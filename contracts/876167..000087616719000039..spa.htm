 STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

THIS STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is entered into as of March
28, 2019, by and among Progress Software Corporation, a Delaware corporation
(the "Buyer"); Ipswitch, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (the "Company"),
and Roger Greene ("Seller").

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the Seller owns all of the issued and outstanding Shares; and

WHEREAS, the parties desire to enter into this Agreement pursuant to which the
Seller agrees to sell to the Buyer and the Buyer agrees to purchase from the
Seller all of the Shares, on and subject to the terms and conditions contained
herein.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth below, and for
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the Buyer, the Company and the Seller agree as
follows:

Article I.

PURCHASE AND SALE

Section 1.01 Purchase and Sale. At the Closing, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth herein, the Buyer shall purchase from the Seller, and
the Seller shall sell, convey, assign, transfer, and deliver to the Buyer, all
of the Shares, free and clear of all Liens (other than restrictions on
transfer imposed under applicable securities Laws).

Section 1.02 Closing; Actions at the Closing.

(a) The Closing shall take place at 10:00 a.m., Eastern time, on the Closing
Date at the offices of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, 60 State
Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02109, unless another date, place or time is
agreed to in writing by the Buyer and the Company. Upon the agreement of the
parties, the Closing may take place remotely, via electronic exchange of
documents.

(b) At the Closing:

(i) the Company and the Seller shall deliver to the Buyer the various
certificates, instruments and documents referred to in Section 7.01;

(ii) the Buyer shall deliver to the Seller the various certificates,
instruments and documents referred to in Section 7.02; and

(iii) the Buyer shall make the payments contemplated by Section 1.03(b). Section 1.03 Closing Payment Certificate; Closing Date Payments.

(a) No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall deliver to the Buyer: (i) the Closing Payment Certificate; (ii)
a pay-off letter in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer
duly executed by each Person to whom any Indebtedness listed on Schedule
1.03(a) is (or at the Closing will be) owed by the Company or any Subsidiary,
which shall include a complete release of the Company and each Subsidiary from
all Liens and Liabilities with respect to such Indebtedness, effective upon
the discharge of such Indebtedness at the Closing; (iii) final invoices
submitted by each Person to whom any Company Transaction Expenses are (or at
the Closing will be) owed representing all Company Transaction Expenses
payable to such Person with respect to the period through the Closing; and
(iv) a certificate of the Secretary of the Company certifying resolutions duly
adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company providing for the termination
and cancellation of all outstanding SAR Awards, Company Options and Phantom
Share Awards in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Stock
Plan, effective immediately prior to the Closing.

(b) On the Closing Date, the Buyer shall make the following payments, in each
case in the respective amounts set forth in the Closing Payment Certificate:

(i) to the Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the
Closing Stock Consideration;

(ii) to the Company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the
portion of the Aggregate Closing Consideration payable to the holders of SAR
Awards, Phantom Share Awards and In-the-Money Company Options pursuant to
Section 1.06;

(iii) to the Escrow Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
the Escrow Amount to be deposited into the Escrow Account;

(iv) to each Person specified in the Closing Payment Certificate as a
recipient of payments in respect of the Closing Indebtedness, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds, the amount payable to such Person as specified
in the Closing Payment Certificate; and

(v) to each Person specified in the Closing Payment Certificate as a recipient
of payments in respect of Company Transaction Expenses, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, the amount payable to such Person as specified in
the Closing Payment Certificate.

Section 1.04 Escrow.

(a) At Closing, the Buyer will (in accordance with Section 1.03(b)(iii))
deliver to the Escrow Agent the Escrow Amount to be held in escrow pursuant to
the Escrow Agreement and to be disbursed in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Account, together with any
interest and earnings thereon, shall be held by the Escrow Agent and released by the Escrow Agent to the Seller or the Buyer, as
applicable, in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

(b) On the first Business Day following the twelve (12) month anniversary of
the Closing Date (such anniversary date the "Escrow Release Date"), if the
amount then remaining in the Escrow Fund exceeds the aggregate amount of all
claims asserted against the Escrow Fund in accordance with Section 1.07 or
Article VIII which have not been resolved pursuant to the terms set out in
Section 1.07 or Article VIII (each a "Pending Claim"), then the Seller and the
Buyer shall deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent directing
the Escrow Agent to pay and distribute such excess (or if there are no Pending
Claims as of the Escrow Release Date, the entire remaining amount in the
Escrow Fund) to the Seller. Thereafter, after final resolution of each Pending
Claim, the Seller and the Buyer shall deliver a joint written instruction to
the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to pay and distribute that
portion, if any, of the Escrow Fund held in respect of such Pending Claim that
is to be paid, in accordance with such resolution, to the Buyer or a Person or
Persons other than the Sellers, and then to pay to the Seller an amount equal
to the remaining Escrow Funds not held in respect of other Pending Claims.

Section 1.05 Exchange Procedures. At or prior to the Closing, the Seller shall
deliver, or the Company shall deliver on the Seller's behalf, to the Buyer the
Certificates evidencing the Shares duly endorsed in blank or with stock powers
duly executed by the Seller. The transfer of the Shares by the Seller to the
Buyer shall be deemed to occur as of the opening of business on the Closing
Date. At Closing and upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Buyer,
the Seller shall receive in exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to the
Closing Stock Consideration, as reflected on the Closing Date Allocation
Schedule attached to the Closing Payment Certificate. Until delivered as
contemplated by this Section 1.05, each Certificate shall be deemed at all
times after the Closing to represent only the right to receive upon such
delivery the applicable Closing Stock Consideration and the applicable portion
of any Future Payments that become payable pursuant to this Agreement. The
Seller shall not be entitled to receive any portion of the Aggregate
Consideration to which he would otherwise be entitled until such Certificates
are properly delivered.

Section 1.06 Company Options, Phantom Share Awards and SAR Awards. Prior to
the Closing Date, the board of directors of the Company shall adopt the
necessary resolutions, and the Company shall take all other actions, necessary
to effect the following (each to be effective immediately prior to and
contingent upon the Closing):

(a) The Company shall use Reasonable Best Efforts to cause the holder of each
SAR Award that is then outstanding to execute and deliver, prior to the
Closing, a Release Agreement pursuant to which such holder shall agree to
release, among other things as set forth in Exhibit B, all claims under the
applicable SAR Award in accordance with Section 9(f) of the applicable SARs
Plan in exchange for the right to receive an amount equal to the amount
payable with respect to such SAR Award pursuant to the applicable SARs Plan
upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
specified in the Closing Date Allocation Schedule, subject to withholding as
provided in Section 1.09; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no amount shall be payable to
any holder of any such SAR Award unless and until such holder shall have
executed and delivered to the Company a Release Agreement.

(b) The Company shall use Reasonable Best Efforts to cause the holder of each
In-the-Money Company Option that is then outstanding (whether such In-the-
Money Company Option is vested or unvested, but not to the extent it has
theretofore been exercised) to execute and deliver, prior to Closing, a
Release Agreement pursuant to which such holder shall agree, among other
things as set forth in Exhibit B, to surrender such In-the-Money Company
Option in exchange for the right to receive an amount equal to (A) such In-
the-Money Company Option's Option Allocation of the Share-Based Consideration
less the aggregate exercise price of such In-the-Money Company Option, plus
(B) such In-the-Money Company Option's Pro Rata Share of the portion of all
Future Payments that become payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
in each case subject to withholding as provided in Section 1.09.

(c) The Company shall use Reasonable Best Efforts to cause the holder of each
Phantom Share Award that is then outstanding to execute and deliver a Release
Agreement pursuant to which such holder shall agree, among other things as set
forth in Exhibit B, to surrender such Phantom Share Award in exchange for the
right to receive an amount equal to (A) the amount payable with respect to
such Phantom Share Award pursuant to the 2015 Phantom Share Plan upon the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as specified
in the Closing Date Allocation Schedule, plus (B) such Phantom Share Award's
Pro Rata Share of the portion of all Future Payments that become payable
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, in each case subject to withholding
as provided in Section 1.09; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, no amount shall be payable to any holder of any such
Phantom Share Award unless and until such holder shall have executed and
delivered to the Company a Release Agreement.

(d) Upon the surrender of any SAR Award, In-the-Money Company Option or
Phantom Share Award pursuant to this Section 1.06, such SAR Award, In-the-
Money Company Option or Phantom Share Award shall no longer represent the
right to acquire any shares of Company Stock or other Equity Interests or
payment derived from the value thereof, but shall entitle the holder thereof
to receive only the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Section 1.06 (and all sections of this Agreement related hereto) as holders of
a SAR Award, Phantom Share Award or In-the-Money Company Options.

(e) The Buyer shall cause the Company to pay as promptly as practicable after
the Closing Date to each holder of a SAR Award, Phantom Share Award or In-the-
Money Company Option the portion of the Aggregate Closing Consideration
payable to such holder of a SAR Award, Phantom Share Award or In-the-Money
Company Option pursuant to this Section 1.06 (subject to any applicable
withholding as provided in Section 1.09) in accordance with the Closing Date
Allocation Schedule. The Buyer shall cause the Company to pay to each holder
of a Phantom Share Award or In-the-Money Company Option any amounts payable
with respect to each Future Payment (subject to any applicable withholding as
provided in Section 1.09) in accordance with the Closing Date Allocation
Schedule. (f) The Company shall cause each Company Option that is not an In-the-Money
Company Option and each Phantom Share Award or SAR Award not receiving
consideration pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
accordance with this Section 1.06 to be terminated and cancelled without
payment of consideration therefor.

Section 1.07 Adjustment Before and After the Closing. The Estimated Closing
Adjustment and the Final Closing Adjustment shall be determined as set forth
below in this Section 1.07:

(a) Not later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall prepare and deliver to the Buyer a statement (the "Estimated
Closing Adjustment Statement") setting forth the Estimated Closing Adjustment,
including an estimated consolidated balance sheet of the Company and the
Subsidiaries as of 11:59 PM Eastern time on the day immediately prior to the
Closing Date, together with all relevant backup materials, in detail
reasonably acceptable to the Buyer. The Estimated Closing Adjustment Statement
and such consolidated balance sheet shall be prepared in accordance with the
Accounting Principles. Schedule 1.07(a) attached hereto reflects the Closing
Adjustment Items to be included in the Estimated Closing Adjustment Statement,
including estimated amounts in respect thereof as of the date of this
Agreement. From the delivery of the Estimated Closing Adjustment Statement
until such time as the calculation of the Estimated Closing Adjustment has
been finally determined pursuant to this Section 1.07(a), the Buyer and its
accountants shall, upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, be
permitted to discuss with the Company and its accountants the Estimated
Closing Adjustment Statement and shall be provided complete and accurate
copies of, and have reasonable access, upon reasonable notice at reasonable
times during normal business hours, to the work papers and supporting records
of the Company and its accountants so as to allow the Buyer and its
accountants to verify the accuracy of the Estimated Closing Adjustment
Statement. If the Buyer objects to the Estimated Closing Adjustment Statement,
the Company and the Buyer will work together in good faith to resolve the
issues in dispute. If all disputed issues are resolved, the amounts as agreed
upon by the Buyer and the Company shall be used to determine the Estimated
Closing Adjustment. If the Buyer and the Company are unable to resolve all
such disputed issues within three (3) Business Days following the Buyer's
receipt of the Estimated Closing Adjustment Statement, the Estimated Closing
Adjustment shall be as determined by the Company and the Escrow Amount shall
be increased by the amount that the Buyer's calculation of the Estimated
Closing Adjustment exceeds the Company's calculation of the Estimated Closing
Adjustment.

(b) Not later than 60 calendar days after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall
deliver to the Seller the Closing Adjustment Statement, including a
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and the Subsidiaries as of as of
11:59 PM Eastern time on the day immediately prior to the Closing Date. The
Closing Adjustment Statement and such consolidated balance sheet shall be
prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles. The Closing Adjustment
Statement delivered pursuant to this Section 1.07(b) shall be accompanied by a
statement setting forth the amount, if any, by which the total of the Closing
Adjustment Items is greater than, or less than, the Estimated Closing
Adjustment. The Closing Adjustment Statement, as proposed by Buyer pursuant to
this Section 1.07(b), shall be deemed for purposes of this Section 1.07 to be
the "Final Closing Adjustment Statement," the Closing Adjustment Items reflected
thereon shall be deemed for purposes of this Section 1.07 to be the "Final
Closing Adjustment Items" and each shall be final and binding on all parties
to this Agreement and on the Seller, unless the Seller timely delivers to the
Buyer an Objection Notice in accordance with Section 1.07(c).

(c) In the event that the Seller disputes the Closing Adjustment Statement or
the amount of the Closing Adjustment Items, the Seller shall notify the Buyer
in writing (the "Objection Notice") of the amount, nature and basis of such
dispute, within 30 calendar days after delivery of the Closing Adjustment
Statement pursuant to Section 1.07(b). Any such Objection Notice shall specify
those items or amounts as to which the Seller disagrees, and the Seller shall
be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the
Closing Adjustment Statement and the amount of the Closing Adjustment Items
delivered pursuant to Section 1.07(b). In the event of such a dispute, the
Buyer and the Seller shall first negotiate in good faith to reach agreement on
the disputed items or amounts in order to determine the amount of the Closing
Adjustment Items, which amount shall not be more than the Buyer's calculation
delivered pursuant to Section 1.07(b) nor less than the Seller's calculation
delivered pursuant to this Section 1.07(c). If the Buyer and the Seller reach
a final resolution on the Closing Adjustment Statement within 30 days after
the Buyer's receipt of the Objection Notice (or within any additional period
as mutually agreed to between the Buyer and the Seller), then the Closing
Adjustment Statement agreed upon by the Buyer and the Seller shall be deemed
for purposes of this Section 1.07 to be the "Final Closing Adjustment
Statement," the Closing Adjustment Items reflected thereon shall be deemed for
purposes of this Section 1.07 to be the "Final Closing Adjustment Items" and
each shall be final and binding on all parties to this Agreement and on the
Seller.

(d) If the Buyer and the Seller are unable to resolve the dispute within 30
calendar days after delivery of the Objection Notice, then any remaining items
in dispute shall be submitted to an independent nationally recognized
accounting firm selected in writing by the Seller and the Buyer or, if the
Seller and the Buyer fail or refuse to select a firm within 10 calendar days
after written request therefor by the Seller or the Buyer, such an independent
nationally recognized accounting firm shall be selected in accordance with the
rules of the Boston, Massachusetts office of the American Arbitration
Association (the "Neutral Accountant"). All determinations and calculations
pursuant to this Section 1.07(d) shall consider only those Closing Adjustment
Items that are set forth in the Objection Notice and remain in dispute, shall
be a value that is not greater than the greatest value for any such item or
less than the lowest value for any such item claimed by Buyer, on the one
hand, or Seller, on the other hand, shall be in writing and shall be delivered
to the Buyer and the Seller as promptly as practicable. Absent fraud or
manifest error, the Closing Adjustment Statement as finally determined by the
Neutral Accountant shall be deemed for purposes of this Section 1.07 to be the
"Final Closing Adjustment Statement," the Closing Adjustment Items reflected
thereon shall be deemed for purposes of this Section 1.07 to be the "Final
Closing Adjustment Items" and each shall be final and binding on all parties
to this Agreement. In determining the Closing Adjustment Statement and the
Closing Adjustment Items, the Neutral Accountant shall act as an expert and
not as arbitrator. A judgment on the determination made by the Neutral
Accountant pursuant to this Section 1.07 may be entered in and enforced by any court
having jurisdiction thereover.

(e) The fees and expenses of the Neutral Accountant in connection with the
resolution of disputes pursuant to Section 1.07(d) shall be borne by the
Seller, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand, in proportion to
the amounts by which the proposals of the Buyer and the Seller differed from
the Neutral Accountant's final determination.

(f) The "Final Closing Adjustment" shall be equal to (i) the amount of the
Final Closing Adjustment Items, minus (ii) the Estimated Closing Adjustment.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Final Closing Adjustment may be a positive or
negative number. If the Final Closing Adjustment is greater than zero (0),
then the Buyer shall be entitled to receive payment of the Final Closing
Adjustment from the Seller promptly (and in no event later than two (2)
Business Days) after the date of determination of the Final Closing
Adjustment; provided that the Buyer shall have the right to have any such
payment satisfied via a disbursement from any then available Escrow Fund and,
if the Buyer elects to have such payment satisfied via a disbursement from the
Escrow Fund, the Seller and the Buyer shall deliver a joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to pay and
distribute such amount to the Buyer. If the Final Closing Adjustment is less
than zero (0), then promptly (and in no event later than two (2) Business
Days) after the date of determination of the Final Closing Adjustment: (1) a
portion of the absolute value thereof equal to 90% of the Pro Rata Share that
is represented by each Share shall be paid by the Buyer to the Seller, (2) a
portion of the absolute value thereof equal to 100% of the Pro Rata Share that
is represented by each In-the-Money Company Option and each Phantom Share
Award shall be paid by the Buyer to the Company for payment to the holder
thereof (subject to any applicable withholding as provided in Section 1.09)
and (3) the absolute value of the remainder of the Final Closing Adjustment
shall be deposited with the Escrow Agent to be held in escrow pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement. The percentage of the Final Closing Adjustment, if any, to
be distributed to the Seller and each holder of a Phantom Share Award or In-
the-Money Company Option is set forth opposite such Seller's and Derivative
Holder's name on the Preliminary Closing Date Allocation Schedule.

(g) From the delivery of the Closing Adjustment Statement until such time as
the calculation of the Final Closing Adjustment has been finally determined
pursuant to this Section 1.07, the Seller and his Representatives (at the
Seller's expense) shall, upon reasonable notice and during normal business
hours, be permitted to discuss with the Buyer, the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and their accountants the Closing Adjustment Statement and shall
be provided complete and accurate copies of, and have reasonable access, upon
reasonable notice at reasonable times during normal business hours, to the
work papers and supporting records of the Buyer, the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their accountants so as to allow the Seller and its
Representatives to verify the accuracy of the Closing Adjustment Statement.

(h) The parties agree that the procedures set forth in this Section 1.07 shall
be the sole and exclusive method for resolving any disputes with respect to
the determination of the Final Closing Adjustment Statement, the Final Closing
Adjustment Items and the Final Closing Adjustment; provided, that this
provision shall not prohibit the Buyer or the Seller from instituting litigation to enforce the determination of the Neutral Accountant
and shall not limit any remedy of any party under Article VIII.

Section 1.08 Allocation Schedules; Payments of Future Payments.

(a) The Preliminary Closing Date Allocation Schedule sets forth a true,
correct and complete summary of the allocation (estimated as of the date
hereof) of the amounts payable to the Seller and each holder of a SAR Award,
Phantom Share Award or In-the-Money Company Option pursuant to this Agreement.
The Company shall deliver to the Buyer, at least three (3) Business Days prior
to the Closing, the Closing Date Allocation Schedule (attached as an exhibit
to the Closing Payment Certificate), which may contain updates or corrections
to the information in the Preliminary Closing Date Allocation Schedule, solely

agreement of the Buyer, update, correct or otherwise amend or modify the
Closing Date Allocation Schedule in any manner that is consistent with the
express provisions of this Article I. The Buyer shall be entitled to rely
conclusively on the Closing Date Allocation Schedule as in effect from time to
time, and, as between the Seller and the holders of SAR Awards, Phantom Share
Awards or In-the-Money Company Options, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the
other hand, any amounts delivered by the Buyer to the Seller or the holders of
SAR Awards, Phantom Share Awards or In-the-Money Company Options in accordance
with the Closing Date Allocation Schedule in effect from time to time shall be
deemed for all purposes to have been delivered to the Seller or the applicable
holder of a SAR Award, Phantom Share Award or In-the-Money Company Option in

accordance with the Closing Date Allocation Schedule.

(d) The parties understand and agree that (i) the Seller has no rights as a
security holder of the Buyer as a result of his right to receive the Future
Payments, (ii) without limiting the generality of Section 13.04, no right to
receive any Future Payment may be assigned or otherwise transferred without
the prior written consent of the Buyer and any purported assignment or
transfer in the absence of such consent shall be null and void ab initio, and
(iii) no interest is payable as additional consideration with respect to any
of the Future Payments. (e) Any Future Payments made to any party pursuant to this Section 1.08 shall
(i) constitute an adjustment of the Aggregate Consideration for Tax purposes
and (ii) be treated as such by parties hereto on their Tax Returns, in each
case to the greatest extent permitted by Law.

Section 1.09 Withholding Rights. The Buyer, the Company and the Escrow Agent
will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts otherwise payable by
it pursuant to this Agreement to any Person, including payments made under the
Escrow Agreement, such amounts as it reasonably determines that it is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law, and to collect any
necessary Tax forms, including Forms W-8 or W-9, as applicable, or any similar
information, from Seller and any other recipients of payments hereunder.
Before making any such deduction or withholding with respect to a payment to
Seller for his Shares, provided that Seller has complied with his obligation
under Section 6.06, the Buyer shall employ commercially reasonable efforts to
provide the Seller with at least ten (10) days advance written notice of the
intention to make such deduction or withholding, which notice shall include
the authority, basis and method of calculation for the proposed deduction or
withholding, and the Buyer will cooperate, at the Seller's expense, with any
reasonable request from Seller to obtain reduction of such withholding or
relief therefrom. In the event that any amount is so deducted and withheld,
and properly remitted, such amount will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom the payment from which
such amount was withheld was made.

Section 1.10 Further Assurances. From and after the Closing, the parties will
use their Reasonable Best Efforts take such further action (including the
execution and delivery of such further instruments and documents) as may be
reasonably necessary to carry out the intent of this Agreement.

payable.

(h) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary (i) is a stockholder of a
"controlled foreign corporation" (other than the Subsidiaries of the Company)
as defined in Section 957 of the Code (or any similar provision of state,
local or foreign Law), or (ii) is a stockholder in a "passive foreign
investment company" as defined in Section 1297 of the Code.

(i) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to
include any item of income in, or exclude any item of deduction from, Taxable
income for any period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a
result of an election under Section 965(h) of the Code. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has requested or received a ruling from any
Governmental Entity or signed any written agreement with any Governmental
Entity that could reasonably be expected to impact the amount of Tax due from
Company or its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date. (j) To the Company's Knowledge, all related party transactions involving the
Company or any Subsidiary have been conducted at arm's length in compliance
with Section 482 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder and any comparable provisions of any other Tax Law.

(k) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has engaged in a "reportable
transaction" as set forth in Treasury Regulation section 1.6011-4(b) or a
"listed transaction" as set forth in Treasury Regulation section
301.6111-2(b)(2) or any analogous provision of state or local Law. Each of the
Company and the Subsidiaries has disclosed on its federal income Tax Returns
all positions taken therein that could give rise to a substantial
understatement of federal income Tax within the meaning of Section 6662 of the
Code.

(l) At all times since its incorporation, for federal income tax purposes, the
Company has validly been treated as an "S corporation" within the meaning of
Section 1361(a) of the Code and has validly been treated in a similar manner
for purposes of the income tax Laws of all states which recognize or give
effect to such status (whether or not a separate election is required) and in
which it has been subject to taxation. At all times since inception, for
federal income tax purposes, each U.S. Subsidiary of the Company has validly
been treated as a "qualified subchapter S subsidiary" within the meaning of
Section 1361(b)(3) of the Code and has validly been treated in a similar
manner for purposes of the income tax Laws of all states in which it has been
subject to taxation. The Seller is eligible to make a Section 338(h)(10)
Election with respect to the purchase and sale of the Shares. Neither the
Company nor the Subsidiaries has any potential Liability for any Tax under
Section 1374 of the Code (or comparable provisions of state Law) in connection
with the sale or deemed sale of the assets of the Company and the U.S.
Subsidiaries. None of the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries has ever (A)
acquired assets from another corporation in a transaction in which the
Company's or such Subsidiary's tax basis for the acquired assets was
determined, in whole or part, by reference to the tax basis of the acquired
assets (or any other property) in the hands of the transferor or (B) acquired
the stock of any corporation which is or has been a qualified subchapter S
subsidiary.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
representations and warranties in Section 3.06, this Section 3.09 and Section
3.16 shall be the only representations or warranties of the Company in this
Agreement with respect to Tax matters. The representations in this Section
3.09 (other than Section 3.09(c), Section 3.09(i), Section 3.09(l)) may only
be relied upon for purposes of liability for Taxable periods (or portions
thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date.

lawful owner of, and has good title to, all of the assets (tangible or
intangible) purported to be owned by the Company or such Subsidiary, free and
clear of all Liens. The Company and each Subsidiary owns or leases all
tangible assets sufficient for the conduct of its businesses as presently
conducted and as presently proposed to be conducted, which tangible assets are

other than pursuant to a Lease. With respect to each Lease:

effect against the Company or the Subsidiary that is a party thereto, as
applicable, and, to the Company's Knowledge, against each other party thereto;

(ii) such Lease will continue to be legal, valid, binding, enforceable and in

thereof as in effect immediately prior to the Closing;

(iii) none of the Company, any Subsidiary or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
any other party, is, in any material respect, in breach or violation of, or
default under, any such Lease, and no event has occurred, is occurring, or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, is threatened, which, after the giving of
notice, with lapse of time, or otherwise, would constitute any such breach or
default by the Company or any Subsidiary or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
any other party under such Lease; and no event has occurred that would give
rise to a termination right under such Lease;

(iv) there are no disputes, oral agreements or forbearance programs in effect
as to such Lease;

(v) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has assigned, transferred,
conveyed, mortgaged, subleased, licensed, granted occupancy rights with
respect to, deeded in trust or encumbered any interest in the leasehold or
subleasehold; and

(vi) to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no Liens, easements, covenants
or other restrictions applicable to the real property subject to such Lease
which would reasonably be expected to impair the current uses or the occupancy
by the Company or any Subsidiary of the property subject thereto.

of candor and disclosure to the United States Patent and Trademark Office and
any relevant foreign patent office with respect to all patent and trademark
applications filed by or on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary and have
made no material misrepresentation in such applications. The Company has no
Knowledge of any information for which there would be a reasonable basis to
preclude the Company or any Subsidiary from having clear title to the Company
Registrations or affecting the patentability, validity or enforceability of
any Company Registrations.

(c) Each item of Company Intellectual Property will be owned or available for
use by the Buyer or a subsidiary of the Buyer following the Closing on the
same terms and conditions as it was immediately prior to the Closing. The

Property constitutes all the material Intellectual Property necessary to (i)
Exploit the Customer Offerings in the manner so done currently and, to the
Company's Knowledge, currently contemplated to be done in the future by the
Company and the Subsidiaries and (ii) otherwise conduct the business of the
Company and the Subsidiaries in the manner currently conducted and, to the
Company's Knowledge, as currently contemplated to be done in the future by the

Intellectual Property rights of any Person, which is exclusively the subject
matter of Section 3.12(e).

(d) The Company or the appropriate Subsidiary, as applicable, has taken
reasonable measures to protect the proprietary nature of each item of Company

or the Subsidiaries or by any authorized Exploitation thereof by any
manufacturer, reseller, distributor, customer or user thereof, infringes or
violates, or constitutes a misappropriation of, or in the past has infringed
or violated, or constituted a misappropriation of, any Intellectual Property
rights of any third party. Section 3.12(e) of the Disclosure Schedule lists
any written complaint, claim or notice, or threat of any of the foregoing
(including any written notification that a license under any patent is or may
be required by, or is available for license to, the Company), received by the
Company or any Subsidiary alleging any such infringement, violation or misappropriation and any written request or demand for indemnification or
defense received by the Company or any Subsidiary from any manufacturer,

pursuant to the rules of which it is obligated to license any existing or
future Intellectual Property to any Person.

Subsidiary to) afford the officers, attorneys, accountants, tax advisors,
lenders and other authorized representatives of the Buyer reasonable access
upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours to all personnel,
offices, properties and Books and Records of the Acquired Companies and,
during such period, the Company will and will cause its Subsidiaries to permit

periods covered thereby, and shall be consistent with the books and records of
the Company and the Subsidiaries.

submissions pursuant thereto that may be necessary, proper or advisable;
provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Buyer shall not be obligated (A) to commence or defend any
Legal Proceeding required to obtain any such waiver, permit, consent, approval
or other authorization; (B) to sell or dispose of or hold separately (through
a trust or otherwise) any assets or businesses of the Company, the Buyer or

would limit the freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain
any of the businesses, product lines, or assets of the Company, the Buyer, or
any of their respective Affiliates; or (D) to make proposals, execute or carry
out agreements, enter into consent decrees or submit to orders providing for

by the party delivering such notice of any representation, warranty or
covenant of the party delivering such notice set forth herein, any material
misstatement in or omission by the party delivering such notice from the
Disclosure Schedule or the non-satisfaction of any condition set forth in
Section 7.01, in the case of a notice by the Company and the Seller, or
Section 7.02, in the case of a notice by the Buyer. No such notice shall be

Buyer certifications that he is not a foreign person in accordance with the

more defined contribution plans that include a qualified cash or deferred
arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (and a related
trust exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code) (the "Buyer 401(k)
Plan"), then, upon the Buyer's written request at least five (5) calendar days
prior to Closing, the Company shall terminate the Qualified Plan prospectively effective not later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date. The
Buyer shall cause each Continuing Employee (as defined below) participating in
the Qualified Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date to be eligible to
become a participant in the corresponding Buyer 401(k) Plan as of the Closing
Date. The Company shall provide the form of resolutions for the foregoing to
the Buyer for its review and approval (such approval not unreasonably withheld
other than with respect to any actions to be taken post-Closing that are not
mandated by applicable Law) not less than two (2) business days preceding the
Closing Date and shall adopt the resolutions no later than the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date.

(b) To the extent the Company terminates the Qualified Plan in accordance with
Section 6.07(a), Buyer agrees to cause the Buyer 401(k) Plan to allow each
Continuing Employee (as defined below) to make a "direct rollover" to the
Buyer 401(k) Plan of the account balances of such Continuing Employee
(including promissory notes evidencing any outstanding loans) under the
Qualified Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated prior to the
Closing if such direct rollover is elected in accordance with applicable Law
by such Continuing Employee. The rollovers described herein shall comply with
applicable Law, and each party shall make all filings and take any actions
required of such party under applicable Law in connection therewith.

that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the base salary or wages
and cash incentive opportunities that Buyer provides to its similarly situated
employees during such period and (ii) the Company Employees with employee
benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those benefits
that Buyer provides to its similarly situated employees during such period.

(b) To the extent permitted under the terms of the Buyer's employee benefits
plans, from and after the Closing, the Buyer will recognize the prior service
with the Company or the Subsidiaries of each individual who is a Continuing
Employee in connection with all employee benefit plans of the Buyer in which
Continuing Employees are eligible to participate following the Closing, for
purposes of eligibility and vesting and, solely for purposes of severance,
level of benefits (but not for purposes of benefit accruals or benefit amounts
(other than with respect to severance) or to the extent that such recognition
would result in duplication of benefits). To the extent permitted under the
terms of the Buyer's employee benefits plans, from and after the Closing, the
Buyer will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any pre-existing
conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting periods (to the extent that
such waiting periods would be applicable, taking into account service with the
Company) under any group health, dental, or vision benefit plans of the Buyer
to be waived with respect to Continuing Employees and their eligible
dependents, except to the extent such individual was or would have been
subject to such exclusion under the Company Plans immediately before the
Closing Date. (c) The Company shall provide Buyer with a list of all Company Employees at a
U.S. facility with sufficient numbers of employees to be covered by the WARN

the 90 day period ending on the Closing Date.

(d) Section 6.08 is included for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and
their respective transferees and permitted assigns and does not and shall not
create any right in any Person, including any Company Employee, any
participant in any Company Plan or any beneficiary or trustee thereof. Section
6.08(a) and (b) shall not apply to any Company Employees outside the United
States or covered by any collective bargaining agreement or other employee
representation agreement and Buyer agrees to (and will cause its Subsidiaries
to) comply with all terms and conditions of employment for the non-U.S.
employees or provided under any collective bargaining agreement or other
employee representative agreement and with applicable Law. Nothing contained
in this Agreement (express or implied) (i) is intended to require Buyer to
establish or maintain any specific Employee Benefit Plan for any length of
time, (ii) is intended to create a Company Plan or any Employee Benefit Plan
or amend any of the foregoing, (iii) is intended to confer upon any individual
any right to employment or continued employment for any period of time, or any

construed to indicate existence of employment relations between Company and
any of its service providers (including contractors and consultants).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties do not
intend for this Section 6.08 to create any rights or obligations except
between the parties hereto. No Company Employee, including any beneficiary or
dependent thereof, or any other Person not a party to this Agreement, shall be
entitled to assert any claim against the Buyer or Seller, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates under this Section 6.08.

Section 6.09 Certain Financial Statements.

(a) Prior to Closing, the Company shall deliver to the Buyer historical
consolidated financial statements for the Company and the Subsidiaries for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and, if applicable, for the relevant
quarterly periods of 2019, in a form that complies with the requirements of

business acquisition required to be described in answer to Item 2.01 of Form
8-K, including information required in order for the Buyer to prepare the pro
forma financial information required by Item 9.01 of Form 8-K. The financial
statements for the Company for fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 shall be
accompanied by an unqualified report from the Company's independent accounting
firm stating that such financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position, as well as the consolidated
results of operations and cash flows, of the Company and the Subsidiaries for
the periods covered by the such financial statements, in conformity with GAAP.

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide the Buyer with such
additional information, including reliance letters from the Company's
independent accounting firm, as the Buyer may reasonably request in order to
comply with the requirements for financial statements included in Annual Reports on Form 10-K or Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q
filed under the Exchange Act, as applicable.

Section 6.10 Section 280G. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
date hereof, the Company shall make available to Buyer the information (other
than information related to plans, policies, agreements and arrangements which
are sponsored or maintained by Buyer or any of its Affiliates or to which
Buyer or any of its Affiliates are a party or otherwise bound ("Buyer
Arrangements")) necessary to accurately calculate any excise tax due under
Section 4999 of the Code as a result of any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement for a "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code) ("Excise Taxes") and the amount of deductions that
may be disallowed for the Company under Section 280G of the Code ("Deduction
Losses") in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Buyer shall reasonably cooperate in providing information to
the Company necessary to calculate the Excise Taxes and Deduction Losses. The
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek waivers from any
"disqualified individuals," pursuant to which such individuals will waive any
and all payments (or other benefits) contingent on the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (within the meaning of Section
280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code) to the extent necessary so that no payment
received by such "disqualified individual" shall be a "parachute payment"
under Section 280G(b) of the Code (determined without regard to Section
280G(b)(4) of the Code) ("Waived Payments") unless and until shareholder
approval of the Waived Payments is received in accordance with Section 280G of
the Code. To the extent such waivers are obtained, the Company shall, not less
than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, submit to a
stockholder vote, in a manner that satisfies the stockholder approval
requirements under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder, the right of any "disqualified individual"
(as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) to receive the Waived Payments.
Such vote shall establish the disqualified individual's right to the Waived
Payments if approved by the Seller. In addition, the Company shall provide
adequate disclosure to the Seller of all material facts concerning all Waived
Payments for any such disqualified individual that, but for such vote, could
be deemed "parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Code in a manner that
satisfies Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Code and regulations promulgated
thereunder. At least three (3) Business Days prior to the vote, the Buyer and
its counsel shall be given the right to review and comment on all documents
required to be delivered to the Seller in connection with such vote and any
disqualified individual waivers, and the Company shall reflect all comments of
the Buyer or its counsel thereon. Buyer and its counsel shall be provided
copies of all documents executed by the stockholders and disqualified
individuals in connection with the vote.

being a member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined, unitary or similar
group on or prior to the Closing Date; (iii) any Taxes for which the Company
or any Subsidiary has any Liability as a transferee or successor, pursuant to

Law, (B) any Tax imposed under Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 of the Treasury

(f) the Employee Amount, any Closing Indebtedness and any Company Transaction
Expenses, in each case to the extent in excess of the amounts included in the
calculation of the Aggregate Closing Consideration or the Final Closing
Adjustment; (g) any failure of the Seller to have good, valid and marketable title to the

Section 8.02 Indemnification Claims.

(a) After receiving notice of a claim as to which indemnity may be sought
pursuant to this Article VIII with respect to any action, lawsuit, proceeding,
investigation or other claim brought against it by a Person who is not a party
(a "Third Party Claim"), the Buyer will notify the Seller of such claim as
promptly as reasonably practicable. Each such notice will be in writing and
will describe with reasonable specificity, to the extent then known by the
Buyer, the nature of such claim and will indicate the estimated amount, to the
extent then known Buyer and if reasonably practicable, of the Damages that
have been or may be sustained by the Buyer Indemnified Parties, based on the
facts known to the Buyer as of such date. Thereafter, the Buyer will deliver
to the Seller, reasonably promptly after the Buyer's receipt thereof, copies
of all notices and court papers received by the Buyer relating to the Third
Party Claim. The Buyer's failure or delay in providing the notices and court
papers described in this paragraph (a) will not relieve the Seller of its
obligations under this Article VIII, except to the extent that the Seller is
materially prejudiced as a result thereof.

(b) The Seller will have the right to participate in the defense of such Third
Party Claim at the Seller's expense, or at its option (subject to the
limitations set forth in this Section 8.03(b)) to assume the defense thereof
with counsel selected by the Seller; provided, however, that:

(i) The Seller may only assume control of such defense if the Seller
acknowledges in writing to the Buyer that any damages, fines, costs or other
Liabilities that may be assessed against the Buyer in connection with such Third Party
Claim constitute Damages for which the Seller shall fully indemnify the Buyer
pursuant to this Article VIII;

(ii) The Seller must give the Buyer written notice of its election to assume
control of the defense of the Third Party Claim as promptly as possible (but
in any case within twenty (20) days of the Seller's receipt of notice of the
Third Party Claim, or sooner, if the nature of the Third Party Claim so
requires). If the Seller assumes the defense of the Third Party Claim, the
Seller will engage legal counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer to
defend such claim, with the parties agreeing that Latham and Watkins LLP is
reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer, and will not admit any liability with
respect to, permit a default or consent to the entry of any judgment, or
settle, compromise or discharge, any Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Buyer (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed);

(iii) If Seller is entitled to and assumes the defense of the Third Party
Claim pursuant to this Section, the Buyer will be entitled to participate in
the defense of the Third Party Claim at its own cost and expense; provided,
however, that the Buyer will be entitled to participate in any such defense
with separate counsel at the expense of the Seller if (A) so requested by the
Seller, (B) in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Buyer made in good
faith, there are legal defenses available to the Buyer that are different from
or additional to those available to the Seller, or (C) in the reasonable
opinion of counsel to the Buyer made in good faith, a conflict of interest
exists between the Seller and the Buyer that would make such separate
representation advisable;

(iv) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 8.02 to the contrary, the Buyer
will have the right to conduct and control, through counsel of its choosing
the defense, compromise and settlement of any Third Party Claim that (A) seeks
an injunction or other equitable relief (except where non-monetary relief is
both immaterial and incidental to a primary claim or claims for monetary
damages) against the Buyer or any of its subsidiaries (including the Acquired
Companies), (B) involves the Seller and in the reasonable opinion of counsel
to the Buyer made in good faith a conflict of interest exists between the
Seller and the Buyer that would make the assumption of the defense by Buyer
advisable, (C) involves a claim made by a Governmental Entity or criminal
charges, (D) involves material Intellectual Property rights of any Acquired
Company, (E) has had or, in the event of an adverse resolution, would
reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the Acquired
Companies' business, taken as a whole, including without limitation its
relationships with its suppliers, vendors, licensors, and customers, (F)
asserts or would reasonably be expected to result in Damages that, without
duplication, together with the estimated costs of defense thereof and the
Claimed Amount with respect to any unresolved claims for indemnification then
pending, would exceed the amount for which Seller is liable for
indemnification under this Article VIII, or (G) is not being competently
defended by Seller (and such failure to competently defend such Third Party
Claim has not been cured within a reasonable period of time after written
notice of the same from Buyer). Except as provided in Section 8.02(e)in the
event that the Buyer will have validly assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Buyer will not admit any liability with respect to, permit a default or
consent to the entry of any judgment, or settle, compromise or discharge, any
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Seller (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); and

(v) Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 8.02 to the contrary, any
Tax matter will be subject to the applicable provisions of Article IX.

(c) The party controlling the defense of such Third Party Claim will keep the
other party reasonably advised of the status of such Third Party Claim and the
defense thereof and shall consider in good faith recommendations made by the
other party with respect thereto. The Non-controlling Party will furnish the
Controlling Party with such information as it may reasonably request with
respect to such Third Party Claim (including copies of any summons, complaint
or other pleading which may have been served on such party and any written
claim, demand, invoice, billing or other document evidencing or asserting the
same) and will otherwise reasonably cooperate with and assist the Controlling
Party in the defense of such Third Party Claim.

(d) In order to seek indemnification under this Article VIII (including for
any claim that does not result from a Third Party Claim), the Buyer shall
deliver a Claim Notice to the Seller. Within 30 days after delivery of a Claim
Notice, the Seller shall deliver to the Buyer a written response, in which
Seller shall: (i) agree that the Buyer is entitled to receive all of the
Claimed Amount, in which case the response shall be accompanied by a letter
from the Seller instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse to the Buyer from the
Escrow Fund an amount in cash equal to the Claimed Amount, (ii) agree that the
Buyer is entitled to receive the Agreed Amount (in which case the response
shall be accompanied by a letter from the Seller instructing the Escrow Agent
to disburse to the Buyer from the Escrow Fund an amount in cash equal to the
Agreed Amount) or (iii) dispute that the Buyer is entitled to receive any of
the Claimed Amount. If no response is delivered by the Seller within such
30-day period, the Seller shall be deemed to have agreed that all of the
Claimed Amount is owed to the Buyer. Acceptance by the Buyer of partial
payment of any Claimed Amount shall be without prejudice to the Buyer's right
to claim the balance of any such Claimed Amount.

(e) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 8.02, if a third
party asserts (other than by means of a lawsuit) that any Buyer Indemnified
Party is liable to such third party for a monetary or other obligation which
may constitute or result in Damages for which a Buyer Indemnified Party may be
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII, and the Buyer
reasonably determines that it has a valid business reason that is material to
the Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including the Acquired Companies) to fulfill
such obligation, then (i) the Buyer shall be entitled to satisfy such
obligation, using reasonable efforts to provide prior notice to, but without
consent from, the Seller prior to satisfying such obligation, (ii) the Buyer
may subsequently make a claim for indemnification in accordance with the
provisions of this Article VIII, and (iii) the Buyer shall be reimbursed, in
accordance with the provisions of this Article VIII, for any such Damages for
which it is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII (subject to the right of the Seller to dispute the applicable Buyer
Indemnified Party's entitlement to indemnification, or the amount for which it
is entitled to indemnification, under the terms of this Article VIII).

(f) The amount of indemnification to which the Buyer will be entitled pursuant
to this Section 8.02 will be determined (i) by the written agreement of the
Buyer and Seller, (ii) by a final judgment or decree of any court of competent
jurisdiction, subject to Section 13.10, (iii) in accordance with Section
8.02(d) or (iv) by any other means to which the Parties will agree in writing.
The judgment or decree of a court will be deemed final when the time for
appeal, if any, will have expired and no appeal will have been taken or when
all appeals taken will have been finally determined. In the event of any
dispute regarding the Buyer's right to indemnification from the Escrow Fund,
the Seller and the Buyer shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, promptly following
the resolution of the dispute (whether by mutual agreement, judicial decision
or otherwise), a written notice executed by both parties instructing the
Escrow Agent as to what (if any) portion of the Escrow Fund shall be
distributed to the Buyer (which notice shall be consistent with the terms of
the resolution of the dispute).

Section 8.03 Survival of Representations and Warranties.

(a) Unless otherwise specified in this Section 8.03 or elsewhere in this
Agreement, all provisions of this Agreement shall survive the Closing and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with their terms, or if no term is
specified, until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations;
provided, however, that, except with respect to claims based on fraud or
intentional misrepresentation, all representations and warranties shall expire
on the date 12 months following the Closing Date; provided further, however,
that (i) the representations and warranties set forth in Section 2.01(a),
Section 2.02, Section 2.04, Section 3.01, Section 3.02, Section 3.03, Section
3.04(a), Section 3.04(b)(i), Section 3.09, Section 3.16 (solely to the extent
related to Tax), Section 3.25, Section 3.27, Section 4.01 and Section
4.02(b)(i) shall survive until the date that is 60 days after the expiration
of the longest statute of limitations applicable to the subject matter of the
applicable representation or warranty, (ii) the representations and warranties
set forth in Section 3.12 shall survive until the date three (3) years
following the Closing Date (collectively, with the representations and
warranties described in the foregoing clauses (i), the "Fundamental
Representations"), and (iii) covenants that require performance at or prior to
Closing shall survive for 12 months following the Closing Date.

(b) If the Buyer delivers to the Seller before expiration of the applicable
survival period referred to in Section 8.03(a), a notice of a claim for
indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII, then the applicable
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall survive until, but only
for purposes of, the resolution of the matter covered by such notice. If the
legal proceeding or written claim with respect to which a Claim Notice has
been given is definitively withdrawn or resolved in favor of the Buyer, the
Buyer shall promptly so notify the Seller.

Section 8.04 Limitations. (a) With respect to claims for Damages arising under Section 8.01(a) or
Section 8.01(b), the Seller shall not be liable for any such Damages until the
aggregate amount of all such Damages exceeds $1,500,000 (at which point the
Seller shall become liable for all Damages under Section 8.01(b) only to the
extent they exceed $1,500,000); provided that the limitation set forth in this
sentence shall not apply to (i) claims based on fraud or intentional
misrepresentation or (ii) any claim pursuant to Section 8.01(a) or Section
8.01(b) relating to a breach of any of the Fundamental Representations;
provided further that the Seller shall not be liable for any individual claim
(or series of related claims) for Damages arising under Section 8.01(a) or
Section 8.01(b) for a breach of any Fundamental Representation that is
qualified by reference to materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect
unless it is (or they are) for an amount in excess of $25,000 (at which point
the Sellers shall become liable for all Damages from the first dollar).

(b) Except for claims based on fraud or intentional misrepresentation and
claims for breaches of Fundamental Representations, the Escrow Agreement,
together with the Buyer's rights of set off under Section 8.04(g), shall be
the exclusive means for the Buyer to collect any Damages for which it is
entitled to indemnification under Sections 8.01(a) and 8.01(b) from the
Seller. The Buyer shall not attempt to collect any Damages for any claims
pursuant to this Article VIII directly from the Seller, including by
exercising its rights of set off under Section 8.04(g), unless there are
insufficient unclaimed Escrow Funds remaining to satisfy such Damages pursuant
to the Escrow Agreement.

(c) Except for claims based on fraud and claims with respect to Article X, the
aggregate Liability of the Seller for Damages under this Article VIII shall
not exceed the Aggregate Consideration; provided that aggregate Liability of
the Seller for Damages under Section 8.01(b) with respect to the breach of the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.12 shall not exceed
$45,000,000.

(d) The Seller shall not have any right of contribution against the Company
with respect to any breach by the Company of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements.

(e) The rights to indemnification set forth in this Article VIII shall not be
affected by (i) any investigation conducted by or on behalf of any Buyer
Indemnified Party or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) by
any Buyer Indemnified Party, whether before or after the date of this
Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the inaccuracy or noncompliance
with any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation which is the subject
of indemnification hereunder, or (ii) any waiver by the Buyer of any closing
condition relating to the accuracy of representations and warranties or the
performance of or compliance with agreements and covenants.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, for purposes
of determining (i) whether there has been a breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty set forth in Article II, Article III or the Company
Certificate and (ii) the amount of Damages for which any Buyer Indemnified
Party may be entitled to indemnification under this Article VIII, each such
representation or warranty (other than the representations and warranties set
forth in clause (a) of Section 3.06 and in Section 3.28) shall be deemed to
have been made without any qualifications or limitations as to materiality (including any
qualifications or limitations made by reference to a Company Material Adverse
Effect).

(g) The Buyer shall have the right, but not the obligation, to set off, in
whole or in part, against any obligation or payment it owes to any Seller,
amounts owed or claimed in good faith to be owed by such Seller to any Buyer
Indemnified Party pursuant to this Agreement or any other agreement delivered
in connection herewith.

(h) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, when
calculating the amount of any Damages incurred or suffered by a Buyer
Indemnified Party there will be deducted an amount equal to the amount of any
insurance proceeds, indemnification payments, contribution payments or
reimbursements actually recovered (net of costs of collection and any
resulting premium increases) in the year in which the Damage in question
occurred or the immediately following calendar year by Buyer or any of its
subsidiaries with respect to such Damages.

(i) If and solely to the extent required by applicable Law, the Buyer shall
use such efforts as required by applicable Law to mitigate Damages in
connection with any claim for indemnification under this Article VIII.

(j) Except with respect to claims based on fraud or intentional
misrepresentation and claims with respect to Article IX or for specific
performance and except as set forth in Section 1.07, after the Closing, the
rights of the Buyer under this Article VIII shall be the exclusive remedy of
the Buyer with respect to claims resulting from or relating to any
misrepresentation, breach of warranty or failure to perform any covenant or
agreement of the Company or the Seller contained in this Agreement.

(k) Any payments made to a party pursuant to this Article VIII or pursuant to
the Escrow Agreement shall (i) be treated as an adjustment to the Aggregate
Consideration for Tax purposes and (ii) shall be reported as such by the
parties hereto on their Tax Returns, in each case to the greatest extent
permitted by Law.

Article IX.

Tax Law. The Buyer shall be responsible for filing the Form 8023. The Company
and the Seller will provide the Buyer with any information regarding the
Company as is reasonably necessary for the Buyer to complete Internal Revenue
Service Form 8883 and any supplements thereto ("Form 8883"). The Buyer shall

(a) The Seller, at his expense, shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax
Returns for any Income Taxes of the Company and the Subsidiaries for all
Taxable periods that end on or before the Closing Date. Any such Tax Return
shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the past practices of the Company
and the Subsidiaries, except as otherwise required by Law. The Seller shall
provide Buyer with a copy of each such Tax Return for review and comment at
least thirty (30) Business Days prior to the due date (taking into account any
extension) of such Tax Return and shall consider in good faith any changes
thereto reasonably requested by the Buyer that the Buyer submits to the Seller
no less than five (5) Business Days prior to the due date of such Tax Returns.
The Seller shall pay to the Buyer all Taxes, if any, imposed on the Company in
respect of each such Tax Return at least five (5) days prior to the due date
for such Taxes, except to the extent such Taxes were taken into account in
determining Closing Net Working Capital. The Buyer shall file or cause to be
filed each such Tax Return and remit the Taxes due to the appropriate
Governmental Entity.

(b) Except as provided in Section 9.02(a), the Buyer shall prepare or cause to
be prepared and file all Tax Returns of the Company and the Subsidiaries with
respect to Taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and required
to be filed (taking into account any extensions) after the Closing Date. The
Buyer shall deliver a draft of all such Tax Returns to the Seller for review
and comment in such period of time prior to filing as the Buyer shall
reasonably determine to be practicable and incorporate any changes thereto
reasonably requested by the Seller in writing and received by the Buyer prior
to the filing of such Tax Return.

(c) Any Tax Return to be prepared and filed for Taxable periods beginning on
or before the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date (a "Straddle
Period") shall be prepared by the Buyer on a basis consistent with the past
practice of the Company and the Subsidiaries except as otherwise required by
Law. The Buyer shall provide the Seller with a copy of each proposed Tax
Return of the Company or the Subsidiaries for any Straddle Period (and such additional information regarding such Tax Return as may reasonably
be requested by the Seller) for review and comment at least thirty (30)
Business Days prior to the filing of such Tax Return, in the case of Income
Tax Returns, and in such period of time prior to filing as the Buyer shall
reasonably determine to be practicable, in the case of other Tax Returns. The
Buyer shall consider in good faith any comments reasonably requested by the
Seller in writing and received by the Buyer no less than five (5) Business
Days prior to the due date of such Tax Return, in the case of Income Tax
Returns, and prior to the filing of such Tax Return, in the case of other Tax
Returns.

Section 9.03 Transfer Taxes. Any transfer, sales, use, stamp, conveyance,
recording, real estate transfer, registration, documentary, filing and other
non-income Taxes and administrative fees (including, without limitation,
notary fees) ("Transfer Taxes") arising in connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne 100% by the
Buyer. The Seller and Buyer will reasonably cooperate to file all necessary
Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes.
The Buyer and the Seller further agree, upon request, to use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Entity or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 9.04 Allocation of Certain Taxes.

(a) The Buyer and the Seller agree that if the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries is permitted but not required under applicable foreign, state or
local Tax Laws to treat the Closing Date as the last day of a Taxable period,
the Buyer and the Seller shall treat such day as the last day of a Taxable
period.

(b) The amount of any Taxes for a Straddle Period allocable to the portion of
such period ending on the Closing Date shall be deemed to equal (i) in the
case of Taxes that (x) are based upon or related to income or receipts or (y)
imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of
property (other than Transfer Taxes described in Section 9.03)) the amount
which would be payable if the Taxable year ended with the Closing Date, and
(ii) in the case of other Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (including
property Taxes), the amount of such Taxes for the entire period multiplied by
a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the period
ending with the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire period.

(c) For purposes of allocating Taxes attributable to any partnerships or
specified foreign corporations (within the meaning of Section 965(e) of the
Code) in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries hold (with due regard to
Section 958 of the Code) an equity interest as of the Closing Date, the
Taxable year of any such partnerships or specified foreign corporations shall
be treated as ending on the Closing Date (without regard to any contrary
provision of Law).

Section 9.05 Allocation of Purchase Price. (a) Within 90 days following the Closing Date, the Buyer shall deliver to the
Seller for his review and approval a schedule setting forth an allocation (the
"Allocation") of the sum of (A) the Aggregate Consideration and (B) the amount
of any Liabilities of the Company and the U.S. Subsidiaries among the assets
of the Company and the U.S. Subsidiaries in accordance with Section 338(b)(5)
of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. If the Seller does not
approve the Allocation, the Buyer and the Seller shall work in good faith to
resolve any disagreement regarding the Allocation. In the event that the Buyer
and the Seller cannot agree on a mutually satisfactory allocation within sixty
(60) calendar days after delivery by the Seller of his comments to the
Allocation, the dispute shall be resolved promptly by the Neutral Accountant
at the joint expense of the Buyer and the Seller. If the Aggregate
Consideration is adjusted pursuant to this Agreement, the Allocation shall be
adjusted as appropriate and the Buyer and the Seller shall cooperate in making
any such adjustments.

(b) The parties agree that, except as may otherwise be required by Law, they
shall file all relevant Tax Returns (including Internal Revenue Service Forms
8883) in a manner consistent with this Section 9.05 (including the Allocation)
and that they shall not take any position with any Governmental Entity (on
audit or otherwise) that is inconsistent with such provisions; provided
however, that nothing contained herein shall prevent the Buyer or the Seller
from settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental Entity
based upon or arising out of the Allocation (subject to Section 9.06), and
neither the Buyer nor the Seller shall be required to litigate before any
court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental Entity
challenging the Allocation.

Section 9.06 Cooperation on Tax Matters; Tax Audits.

(a) The Buyer, the Seller, the Company and the Subsidiaries and their
respective Affiliates agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to the other,
upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance
relating to Taxes, including, without limitation, access to books and records,
as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns by the Buyer, the
Seller or the Company, the making of any election relating to Taxes, the
preparation for any Tax audit and the prosecution or defense of any claim,
suit or proceeding relating to any Tax. The Buyer, the Seller, the Company and
the Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates shall also cooperate in
seeking relief from the Internal Revenue Service for the inadvertent
termination of the Company's S corporation status if applicable. Each of the
Buyer and the Seller shall retain all books and records with respect to Taxes
for a period of at least seven (7) years following the Closing Date.

(b) The Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries, and their Affiliates, on the
one hand, and the Seller and his Affiliates, on the other hand, shall promptly
notify each other upon receipt by such party of written notice of any
inquiries, claims, assessments, audits or similar events with respect to Taxes
relating to a Taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the
Closing Date (any such inquiry, claim, assessment, audit or similar event, a
"Tax Matter").

(c) The Seller shall have the right, at its own expense, to control any Tax
Matter relating to Income Taxes of the Company or the Subsidiaries for any
Taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date, provided, however, that
the Buyer shall have the right, at its own expense, to participate in such Tax Matter, and the Seller shall not settle or
compromise any such Tax Matter which may have the effect of materially
increasing the Tax Liability of the Buyer, the Company, the Subsidiaries or
their Affiliates for any Tax period ending after the Closing without the
Buyer's prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Buyer shall have the right to control
any other Tax Matter with respect to the business of the Company or the
Subsidiaries; provided, however, that, the Seller shall have the right at its
own expense, to participate in any such Tax Matter and the Buyer shall not
settle any such Tax Matter which may have the effect of materially increasing
the Tax Liability of the Seller without the prior written consent of the
Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

Section 9.07 Section 338(g) Election. Prior to making any election under
Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to any non-U.S. Subsidiary of the
Company, the Buyer shall obtain the prior written consent of the Seller, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

Section 9.08 Post-Closing Actions. Except as otherwise required by law or with
the written consent of the Seller, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed, the Buyer shall not amend any Tax Return with respect
to the Company and its Subsidiaries for any Taxable period that ends on or
before the Closing Date or make any Tax election or, grant an extension of any
applicable statute of limitations with respect to any Taxable period that ends
on or before the Closing Date, or file a Tax Return with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries for any Taxable period that ends on or before the
Closing Date in a jurisdiction where the Company or its Subsidiaries did not
previously file; provided, however, that this Section 9.08 shall not apply to
the filing of voluntary disclosures and tax returns for sales and use taxes in
the states listed on Schedule 9.08. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to
making any voluntary disclosures in the states listed on Schedule 9.08, Buyer
will consult with Seller and Seller's tax advisor.

Section 9.09 Refunds. The Seller shall be entitled to the amount of any refund
of Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to a Taxable period
(or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date which refund is
actually obtained by the Buyer or its subsidiaries (including the Company and
its Subsidiaries) after the Closing, net of any reasonable cost to the Buyer
attributable to the obtaining and receipt of such refund, except to the extent
such refund arises as the result of a carryback of a loss or other tax benefit
from a Tax period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date or was
taken into account in determining Closing Net Working Capital. The Buyer shall

OTHER POST-CLOSING AGREEMENTS

Section 10.01 Proprietary Information.

(a) From and after the Closing, the Seller and its Affiliates shall not
disclose or make use of any Proprietary Information except with the prior
written consent of an authorized Representative of the Buyer; provided that if
Seller requests to use any Proprietary Information that is necessary to assert
a defense in a Legal Proceeding in which neither Buyer nor any of its
Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) is involved, Buyer shall make a
good faith determination as to whether to grant such consent to Seller.
Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, Seller will be permitted to disclose
Proprietary Information (i) to the extent requested in writing by Buyer or its
subsidiaries (including the Acquired Companies following the Closing), (ii) to
the extent required under applicable Law for Tax reporting and (iii) to his
Representatives who have a need to know such Proprietary Information in
connection with any of the foregoing and are required to keep such Proprietary
Information confidential. "Proprietary Information" means any information with
respect to the business and affairs of the Acquired Companies that is not
generally known by, nor easily learned or determined by, persons outside the
Company, including: (1) specifications, manuals, software in various stages of
development, and other technical data; (2) customer and prospect lists,
details of agreements and communications with customers and prospects, and
other customer information; (3) sales plans and projections, product pricing
information, protocols, acquisition, expansion, marketing, financial and other
business information and existing and future products and business plans and
strategies; (4) sales proposals, demonstrations systems, sales material; (5)
research and development; (6) software systems, computer programs and source
codes; (7) sources of supply; (8) identity of specialized consultants and
contractors and Proprietary Information; (9) purchasing, operating and other
cost data; (10) special customer needs, cost and pricing data; and (11)
employee information (including personnel, payroll, compensation and benefit
data and plans), including all such information recorded in manuals,
memoranda, projections, reports, minutes, plans, drawings, sketches, designs,
data, specifications, software programs and records, whether or not legended
or otherwise identified as Proprietary Information, as well as such
information that is the subject of meetings and discussions and not recorded.
Proprietary Information shall not include any information that the Seller can
demonstrate (A) is in the public domain (other than as a result of a
disclosure by the Seller), (B) is disclosed to the Seller following the
Closing by a third party other than the Buyer, its subsidiaries (including the
Acquired Companies), or their Representatives, that to the Seller's knowledge,
was not under an obligation of confidence to the Buyer or its subsidiaries
(including the Acquired Companies) not to disclose such information or (C)
disclosure thereof is required by Law or any Order of any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction (in which event Seller will, to
the extent permitted under such Law or Order, inform the Buyer in advance as
soon as reasonably practicable of any such required disclosure, make available
to the Buyer and its counsel the documents and other information requested and
will cooperate with the Buyer, at the Buyer's sole cost and expense, if
directed by the Buyer in obtaining a protective Order or other protection in
respect of such required disclosure, and will limit such disclosure to the
extent permitted under such Law or Order while still complying with such
requirements).

(b) Seller agrees that the remedy at Law for any breach of this Section 10.01
would be inadequate and that the Buyer shall be entitled to injunctive relief,
without the requirement of posting any bond or other security, in addition to
any other remedy it may have upon breach of any provision of this Section
10.01.

Section 10.02 Non-Competition Agreement.

(a) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the third
anniversary of the Closing Date, the Seller shall not (other than in his
capacity as an employee of the Buyer, the Company or any of their respective
subsidiaries) directly or indirectly, whether as a partner, officer, director,
employee, stockholder, joint venturer, member, investor or otherwise (other
than as the passive holder of not more than five percent (5%) of the total
outstanding stock of a publicly-held company):

(i) engage, participate or invest in, establish, manage, operate or control
any business that is competitive with the business of the Acquired Companies
as conducted on the Closing Date or planned to be conducted by the Acquired
Companies as of the Closing Date in the geographic areas where the Acquired
Companies conduct business or plan to conduct business as of the Closing Date
(the "Restricted Territory"); or

(ii) solicit, divert or take away, or attempt to solicit, divert or take away,
the business or patronage from the Acquired Companies of any individual,
corporation or other entity which is as of the Closing Date a current or
prospective client or customer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
had been a client or customer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries within
a period of two (2) years prior to the Closing Date (for the avoidance of
doubt, soliciting current or prospective clients or customers of the Acquired
Companies with respect to a business that does not compete with the business
of the Acquired Companies as conducted or contemplated as of the Closing Date
shall be permitted under this Section 10.02(a)(ii) so long as such
solicitation complies with the other provisions of this Agreement).

(b) Each of the parties agrees that the duration and geographic scope of the
non-competition provision set forth in this Section 10.02 are reasonable. In
the event that any court of competent jurisdiction determines that the
duration or the geographic scope, or both, are unreasonable and that such
provision is to that extent unenforceable, each of the parties agrees that the
provision shall remain in full force and effect for the greatest time period
and in the greatest area that would not render it unenforceable. Each of the
parties intends that this non-competition provision shall be deemed to be a
series of separate covenants, one for each and every county or other political subdivision of each and every state of the
United States of America or other territory included in the Restricted
Territory. The Seller agrees that damages are an inadequate remedy for any
breach of this provision and that the Buyer or the Company shall, whether or
not it is pursuing any potential remedies at Law, be entitled to equitable
relief in the form of preliminary and permanent injunctions without bond or
other security upon any actual or threatened breach of this non-competition
provision.

(c) The Seller acknowledges that his ownership of Shares represents a
substantial interest in the Company and the Seller intends to transfer to the
Buyer the goodwill reflected in the Shares. The Seller further acknowledges
that the Buyer would not enter into this Agreement but for the restrictions in
this Section 10.02.

(d) If the Seller violates the terms of this Section 10.02, the Seller shall
continue to be bound by the restrictions set forth herein for an additional
time period equal to the amount of time that the Seller was in violation of
this Section 10.02.

(e) The restrictions in this Section 10.02 shall be in addition to restrictive
covenants in any other agreements regarding the Company or the Buyer that the
Seller is a party to.

Section 10.03 No Claims. Effective as of the Closing, the Seller, by its
execution and delivery of this Agreement, hereby (a) waives any and all rights
of indemnification, contribution and other similar rights against the Company
or any Subsidiary (whether arising pursuant to any Organizational Document of
the Company or any Subsidiary, any Contract, applicable Law or otherwise) and
(b) forever waives, releases and discharges (and hereby agrees to cause each
of its representatives to forever waive, release and discharge) with prejudice
the Company and each Subsidiary from any and all claims, rights (including
rights of indemnification, contribution and other similar rights, from
whatever source, whether under Contract, applicable Law or otherwise), causes
of action, protests, suits, disputes, orders, obligations, debts, demands,
proceedings, Contracts, promises, Liabilities, controversies, costs, expenses,
fees (including attorneys' fees), or damages of any kind, arising by any means
(including subrogation, assignment, reimbursement, operation of law or
otherwise), whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, accrued or not
accrued, foreseen or unforeseen, or mature or unmature related or with respect
to, in connection with, or arising out of, directly or indirectly, any event,
fact, condition, circumstance, occurrence, act or omission that was in
existence (or that occurred or failed to occur) at or prior to the Closing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 10.03 will be deemed to
constitute a release by Seller of (a) any rights under this Agreement or the
other Transaction Documents, (b) any claim for any unpaid salary, wages or
benefits arising in the Ordinary Course of Business solely from Seller's
employment with the Company or a Subsidiary as in effect on the Closing Date,
(c) any right that cannot be waived by applicable Law, or (d) subject to
Section 10.04 and Section 8.01(h)(iii), any right to indemnification in favor
of, or limitation of liability of, a Company Indemnified Person pursuant to
the Organizational Documents of any Acquired Company or pursuant to any
liability insurance policies (or the equivalent thereof) of an Acquired
Company, in each case, in effect as of the Closing Date.

Section 10.04 Indemnification. (a) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall not
amend, repeal or otherwise modify any provisions of any Acquired Companies'
certificate or articles of incorporation, bylaws, certificate of formation or
limited liability company agreement (or equivalent governing document)
concerning indemnification, exculpation, limitation of liability of, or
advancement of expenses to directors, officers, fiduciaries or agents of the
Company in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of
persons who, prior to the Closing Date, were directors, officers, employees,
fiduciaries or agents of the Company (collectively, "Company Indemnified
Persons"), except to the extent required by applicable Law and except for any
such change that would not affect the application of such provisions to acts
or omissions of such individuals prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the certificate of incorporation, bylaws of the
Company or any Subsidiary or any provision in any indemnification or other
agreement to which any of them is a party or by which any of them is bound, no
exculpation or other provision in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws
of the Company or any Subsidiary or any such agreement shall be deemed to
exculpate any such person from its obligations under this Agreement,

(b) If an Acquired Company or any of their successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges with or into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving entity, partnership or other entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of such
Acquired Company assume the obligations set forth in this Section 10.04. The
provisions of this Section 10.04 are intended to be for the benefit of, and
enforceable by, each Company Indemnified Person and such Company Indemnified
Person's estate and heirs, and nothing herein shall affect any indemnification
rights that any Company Indemnified Person or such Company Indemnified
Person's estate and heirs may have under the organizational or governing
documents of the Acquired Companies, any applicable Law, any Contract or
otherwise.

(c) The Company will obtain prior to the Closing Date six (6)-year "tail"
insurance policies (the "DandO Tail") with respect to directors' and officers'
liability insurance of the type and with the amount of coverage no less
favorable than those of the directors' and officers' liability insurance
maintained as of the date hereof by the Company (the "Current Policies"), and
with such other terms as are no less favorable in the aggregate than those in
the Current Policies. The premium for the DandO Tail (the "DandO Tail Premium")
shall be paid in full prior to the Closing Date by the Company or at the
Closing as a Company Transaction Expense. Buyer will cause the Company from
and after the Closing not to cancel or change such coverage.

Section 10.05 Access. Until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing, Buyer
will, and will cause the Acquired Companies to, afford to Seller and its
Representatives reasonable access, upon reasonable notice at reasonable times
during normal business hours and at Seller's expense, to the Books and Records
of the Acquired Companies to the extent relating to periods prior to the
Closing Date and reasonably required by Seller in connection with any Tax or
financial reporting requirement under applicable Law (other than in any matter
relating to a potential or actual dispute arising out of this Agreement or
contemplated hereby); provided that (i) such access does not unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of the business of Buyer or the Acquired Companies, (ii) such books, records and information are not subject to an attorney-client
or other legal privilege that would be forfeited by such access and (iii) such
access is not in violation of applicable Laws or the provisions of any
agreement to which the Buyer or any of its subsidiaries (including any
Acquired Company) is a party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Seller
requests access to information that is necessary to assert a defense in a
Legal Proceeding in which neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates (including
the Acquired Companies) is involved, Buyer shall make a good faith
determination as to whether to grant such access to Seller and its
Representatives. Seller will, and will cause its Representatives to, maintain
such books, records and information in confidence unless disclosure is
required by applicable Law or pursuant to an Order of a Governmental Entity
(and if such disclosure is required, the procedures described in Section
10.01(a) clause (C) will apply to such disclosure). All requests for access or
information pursuant to this Section 10.05 will be directed to such Person or
Persons as Buyer will designate. Buyer will not be required to maintain any
information described in this Section 10.05 past the date of destruction
prescribed by the bona fide document retention policies of the Buyer or the
Acquired Companies in effect from time to time.

Any party to this Agreement may give any notice or other communication
hereunder using any other means (including personal delivery, messenger
service, ordinary mail or electronic mail), but no such notice or other
communication shall be deemed to have been duly given unless and until it
actually is received by the party for whom it is intended. Any party to this
Agreement may change the address to which notices and other communications
hereunder are to be delivered by giving the other parties to this Agreement
notice in the manner herein set forth.

Section 13.02 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the documents and
instruments referred to herein) and the other Transaction Documents constitute
the entire agreement among the parties to this Agreement and supersede any
prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among the parties
hereto, or any of them, written or oral, with respect to the subject matter
hereof; provided that the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in effect in
accordance with its terms.

Section 13.03 Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is not intended to,
and shall not, confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder,
except that the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be third-party beneficiaries
of Article VIII and the Company Indemnified Persons shall be third-party
beneficiaries of Section 10.04. Section 13.04 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in
whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties
hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such
assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void, except
that the Buyer may transfer or assign its rights and obligations under this
Agreement, in whole or from time to time in part, to one (1) or more of its
Affiliates so long as such assignment does not materially impair Buyer's
ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents; provided, however, that any such assignment by Buyer shall not
relieve it of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

Section 13.05 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or
the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid
or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the
event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior
sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will
achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of
such invalid or unenforceable term.

Section 13.06 Counterparts and Signature. This Agreement may be executed in
two (2) or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but
all of which together shall be considered one (1) and the same agreement and
shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties hereto and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that
all parties need not sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed
and delivered by facsimile or by an electronic scan delivered by electronic
transmission.

Section 13.07 Interpretation. Except where expressly stated otherwise in this
Agreement, the following rules of interpretation apply to this Agreement: (a)
"either" and "or" are not exclusive and "include," "includes" and "including"
are not limiting; (b) "hereof," "hereto," "hereby," "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement;
(c) "date of this Agreement" refers to the date set forth in the initial
caption of this Agreement; (d) "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" means
the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase does not
mean simply "if"; (e) the descriptive headings and table of contents included
herein are included for convenience only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or any provision hereof; (f)
definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well
as the plural forms of such terms; (g) references to a Contract mean such
Contract as amended or otherwise supplemented or modified from time to time; (h) references to a Person are also to its
permitted successors and assigns; (i) references to an "Article," "Section,"
"Exhibit" or "Schedule" refer to an Article or Section of, or an Exhibit or
Schedule to, this Agreement; (j) references to "$" or otherwise to dollar
amounts refer to the lawful currency of the United States; (k) references to a

delegated legislation issued thereunder; (l) references to accounting terms

the Accounting Principles; (m) a term that begins with an initial capital
letter, is not defined herein and reflects a different part of speech than a
term that begins with an initial capital letter and is defined herein, shall
be interpreted in a correlative manner; and (n) references in Article II or
Article III to written notices, complaints, claims, requests, threats or other
written communications shall include notices, complaints, claims, requests,

made in this Agreement to information that has been "made available" to the
Buyer, that shall consist of only the information that was (i) contained in
the Company's electronic data room no later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on
the second (2nd) Business Day prior to the date of this Agreement or (ii)
delivered to the Buyer or its counsel. The language used in this Agreement
shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express
their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied
against any party hereto. No summary of this Agreement prepared by any party
shall affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. If any date on
which a party is required to make a payment or a delivery pursuant to the
terms hereof is not a Business Day, then such party shall make such payment or
delivery on the next succeeding Business Day.

Section 13.08 Governing Law. This Agreement (and any claims or disputes
arising out of or related hereto or the transactions contemplated hereby or to
the inducement of any party to enter herein, whether for breach of contract,
tortious conduct or otherwise and whether predicated on common law, statute or
otherwise) shall be governed in all respects, including validity,
interpretation, and effect, by and construed in accordance with the internal
Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (including in respect of the statute
of limitations or other limitations period applicable to any claim,
controversy or dispute) without giving effect to any choice or conflict of Law
provision or rule (whether of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of Laws of any jurisdictions
other than those of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

Section 13.09 Remedies.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.04(i) with respect to the period
from and after the Closing, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred
upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other
remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such party, and the exercise
by a party of any one (1) remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other
remedy.

(b) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case without posting a bond or
undertaking, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at Law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief on the basis that (i) the party seeking such remedy has an adequate
remedy at Law or (ii) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at Law or equity.

Section 13.10 Submission to Jurisdiction. Each of the parties to this
Agreement (a) consents to submit itself to the exclusive personal jurisdiction
of the Business Litigation Session of the Superior Court of Suffolk County,
Massachusetts, or, if that court does not have jurisdiction, another
Massachusetts state court located in Suffolk County, or, if no such
Massachusetts state court has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District
of Massachusetts in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b)
agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard
and determined in any such court, (c) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny
or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court, and (d) agrees not to bring any action or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement in any other court. Each of the parties hereto waives any
defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding
so brought and waives any bond, surety or other security that might be
required of any other party with respect thereto. Any party hereto may make
service on another party by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the
party to be served at the address and in the manner provided for the giving of
notices in Section 13.01. Nothing in this Section 13.10, however, shall affect
the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by
Law.

Section 13.11 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL

TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW WHICH CANNOT BE WAIVED, EACH OF
THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE AND COVENANT THAT NEITHER IT NOR ITS AFFILIATES WILL
ASSERT ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY ON ANY ISSUE IN ANY PROCEEDING, WHETHER AS
PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT, OR OTHERWISE, IN RESPECT OF ANY ISSUE, CLAIM, DEMAND,
ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR BASED UPON THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH, RELATED, OR INCIDENTAL TO
THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR
HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN TORT OR CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE.

Section 13.12 Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representations; Non-Assertion of
Attorney-Client Privilege.

(a) Conflicts of Interest. Buyer acknowledges that Latham and Watkins LLP and
Sullivan and Worcester LLP ("Prior Company Counsel") have, on or prior to the
Closing Date, represented one or more of the Seller, the Acquired Companies,
and other Affiliates, and their respective officers and directors (each such
Person, other than the Acquired Companies, a "Designated Person") in one or more matters relating to this Agreement or any
other agreements or transactions contemplated hereby (which may include any
litigation, claim or dispute arising prior to the Closing under or related to
this Agreement or such other agreements or in connection with such
transactions) (each, an "Existing Representation"), and that, in the event of
any post-Closing matters: (i) relating to this Agreement, any other
Transaction Documents or any transactions contemplated hereby (including any
litigation, claim or dispute arising under or related to this Agreement or
such other Transaction Documents or in connection with such transactions), and
(ii) in which the Buyer or any of its controlled Affiliates (including the
Acquired Companies), on the one hand, and one or more Designated Persons, on
the other hand, are or may be adverse to each other (each, a "Post-Closing
Matters"), the Designated Persons reasonably anticipate that Prior Company
Counsel will represent them in connection with such matters. Accordingly, each
of Buyer and the Company hereby: (A) waives and will not assert, and agrees
after the Closing to cause its controlled Affiliates to waive and to not
assert, any Existing Representation as a basis for any conflict of interest
arising out of or relating to the representation by one or more Prior Company
Counsel of one or more Designated Persons in connection with one or more Post-
Closing Matters (the "Post-Closing Representations"); and (B) agrees that, in
the event that a Post-Closing Matter arises, no Existing Representation will
serve as a basis to prevent Prior Company Counsel from representing one or
more Designated Persons in such Post-Closing Matter even though the interests
of such Person(s) may be directly adverse to Buyer or any of its controlled
Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) and even though Prior Company
Counsel may have represented the Acquired Companies in a matter substantially
related to such dispute.

(b) Attorney-Client Privilege. Each of Buyer and the Company (on behalf of
itself and its controlled Affiliates) waives and will not assert, and agrees
after the Closing to cause its controlled Affiliates to waive and to not
assert, any attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product protection or
expectation of client confidence with respect to any communication between any
Prior Company Counsel, on the one hand, and any Designated Person or the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Pre-Closing Designated
Persons") to the extent solely relating to the negotiation, execution,
interpretation, or performance of this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby (collectively, "Pre-Closing Transaction-Related Privileges") in
connection with any Post-Closing Representation, including in connection with
a dispute between any Designated Person and one or more of Buyer, the Company
and their respective Affiliates, it being the intention of the parties hereto
that all rights to such Pre-Closing Transaction-Related Privileges, and all
rights to waive or otherwise control such Pre-Closing Transaction-Related
Privilege, will be retained by the Seller, and will not pass to or be claimed
or used by Buyer or the Company, except as provided in the last sentence of
this Section 13.12(b). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a
dispute arises between Buyer or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and a third party other than a Designated Person, on the other hand,
the Company may (and may cause its Affiliates to) assert the Pre-Closing
Transaction-Related Privileges on behalf of the Designated Persons to prevent
disclosure of any documentation or information that is subject to an attorney-
client privilege or other rights of confidentiality referenced in this Section
13.12 to such third party; provided, however, that such Pre-Closing Transaction-Related Privilege may be waived only with the prior
written consent of the Seller.
