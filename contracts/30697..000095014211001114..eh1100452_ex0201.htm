subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Buyer agrees to purchase from

Section 2.2. Purchase Price. At the Closing, Buyer shall (i) pay the
Preliminary Cash Consideration in immediately available funds by wire transfer
to an account or accounts that have been designated by Seller to Buyer not
less than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing, which amount shall be
subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 2.3 and Section 8.5 (as so
adjusted, the "Cash Consideration"), and (ii) transfer to Seller the Buyer
Parent Common Stock Consideration (the Cash Consideration and the Buyer Parent
Common Stock Consideration, collectively, the "Purchase Price").

  

  

Section 2.3. Purchase Price Adjustments.

than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Estimated Adjustment
Certificate and the Estimated Outstanding Gift Card Liability Certificate.

Within thirty (30) days following the Closing, Buyer shall prepare and deliver
to Seller (i) the Closing Adjustment Certificate and (ii) a statement setting
forth the amount of the Outstanding Gift Card Liability and any Outstanding
Gift Card Liability Excess Payment or Outstanding Gift Card Liability
Shortfall Payment (the "Outstanding Gift Card Liability Statement"). Buyer and
Seller shall provide to each other such data and information as the other
Party may reasonably request in connection with the preparation and review of
the Closing Adjustment Certificate and the Outstanding Gift Card Liability
Statement.

  

  

(c) Notice of Disagreement. The Closing Adjustment Certificate and the
Outstanding Gift Card Liability Statement shall become final and binding upon
the Parties on the date (the "Final Settlement Date") that is fifteen (15)
days following receipt thereof by Seller unless Seller gives written notice of
its disagreement ("Notice of Disagreement") to Buyer prior to such date;
provided, however, that any disagreement shall be limited to mathematical
errors and/or calculations of amounts not in accordance with GAAP, and to the
extent consistent with GAAP, the Accounting Methodology. Any Notice of
Disagreement shall specify in reasonable detail the dollar amount, nature and
basis of any disagreement so asserted. If a Notice of

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

18  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Disagreement is received by Buyer, then the Closing Adjustment Certificate
and/or the Outstanding Gift Card Liability Statement (each, as revised in
accordance with paragraph (d) below, if applicable) shall become final and
binding on the Parties on, and the Final Settlement Date shall be, the earlier
of (i) the date upon which Seller and Buyer agree in writing with respect to
all matters specified in the Closing Adjustment Certificate and/or the
Outstanding Gift Card Liability Statement and (ii) the date upon which the
Final Adjustment Certificate and/or the Final Outstanding Gift Card Liability
Statement is issued by the Adjustment Amount Arbitrator.

  

  

(d) Final Adjustment Certificate; Final Outstanding Gift Card Liability
Statement. During the first twenty (20) days following the date upon which
Buyer receives a Notice of Disagreement, Seller and Buyer shall attempt in
good faith to resolve in writing any differences that they may have with
respect to all matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement. If at the end
of such twenty (20) day period (or earlier by mutual agreement to arbitrate)
Buyer and Seller have not reached agreement, the matters that remain in
dispute may be submitted to an arbitrator (the "Adjustment Amount Arbitrator")
by either Buyer or Seller for review and resolution. The Adjustment Amount
Arbitrator shall be KPMG LLP, or if KPMG LLP is unwilling or unable to serve,
another nationally recognized independent public accounting firm agreed upon
by Buyer and Seller in writing. The hearing date shall be scheduled by the
Adjustment Amount Arbitrator as soon as practicable and shall be conducted on
a confidential basis. Buyer and Seller shall each, not later than seven (7)
days prior to the hearing date set by the Adjustment Amount Arbitrator, submit
a brief (to include their respective calculations with regard to amounts in
dispute on the Closing Adjustment Certificate and/or the Outstanding Gift Card
Liability Statement) for settlement of any amounts set forth in the Notice of
Disagreement that remain in dispute. The Adjustment Amount Arbitrator shall
render a decision (which decision shall include a written statement of
findings and conclusions) resolving the matters in dispute in accordance with
this Section 2.3(d), within three (3) Business Days after the conclusion of
the hearing, unless Buyer and Seller reach agreement prior thereto and
withdraw the dispute from arbitration. The Adjustment Amount Arbitrator shall
provide to Buyer and Seller explanations in writing of the reasons for its
decisions regarding the Adjustment Amount and shall issue the Final Adjustment
Certificate and/or the Final Outstanding Gift Card Liability Statement
reflecting such decisions. The Adjustment Amount Arbitrator shall act as an
arbitrator and not as an expert, shall not permit or authorize discovery or
hear testimony, shall address only those items in dispute and for each item
may not assign a value greater than the greatest value for such item claimed
by Buyer or Seller or smaller than the smallest value for such item claimed by
Buyer or Seller. The decision of the Adjustment Amount Arbitrator shall be
final and binding on Buyer and Seller. The fees and expenses of the Adjustment
Amount Arbitrator pursuant to this Section 2.3(d) shall be borne pro rata
between Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, in proportion
to the final determination made by the Adjustment Amount Arbitrator of the
disputed matters in relation to the amounts asserted in such disputed matters
by Seller and Buyer, such that the prevailing party pays the lesser proportion
of such fees and expenses. As used in this Agreement, (x) the term "Final
Adjustment Certificate" shall mean the Closing Adjustment Certificate
delivered pursuant to Section 2.3(b), as subsequently adjusted, if applicable,
pursuant to this Section 2.3(d) to reflect any subsequent written agreement
between Buyer and Seller with respect thereto and, if submitted to the
Adjustment Amount Arbitrator, any amendments or modifications to the Closing
Adjustment Certificate decided by the Adjustment Amount Arbitrator, and (y)

Gift Card Liability Statement delivered pursuant to Section 2.3(b), as
subsequently adjusted, if applicable, pursuant to this Section 2.3 to reflect
any subsequent written agreement between Buyer and Seller with respect thereto
and, if submitted to the Adjustment Amount Arbitrator, any amendments or
modifications to the Outstanding Gift Card Liability Statement decided by the
Adjustment Amount Arbitrator.

  

  

(e) Final Settlement and Adjustment to Purchase Price; Payments.

  

  

(i) (x) If the Adjustment Amount set forth on the Final Adjustment Certificate
is less than the Estimated Adjustment Amount, then the Preliminary Cash
Consideration shall be decreased by an amount equal to such excess of the
Estimated Adjustment Amount over the Adjustment Amount set forth on the Final
Adjustment Certificate (a "Shortfall Payment") and (y) if the Adjustment
Amount set forth on the Final Adjustment Certificate is greater than the
Estimated Adjustment Amount, the Preliminary Cash Consideration shall be
increased by an amount equal to such excess of the Adjustment Amount set forth
on the Final Adjustment Certificate over the Estimated Adjustment Amount (an
"Excess Payment").

  

  

(ii) (x) If the amount of the Outstanding Gift Card Liability as set forth on
the Final Outstanding Gift Card Liability Statement (the "Final Outstanding
Gift Card Liability Amount") is less than the Estimated Outstanding Gift Card
Liability Amount, then the Preliminary Cash Consideration shall be increased

Liability Amount over the amount of the Final Outstanding Gift Card Liability
Amount (an "Outstanding Gift Card Liability Excess Payment") and (y) if the
amount of the Final Outstanding Gift Card Liability Amount is greater than the
Estimated Outstanding Gift Card Liability Amount, then the Preliminary Cash
Consideration shall be decreased by an amount equal to such excess of the
Final Outstanding Gift Card Liability Amount over the Estimated Outstanding
Gift Card Liability Amount (an "Outstanding Gift Card Liability Shortfall
Payment").

  

  

(iii) Seller shall pay to Buyer any Shortfall Payment and any Outstanding Gift
Card Liability Shortfall Payment, and Buyer shall pay to Seller any Excess
Payment and any Outstanding Gift Card Liability Excess Payment, not later than

Group is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification or license

Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter or any of the other Transaction
Documents to which it is or will be a party by a member of the Buyer Group,
nor the consummation by such member of the Buyer Group of the transactions

Equity Commitment Letter, which is in full force and effect, is a legal, valid
and binding obligation of each of the parties thereto, subject to the Remedies
Exception, and is not subject to any contingencies or conditions that are not
set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter. Other than the Equity Commitment
Letter, neither Buyer Parent nor Buyer has entered into any agreement pursuant
to which any Person has the right to modify or amend the terms of the equity
investment contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter. Neither Buyer Parent
nor Buyer is in default or breach and no event has occurred which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach
under any term or condition of the Equity Commitment Letter. Neither Buyer
Parent nor Buyer has a reasonable basis to believe that it, Sponsor or any
other party thereto will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or
condition of closing to be satisfied pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter.

  

  

(b) Each of Buyer Parent and Buyer understands that its obligations to effect

Commitment Letter.

  

  

Section 4.6. Investment. Each member of the Buyer Group is aware that the
Company Shares being acquired by Buyer pursuant to the transactions
contemplated hereby have not been registered under the Securities Act or under
any state securities Laws. Buyer is not an underwriter, as such term is
defined under the Securities Act, and Buyer is purchasing the Company Shares
solely for investment and not with a view toward, or for sale in connection
with, any distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act, nor
with any present intention of distributing or selling any of the Company
Shares. Buyer and its Affiliates acknowledge that none of them may sell or
otherwise dispose of the Company Shares except in compliance with the
registration requirements or exemption provisions under the Securities Act and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any other applicable
securities Laws.

  

  

Section 4.7. Litigation. There are no Actions pending or, to Buyer's
Knowledge, threatened in law or in equity or before any Governmental Authority
against Buyer or any of its Affiliates which would have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Buyer Material Adverse Effect, and there are no outstanding
injunctions, judgments, orders, decrees, rulings, or charges to which Buyer or
any of its Affiliates is a party or by which it is bound by or with any
Governmental Authority which would have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

Section 4.8. Brokers' Fees. None of Buyer or any of its Affiliates has any
contract or other arrangement or understanding (written or oral, express or
implied) with any Person which may result in the obligation of Seller, the
Company or any of its Affiliates to pay any fees or commissions to any broker
or finder as a result of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
other Transaction Documents to which the Buyer is or will be a party or the

Section 4.9. Information. Seller and the Company Group have provided Buyer
with such access to the facilities, books, records and personnel of each
member of the Company Group as Buyer has deemed necessary and appropriate in
order for Buyer to investigate to its satisfaction the Business and properties
of each member of the Company Group sufficiently to make an informed
investment decision to purchase the Company Shares and to enter into this
Agreement. Buyer (either alone or together with its Affiliates and/or
advisors) has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters
so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its purchase of the
Company Shares and is capable of bearing the economic risks of such purchase.
Buyer agrees to accept the Company Shares on the Closing Date based upon its
own investigation, examination and determination with respect thereto as to
all matters and without reliance upon any express or implied representations
or warranties of any nature made by or on behalf of or imputed to Seller,
except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. Buyer does not know of the
existence or non-existence or occurrence or non-occurrence of any event,
condition or circumstance the existence or non-existence or occurrence or non-
occurrence of which would excuse Buyer from its timely performance of its
obligations hereunder.

  

  

Section 4.10. Sponsor Guaranty. The Sponsor Guaranty is in full force and
effect and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Sponsor,
enforceable against Sponsor in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Remedies Exception. No event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both, would constitute a default thereunder.

the consummation of

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

 

  

  

the transactions contemplated hereby, including causing the failure of the

memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or
on behalf of any Party in connection with proceedings under or relating to the
HSR Act or any other Law contemplated to be complied with pursuant to Section
6.1. For the avoidance of doubt, no member of the Buyer Group shall require
Seller and/or any member of the Company Group to, and neither Seller nor any
member of the Company Group shall be required to, take any action with respect
to any decree, judgment, injunction or other order or any applicable Law which
would bind Seller or any member of the Company Group irrespective of whether
the Closing occurs.

  

  

(b) Each of the Parties shall notify and keep the other Parties advised as to
(i) any material communication from the Federal Trade Commission, the United
States Department of Justice or any other Governmental Authority regarding any
of the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) any Action pending and Known
to such Party, or to its Knowledge threatened, which challenges the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

Section 5.5. Public Announcements. None of the Parties shall (and the Parties
shall cause their respective Affiliates not to) issue any press release or
make any public announcement concerning the transactions contemplated hereby
or the contents of this Agreement without the prior written consent of the
other Parties (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The
Parties agree that the initial press release(s) to be issued

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

  

  

with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be substantially in the form attached to Section 5.5 of the Seller Disclosure

Section 5.6. Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) Tax Returns.

  

  

(i) Seller shall file or cause to be filed when due (taking into account any
applicable extensions) all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or
with respect to the Company Group for taxable years or periods ending on or
before the Closing Date, and shall pay all Taxes due in respect of such Tax
Returns. In the case of any such Tax Return due after the Closing Date that is
required to be signed by Buyer or any member of the Company Group (or any
officer or other authorized representative of any thereof), Seller shall send
a copy of such Tax Return to Buyer no later than thirty (30) Business Days, in
the case of Tax Returns that are filed less frequently than monthly, and three
(3) Business Days, in the case of all other Tax Returns, prior to the date on
which such Tax Return is due and Buyer shall sign or cause to be signed by the
relevant appropriate Person, as applicable, such Tax Return and send such
signed Tax Return back to Seller no later than five (5) Business Days prior to
the date on which such Tax Return is due, in the case of Tax Returns that are
filed less frequently than monthly, and no later than the earlier of (A) one
(1) Business Day prior to the date on which such Tax Return is due and (B) two
(2) Business Days after receipt of such Tax Return by Buyer, in the case of
all other Tax Returns. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, no review or deemed review of any Tax Return by Buyer pursuant to
this Section 5.6(a)(i) shall affect any Buyer Indemnified Party's rights, or
any of Seller's obligations, under Section 8.2(a)(iv).

  

  

(ii) Except as otherwise provided in Section 5.6(a)(iii), Buyer shall file or
cause to be filed when due (taking into account any applicable extensions) all
Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Company
Group for taxable years or periods ending after the Closing Date, and shall
pay all Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns.

  

  

(iii) With respect to Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with
respect to the Company Group for Straddle Periods ("Straddle Returns"), Buyer
shall file or cause to be filed such Straddle Returns when due (taking into
account any applicable extensions). Such Straddle Returns shall be prepared in
a manner consistent with past practice (unless otherwise required by
applicable Law). Seller shall be responsible for the Pre-Closing Taxes due in
respect of such Straddle Returns, and Buyer shall be responsible for the Post-
Closing Taxes due in respect of such Straddle Returns. Buyer shall notify
Seller of any amounts due from Seller in respect of any Straddle Return no
later than ten (10) Business Days

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

  

  

prior to the date on which such Straddle Return is due, and Seller shall remit
such payment to Buyer no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the date
such Straddle Return is due. Buyer shall deliver any Straddle Return to Seller
for its review at least thirty (30) days prior to the date on which such Tax
Return is required to be filed. If Seller disputes any item on such Tax
Return, it shall notify Buyer of such disputed item (or items) and the basis
for its objection. The Parties shall act in good faith to resolve any such
dispute prior to the date on which the relevant Tax Return is required to be
filed. If the Parties cannot resolve any disputed item, the item in question
shall be resolved by the Adjustment Amount Arbitrator. The fees and expenses
of the Adjustment Amount Arbitrator shall be borne equally by Seller and
Buyer.

  

  

(iv) Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing,
the Company Group) shall amend, refile or otherwise modify any Tax Return
relating in whole or in part to the Company Group with respect to any taxable
period or portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date without
Seller's prior written consent.

  

  

(v) For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Taxes of the Company
Group that are payable with respect to any Tax period that begins before and
ends after the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the portion of any such
Taxes that constitutes Pre-Closing Taxes shall: (i) in the case of Taxes that
are either (x) based upon or related to income or receipts, or (y) imposed in
connection with any sale, transfer or assignment or any deemed sale, transfer
or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), be
deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if the Tax year or period
ended on the Closing Date; and (ii) in the case of Taxes (other than those
described in clause (i) above) that are imposed on a periodic basis with
respect to the business or assets of the Company Group or otherwise measured
by the level of any item, be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the
entire Straddle Period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears
basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding Tax period)
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days
in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle
Period. For purposes of clause (i) of the preceding sentence, any exemption,
deduction, credit or other item (including, without limitation, the effect of
any graduated rates of tax) that is calculated on an annual basis shall be
allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date on
a pro rata basis determined by multiplying the total amount of such item
allocated to the Straddle Period times a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of calendar days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days
in the entire Straddle Period. In the case of any Tax based upon or measured
by capital (including net worth or long-term debt) or intangibles, any amount
thereof required to be allocated under this Section 5.6(a) shall be computed
by reference to the level of such items on the Closing Date and prorated as
provided in clause (ii). All determinations necessary to give effect to the
foregoing allocations shall be made

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  

  

in a manner consistent with past practice of the Company Group. The parties
hereto will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, elect with the
relevant Governmental Authority to treat a portion of any Straddle Period as a
short taxable period ending as of the close of business on the Closing Date.

  

  

(b) Contest Provisions.

  

  

(i) Buyer shall notify Seller in writing within five (5) Business Days after
receipt by Buyer, any of its Affiliates or any member of the Company Group of
notice of any pending or threatened federal, state, local or foreign Tax
audits or assessments which may affect the Tax Liabilities of the Company
Group for any taxable period or portion thereof ending on or before the
Closing Date; provided, however, that the failure to notify Seller within such
time period shall not relieve Seller from Liability hereunder. Seller shall
have the sole right to represent the Company Group (or any member thereof) in
any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to a
consolidated, combined or unitary group Tax Return of Seller or to Taxes for
which Seller or any of its Affiliates would be liable under Section 8.2 or
otherwise, and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense. In the case of
a contest that relates to Straddle Periods, Buyer shall control the conduct of
such contest, but Seller shall have the right to participate in such contest
at its own expense; provided that neither Buyer nor any member of the Company
Group may agree to settle any such Tax contest in a manner that could affect
Taxes or Tax attributes of Seller or any of its Affiliates without the prior
written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

  

  

(ii) Neither Buyer nor any member of the Company Group may agree to settle any
Tax claim in a manner that would affect Taxes or Tax attributes of Seller or
any of its Affiliates without the prior written consent of Seller, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  

  

(c) Termination of Tax Allocation Agreements. Any and all Tax allocation or
sharing agreements or other agreements or arrangements relating to Tax matters
between the Company Group (or any member thereof), on the one hand, and Seller
or any of its Affiliates (other than members of the Company Group), on the
other hand, shall be terminated as to the Company Group (and any member
thereof) as of the Closing Date and, from and after the Closing Date, no
member of the Company Group shall be obligated to make any payment pursuant to
any such agreement or arrangement for any past or future period.

  

  

(d) Assistance and Cooperation. Seller shall retain all Tax Returns, and other
records related to Taxes, as well as all accounting records and reports, of
the Company Group; provided, that after the Closing Date, each of Seller and
Buyer shall:

  

  

(i) reasonably assist (and cause their respective Affiliates to assist) the
other Party in preparing any Tax Returns or reports which such other Party is
responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with this Section 5.6
(including that with respect to any taxable year (or portion thereof) of the

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Company Group for which Seller is required to file a Tax Return pursuant to
Section 5.6(a)); and Buyer shall promptly (and, for the portion of the taxable
period ending on the Closing Date, within ninety (90) days after the Closing
Date) cause the Company to prepare and provide to Seller a package of tax
information materials, which shall be completed in accordance with the past
practice of the Company or the relevant Subsidiary including past practice as
to providing the information, schedules and work papers and as to the method
of computation of separate taxable income or other relevant measure of
income); and Buyer shall cause the Company Group to retain all records related
to Taxes for a ten (10) year period after the Closing Date, after which time
the Buyer shall notify Seller at least ten (10) Business Days in advance of
disposing of any records relevant to taxable periods (or portions thereof)
ending on or prior to the Closing Date and shall deliver such records to
Seller at Seller's request;

  

  

(ii) reasonably cooperate in preparing for any audits of, or disputes with
taxing authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of the Company Group;

  

  

(iii) make available to the other and to any Governmental Authority as
reasonably requested, and permit the other to copy at its own expense, all
information, records, and documents relating to accounting or Taxes of the
Company Group (which, for the avoidance of doubt, does not include (A) any
such items relating to accounting or Taxes of the Seller or any of Seller's
Affiliates (other than members of the Company Group) that do not relate solely
to the Company Group, and (B) any Tax Return of Seller Parent or any of its
Affiliates (including any consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return
including any such Person) except for separate non-income Tax Returns of the
members of the Company Group) (collectively, all such non-excluded items and
Tax Returns, the "Company Group Records"); and

  

  

(iv) furnish the other with copies of all correspondence received from any
Governmental Authority in connection with any Tax audit or information request
with respect to Taxes for which the other Party may be liable under this
Agreement.

  

  

provided, further, that after the date on which Seller no longer has any
indemnification obligation under Section 8.2(a) with respect to Taxes, Seller
shall, if Buyer so requests and at Buyer's expense, deliver to Buyer the
Company Group Records.

  

  

(e) Survival of Obligations. Except as specifically otherwise set forth in
this Section 5.6, the obligations of the Parties set forth in this Section 5.6
shall survive until the sixtieth (60th) day following the date on which the
applicable statute of limitations for the taxable year in question expires.

  

  

(f) For avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 5.6 shall not apply
to Transfer Taxes, as to which Section 2.6 shall apply.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(g) Section 338(h)(10) Election.

  

  

(i) Buyer shall join with Seller in making an election under Section
338(h)(10) of the Code and any corresponding or similar elections under state,
local or foreign Tax law (collectively the "Section 338(h)(10) Election") with
respect to the purchase and sale of the stock of the Company and any of its
domestic corporate Subsidiaries hereunder.

  

  

(ii) Seller shall pay any Taxes attributable to the making of the Section
338(h)(10) Election as provided in Section 5.6(g)(i) of this Agreement.

  

  

(iii) Seller shall prepare and file, or cause to be filed, all forms and
documents required in connection with the Section 338(h)(10) Election. For the
purpose of making the Section 338(h)(10) Election, on or prior to the Closing
Date, Buyer and Seller each shall execute two copies of Internal Revenue
Service Form 8023 (or successor form). Buyer shall execute (or cause to be
executed) and deliver to Seller such additional documents or forms as are
reasonably requested to complete the Section 338(h)(10) Election at least ten
(10) days prior to the date such documents or forms are required to be filed.

  

  

(iv) Seller shall determine and allocate the "aggregate deemed sales price"
("ADSP") with respect to the Company Shares and/or the assets and Liabilities
of the Company Group, as applicable, in accordance with Section 338 of the
Code and the applicable Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder or
comparable provisions for state, local and foreign Tax law (the "ADSP
Allocation"). Seller shall forward a draft of the ADSP Allocation to Buyer for
Buyer's consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned. If Buyer notifies Seller of its disagreement with any items
reflected on the ADSP Allocation so provided within thirty (30) days of
receipt thereof, Seller and Buyer shall attempt to resolve the disagreement.
To the extent Seller and Buyer cannot agree within thirty (30) days after
Seller receives notice of such disagreement from Buyer, Seller and Buyer shall
jointly submit their disagreement to the Adjustment Amount Arbitrator and the
decision of the Adjustment Amount Arbitrator shall be rendered within thirty
(30) days after receipt of such joint submission and shall be final and
binding on the Parties. Seller and Buyer shall share equally the costs of
employing the Adjustment Amount Arbitrator. Buyer and Seller and their
respective Affiliates shall be bound by the Section 338(h)(10) Election and
the ADSP Allocation for all Tax purposes. Buyer and Seller shall file, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to file, all Tax Returns in a manner
consistent with the Section 338(h)(10) Election and the ADSP Allocation
(except that Buyer shall report its "adjusted grossed-up basis" taking into
account appropriate differences between that concept and ADSP under the
Section 338 regulations) and shall take no position contrary thereto unless
required to do so by applicable Law or a good faith resolution of a Tax
contest.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(h) Buyer shall not make, or cause to be made, an election under Section
338(g) of the Code and any corresponding or similar elections under state,
local or foreign Tax law with respect to the purchase of the stock of any of
the Company's foreign Subsidiaries hereunder without Seller's prior written
consent, which may be withheld in Seller's sole discretion.

  

  

(i) Seller will be entitled to any credits (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any Taxes prepaid by Seller that are Post-Closing Taxes) and refunds
(including interest received thereon) in respect of any Taxes for which Seller
has agreed to indemnify Buyer pursuant to Section 8.2(a). Buyer shall cause
such refund or the amount of such credit to be paid to Seller promptly after
it is received, allowed or applied against any Tax Liability.

  

  

(j) In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this Section 5.6, on
the one hand, and the provisions of Article VIII, on the other, the provisions
of this Section 5.6 shall control.

  

  

Section 5.7. Further Assurances. Each of the Parties agrees that, from time to
time after the Closing Date, they shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates, including, with respect to Buyer, the Company Group, to execute
and deliver such further instruments, and take (or cause their respective
Affiliates, including, with respect to Buyer, causing the Company Group, to
take) such other action, as may be reasonably necessary to carry out the
purposes and intents of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents,
including the transfer or cancellation of the domain names set forth in
Section 5.7 of the Seller Disclosure Letter; provided, that Seller and its
Affiliates shall be required only to use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the transfer of the domain name identified in item
3 in Section 5.7 of the Seller Disclosure Letter.

  

  

Section 5.8. Assumption of Obligations. From and after the Closing, the Buyer
Group agrees to cause each member of the Company Group to fully perform and
fulfill all of its obligations and commitments, whether existing as of the
Closing Date or arising or incurred thereafter.

  

  

Section 5.9. Equity Financing. Each member of the Buyer Group shall and shall
cause its Affiliates to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done all things necessary to
consummate the equity financing contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter
on the terms and conditions described therein as promptly as practicable
following the date hereof, including (i) satisfying all the conditions (and
complying with all the obligations) contemplated by the Equity Commitment
Letter to the extent such conditions (and obligations) are in such member of
the Buyer Group's or any Affiliate of such member of the Buyer Group's control
and (ii) causing the funding under the Equity Commitment Letter as soon as
practicable following the date hereof. The Buyer Group shall, as promptly as
practicable, give Seller (1) notice of any breach of the Equity Commitment
Letter by any party thereto and (2) at Seller's request, the status of the
equity financing. No member of the Buyer Group nor any of its Affiliates shall
amend, modify, terminate, assign or agree to any waiver under the Equity
Commitment Letter without the prior written consent of Seller. In the event
that all conditions to the Equity Commitment Letter have been satisfied, the
Buyer Group

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

shall cause the equity financing to be funded in full at the Closing
(including taking enforcement actions, including seeking specific performance,
to cause such funding).

  

  

Section 5.10. Employee Matters.

  

  

(a) Offers to Certain Seller Employees. Buyer shall make a written offer of
employment to (i) each individual listed on Section 5.10(a)(i) of the Seller
Disclosure Letter (each, a "Group I Seller Employee"), not later than ten (10)
Business Days following the date hereof, and (ii) each individual listed on
Section 5.10(a)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure Letter (each, a "Group II Seller
Employee" and together with Group I Seller Employee, a "Seller Employee"), not
later than thirty (30) days following the Closing Date. Each such offer of
employment shall be for (i) base salary or wages not less than the base salary
or wages provided (a) immediately prior to the Closing Date, with respect to
each Group I Seller Employee, or (b) immediately prior to the applicable
Employment End Date, with respect to each Group II Seller Employee, (ii)
incentive compensation opportunities not less than the incentive compensation
opportunities provided (a) immediately prior to the Closing Date, with respect
to each Group I Seller Employee, or (b) immediately prior to the applicable
Employment End Date, with respect to each Group II Seller Employee, and (iii)
employee benefits not less favorable in the aggregate to such Seller Employee
than those provided to each such Seller Employee (a) immediately prior to the
Closing Date, with respect to each Group I Seller Employee, or (b) immediately
prior to the applicable Employment End Date, with respect to each Group II
Seller Employee; provided, that with respect to each Seller Employee who is an
Inactive Employee as of the date hereof, such offer of employment shall be
made by Buyer (a) with respect to a Group I Seller Employee, only if such
Group I Seller Employee actually reports to employment with the Seller and is
capable of performing his or her job duties as in effect immediately prior to
the Closing or (b) with respect to a Group II Seller Employee, only if such
Group II Seller Employee actually reports to employment with Seller and is
capable of performing his or her duties as in effect immediately prior to such
individual's applicable Employment End Date, in each case with all
accommodations, in which case such offer shall be made (a) with respect to
each Group I Seller Employee, within one Business Day following the date on
which such Group I Seller Employee so reports to employment or (b) with
respect to each Group II Seller Employee, on the date that is the later of (x)
10 Business Days prior to such individual's Employment End Date or (y) one
Business Day following the date on which such Group II Seller Employee so
reports to employment. Each Seller Employee shall have until the fifth (5th)
Business Day following the date an offer of employment by Buyer is made, to
accept such offer of employment, and employment with Buyer shall commence (a)
with respect to each Group I Seller Employee, immediately following the
Closing (or, in the case of such Inactive Employees, as of the date
immediately following the date on which such employee accepts employment with
Buyer, if later) or (b) with respect to Group II Seller Employee, immediately
following the Employment End Date (or, in the case of an Inactive Employee, as
of the date immediately following the date on which such employee accepts
employment with Buyer, if later) (such date in the immediately preceding
clauses (a) and (b), as applicable, the "Employment Date"). For all purposes
consistent with applicable Law, and except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, employment of the Seller Employees (including any Inactive Employees)
from and after the Employment Date shall be deemed to have occurred with no
interruption or break in service and no termination of employment. Those
Seller Employees who

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

accept employment with Buyer along with all Company Group Employees are
referred to herein as "Buyer Employees".

  

  

(b) Compensation and Benefit Continuation. For the period commencing on the
Closing Date (or, with respect to Group II Seller Employees, the Employment
End Date) and ending on December 31, 2012 (the "Employment Period"), each
Buyer Employee shall be entitled to (and Buyer shall, or shall cause the
Company Group to, provide each Buyer Employee with): (i) base salary or wages
not less than the base salary or wages provided to each such Buyer Employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date (or, with respect to Group II Seller
Employees, the Employment End Date), (ii) cash incentive compensation
opportunities not less than the cash incentive compensation opportunities
provided to each such Buyer Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date
(or, with respect to Group II Seller Employees, the Employment End Date) and
(iii) employee benefits not less favorable in the aggregate than those to be
provided to each such Buyer Employee under (A) the employee benefit plan
documents and policies prepared, or caused to be prepared, by Seller pursuant
to Section 5.10(l), in each case as in effect on the Closing Date, (B) the
Company 401(k) Retirement Plan and (C) the employee benefit plan documents and
policies identified on Schedule C, attached hereto, as already existing on the
date hereof on a stand-alone basis for the Company.

  

  

(c) Severance. Without in any way limiting the provisions of Section 5.10(a)
or (b), Buyer agrees that any Buyer Employee whose employment with Buyer and
its Subsidiaries (including the Company Group) is terminated during the
Employment Period under circumstances that would have entitled such Buyer
Employee to severance payments and benefits under the severance plans and
arrangements applicable to such Buyer Employee immediately prior to the
Closing (the "Company Group/Seller Severance Plans") or under the severance
plans and arrangements of Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including the Company
Group) applicable to employees similarly situated to such Buyer Employee at
the time of such termination ("Buyer Severance Plans"), shall be entitled to
receive from Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including the Company Group)
severance payments and benefits that are no less favorable than the greater of
(x) such payments and benefits that would have been available to such Buyer
Employee pursuant to Company Group/Seller Severance Plans upon a termination
from employment immediately prior to the Closing and (y) such payments and
benefits that are available to similarly situated employees of the Buyer and
its Subsidiaries (including the Company Group) under the Buyer Severance Plans
at the time of such termination.

  

  

(d) Vacation. Without in any way limiting the provisions of Section 5.10(a) or
(b), during the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs (or, or in the
case of Buyer Employees who were Inactive Employees, in which the Employment
Date occurs), Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including the Company Group) shall
honor all vacation, sick and other paid-time-off days that Buyer Employees
have earned or accrued as of the Closing Date (or, in the case of Buyer
Employees who were Inactive Employees, as of the Employment Date) under
applicable plans and policies of the Company Group or Seller.

  

  

(e) Cafeteria Plans. Without in any way limiting the provisions of Section
5.10(a) or (b), as of the Closing Date, to the extent Buyer and its
Subsidiaries (including the Company Group) are not assuming or retaining any
Company Plan that is a cafeteria plan or

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

  

  

plan subject to Section 125 of the Code in which any Buyer Employee
participated immediately prior to the Closing ("Company Group/Seller 125
Plans"), Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including the Company Group) shall (i)
cause each Buyer Employee to be credited under similar plans of Buyer and its
Subsidiaries (including the Company Group) ("Buyer 125 Plans"), with a "Credit
Balance" representing the aggregate amount of an employee's payroll deductions
less the aggregate amount of disbursements, but not below zero, under each
Buyer Employee's account under the applicable Company Group/Seller 125 Plan
immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) give effect, or cause the
applicable Buyer 125 Plan to give effect, to elections made by each Buyer
Employee for the calendar year during which the Closing Date occurs under each
Company Group/Seller 125 Plan in which such Buyer Employee participates.

  

  

(f) Service Credit and Similar Matters. Buyer shall, to the greatest extent
allowable under applicable plans, cause service rendered by Buyer Employees
prior to the Closing Date to be taken into account for all purposes including
participation, coverage vesting and level of benefits, as applicable, under
all employee benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements of Buyer and
its Subsidiaries (including the Company Group) from and after the Closing
Date, to the same extent as such service was taken into account under
corresponding plans of the Company Group or Seller for such purposes;
provided, however, that nothing herein shall result in the duplication of any
benefits. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer shall, or shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause any third-party insurance carriers to, ensure that Buyer
Employees will not be subject to any preexisting condition or limitation under
any health or welfare plan of Buyer or its Subsidiaries (including the Company
Group) for any condition for which such employee would have been entitled to
coverage under the corresponding health or welfare benefit plan of the Company
Group or Seller in which such employee participated immediately prior to the
Closing Date. Buyer shall, or shall use reasonable best efforts to cause any
third-party insurance carriers to, ensure that such employees are given credit
under such plans for co-payments made, and deductibles satisfied, prior to the
Closing Date.

  

  

(g) No Third Party Beneficiary or Additional Rights/Restrictions Created.
Nothing contained herein shall be construed as (i) requiring Seller, the
Company or Buyer or any of their Affiliates to continue any Company Plan or
other employee compensation or benefit plans or arrangements, or prevent the
amendment, modification or termination thereof whether before or after the
Closing; (ii) creating any right to any compensation or benefits whatsoever on
the part of any future, present or former employee of the Company or Buyer or
any of their Affiliates; or (iii) constituting an amendment to any Company
Plan or other employee benefit or compensation plans or arrangements. Nothing
in this Section 5.10 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed to make
any employee, former employee, independent contractor of the Company Group or
Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including any beneficiary or dependent
thereof) a third party beneficiary of this Agreement or provide any of them
any rights relating hereto.

  

  

(h) Pension Plan Contribution. At the Closing, Buyer shall pay to Seller an
amount in cash equal to the Pension Plan Contribution and, from and after the
Closing, Seller shall retain all Liabilities related to or arising under the
Pension Plan and Buyer shall not have any Liability relating thereto.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(i) Treatment of Seller Parent Equity Awards. Effective immediately prior to
the Closing (or with respect to Group II Employees, the Employment End Date),
(A) all outstanding stock options and all restricted stock or restricted stock
units which vest solely based on the passage of time owned by any Buyer
Employee shall fully vest and all restrictions thereunder shall fully lapse
with respect to each such Buyer Employee and (B) all restricted stock or
restricted stock units which vest based on performance targets owned by any
Buyer Employee shall be forfeited.

  

  

(j) 2011 Cash Bonuses. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall be responsible
for, and shall pay when due, (i) the ARG 2011 Bonus Plan Retention Guaranty
and (ii) all other cash payment obligations of the Company related to the
bonuses of any and all Buyer Employees (other than bonuses, excluding the ARG
2011 Bonus Plan Retention Guaranty, payable solely as a result of consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). As described under
Section 5.10(j) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, each Seller Employee who
becomes a Buyer Employee following the Closing pursuant to this Section 5.10
shall be entitled to receive from Buyer, when bonuses in respect of 2011 are
due to such Buyer Employee, (x) the portion of such bonus that such Buyer
Employee has earned (based on the number of days elapsed during fiscal year

Employee participated in immediately prior to the Employment Date and (y) the
portion of such bonus that such Buyer Employee has earned (based on the number
of days elapsed during fiscal year 2011 following the Employment Date)
pursuant to the bonus plan that such Buyer Employee participated in
immediately after the Employment Date. As promptly as practicable, but in any
event no later than five (5) Business Days, after Buyer has (A) paid bonuses
in respect of 2011 in March of 2012 to Seller Employees who become Buyer
Employees following the Closing pursuant to this Section 5.10 and (B)
delivered reasonably detailed evidence of such payments to Seller, Seller
shall reimburse Buyer, for each such Buyer Employee, for the portion of such
bonus that such Buyer Employee has earned (based on the number of days elapsed
during fiscal year 2011 until the Employment Date) pursuant to the bonus plan
that such Buyer Employee participated in immediately prior to the Employment
Date.

  

  

(k) Transaction Bonuses. Seller shall be responsible for, and shall pay, or
cause to be paid, at the Closing, the full amount of any and all bonuses
payable to any Company Group Employee solely as result of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt,
Buyer shall be responsible for the ARG 2011 Bonus Plan Retention Guaranty.

if such summary plan descriptions are required by Law to be distributed to
participants at the Closing) and policies that are substantially comparable in
all material respects (except for changes requested or approved in writing by
or on behalf of Buyer Parent or Buyer) to Seller's employee benefit plans,
summary plan descriptions and policies in each case as listed on Section
5.10(l) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, other than those that are identified
on Section 5.10(l) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, as already existing on the
date hereof on a stand-alone basis for the Company. Buyer Parent and Buyer
shall reasonably cooperate with Seller in connection with the foregoing.

Seller and Seller Parent reasonably available to Buyer and Buyer Parent during
normal business hours, in connection with Buyer's and Buyer Parent's efforts
to prepare, or cause to be prepared, for adoption or execution by Buyer, the
Company or a Subsidiary of the Company, as the case may be, at the Closing, a
401(k) plan document that mirrors Seller's 401(k) Retirement Plan, to the
extent applicable to Buyer Employees, or an adoption agreement for a prototype
401(k) plan document that is substantially similar in all material respects to
Seller's 401(k) Retirement Plan (such plan, the "Company 401(k) Retirement
Plan").

  

  

(m) 401(k) Retirement Plan. No later than 90 days after the Closing Date,
Seller shall cause its 401(k) Retirement Plan to transfer to the Company
401(k) Retirement Plan, and Buyer agrees to cause the Company 401(k)
Retirement Plan to accept, the account balance (including promissory notes
evidencing all outstanding loans and subject to any qualified domestic
relations orders pursuant to Section 414(p) of the Code) of each Buyer
Employee under Seller's 401(k) Retirement Plan who has not elected out of such
transfer, in a direct rollover pursuant to QandA 7 of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.401(a)(31)-1; and such transfer shall be subject to Seller's prior
notice to Buyer Employees of such transfer, which notice shall comply in all
material respects with all applicable regulations with respect thereto,
including, but not limited to, Section 402(f) of the Code, 26 CFR §1.402(f)-1,

Insured Period, for so long as any such collateral is required; (B) as

Affiliates shall provide such assistance as is reasonably requested by Seller
Parent in connection therewith and shall not take any actions contrary to such
intent), and to the extent Buyer Parent, Buyer, the Company or any Subsidiary

franchisee in the United Arab Emirates ("UAE") for a period of one hundred
eighty (180) days following the Closing Date (such period, the "Arby's UAE
Rights Period"): (a) the rights and license to use the "Arby's" name and
trademarks in connection with the operation of the existing six (6)
Wendy's/Arby's dual branded restaurants in the UAE, the existing Wendy's

of itself and WAI and WAIS) to cause its UAE franchisee to (i) remove the
"Arby's" name and trademarks at or in connection with the UAE Restaurants,
comply with the De-Identification Obligations, and otherwise cease the use of
the "Arby's" name and trademarks; (ii) take any and all actions reasonably
necessary to further evidence the termination of any rights (other than
pursuant to that certain Right of First Refusal

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Agreement dated May 31, 2011 by and among Arby's Restaurant Group, Inc. and
Specialized Catering Services Establishment) that the UAE franchisee may have
had (and Seller agrees, on behalf of itself and WAI and WAIS, to take any and
all actions reasonably necessary to further evidence the termination of any
rights that they may have had) to use, license or sublicense any of the Arby's
trademarks or other Intellectual Property of the Company Group; and (iii)
cease the use of all other Intellectual Property of the Company Group at or in
connection with the UAE Restaurants (including all recipes, manuals,
confidential information and trade secrets), in all cases promptly following

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, as between Buyer

interpreted in a manner to be effective and valid to the greatest extent
permitted by applicable Law, but if any provision or term of this Section 5.19

the Company Group to waive, any conflicts that may arise in connection with
Paul, Weiss representing Seller and its Affiliates after the Closing as such
representation may relate to the Company Group or the transactions
contemplated hereby. The parties also agree that the fact that Paul, Weiss may
be deemed from time to time to have acted as legal counsel to the Company
Group prior to the Closing shall not prevent Paul, Weiss from representing
Seller or its Affiliates in connection with any matters involving this

(a) Buyer Parent and Buyer acknowledge that the Outstanding L/C's in the
respective face amounts set forth in Section 5.23 of the Seller Disclosure
Letter are outstanding as of the date of this Agreement. With respect to each
Outstanding L/C, (i) Buyer Parent and Buyer shall, or cause an Affiliate of
Buyer Parent to, cause an Acceptable Bank to issue for the benefit of each
beneficiary of such Outstanding L/C (each such beneficiary, an "Existing
Beneficiary"), effective from and after the Closing, a substitute or
replacement letter of credit (each, a "Substitute L/C") in a face amount equal
to the then undrawn amount of such Outstanding L/C, and (ii) Buyer Parent and
Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Existing Beneficiary of
each such Outstanding L/C to agree to the cancellation and termination thereof
as to all then undrawn amounts and to return the original thereof to the
issuing bank of such Outstanding L/C for such cancellation and termination
(any such Outstanding L/C the original of which has been returned and which
has been cancelled and terminated as to all undrawn amounts as contemplated by
this sentence is referred to in this Section 5.23 as a

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

61  

  

 

 

 

  

  

"Cancelled L/C"). Each Substitute L/C shall provide, among other things, that
as a condition to drawing thereunder, the Existing Beneficiary shall certify
that it has not drawn under the Outstanding L/C in respect of which such
Substitute L/C shall have been issued from and after the date of issuance of
such Substitute L/C. Buyer shall cause the Company to reimburse the account
party of each Substitute L/C for (x) all out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred by such account party relating to the issuance of such Substitute L/C
and causing such Substitute L/C to remain outstanding promptly after such
costs and expenses are incurred, and (y) all amounts drawn down under such
Substitute L/C by the Existing Beneficiary thereof promptly after such amounts
are drawn down by such Existing Beneficiary. Seller shall bear all of its own
costs and expenses relating to the return and cancellation of the Cancelled
L/C's. Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer and Buyer Parent in
connection with any actions required to be taken by Buyer or Buyer Parent in
connection with the matters described in clause (ii) of the second sentence of
this Section 5.23(a).

  

  

(b) Seller and Buyer shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
enter into prior to the Closing an Assumption and Loss Allocation Agreement
with Pacific Employer on terms reasonably acceptable to each of Seller and
Buyer. Buyer and Seller agree that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in the Assumption and Loss Allocation Agreement, each of Buyer and
Seller shall be responsible for 50% of the administrative fee payable pursuant
to Section 4(b) of the Assumption and Loss Allocation Agreement. Buyer shall
use its reasonable best efforts to enter into prior to the Closing an
Indemnity Agreement with Liberty Mutual Insurance Company and certain of its
Affiliates on terms reasonably acceptable to Buyer. On or prior to the Closing
Date, Buyer Parent or Buyer shall, or cause an Affiliate of Buyer Parent to,
cause the Acceptable Bank to issue for the benefit of Safeco Insurance Company
a standby letter of credit in a face amount equal to $ 1,000,000 as
contemplated by note 3 in Section 5.23 of the Seller Disclosure Letter. If
Buyer, Seller and Pacific Employers do not enter into the Assumption and Loss
Allocation Agreement as contemplated by this Section 5.23(b), then Buyer or
Buyer Parent shall, or cause an Affiliate of Buyer Parent to, either (i) cause
an Acceptable Bank to issue a Substitute L/C in respect of the letter of
credit no. 68030699 in face amount that is then attributable solely to the
obligations and liability of the members of the Company Group as contemplated
by Section 5.23(a) or (ii) cause an Acceptable Bank to issue a Standby L/C for
the benefit of Seller (or any Affiliate of Seller designated by Seller on or
prior to the Closing Date) in face amount of Four Million Three Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($4,300,000).

  

  

(c) From and after the Closing Date, with respect to each Outstanding L/C the
Existing Beneficiary of which has received and accepted a Substitute L/C prior
to the Closing Date, but has not returned the original Outstanding L/C to the
issuing bank of such Outstanding L/C for cancellation and termination as to
all then undrawn amounts on or prior to the Closing Date (any such Outstanding
L/C, a "Duplicate L/C"), Buyer shall cause the Company to reimburse Seller for
all amounts, if any, drawn down under such Duplicate L/C after the Closing
Date by the Existing Beneficiary thereof promptly after such amounts are drawn
down by such Existing Beneficiary. Nothing contained herein and no such
reimbursement by the Company or Buyer under this Section 5.23(c) shall be
deemed to waive or release any claim that Buyer or the Company has or may have
against any Existing Beneficiary or issuing bank in connection with any
Duplicate L/C.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

62  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(d) On the Closing Date, with respect to each Outstanding L/C that is neither
a Cancelled L/C nor a Duplicate L/C (a "Remaining L/C"), Buyer Parent or Buyer
shall, or cause an Affiliate of Buyer Parent to, cause an Acceptable Bank to
issue for the benefit of Seller (or any Affiliate of Seller designated by
Seller on or prior to Closing Date) a standby letter of credit (a "Standby
L/C") in a face amount equal to the undrawn amount of each such Remaining L/C.
Each Standby L/C shall be a multiple draw letter of credit, have a termination
date no earlier than the latest termination date in the applicable Remaining
L/C and provide that (i) it may be drawn upon from time to time by Seller (or
any Affiliate of Seller designated by Seller on or prior to the Closing Date)
(x) if, and when, such Remaining L/C is drawn on by an Existing Beneficiary
(which at the time of such drawing continues to be a Remaining L/C) and (y) in
each case, in an amount equal to the amount drawn upon by the Existing
Beneficiaries and (ii) its aggregate face amount shall be reduced by the
outstanding undrawn amount of the applicable Remaining L/C that becomes a
Cancelled L/C or Duplicate L/C after the Closing Date (without duplication of
the reduction resulting from a drawing in respect of such Remaining L/C) and
be in a form and on terms reasonably acceptable to Seller. Buyer shall cause
the Company to reimburse the applicant of each Standby L/C for (x) all out-of-
pocket costs and expenses incurred by such applicant relating to the issuance
of such Standby L/C and causing such Standby L/C to remain outstanding
promptly after such costs and expenses are incurred, and (y) all amounts drawn
down on such Standby L/C by Seller (or any Affiliate of Seller designated by
Seller on or prior to Closing Date) promptly after such amounts are drawn down
by such Substitute L/C.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) in no
event shall Buyer Parent or Buyer have any obligation to cause to be issued
both a Substitute L/C and a Standby L/C with respect to the same Outstanding
L/C, and (ii) neither Seller nor any of Seller's affiliates shall have any
obligation to extend the termination date of any Outstanding L/C or renew any
Outstanding L/C beyond the current stated maturity or termination date of such
Outstanding L/C.

two separate leases for office space at such location substantially in
accordance with the terms and descriptions set forth in Section 5.24 of the
Seller Disclosure Letter, with one such separate lease to be signed by the

District Partner Plans as of the Closing Date in respect of contributions made
by such Persons prior to the Closing Date (disregarding withdrawals made in

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

63  

  

 

 

 

  

  

connection with contributions to plans that are substantially similar to the
ARG Operating Partner and District Partner Plans or other funded plans) shall
exceed One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), then Seller shall, as promptly as
reasonably practicable following its receipt of reasonable documentation
evidencing such withdrawals from Buyer Parent (which documentation shall be
delivered to Seller not later than ten (10) Business Days after the end of the
Withdrawal Measurement Period), pay to Buyer Parent an amount in cash equal to
fifty percent (50%) of the amount by which the amount of such aggregate
withdrawals under the ARG Operating Partner and District Partner Plans during
the Withdrawal Measurement Period exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000);
provided, that in no event shall Seller be required to pay to Buyer Parent in
excess of fifty percent (50%) of the Company Group's liabilities as of the
Closing calculated in accordance with the Accounting Methodology in respect of
the ARG Operating Partner and District Partner Plans as of the Closing under
this Section 5.25.

ARTICLE VII.

  

  

LIMITATIONS

  

  

Section 7.1. Remedies. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, (a) each Party recognizes and acknowledges that a breach by it of
any covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement will cause the other
Parties to sustain irreparable harm for which it would not have an adequate
remedy at Law, and therefore in the event of any such breach the aggrieved
Party shall, without the posting of bond or other security (any requirement
for which the Parties hereby waive), be entitled to the remedy of specific
performance of such covenants and agreements, including consummation of the
Closing and specific performance of the Buyer Group's and their Affiliates'
obligation to cause the equity financing under the Equity Commitment Letter to
be funded, and injunctive and other equitable relief, in addition to any

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

66  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

other remedy to which it might be entitled, (b) a Party shall be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and (c) in
the event that any action is brought in equity to enforce the provisions of
this Agreement, no Party will allege, and each Party hereby waives the defense
or counterclaim, that there is an adequate remedy at law. Each Party hereto
agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that (a) the other Party
has an adequate remedy at Law or (b) an award of specific performance is not
an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity.

  

  

Section 7.2. Environmental Waiver and Release. From and after the Closing,
except to the extent provided under Article VIII, all rights or remedies that
the Buyer Group may have against Seller and each of its respective employees,
directors, partners, agents, representatives, managers and officers
(collectively, the "Seller Parties") at or under Environmental Laws or with
respect to any Environmental Liabilities or any other environmental matters
relating to the Company Group or any currently or formerly Owned Real Property
are waived.

  

  

  

ARTICLE VIII.

  

  

SURVIVAL, INDEMNIFICATION AND REMEDIES

  

  

Section 8.1. Survival. (a) Each and every representation and warranty of
Seller and the Buyer Group contained in this Agreement and in any certificate
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive for a period of twelve (12)
months following the Closing; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, (i) the Surviving Representations shall survive the Closing
indefinitely, (ii) the representations and warranties set forth in Section
3.13 and Section 3.20 shall survive the Closing for a period of thirty-six
(36) months following the Closing Date, and (iii) the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 3.10 (the "Tax Representations") shall survive
the Closing until the date that is sixty (60) days following the expiration of
the applicable statutes of limitations, and (b) subject to the proviso at the
end of this Section 8.1, none of Seller or any of its Affiliates, or any
member of the Buyer Group or any of its Affiliates shall have any Liability
whatsoever with respect to any such representations or warranties after the
expiration thereof. Subject to Section 5.6(e) and Section 8.2(a)(vi), each and
every covenant contained in this Agreement (other than the covenants which by
their terms are to be performed by the Parties (or, with respect to Section
5.16, Seller Parent) following the Closing (collectively, the "Surviving
Covenants")) shall expire with the consummation of the sale of the Company
Shares and shall not survive the Closing; and none of Seller or any of its
Affiliates, or any member of the Buyer Group or any of its Affiliates shall
have any Liability whatsoever with respect to any such covenant thereafter.
The Surviving Covenants shall survive the Closing Date until, and shall expire
when, in each case, the applicable statute of limitations has expired and none
of Seller or any of its Affiliates, or any member of the Buyer Group or any of
its Affiliates shall have any Liability whatsoever with respect to any such
Surviving Covenant thereafter; provided, that any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement that would otherwise terminate in accordance with this
Section 8.1 shall, if a Claim Notice or Indemnity Notice (as applicable) shall
have been timely given under Section 8.3 on or prior to such termination date,
continue to survive until the related claim for indemnification has been
satisfied or otherwise resolved as provided in Section 8.3.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

67  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 8.2. Indemnification.

  

  

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this Article VIII, from and after the
Closing, Seller shall indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties in respect of,
and hold each of them harmless from and against, any and all Damages suffered,
incurred or sustained by any of them to the extent resulting from, arising out
of or relating to: (i) any breach of any representations and warranties made
by Seller in this Agreement; (ii) any nonfulfillment of or failure to perform
any Surviving Covenant on the part of Seller (or, with respect to Section
5.16, Seller Parent) contained in this Agreement; (iii) the Excluded
Restaurants or the Winthrop Lease Agreement; (iv) all Pre-Closing Taxes (or
the nonpayment thereof), including the Pre-Closing Taxes due in respect of any
Straddle Periods, and all income Taxes for a pre-Closing period (or for the
pre-Closing portion of any Straddle Period) of any member of an affiliated,
consolidated, combined or unitary group of which the Company or any Subsidiary
thereof (or predecessor thereof) is or was a member on or prior to the Closing
Date, including pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any
analogous or similar provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law); (v) any
liability relating to, resulting from or arising out of Indebtedness or the
Company Transaction Expenses, in each case to the extent not repaid or paid
prior to or at the Closing; and (vi) any matters set forth on Section
8.2(a)(vi) of the Seller Disclosure Letter.

  

  

(b) Subject to the other provisions of this Article VIII, from and after the
Closing, Buyer Parent and Buyer, jointly and severally, shall (i) indemnify
the Seller Indemnified Parties in respect of, and hold each of them harmless
from and against, any and all Damages suffered, incurred or sustained by any
of them resulting from, arising out of or relating to any breach of any
representations and warranties made by the Buyer Group or nonfulfillment of or
failure to perform any Surviving Covenant on the part of the Buyer Group
contained in this Agreement and (ii) without limitation to any of the
provisions of Section 5.23, indemnify, hold harmless and defend Seller and
each of its Affiliates and each of their respective partners, shareholders,
members, officers, directors, employees, managers, agents and representatives
and each of the heirs, executors, successors and assigns of any of the
foregoing from, against and in respect of any and all claims, Liabilities,
obligations, actions, suits, proceedings, losses, costs, expenses, penalties,
fines and other judgments (at equity or at law) and damages whenever arising
or incurred (including, without limitation, amounts paid in settlement, costs
of investigation and preparation and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses)
incurred by any such Persons in connection with any drawing down of any
Duplicate L/C or any inability to draw down upon, or other unavailability of,
any Standby L/C as contemplated by Section 5.23(d); provided, that nothing
contained in this Section 8.2(b)(ii) and no payment of any such Damages by
Buyer Parent or Buyer shall be deemed to waive or release any claim which
Buyer Parent, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates has or may have
against any issuing bank or any Existing Beneficiary in respect of any
Duplicate L/C or any Standby L/C.

  

  

(c) No amounts of indemnity shall be payable in the case of a claim by a Buyer
Indemnified Party under Section 8.2(a)(i) for breaches of representations and
warranties unless and until the Buyer Indemnified Parties have suffered,
incurred or sustained otherwise indemnifiable Damages referred to in Section
8.2(a)(i) (after giving effect to the any Indemnity Reduction Amounts) in
excess of Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) in the aggregate (the
"Deductible"), in which event the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled
to claim indemnity for Damages only to the extent such Damages exceed the
Deductible; provided, that the

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

68  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Deductible shall not apply to breaches of the Surviving Representations or the
Tax Representations, including for purposes of determining whether the
Deductible has been satisfied. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Seller shall not be liable with respect to any individual claim
arising out of or relating to matters described in Section 8.2(a)(i) that
results in otherwise indemnifiable Damages (after giving effect to any
Indemnity Reduction Amounts) of Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000) or less
(and such Damages shall not be counted toward satisfaction of the Deductible).

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the amounts paid by
Seller for indemnification of Damages under this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.2(a)(i) shall be limited to, in the aggregate, an amount equal to Twelve
Million Dollars ($12,000,000) (the "Cap"); provided, that the Cap shall not
apply to breaches of the Surviving Representations or the Tax Representations,
including for purposes of determining whether the Cap has been satisfied.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the amounts paid by
Seller for indemnification of Damages under this Agreement pursuant to this
Article VIII shall be limited to, in the aggregate, an amount equal to the
Purchase Price.

  

  

(f) The amount which an Indemnifying Party is or may be required to pay to an
Indemnified Party in respect of Damages for which indemnification is provided
under this Agreement shall be reduced by any amounts actually received
(including amounts received under insurance polices) by or on behalf of any
Indemnified Party from third parties, net of all deductible amounts and other
costs and expenses of collection (such amounts and benefits are collectively
referred to herein as "Indemnity Reduction Amounts"). If any member of the
Company Group or Indemnified Party receives any Indemnity Reduction Amounts in
respect of a claim for which indemnification is provided under this Agreement
after the full amount of such claim has been paid by an Indemnifying Party or
after an Indemnifying Party has made a partial payment of such claim and such
Indemnity Reduction Amounts exceed the remaining unpaid balance of such claim,
then the Indemnified Party shall promptly remit to the Indemnifying Party an
amount equal to the excess (if any) of (i) the amount theretofore paid by the
Indemnifying Party in respect of such claim, less (ii) the amount of the
indemnity payment that would have been due if such Indemnity Reduction Amounts
in respect thereof had been received before the indemnity payment was made. An
insurer or other third party who would otherwise be obligated to pay any claim
shall not be relieved of the responsibility with respect thereto or, solely by
virtue of the indemnification provisions hereof, have any subrogation rights
with respect thereto, it being expressly understood and agreed that no insurer
or any other third party shall be entitled to any benefit they would not be
entitled to receive in the absence of the indemnification provisions by virtue
of the indemnification provisions hereof. Each of Seller and Buyer, as
appropriate, shall, or shall cause each Indemnified Party to, use its
reasonable best efforts to pursue promptly any claims or rights it may have
against all third parties which would reduce the amount of Damages for which
indemnification is provided under this Agreement and use reasonable best
efforts to mitigate damages.

  

  

(g) Seller, Buyer and Buyer Parent shall satisfy any or all amounts of
indemnity payable under this Article VIII in cash.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

69  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 8.3. Method of Asserting Claims. All claims for indemnification by any
Indemnified Party under Section 8.2 will be asserted and resolved as follows:

  

  

(a) In the event any claim or demand in respect of which an Indemnified Party
might seek indemnity under Section 8.2 is asserted against or sought to be
collected from such Indemnified Party by a Person other than a Party hereto or
any of its Affiliates (a "Third Party Claim"), then such Indemnified Party
shall deliver a Claim Notice promptly to the Indemnifying Party in accordance
with paragraph (b) below. In case any such action is brought against an
Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in
and, subject to such Indemnifying Party confirming that it is fully
responsible for any Damages arising from such action (subject, in all cases,
to the limitations on indemnification obligations in this Article VIII), to
assume and control the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory
to such Indemnified Party, and after notice from the Indemnifying Party to
such Indemnified Party of its election so to assume the defense thereof;
provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not have any right to
assume the defense of any Third Party Claim to the extent (x) such Third Party
Claim would reasonably be expected to result in criminal Liability of,
equitable remedies against, or any judgment or term that in any manner
adversely affects, restrains or interferes with, in any material respect, the
business of, the Indemnified Party or any of the Indemnified Party's
Affiliates, or (y) the Indemnified Party reasonably believes (based on the
advice of outside counsel) that the interests of the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim are in conflict
with one another, and as a result, the Indemnifying Party could not adequately
represent the interests of the Indemnified Party in such Third Party Claim. If
the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any such Third Party Claim as
permitted hereunder, then the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such
Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the
latter in connection with the defense of such Third Party Claim; provided,
that the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at the Indemnified
Party's expense. If the Indemnifying Party does not elect to assume the
defense of a Third Party Claim, it shall not be obligated to pay the fees and
expenses of more than one counsel for the Indemnified Parties with respect to
such Third Party Claim, unless the Indemnified Parties shall have been advised
by outside counsel that representation of any such Indemnified Parties by the
same counsel would be inappropriate under applicable standards of professional
conduct due to actual or potential differing interests between them, in which
case such Indemnified Parties shall have the right to select one separate
counsel the fees and expenses of which shall be paid by the Indemnifying
Party. No Indemnifying Party shall consent to entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement of any Third Party Claim of which it has assumed the
defense hereunder without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party,
which prior written consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed; provided, that such prior written consent shall not be required if
(i) the settlement agreement contains a complete and unconditional general
release by the third party asserting the claim to all Indemnified Parties
affected by the claim, (ii) the settlement is for money damages only and (iii)
the settlement agreement does not contain any admission of any wrongdoing or
Liability on behalf of the Indemnified Party. No Indemnifying Party shall be
subject to any Liability for any settlement of a Third Party Claim made
without its prior written consent.

  

  

(b) In the event of any claim or demand, including Third Party Claims, in
respect of which an Indemnified Party might seek indemnity hereunder, the
Indemnified Party

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

70  

  

 

 

 

  

  

shall deliver an Indemnity Notice promptly to the Indemnifying Party;
provided, that the failure by any Indemnified Party to give the Indemnity
Notice shall not impair such party's rights hereunder except to the extent
that an Indemnifying Party has been prejudiced thereby, and then only to the
extent of such prejudice. The Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified
Party within the thirty (30) day period following its receipt of such
Indemnity Notice (the "Dispute Period") as to whether the Indemnifying Party
disputes its Liability to the Indemnified Party hereunder. If the Indemnifying
Party notifies the Indemnified Party that it does not dispute the claim
described in such Indemnity Notice, or fails to notify the Indemnified Party
within the Dispute Period whether the Indemnifying Party disputes the claim
described in such Indemnity Notice, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to
be liable hereunder for indemnifying the Indemnified Party in respect of such
claim, subject to the other provisions of this Article VIII, up to the amount
of Damages specified in the Indemnity Notice, when such Damages have been
finally determined. If the Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its
Liability with respect to such claim, the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of
such dispute.

  

  

(c) The Parties shall cooperate with one another with respect to resolving any
claim or Liability with respect to which one Party is obligated to provide
indemnification hereunder.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, any amounts payable
pursuant to the indemnification obligations under this Agreement shall be paid
without duplication, and in no event shall any Party be indemnified under
different provisions of this Agreement for the same Damages.

  

  

Section 8.4. Remedies. Subject to Section 7.1, from and after the Closing, the
remedies set forth in Article VIII shall be the sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to any and all claims (in law or equity and whether based on contract,
tort or any other theory of law) relating, directly or indirectly, to the
subject matter of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing and subject to Section 7.1 and Article VIII, Buyer and Seller hereby
waive, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all
rights, claims and causes of action it or any of their respective Affiliates
may have against the other Party or any of its Affiliates with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement, whether arising under or based upon any Law.

  

  

Section 8.5. Tax Characterization. The Parties agree to treat any indemnity
payment made pursuant to this Agreement, any payment made pursuant to Section
2.3 and any payment from Seller to Buyer made pursuant to Section 5.10(j) as
an adjustment to the Purchase Price, unless otherwise required by a change in
applicable Law or a good faith resolution of a Tax contest.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

71  

  

 

 

 

  

  

ARTICLE IX.

  

  

TERMINATION

  

  

Section 9.1. Termination Events. Without prejudice to other remedies which may
be available to the Parties by Law or this Agreement, this Agreement may be
terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any
time prior to the Closing:

  

  

(a) by mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer;

  

  

(b) by either Seller or Buyer by giving written notice to the other Party if
the Closing shall not have occurred by December 10, 2011, unless extended by
written agreement of Seller and Buyer; provided, that a Party shall not be
permitted to terminate pursuant to this subsection (b) if such Party is in
default or breach hereunder; provided, further, that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this subsection (b) shall not be available to any Party
whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the
cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before
such date;

  

  

(c) by either the Seller or Buyer by giving written notice to the other if
such other Party has breached its covenants, agreements or other obligations
hereunder in a manner that would reasonably be expected to cause any condition
of such Party giving notice set forth in this Section 9.1(c) not to be
satisfied and, except in the case of a breach of Buyer's obligation to pay the
Purchase Price in accordance with the terms of Article II, such breach has not
been cured within thirty (30) days following written notification thereof by
the Party seeking termination hereunder; or

  

  

(d) by either Seller or Buyer by giving written notice to the other if any
Governmental Authority with competent jurisdiction shall have issued an order,
decree or ruling or taken any other Action permanently restraining, enjoining
or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and such order, decree, ruling or other Action
shall not be subject to appeal or shall have become final and unappealable;
provided, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this subsection (d)
shall not be available to any Party whose breach (or whose Affiliates' breach)
of this Agreement has resulted in such order, decree, ruling or other Action.

  

  

Section 9.2. Effect of Termination. In the event of any termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1, all rights and obligations of the Parties
hereunder shall terminate without any Liability on the part of any Party or
their Subsidiaries and Affiliates in respect thereof, except that (i)
provisions of, and the obligations of the Buyer Group and Seller under,
Section 5.2(a), Section 5.2(b), Section 5.5, and Article X of this Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect and (ii) such termination shall not
relieve any Party of any Liability for any willful and intentional breach of

Section 10.5. Disclosure Letters.

  

  

(a) The Disclosure Letters attached hereto are hereby incorporated herein by
reference and made a part hereof. Any matter that is disclosed pursuant to any
Section of the Disclosure Letters or in the Company Financial Statements in
such a way as to make reasonably apparent its relevance or applicability to
any representation or warranty made elsewhere in this Agreement or to the
information called for by any other Section of the Disclosure Letters shall be
deemed to be an exception to such representation or warranty and to be
disclosed with respect to all such Sections of the Disclosure Letters,
notwithstanding the omission of a reference or cross-reference thereto.

  

  

(b) Neither the specification of any dollar amount in any representation nor
the mere inclusion of any item in any Section of either of the Disclosure
Letters as an exception to a representation or warranty shall be deemed an
admission by a Party that such item represents a material fact, event or
circumstance or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect or a Buyer Material Adverse Effect, as applicable.

  

  

Section 10.6. Headings. The table of contents and section headings contained
in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not be deemed a
part of this Agreement or affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement.

  

  

Section 10.7. Construction. The Parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of
any of the provisions of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 10.8. No Other Representations or Warranties. Except for the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in Article III of this
Agreement, the Buyer Group acknowledges that none of Seller or any of its
respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates or any other Person makes any
representation or warranty, express or implied, at law or in equity, with
respect to Seller, the Company Group, the Company Shares, the Business or any
of the assets or Liabilities of the Company Group and its Affiliates, or with
respect to any other information provided to the Buyer Group, whether on
behalf of Seller, the Company or such other Persons, including as to the
probable success or profitability of the Business after the Closing. Neither
Seller nor any of its Affiliates or representatives shall have or be subject
to any Liability or indemnification obligation to the Buyer Group or any other
Person resulting from the distribution to the Buyer Group, or the Buyer
Group's use of, any such information, including the confidential information
memorandum, related to the Business, and any information, document or material
made available to the Buyer Group in certain "data rooms," management
presentations or in any other form in expectation or contemplation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

Section 10.9. Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Disclosure
Letters), the Transaction Documents and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and thereof and supersede

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

75  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

any prior understandings, negotiations, agreements, or representations among
the Parties of any nature, whether written or oral, to the extent they relate
in any way to the subject matter hereof or thereof.

  

  

Section 10.10. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be
declared by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, void
or unenforceable in any respect, all other provisions of this Agreement, or
the application of such provision to Persons or circumstances other than those
as to which it has been held invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable, shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect and will in no way be affected,
impaired or invalidated thereby. Upon such determination that any provision,
or the application of any such provision, is invalid, illegal, void or
unenforceable, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as
possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable
manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to
the greatest extent possible. Notwithstanding anything contained herein, under
no circumstance shall the obligation of Seller to deliver the Company Shares
be enforceable absent enforceability of the obligation of Buyer to pay the
Purchase Price, and vice versa.

  

  

Section 10.11. Expenses. Unless otherwise provided herein, including as
provided in Section 2.2, (a) each of the Buyer Group and Seller agrees to pay,
without right of reimbursement from the other, all costs and expenses incurred
by it incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder, including the
fees and disbursements of counsel, accountants, financial advisors, experts
and consultants employed by the respective Parties in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, whether or not the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement are consummated, and (b) at the Closing, Seller shall pay
the fees, costs and expenses of each member of the Company Group incurred in
connection with the negotiation and the preparation of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the extent
not paid prior to the Closing, including, but not limited to, fees and
disbursements of counsel, accountants, financial advisors, experts,
consultants and other advisors and service providers, and management agreement
termination fees and any amounts owed by any member of the Company Group to
Seller or Seller Parent (collectively, "Company Transaction Expenses").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, (x) the out-of-
pocket costs incurred by Seller or any member of the Company Group prior to
the Closing in obtaining any license, consent, waiver, clearance or approval
from or of a Third Party (other than any Governmental Authority) necessary for
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Transition
Services Agreement shall be borne (i) 50% by the Buyer Group and 50% by Seller
for the amount of such costs incurred as set forth under Section 10.11 of the
Seller Disclosure Letter and (ii) 100% by Seller for all costs in excess of
such amount, and (y) the Buyer Group shall be responsible for 100% of the
documented costs of Mercer LLC and Mercer HR Services, LLC in connection with
the creation of stand-alone benefit plans for the Business.

  

  

Section 10.12. Governing Law. This Agreement and all claims arising out of or
relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
governed by the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the conflicts
of law principles that would result in the application of any Law other than
the Law of the State of Delaware.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

76  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 10.13. Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

  

  

(a) Each of the Parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the federal courts of the United States of America located in the State of
Delaware and the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware for the purposes
of any suit, Action or other proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby (and agrees not to commence
any Action, suit or proceeding relating hereto except in such courts). Each of
the Parties further agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or
document hand delivered or sent by U.S. registered mail to such Party's
respective address set forth in Section 10.3 will be effective service of
process for any Action, suit or proceeding in Delaware with respect to any
matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction as set forth in the
immediately preceding sentence. Each of the Parties irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any Action,
suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby in the federal courts of the United States of
America located in the State of Delaware and the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware, and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives
and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such Action, suit
or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party agrees that a final judgment
in any Action or proceeding so brought shall be conclusive and may be enforced
by suit on the judgment in any jurisdiction or in any other manner provided in
law or in equity.

  

  

(b) EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS
DOCUMENTS, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF
THE PARTIES IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT
HEREOF OR THEREOF.

  

  

Section 10.14. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, any of which might be delivered via facsimile or PDF, each of
which shall be deemed an original but all of which together will constitute
one and the same instrument.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be
