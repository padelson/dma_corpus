related matters in the possession of Seller (collectively the "Records");
provided, however, that Seller has the rights with respect to such Records as

---|--- 

 

1.3Effective Date

 

. Ownership of the Assets shall be transferred from Seller to Purchaser at
the Closing (as defined below), but shall be effective as provided in Section
2.4 below as of 7:00 a.m. (local time where the Assets are located) on June 1,
2017, (the "Effective Date"). Except to the extent accounted for in
adjustments to the Purchase Price under Section 2.4 and subject to the
provisions herein, Seller shall be entitled to any amounts realized from and
accruing to the Assets (including contract rights, gas contract settlements,
take-or-pay claims, and other claims and causes of action) for all periods
prior to the Effective Date and shall be liable for the payment of all
Property Costs incurred by Seller prior to the Closing and attributable to
periods prior to the Effective Date. Except to the extent accounted for in
adjustments to the Purchase Price under Section 2.4 and subject to the
provisions herein, Purchaser shall be entitled to any amounts realized from
and accruing to the Assets for all periods on and after the Effective Date,
and shall be liable for the payment of all expenses relating to the Assets and

1.4Gauging and Strapping

 

. Seller has caused the oil storage facilities on or utilized in connection
with the Properties to be gauged or strapped as of the Effective Date for
those Properties for which a Seller serves as operator. Seller also has
caused the gas production meter charts (or if such do not exist, the sales
meter charts) on the pipelines transporting gas production from the Assets to
be read as of the Effective Date for those Properties for which a Seller
serves as operator. Prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall be provided with
access to the records of the gauging, strapping or chart reading for the
purpose of verifying such records. For those Properties not operated by a
Seller, applicable state regulatory agency production reports or records shall
be used to determine the amount of oil in storage or gas existing in the
pipeline as of the Effective Date. If such state records or reports are not
available or sufficient, Seller's reasonable estimate based on historical data
shall be used.

 

1.5Records

 

. Seller shall deliver to Purchaser, within thirty (30) days after the
Closing or such later time as Purchaser may request, but in no event later
than ninety (90) days after the Closing, all Records, including in electronic
form where available. Seller shall have the right to

   

make and retain such copies of the Records as Seller may desire prior to the
delivery of the Records to Purchaser. Purchaser, for a period of three (3)
years after the Closing, shall further make available to Seller (at the
location of such Records in Purchaser's organization) access to the Records
during normal business hours, upon written request of Seller, and Seller shall
have the right to copy at its own expense and retain such copies of the
Records. If, however, Purchaser elects to destroy any of the Records, either
before or after the expiration of such three (3) year period, Purchaser shall
give to Seller written notice of such intent at least thirty (30) days prior
to such destruction, and Seller shall have the option, at its expense, of
having such Records delivered to them. This obligation shall be an obligation
running with the land, and Purchaser shall include the obligations set forth
in this Section 1.5 as an obligation of any subsequent purchaser of any of the
Properties in the applicable purchase and sale agreement with, and/or
assignment to, such subsequent purchaser. Except as expressly provided in
this Agreement or in the General Assignment, Seller makes no representation or
warranty, and expressly disclaims all representations and warranties as to the
accuracy or completeness of the Records that it may provide or disclose to
Purchaser.

to or death of persons or loss or destruction of or damage to property,
relating in any way to the Assets that occurred prior to the Effective Date;
provided, however, that no such claim may be settled, compromised, or
otherwise resolved in a manner that results in an obligation borne by
Purchaser or the Assets on and after the Effective Date without the prior
written consent of Purchaser, which shall not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed; (v) all exchange traded futures contracts and over-the-counter
derivative contracts of Seller as to which Seller has an open position as of
the Effective Date; (vi) any and all rights to use Seller's names, marks,
trade dress or insignia, or to use the name of Seller, and all of Seller's
intellectual property, including, without limitation, proprietary or licensed
computer software; patents; trade secrets; copyrights; geological and
geophysical information and data (including, without limitation, conventional
2-D and 3-D seismic data) licensed from third persons, and Seller's

2.SALE AND PURCHASE

 

2.1Purchase and Sale

 

. At the Closing, Seller shall sell, assign, transfer, and convey to
Purchaser, and Purchaser shall purchase and pay for, the Assets, and Purchaser
shall also assume the Assumed Obligations as set forth in Section 13.3.1.

 

2.2Purchase Price

 

. The purchase price to be paid by Purchaser to Seller with respect to the
Assets shall be One Hundred Seventy Million Dollars U.S. ($170,000,000) (the
"Purchase Price"), subject to the adjustments provided in Section 2.4. The
amount of the Purchase Price has been agreed to taking into account, among
other factors, the perceived value of the Assets and Purchaser's assumption of
the Assumed Obligations as set forth in Section 13.3.1.

 

    

2.2.1

 |  

Additional Consideration 

---|--- 

 

. For each Month during, and including, the period of January 1, 2018 through
December 31, 2020, if (i) the produced volumes of oil production attributable
to Purchaser's Net Revenue Interest in the Assets (the "Purchaser's Actual
Production") for such Month are greater than the volumes of oil production
from the Assets that are subject to a Hedge Contract (the "Hedged Production")
for such Month and (ii) the average sale price for the Purchaser's Actual
Production for such Month (net of any amounts payable as severance, sales,
excise and other production-related Taxes, transportation costs and
differential) is greater than the price received by Purchaser in respect of
the Hedged Production for such Month, Purchaser shall pay Seller (x) the
difference between the Purchaser's Actual Production for such Month and the
Hedged Production for such Month, multiplied by (y) the difference between the
average sale price for the Purchaser's Actual Production for such Month (net
of any amounts payable as severance, sales, excise and other production-
related Taxes, transportation costs and differential) and the price received
by Purchaser in respect of the Hedged Production for such Month, multiplied by
(z) thirty percent (30%) (the "Additional Consideration"); provided, however,
that notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, in no event
shall Purchaser be obligated to pay to Seller any amounts hereunder in respect
of Additional Consideration in excess of an aggregate Seventeen Million
Dollars ($17,000,000). The Additional Consideration shall be a part of the
purchase price for the Assets. Purchaser shall settle the amount of
Additional Consideration due on a quarterly basis and shall deliver to Seller
all amounts in respect of Additional Consideration owed for a calendar quarter
not later than sixty (60) days after the end of the applicable calendar
quarter. 

   

2.3Performance Deposit

 

. As evidence of good faith intentions to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, Purchaser shall tender to JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A. (the
"Escrow Agent") a cash performance deposit in the amount of seven percent (7%)
of the Purchase Price, said amount being Eleven Million Nine Hundred Thousand
Dollars U.S. ($11,900,00) (the "Performance Deposit") on the date this
Agreement is executed. If this Agreement is terminated by Seller pursuant to
Section 15.1.2, the Parties shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to release
the Performance Deposit to Seller as liquidated damages representing Seller's
sole remedy for Purchaser's failure to consummate the transaction contemplated
herein (without waiving any indemnification obligation of Purchaser). The
Parties agree that the Performance Deposit is a reasonable sum considering all
the circumstances existing on the date of this Agreement, including the
relationship of the sum to the range of harm to Seller that reasonably could
be anticipated and the anticipation that proof of actual damages would be
costly or inconvenient. If this Agreement is terminated for any reason other
than Section 15.1.2, the Parties shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to
release the Performance Deposit to Purchaser. In the event the transactions
contemplated herein close, the Performance Deposit and any interest and/or
income accumulated thereon shall be credited against the Purchase Price
payable by Purchaser hereunder. 

 

2.4Determination of Adjusted Purchase Price

Section 1060 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "IRC" or

contemplated by this Agreement. Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate in
preparing a schedule that allocates the purchase price (as determined for U.S.
federal income Tax purposes) among the Assets in accordance with Section 1060
of the Code (the "Tax Allocation Schedule"). Purchaser shall prepare and
deliver to Seller an initial draft of the Tax Allocation Schedule within
thirty (30) days after the final adjustment to the purchase price under this
Agreement. Seller and Purchaser shall then cooperate to prepare a final Tax
Allocation Schedule within thirty (30) days after delivery of the initial
draft of such schedule. Except as may otherwise be required by the IRC and
regulations thereunder or other Applicable Laws, Seller and Purchaser agree
(i) that any required Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 ("Form 8594") (or
similar form under state, local or foreign Tax law) shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with the final Tax Allocation Schedule and (ii) not to
assert, in connection with any Tax return, Tax audit, or similar proceeding,
any allocation of the purchase price that differs from the final Tax
Allocation Schedule. Each Party agrees to promptly notify the other Party
regarding the existence of any Tax audit or similar proceeding related to the
allocation described in this Section 2.6 and, to the extent there is a
challenge to the Tax Allocation Schedule in any Tax audit or similar
proceeding, a party may adopt an allocation that is inconsistent with the Tax
Allocation Schedule if to do so is necessary to reasonably resolve such audit
or proceeding.

 

3.TITLE MATTERS

 

3.1Access to Records and Assets

 

. Upon execution of this Agreement and until the Closing, and thereafter to
the extent Seller retains physical possession of any of the Assets and/or
Records, Seller shall make the Records available to Purchaser at its offices
located at the address set forth in the introductory paragraph of this
Agreement, during normal business hours, for examination and copying by
Purchaser and, with respect to the Properties operated by Seller,

   

shall grant Purchaser access to such Properties for inspection. Seller shall
not be obligated to perform any title work or provide abstracts other than
those presently in Seller's possession, nor will any existing title opinions
be brought current by Seller. Seller will use reasonable commercial efforts
to furnish to Purchaser all other information with respect to the Assets that
Purchaser may from time to time reasonably request, except to the extent that
Seller determines in good faith that it is prohibited by agreement with a
third party from disclosing the information covered thereby. Purchaser agrees
to conduct its due diligence in a professional and orderly manner and at its
own cost and expense without disruption of Seller's normal and usual
operations. Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its
partners, shareholders, members, officers, directors, trustees, employees,
agents and representatives (collectively the "Seller Group") from any and all
claims, demands, damages, losses, liabilities, costs and expenses, including
court costs and reasonable attorney's fees (collectively "Costs"), resulting
from Purchaser's acts or omissions in connection with its access to the
Assets, regardless of whether such Costs are attributable, in whole or in
part, to the negligence, sole or concurrent, of the Seller Group, excepting
only Costs to the extent actually resulting (i) on the account of the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of a member of Seller Group or (ii) from
matters discovered or uncovered by Purchaser or Purchaser's representatives in
the course of such due diligence investigation to the extent such discoveries
are of pre-existing conditions (including any Title Defects) not caused or
exacerbated (which term shall specifically exclude the discovery of such
conditions) by Purchaser or Purchaser's representatives.

irregularities affecting the Assets which, individually or in the aggregate,
do not prior to Closing: (a) interfere with the operation, value, or use of
any of the Assets; (b) do not prevent Purchaser from receiving the proceeds of
production from any of the Oil and Gas Properties; (c) do not reduce the Net
Revenue 

---|---|--- 

   

    



 |  |  

Interest of Seller in any of the Wells or Units below the Net Revenue Interest
set forth for such Well or Unit on Exhibit B-1; and (d) do not increase the
Working Interest of Seller in any of the Wells or Units to greater than the
Working Interest set forth for such Well or Unit in Exhibit B-1 without a
proportionate increase in the Net Revenue Interest for such Well or Unit. 

---|---|--- 

 

    

3.2.3

 |  

"Title Defect" shall mean any matter (i) that would cause the title to any
Well or Unit to fail to qualify as Good and Defensible Title and (ii) for
which the Title Defect Amount (as hereinafter defined) is greater than the
Individual Title Defect Threshold. 

---|--- 

 

    

3.2.4

 |  

"Individual Title Defect Threshold" shall mean the sum of $40,000. 

---|--- 

 

    

3.2.5

 |  

"Title Defect Property" shall mean a Property affected by a Title Defect
timely and properly asserted by Purchaser. 

---|--- 

 

    

3.2.6

 |  

"Title Defect Amount" shall mean, with respect to a Title Defect Property, the
amount by which the value of such Title Defect Property is impaired by reason
of the existence of one or more Title Defects. 

---|--- 

 

    

3.2.7

 |  

"Allocated Value" means, with respect to each Well or Unit, the amount set
forth on Exhibit B-1 under the column styled "Allocated Value" for such Well
or Unit. Seller and Purchaser agree that the Allocated Values set forth in
Exhibit B-1 represent a fair and reasonable allocation of the Purchase Price
among the Properties and have been established solely for use in connection
with the administrative provisions of this Agreement, including the
calculation of adjustments to the Purchase Price as provided herein, and not
for purposes of federal, state, local, or foreign income taxation. 

---|--- 

 

3.3Notice of Title Defect

 

. During the period of time between the execution of this Agreement and
October 27, 2017 (the "Due Diligence Period"), Purchaser may review title to
the Properties and may notify Seller in writing (the "Title Defect Notice") of
any Title Defect; provided, however, Purchaser shall exercise reasonable
efforts to inform Seller of Title Defects as they are discovered. Any notice
provided hereunder shall include appropriate evidence to reasonably support
the Purchaser's position, including (i) identification of the Title Defect
Property, (ii) a description of the Title Defect(s) asserted by Purchaser with
respect to such Title Defect Property, (iii) the basis for the Title
Defect(s), (iv) the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property, (v) the
portion of the Title Defect Property affected by the Title Defect, (vi) the
Title Defect Amount asserted by Purchaser with respect to such Title Defect,
and (vii) the computations and information upon which Purchaser's assertion is
based; provided, however, that an alleged failure to comply with subsections
(i) through (vii) above shall not cause any such notice to be invalid or any
Title Defect to be waived if the Title Defect Notice is reasonably sufficient
(A) to provide notice to Seller of the existence and general nature of the
Title Defect and (B) for Seller to verify the existence of the alleged Title
Defect. Purchaser will be deemed to have conclusively waived any Title Defect
discovered by Purchaser during the Due Diligence Period about which it fails
to notify Seller in writing in the manner described above prior to the
expiration thereof; provided, however, that Purchaser shall not be deemed to
have waived any such Title Defect for purposes of the special warranty of
title set out in the General Assignment.

   

3.4Remedies for Title Defects

 

. For any Title Defect properly asserted by Purchaser during the Due
Diligence Period, subject to the termination rights of Seller and Purchaser
pursuant to Section 3.8 hereof, and subject to Seller's rights under Section
3.5.1, Seller shall have the option, in its sole discretion, by written notice
to Purchaser which shall be delivered on or before the date that is two (2)
business day prior to Closing of (i) curing the Title Defect, (ii) reducing
the Purchase Price by the proposed Title Defect Amount (a "Title Defect
Adjustment"), or (iii) if the Title Defect Adjustment for any Title Defect
Property equals, or but for the limitations in Section 3.6 would exceed, the
Allocated Value for such Property, Seller shall have the option of removing
the affected Property from the transaction contemplated herein and reducing
the Purchase Price by the Allocated Value thereof and such Assets shall be
Excluded Assets for all purposes hereunder. In the event Seller elects option
(i) above, then the Closing shall proceed as scheduled, the Property affected
by the asserted Title Defect shall be conveyed to Purchaser at Closing without
adjustment to the Purchase Price and the Title Defect Amount Purchaser
reasonably asserted in its Title Defect Notice shall be deposited with the
Escrow Agent, which amount shall be disbursed pursuant to Sections 3.5.2 and
3.9.

 

3.5Procedure for Resolving Title Defects

 

. With respect to Title Defects properly and timely asserted by Purchaser and
contested by Seller as to existence or the Title Defect Amount attributable
thereto, the following procedures shall apply.

 

    

3.5.1

 |  

Seller shall furnish to Purchaser a notice (a "Rejection Notice") in writing
on or before five (5) business days after Seller's receipt of the Title Defect
Notice. The Rejection Notice shall state with reasonable specificity the
basis of Seller's rejection of the Title Defect or the proposed Title Defect
Amount. No later than five (5) business days following Purchaser's receipt of
the Rejection Notice, representatives of Purchaser and Seller, knowledgeable
in title matters, shall meet and either: (i) agree to mutually reject the
particular Title Defect, or (ii) agree on the validity of such Title Defect
and the Title Defect Amount attributable thereto, in which case Seller may
elect pursuant to Section 3.4(i) to cure such Title Defect at its own expense
or, failing such cure, agree to reduce the Purchaser Price by the Title Defect
Adjustment attributable thereto, subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 3.5.3; provided, however, that if the Parties cannot agree on either
option (i) or (ii), then the Closing shall proceed as scheduled, the Property
affected by the asserted Title Defect shall be conveyed to Purchaser at
Closing without adjustment to the Purchase Price, the Title Defect Amount
Purchaser reasonably asserted in its Title Defect Notice shall be deposited
with the Escrow Agent, and the existence of the Title Defect or the Title
Defect Amount subject to the Rejection Notice shall be submitted to dispute
resolution in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 3.9. 

---|--- 

 

    

3.5.2

 |  

Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, upon delivering written
notice to Purchaser in accordance with Section 3.4(i), to attempt, at Seller's
sole cost, to cure or remove any Title Defects on or before the expiration of
ninety (90) days counted from and after the Closing Date (the "Cure Period").
Upon the expiration of the Cure Period, (i) if the Parties agree as to whether
any such Title Defect has been cured, the Parties shall jointly instruct the
Escrow Agent to release the funds attributable to such Title Defect to the
appropriate Party or (ii) if the Parties dispute whether the Title Defect has
been cured or if any dispute remains regarding such Title Defect or the cure 

---|--- 

   

    |  

or Title Defect Amount thereof, the Parties shall submit the dispute to the
Defect Expert in accordance with Section 3.9. 

---|--- 

 

    

3.5.3

 |  

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.5.1, there shall be no adjustment
to the Purchase Price, nor shall any Title Defect Amount be deposited with the
Escrow Agent, for Title Defects affecting any Property unless the aggregate
Title Defect Adjustments for asserted Title Defects with respect to all of the
Properties exceeds an amount equal to three percent (3%) of the Purchase Price
(the "Aggregate Title Deductible"), and then only to the extent the sum of the
Title Defect Adjustments exceeds the Aggregate Title Deductible. 

---|--- 

 

3.6Value of Defects

 

. Subject to the provisions of Section 3.5.3, the adjustment to the Purchase
Price for a Title Defect shall be determined as follows:

 

    

3.6.1

 |  

If, because of the Title Defect, title to a particular Title Defect Property
fails completely with the effect that Seller has no ownership interest in the
relevant Property, the adjustment to the Purchase Price attributable to such
Title Defect shall be the Allocated Value of that Property. 

---|--- 

 

    

3.6.2

 |  

If the Title Defect consists of a lien, encumbrance or other charge upon the
Title Defect Property which is liquidated in amount, the adjustment to the
Purchase Price attributable to such Title Defect shall be the amount necessary
to pay the obligee to remove such Title Defect. If such amount, however, is
in excess of the Allocated Value of that Property, Seller may elect to exclude
the Property from the transaction contemplated herein, and the Purchase Price
shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such Well or Unit. If Seller does
not elect to exclude the Property from the transaction contemplated herein,
then Seller shall indemnify Purchaser for such Title Defect to the extent such
Title Defect exceeds the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property. 

---|--- 

 

    

3.6.3

 |  

If Seller's actual Net Revenue Interest in a Well or Unit is less than the Net
Revenue Interest set forth for such Well or Unit in Exhibit B-1 throughout the
remaining productive life of such Well or Unit, the adjustment to the Purchase
Price attributable to such Title Defect shall be an amount equal to (i) the
ratio of (x) the difference obtained by subtracting the actual Net Revenue
Interest for such Well or Unit from the Net Revenue Interest set forth for
such Well or Unit on Exhibit B-1, to (y) the Net Revenue Interest set forth
for such Well or Unit on Exhibit B-1, (ii) multiplied by the Allocated Value
for such Well or Unit. 

---|--- 

 

    

3.6.4

 |  

If Seller's actual Net Revenue Interest in a Well or Unit is less than the
Net Revenue Interest set forth for such Well or Unit in Exhibit B-1 for less
than the remaining productive life of the Well or Unit, or if Seller's actual
Working Interest in a Well or Unit is greater than the Working Interest set
forth for such Well or Unit in Exhibit B-1 without a proportionate increase in
the relevant Net Revenue Interest, then the adjustment to the Purchase Price
attributable to such Title Defect shall be determined by agreement of the
Parties, or if they are unable to agree, pursuant to the dispute resolution
procedures set out in the Section 3.9; and 

---|--- 

   

    

3.6.5

 |  

If the Title Defect is one other than described in subparagraphs 3.6.1 through
3.6.4, the adjustment to the Purchase Price attributable to such Title Defect
shall be the amount agreed to by Seller and Purchaser or, failing such
agreement, the Title Defect Adjustment shall be determined pursuant to Section
3.9 below. 

---|--- 

 

In no event, however, shall the total of the Title Defect Amounts related to a
particular Asset exceed the Allocated Value of such Asset. The Title Defect
Amount with respect to a Title Defect shall be determined without any
duplication of defects fully addressed in the Title Defect Amount of any other
Title Defects, or for which Purchaser otherwise receives credit in the
calculation of the Purchase Price.

 

3.7Interest Additions

 

. If Seller discovers (i) that Seller owns an interest in a Property that is
not described in Exhibit A but will be conveyed to Purchaser at Closing, and
such additional Property is otherwise free of Title Defects, or (ii) that the
actual Net Revenue Interest for a Well or Unit described on Exhibit B-1 is
greater than the Net Revenue Interest shown for such Well or Unit on Exhibit
B-1, and such Well is otherwise free of Title Defects (in each case, an
"Interest Addition"), then Seller shall, from time to time, have the right to
give Purchaser written notice of such Interest Additions ("Interest Addition
Notice"), as soon as practicable but no later than the end of the Due
Diligence Period, stating with reasonable specificity the Property affected,
the particular Interest Addition claimed, and Seller's good faith estimate of
the value of the additional Property or the amount by which the Additional
Interest increases the value of the affected Property over and above the
Allocated Value for such Property ("Interest Addition Value"). If Purchaser
agrees with the existence of the Interest Addition and Seller's good faith
estimate of the Interest Addition Value, then the Interest Addition Value
shall be added to and increase the amount of the Aggregate Title Deductible.
If Purchaser contests the existence of the Interest Addition or Seller's good
faith estimate of the Interest Addition Value, then Purchaser shall so notify
Seller in writing on or before five (5) days after receipt of the Interest
Addition Notice ("Interest Addition Rejection Notice"). The Interest Addition
Rejection Notice shall state with reasonable specificity the basis of
Purchaser's rejection of the Additional Interest or the Interest Addition
Value. No later than five (5) days following delivery of the Interest
Addition Rejection Notice, representatives of Purchaser and Seller,
knowledgeable in title matters, shall meet and either (i) agree to mutually
reject the Interest Addition, in which case Seller shall waive the Interest
Addition, or (ii) agree on the validity of such Interest Addition and the
Interest Addition Value, in which case Seller shall be entitled to an increase
in the Aggregate Title Deductible. If the Parties cannot agree on either
option (i) or (ii) in the preceding sentence, the Interest Addition subject to
the Interest Addition Rejection Notice shall be submitted to dispute
resolution in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 3.9. If
Purchaser fails to timely deliver an Interest Addition Rejection Notice,
Purchaser shall be deemed to have accepted the validity of the Interest
Addition and the Interest Addition Value, and Seller shall be entitled to an
increase in the Aggregate Title Deductible.

 

3.8Right to Terminate Agreement

 

. Notwithstanding anything in Article 3, Article 4 or Article 5, in the event
the sum of (i) the amounts to be delivered to the Escrow Agent attributed to
Title Defects and Environmental Defects, (ii) adjustments to the Purchase
Price attributable to Title Defects and Environmental Defects as to which the
Parties have agreed to as of the Closing Date (including, without limitation,
adjustments as to affected Properties removed from the transactions under this
Agreement pursuant to Article 3 or Article 5), and (iii) adjustments to the

   

Purchase Price attributed to preferential purchase rights in accordance with
Section 3.10, Required Consents in accordance with Section 3.10 and Casualty
Losses (as hereinafter defined) in accordance with Section 4.1 equals or
exceeds fifteen percent (15%) of the Purchase Price, then Seller or Purchaser
may, by written notice given to the other Party not less than two (2) business
days prior to the Closing Date, elect to terminate this Agreement without
liability to Purchaser, in which case Purchaser shall be entitled to a refund
of the Performance Deposit.

 

3.9Expert Determination.

 

    

3.9.1

 |  

If Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree, as herein provided, regarding the
existence of a Title Defect, Environmental Defect, or Casualty Loss, the
adjustment to the Purchase Price attributable to a Title Defect, the
Remediation Amount (as hereinafter defined) attributable to an Environmental
Defect, or reduction in value resulting from a Casualty Loss, or any other
matter to be resolved under this Article 3 or Article 4 or 5, the Parties
shall promptly refer the matter for determination in the manner hereinafter
provided to a person selected by mutual agreement of the Parties who possesses
the requisite knowledge, skill and experience to determine the issue in
question; provided, however, that all disputes shall be submitted at the
latest by the day that is ten (10) days after the end of the Cure Period (the
"Defect Expert"). Neither Party shall propose as a Defect Expert a person who
(i) is currently working as an employee or consultant for such Party or any
Affiliate of such Party, or is in discussions about potential future work for
such Party or any such Affiliate, (ii) has worked or been engaged as an
employee, attorney, accountant or consultant for such Party or any such
Affiliate during the two year period preceding the Closing Date, or (iii) has
any financial interest in the transaction contemplated by this Agreement other
than compensation for services as a Defect Expert. In the event the Parties
are unable to agree upon a Defect Expert, then each Party shall designate in
writing to the other an independent person having the qualifications necessary
to determine the issue in question, and the two persons so identified shall,
without direction from or prior approval of the Party appointing such person,
select an independent third party having the requisite qualifications to serve
as the Defect Expert. The Defect Expert may enlist the advice of attorneys,
geologists, and landmen, or any petroleum engineer or environmental consultant
mutually agreed upon by the Parties or any neutral expert selected by the
Defect Expert. 

---|--- 

 

    

3.9.2

 |  

Within five (5) business days of referral to the Defect Expert, the Parties
shall each deliver to the other and the Defect Expert a notice setting forth
in adequate detail the issues to be determined by the Defect Expert and the
decision (on a word-for-word basis) that such Party wishes the Defect Expert
to make with respect to the issues to be determined (the "Decision Notice");
provided, however, in preparing their Decision Notice, each Party (as well as
the Defect Expert) shall be bound by the terms of this Agreement. Within two
(2) business days after the giving of the two Decision Notices, one or more
representatives of each Party shall attend a meeting with the Defect Expert at
a mutually acceptable time and place to discuss fully the content of such
Decision Notice and, based thereon, determine whether either or both wish to
modify their Decision Notices in any way. Any such modifications shall be
discussed, so that when each Party finalizes its Decision Notice, it shall do
so with full knowledge of the 

---|--- 

   

    |  

content of the other Party's final Decision Notice. The finalization of such
Decision Notices and the delivery of same by each Party to the other shall
occur at the meeting unless the Parties agree to have one or more additional
meetings for such purposes. The Defect Expert shall be required to adopt the
decision set forth in either final Decision Notice and shall have no power
whatsoever to reach any other result. The Defect Expert shall adopt the
decision that, in his or her judgment, is the more fair and equitable and in
conformity with this Agreement and industry standards. 

---|--- 

 

    

3.9.3

 |  

The decision, made in writing and signed by the Defect Expert, shall determine
such dispute. Such decision shall be made, signed and delivered to the
Parties within two (2) business days after the meeting, unless otherwise
agreed by the Parties. The expenses of the Defect Expert and any other
experts retained by the Defect Expert under this Agreement shall be borne by
the Party whose final Decision Notice was not chosen by the Defect Expert,
except that each Party shall bear the compensation and expense of its own
counsel, witnesses and employees. The determination and award of the Defect
Expert shall be final and binding upon the Parties, shall not be subject to
appeal or judicial review of any nature whatsoever and shall be taken into
account in preparing the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement. Upon final
resolution of a dispute relating to a Title Defect or Environmental Defect,
the Parties shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to release the funds
attributable to such Title Defect or Environmental Defect to the appropriate
Party in accordance with the decision of the Defect Expert. 

---|--- 

 

3.10Preferential Purchase Rights and Consents to Assign

 

. 

 

    

3.10.1

 |  

Promptly, but no later than five (5) business days, after the date hereof,
Seller shall send notices to all holders of preferential rights to purchase
affecting the Assets. If an Asset is subject to a preferential right to
purchase, right of first refusal, right of first offer, or similar right that
is exercised prior to the Closing, Seller shall be deemed to have suffered a
complete failure of title with respect to the affected Asset, such Asset shall
be excluded from the Assets conveyed to Purchaser at the Closing, such Assets
shall be Excluded Assets for all purposes hereunder, the Purchase Price shall
be reduced by an amount equal to the full Allocated Value of the affected
Asset, and, in the case of such a preferential right to purchase or similar
right, Seller shall be entitled to retain all proceeds paid for the affected
Asset by the person exercising such preferential right to purchase or similar
right. Such a reduction of the Purchaser Price shall be without regard to the
$40,000 Individual Title Defect Threshold otherwise applicable to individual
Title Defects under Section 3.2.3 or the 3% Aggregate Title Deductible
otherwise applicable to Title Defect Amounts for uncured Title Defects under
Section 3.5.3, and no reduction of the Purchase Price pursuant to this Section
3.10 shall be taken into account in determining whether the Aggregate Title
Deductible has been met. If Purchaser purchases at the Closing an Asset
burdened by a preferential right to purchase or similar right that has not
been exercised as of the Closing Date, regardless of whether the time period
for the exercise of such right has expired, no reduction of the Adjusted
Purchase Price paid at the Closing shall be made with respect thereto. If,
for any reason, such preferential right to purchase or similar right is
successfully exercised by the holder thereof after the Closing, Purchaser
shall 

---|--- 

   

    |  

be entitled to retain all proceeds paid for the affected Asset by the holder
of the relevant preferential right to purchase or similar right. 

---|--- 

 

    

3.10.2

 |  

Promptly, but no later than five (5) business days, after the date hereof,
Seller shall send notices to all holders of consents to assign affecting the
Assets. If Seller fails to obtain any consent necessary for the transfer of
any Asset to Purchaser, Seller's failure shall be handled as follows: 

---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(i)

 |  

If the consent is a not a Required Consent, then the affected Assets shall
nevertheless be conveyed at the Closing as part of the Assets with no
adjustment to the Purchase Price. Except with respect to any consents denied
in writing by the consent holder prior to Closing, any Costs that arise due to
the failure to obtain such consent shall be borne by Purchaser, and Purchaser
shall defend, release, indemnify and hold harmless Seller from and against the
same. 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(ii)

 |  

If the consent is a Required Consent, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted
downward by the Allocated Value of the affected Assets (which affected Assets
shall include all Properties and Wells affected by the Existing Contract or
Property for which a consent is refused), and the affected Assets shall be
treated as Excluded Assets. 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(iii)

 |  

Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 3.10.2, if Seller obtains a
Required Consent described in Section 3.10.2(ii) within one hundred eighty
(180) days after the Closing, then Seller shall promptly deliver conveyances
of the affected Asset(s) to Purchaser and Purchaser shall pay to Seller an
amount equal to the Allocated Value of the affected Asset(s) in accordance
with wire transfer instructions provided by Seller (subject to the adjustments
set forth in Section 2.4). 

---|---|--- 

 

For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 3.10.2 shall not
apply to consents to assign contained in BIA Leases as such matters are to be
handled exclusively pursuant to Article 14. 

 

4.CASUALTY LOSS.

 

4.1Casualty Loss

 

. If, prior to the Closing, any of the Assets are the subject of a
condemnation or taking or substantially damaged or destroyed by fire,
explosion, accident, act of the public enemy, act of God, or other similar
event or occurrence, and the losses as a result of such individual occurrence
or taking exceed $40,000 ("Casualty Loss"), Seller shall notify Purchaser
promptly after Seller learns of such event. Seller shall have the right, but
not the obligation, to cure any such Casualty Loss by repairing such damage
or, in the case of Personal Property or fixtures, replacing the damaged Assets
with equivalent items, in each case reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, no
later than the Closing Date. If any Casualty Loss exists at the Closing,
Purchaser shall proceed to purchase the damaged Assets, and the Purchase Price
shall be reduced by the aggregate reduction in value of all Assets affected by
such Casualty Loss, as determined by the mutual agreement of the Parties;
provided that if the Parties are unable to agree on such amount prior to the
Closing, then such determination shall be made by the Defect

   

Expert as provided in Section 3.9 above; provided, however, that if the
Purchase Price reduction on account of such Casualty Loss reasonably claimed
by Purchaser is an amount equal to or greater than the Allocated Value of the
affected Assets, either Party shall have the option to exclude such Assets
from the transaction, in which case such Assets will be retained by Seller at
Closing, considered Excluded Assets for all purposes hereunder, and the
Purchase Price will be reduced by the Allocated Value of the Assets so
excluded without regard to the Individual Title Threshold or Aggregate Title
Deductible. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 4.1, Seller shall be entitled to retain all insurance proceeds and
claims against other parties relating to any such Casualty Loss. For purposes
of this provision, normal wear and tear shall not be considered a Casualty
Loss.

 

5.ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION

 

5.1Physical Condition of the Assets

 

. The Assets have been used for Hydrocarbon drilling and production
operations and various related oil field operations. Physical changes in or
under the Properties or adjacent lands may have occurred as a result of such
uses. The Properties also may contain buried pipelines and other equipment,
whether or not of a similar nature, the locations of which may not now be
known by Seller or be readily apparent by a physical inspection of the
Property. Purchaser understands that Seller may not have the requisite
information with which to determine the exact nature or condition of the
Properties or the effect any such use has had on the physical condition of the
Assets. In addition, Purchaser acknowledges that some oil field production
equipment may contain asbestos and/or naturally occurring radioactive material
("NORM"). In this regard, Purchaser expressly understands that NORM may affix
or attach itself to the inside of wells, materials, and equipment as scale or
in other forms, and that the wells, materials, and equipment located on the
Assets may contain NORM and that NORM containing materials may be buried or
have been otherwise disposed of on the Assets. Purchaser also expressly
understands that special procedures may be required for the removal and
disposal of asbestos and NORM from the Assets where it may be found. The
statements in this Section 5.1 are intended as disclosures of possible
conditions existing on the Properties and not an admission or acknowledgment
that any such conditions actually exist.

 

5.2Environmental Assessment.

 

    

5.2.1

 |  

Prior to the Closing, and upon reasonable, prior notice to Seller and the
operator(s) of the Properties, Purchaser and any third party environmental
consulting firm approved by Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld) and retained by Purchaser (the "Purchaser's Environmental
Consultant"), to the same extent Seller has such right, shall have the right,
at Purchaser's sole cost and expense, to enter upon the Assets and all
buildings and improvements thereon, inspect the same, conduct soil and water
tests and borings, and generally conduct such tests, examinations,
investigations, and studies as may be necessary or appropriate for the
preparation of appropriate engineering and other reports, judgments, and
environmental assessments in relation to the Assets, their environmental
condition, and the existence of Environmental Defects (as hereinafter defined)
(such inspection and investigation being called herein "Purchaser's
Environmental Assessment") provided, however, that Purchaser shall not conduct
any environmental sampling, testing, or monitoring activities, including any
Phase II Environmental Site Assessments (collectively "Phase II Activities"),
without prior 

---|--- 

   

    |  

notice to and written consent of Seller. Purchaser\'s notice to Seller of
Phase II Activities shall be accompanied by a written report from Purchaser\'s
Environmental Consultant that specifically identifies (i) the environmental
condition that dictates the necessity of Phase II Activities and (ii) the
Phase II Activities required to more specifically determine the scope or
extent of such condition. Seller\'s consent to Phase II Activities may be
withheld in Seller's sole and absolute discretion; provided, however, that if
Seller does not give its consent for a Phase II Environmental Assessment
pursuant to this sentence, then (i) Purchaser shall have the right, at its
sole discretion, upon delivery of written notice to Seller prior to Closing,
to exclude such Asset from the transaction contemplated by this Agreement,
(ii) the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of the Asset
if it is so excluded and (iii) such Asset shall become an Excluded Asset for
all purposes hereunder. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Purchaser shall not have access to, and shall not be permitted to conduct
Purchaser's Environmental Assessment with respect to the Assets where Seller
does not have the authority to grant access for such due diligence; provided,
however, that Seller shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
required consents of third parties, including third party operators of the
Assets, in order to obtain such authority. Seller shall have the right to be
present during any activities conducted as a part of Purchaser's Environmental
Assessment and shall have the right, at its option and expense, to split
samples with Purchaser. Purchaser and its officers, employees,
representatives, agents, and Environmental Consultant shall abide by Seller's
and any third party operator's health and safety rules, policies, and
procedures that are provided to Purchaser in advance while conducting
Purchaser's Environmental Assessment. Purchaser shall by the end of the Due
Diligence Period provide to Seller a copy of Purchaser's Environmental
Assessment, including any reports, data, and conclusions. Purchaser and
Seller shall keep strictly confidential any data or information acquired from
such examinations and the results of all analyses of such data and information
and shall not disclose same to any person or Governmental Body without the
prior written approval of the other Party, except such disclosure as may be
required by Applicable Law; provided, however, that if the Closing occurs,
Seller shall, upon request of Purchaser (and to the extent not prohibited by
Applicable Laws), destroy all such data or information in its possession and
Purchaser shall no longer be bound by such confidentiality obligation. The
obligation of confidentiality of Seller shall survive the Closing. 

---|--- 

 

    

5.2.2

 |  

With respect to Purchaser's Environmental Assessment, Purchaser shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Group from any and all Costs resulting
from the acts or omissions of Purchaser or Purchaser's Environmental
Consultant, including, without limitation, Costs relating to (i) any and all
statutory or common-law liens or other encumbrances for labor or materials
furnished in connection with such tests, samplings, studies, or surveys as
Purchaser or Purchaser's Environmental Consultant may conduct with respect to
the Assets, property damage, (iii) personal injury, and (iv) claims asserted
by Purchaser, its Affiliates, and their respective partners, shareholders,
members, officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives
(collectively the "Purchaser Group"), regardless of whether such Costs are
attributable, in whole or in part, to the negligence, sole or concurrent, of
the Seller Group, excepting 

---|--- 

   

    |  

only Costs to the extent actually resulting (i) on the account of the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of a member of Seller Group or (ii) from
matters discovered or uncovered by Purchaser and Purchaser's Environmental
Consultant in the course of such due diligence investigation to the extent
such discoveries are of pre-existing conditions (including any Environmental
Defects) not caused or exacerbated (which term shall specifically exclude the
discovery of such conditions) by Purchaser or Purchaser's Environmental
Consultant. 

---|--- 

 

5.3Environmental Defect Notice

 

. If Purchaser, in its sole discretion, determines, as a result of
Purchaser's Environmental Assessment, that there exists or may exist an
Environmental Defect, Purchaser may notify Seller thereof in writing as soon
as reasonably practical after its discovery, but in any event before the end
of the Due Diligence Period (the "Environmental Defect Notice"). Any notice
provided hereunder shall state with reasonable specificity the basis of the
alleged Environmental Defect and include evidence to support Purchaser's
position, including (i) a description of the Environmental Defect, (ii) the
Environmental Law applicable to the Environmental Defect, (iii) Purchaser's
basis for believing that Seller is in violation of such Environmental Law,
(iv) the portion of the Assets affected by the Environmental Defect and (v) a
description of the proposed methods and scope of the Remediation (as
hereinafter defined) required and the proposed Remediation Amount (as
hereinafter defined) attributable thereto, and the assumptions relied upon by
Purchaser or Purchaser's Environmental Consultant in preparing such summary
and estimate; provided, however, that an alleged failure to comply with
subsections (i) through (v) shall not cause any such notice to be invalid or
any Environmental Defect to be waived if the Environmental Defect Notice is
reasonably sufficient (A) to provide notice to Seller of the existence and
general nature of the Environmental Defect and (B) for Seller to verify the
existence of the alleged Environmental Defect. Except for Seller's
indemnification under Section 13.3.3 for breaches of Seller's representations
in Section 6.2.10 and Section 6.2.16, Purchaser will be deemed to have
conclusively waived any Environmental Defect discovered by Purchaser during
the Due Diligence Period and with respect to which Purchaser fails to timely
and properly furnish to Seller an Environmental Defect Notice.

 

5.4Remedies for Environmental Defects

 

. For any Environmental Defect properly asserted by Purchaser during the Due
Diligence Period, subject to the termination rights of Seller and Purchaser
pursuant to Section 3.8 and subject to Seller's rights in Section 5.5.1,
Seller shall have the option, in its sole discretion, by written notice to
Purchaser which shall be delivered on or prior to the date that is two (2)
business days prior to Closing, of (i) remedying the Environmental Defect or
(ii) reducing the Purchase Price by an amount equal to the proposed
Remediation Amount ("Environmental Defect Adjustment"), subject to the
limitation set forth in Section 5.5.3; provided, that if the asserted
Environmental Defect Adjustment for any Property exceeds the Allocated Value
for such Property, Seller or Purchaser shall have the option of removing the
affected Property from the transaction contemplated herein and reducing the
Purchase Price by the Allocated Value thereof and such Assets shall be
Excluded Assets for all purposes hereunder. In the event Seller elects option
(i) above, then the Property affected by the asserted Environmental Defect
shall be conveyed to Purchaser at Closing without adjustment to the Purchase
Price and the Remediation Amount Purchaser reasonably asserted in its
Environmental Defect Notice shall be deposited with the Escrow Agent, which
amount shall be disbursed pursuant to Sections 5.5.2 and 3.9.

   

5.5Procedure for Resolving Environmental Defects

 

. With respect to Environmental Defects properly and timely asserted by
Purchaser as provided herein, the following procedures shall apply.

 

    

5.5.1

 |  

If Seller contests the existence of an Environmental Defect or the proposed
Remediation Amount attributable thereto, Seller shall provide Purchaser a
Rejection Notice with respect thereto on or before five (5) days after
Seller's receipt of the Environmental Defect Notice. The Rejection Notice
shall state with reasonable specificity the basis of Seller's rejection of the
Environmental Defect or the proposed Remediation Amount. No later than five
(5) days following Purchaser's receipt of the Rejection Notice,
representatives of Purchaser and Seller, knowledgeable in environmental
matters, shall meet and either: (i) agree to mutually reject the particular
Environmental Defect, or (ii) agree on the validity of such Environmental
Defect and the Remediation Amount attributable thereto, in which case Seller
may elect under Section 5.4(i) to cure such Environmental Defect at its own
expense and, if required, to the satisfaction of the appropriate Governmental
Body prior to the Closing or, failing such cure, agree to reduce the Purchase
Price by the Environmental Defect Adjustment attributable thereto, subject to
the limitation set forth in Section 5.5.3. If the Parties cannot agree on
either option (i) or (ii), then, subject to Seller's and Purchaser's right to
remove Properties from the sale under this Agreement pursuant to Section 5.4,
the Property affected by the asserted Environmental Defect shall be conveyed
to Purchaser at Closing without adjustment to the Purchase Price, the
Remediation Amount Purchaser reasonably asserted in its Environmental Defect
Notice shall be deposited with the Escrow Agent, and the existence of the
Environmental Defect or the Remediation Amount subject to the Rejection Notice
shall be submitted to dispute resolution in accordance with the procedures set
forth in Section 3.9. 

---|--- 

 

    

5.5.2

 |  

Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, upon delivering written
notice to Purchaser in accordance with Section 5.4(i), to attempt, at Seller's
sole cost, to cure or remove any Environmental Defects on or before the
expiration of the Cure Period. Upon the expiration of the Cure Period, (i) if
the Parties agree as to whether any such Environmental Defect has been cured,
the Parties shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to release the funds
attributable to such Environmental Defect to the appropriate Party or (ii) if
the Parties dispute whether the Environmental Defect has been cured or if any
dispute remains outstanding regarding such Environmental Defect or the cure or
Remediation Amount thereof, the Parties shall submit the dispute to the Defect
Expert in accordance with Section 3.9. 

---|--- 

 

    

5.5.3

 |  

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.5.1, there shall be no adjustment
to the Purchase Price, nor shall any amounts be deposited with the Escrow
Agent, for Environmental Defects affecting any Property unless the aggregate
Environmental Defect Adjustment for all asserted Environmental Defects with
Remediation Amounts exceeding the Individual Environmental Defect Threshold
with respect to all of the Properties exceeds an amount equal to three percent
(3%) of the Purchase Price (the "Aggregate Environmental Deductible"), and
then only to the extent the sum of the Environmental Defect Adjustments exceed
the Aggregate Environmental Deductible.

8.PRE-CLOSING OBLIGATIONS OF SELLER

 

8.1Operations

 

. From the date of this Agreement until the Closing (the "Interim Period"),
to the extent Seller can exert influence over such matters, Seller will use
reasonable commercial efforts to see that the Properties not operated by
Seller are maintained in full force and effect and are operated in a good and
workmanlike manner and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
applicable oil, gas, and mineral leases, Existing Contracts, and all
Applicable Laws. Seller, as to the portion of the Properties which Seller now
operates, shall continue to operate the

   

same in a good and workmanlike manner and in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the applicable oil, gas and mineral leases, the Existing
Contracts, and all Applicable Laws, until such operations are turned over to
and become the responsibility of Purchaser. However, Seller will not have any
obligation to operate any portion of the Properties after the expiration of
the Interim Period except as provided for in Section 8.3. Subject to the
terms of Section 8.3, Seller will pay its proportionate share of all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with Properties for which invoices are
received prior to the Closing Date. During the Interim Period, Seller will
(a) to the extent Seller controls the operation of any of the Properties,
maintain the lease equipment in the same condition, working order, and state
of repair as currently exists, subject to ordinary wear and tear, (b) give
prompt written notice to Purchaser of any written notice received or given by
Seller with respect to any material breach by Seller or any other person of
any of the Properties, Permits and Existing Contracts, (c) use commercially
reasonable efforts to pursue and collect accounts receivable and other
receivables in a timely manner and in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, (d) give prompt written notice to Purchaser of
(I) any written notice of any material damage to or destruction of any of the
Assets and (II) any written notice received by Seller or any of its Affiliates
of any material claim asserting any tort or violation of Applicable Law or any
investigation, suit, action or litigation by or before a Governmental Body
that, in each case, relates to the Assets, and (e) use commercially reasonable
efforts to maintain and keep the Properties and Permits in full force and
effect; provided, that, Seller shall not be required to make payments, conduct
drilling operations or undertake obligations in favor any third parties in
order to do so. During the Interim Period and thereafter until operations are
transferred to Purchaser or the duly elected or appointed successor operator,
without the prior written consent of Purchaser, Seller will not (i) cause the
Properties to be developed, maintained or operated in a manner substantially
inconsistent with prior operations, (ii) unless required by law, abandon any
part of the Properties or plug any of the Wells, (iii) commence any operation
on the Properties anticipated to cost, as to Seller's interest in the
Properties, in excess of $250,000 per operation, except emergency operations,
the outstanding AFE's and other commitments described in Schedule 8.1, and
operations undertaken to avoid any penalty provision of any Existing Contract
or order (with respect to emergency operations, Seller shall notify Purchaser
of said emergency as soon as reasonably practical), (iv) encumber (except for
Permitted Encumbrances), convey or dispose of any part of the Properties
(other than Personal Property and equipment replaced with items of comparable
or superior quality and Hydrocarbons produced from the Properties in the
ordinary course of business), (v) settle any suit or litigation or waive any
claims or rights of value, in each case, attributable to the Assets, (vi)
voluntarily relinquish its position as operator with respect to any Asset,
(vii) reduce or terminate (or cause to be reduced or terminated) any insurance
coverage now held by Seller or its Affiliates in connection with the Assets,
(viii) voluntarily waive or release any material right with respect to any
Asset or (ix) agree to any of the foregoing.

 

8.2Contracts

 

. During the Interim Period, Seller will not, without the prior written
consent of Purchaser, enter into any agreement (i) that would be a Material
Contract if existing on the date of this Agreement, or (ii) amending,
modifying, or terminating any of the Material Contracts.

 

8.3Compensation of Seller

 

. With respect to those Properties operated by Seller, Seller shall operate
such Properties for the benefit of Purchaser during the period from the
Effective Date through the date(s) when the operation of such Properties is
turned over to, and becomes

   

the responsibility of, Purchaser or the duly elected or appointed successor
operator (the "Operations Period"). For the Operations Period, Seller shall
be entitled to retain all amounts paid or owing to Seller by non-operators
pursuant to the terms of the existing operating or similar agreements or
otherwise required by law. For the period from the Closing Date until the
date(s) when the operation of the Properties is turned over to and becomes the
responsibility of Purchaser or the duly elected or appointed successor
operator, Purchaser shall pay to Seller (i) an amount equal to (A) the
overhead charge attributable to Seller's Working Interest in each such
Property that would be payable to the operator pursuant to the terms of
existing operating or similar agreements or otherwise required by law if
Seller were a non-operator, or (B) if Seller owns one hundred percent (100%)
of the working interest in such Property, a per Month overhead charge equal to
five thousand dollars ($5,000) per drilling well and one thousand dollars
($1,000) per producing well, all in accordance with the 1984 COPAS Onshore
Model Accounting Procedure, which is hereby incorporated by reference and (ii)
all reasonable and necessary expenses attributable to Seller's Working
Interest incurred by Seller in operating, protecting, and maintaining the
subject Properties. Any such charges and expenses described above shall be
recovered by Seller as part of the Closing or post-Closing adjustments, as
appropriate. Except in the event of an emergency, or as otherwise required
pursuant to Section 8.1, Seller will have no obligation to make capital
expenditures or extraordinary operating expenditures in connection with the
Properties during the Operations Period. During the Operations Period, Seller
shall incur no liability to Purchaser or any other person for, and Purchaser
hereby releases Seller from, any Costs of any nature suffered or incurred by
Purchaser or such other Person arising out of or in connection with the
rendering by Seller of any operation of the Assets (including, without
limitation, the incorrect payment of expenses, taxes, billings, delay rentals,
royalties, minimum royalties, payments required by any of the Properties,
shut-in royalties or similar payments, or for any failure to pay any such
payments through mistake or oversight), unless such Costs are the result of
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Seller. 

 

8.4Permissions

 

. During the Interim Period, Seller shall use reasonable efforts to obtain
all permissions, approvals, and consents by Federal, state and local
governmental authorities and others as may be required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (excluding governmental
permissions, approvals and consents which are customarily obtained after the
assignment of an oil and gas interest which shall be the responsibility of
Purchaser to obtain).

 

8.5Defaults

 

. Seller shall give prompt written notice to Purchaser of any notice of
material default (or written threat of material default, whether disputed or
denied by Seller) received or given by Seller subsequent to the Effective Date
under any Existing Contract or any other instrument or agreement affecting the
Properties to which Seller is a party or by which Seller or any of the Assets
is bound.

 

8.6Operatorship

 

. It is understood that in most (if not all) of the operating agreements
covering any of the Properties, Seller does not retain the right to transfer
operation of such Properties that are the subject of such operating agreements
to a purchaser of Seller's interests. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the
Closing Seller will execute and deliver to Purchaser such change of operator
forms as may be required by the applicable Governmental Bodies reflecting
Purchaser as successor operator; however, Purchaser shall be responsible for
obtaining approval to succeed Seller as operator from both the non-operators
of each such Property and from the

   

applicable Governmental Body, provided that Seller shall use reasonable
commercial efforts to assist Purchaser in securing the consent of all
interested parties to Purchaser's election as operator of all of the
Properties for which Seller is the current operator, but in no event shall
Seller be required to expend funds in connection therewith; and provided,
further that Seller shall not have any liability or responsibility with
respect thereto. Purchaser shall have the right to obtain agreements from
such interested parties after the earlier of (i) the Closing Date or (ii) the
date on which the transaction contemplated by this Agreement has been publicly
announced and thereafter during the Interim Period.

 

8.7Geological and Geophysical Information

 

. During the Interim Period, with respect to any right, title, and interest
of Seller in any item of geological and geophysical information:

 

    

8.7.1

 |  

Seller shall use all reasonable efforts to determine whether such item of
geological and geophysical information is subject to a contractual restriction
on transfer or confidentiality obligation (including, without limitation,
contacting appropriate parties in cases where Seller's files are not clear in
this regard). 

---|--- 

 

    

8.7.2

 |  

Where geological and geophysical data is restricted, no access shall be
permitted to such data and the same shall not be delivered to Seller at the
Closing.

If either Party determines, prior to the delivery of the Post-Closing
Adjustment Statement, that Hydrocarbon production imbalances or imbalances
with respect to any pipeline, storage, or processing facility attributable to
Wells included in the Assets as of the Effective Date are other than as set
forth in Schedule 6.2.8, subject to verification of the other Party, the
Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward or downward in connection with the
Post-Closing Adjustment Statement, depending upon whether there is a net
overproduction or a net underproduction attributable to such Wells. The
amount to be paid by Purchaser to Seller with respect to any underproduction,
or by Seller to Purchaser with respect to any overproduction, shall be based
on a value of $2.00 per MMBtu, without adjustment for present value or other
discount factors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall any
adjustment be made or any amount owing by either Party unless the net amount
owed (the "Gas Imbalance Adjustment") is greater than $50,000.

REGARDLESS OF THE FAULT OR NEGLIGENCE (OTHER THAN THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR
WILLFUL MISCONDUCT) OF SELLER, INCLUDING STRICT OR STATUTORY LIABILITY OF
SELLER UNDER ANY APPLICABLE LAW. SELLER'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 13.3.3
SHALL APPLY REGARDLESS OF THE FAULT OR NEGLIGENCE (OTHER THAN THE GROSS
NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT) OF PURCHASER, INCLUDING STRICT OR STATUTORY
LIABILITY OF PURCHASER UNDER ANY APPLICABLE LAW.

 

13.5Method of Asserting Claims

 

. All claims for indemnification under this Agreement shall be asserted and
resolved as follows; provided that the provisions of Sections 13.5 and 13.6
shall be covenants and not conditions to the defense and indemnity obligations
to which they apply:

 

    

13.5.1

 |  

If any claim for which a Party providing indemnification (the "Indemnifying
Party") would be liable to a Party or any of its officers, directors,
employees, agents or representatives entitled to indemnification hereunder
(the "Indemnified Party") is asserted against or sought to be collected by a
third person, the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying
Party of such claim, specifying the nature of such claim and the amount or the
estimated amount thereof to the extent then feasible (which estimate shall not
be conclusive of the final amount of such claim) (the "Claim Notice"). The
Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Claim
Notice (the "Notice Period") to notify the Indemnified Party (i) whether it
disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party hereunder with respect to such
claim; and (ii) if it does not dispute such liability, whether it desires, at
its sole cost and expense, to defend the Indemnified Party against such claim;
provided, however, that the Indemnified Party is hereby authorized, prior to
and during the Notice Period, to file 

---|--- 

   

    |  

any motion, answer, or other pleading, submission or document which it shall
deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests. If the Indemnifying
Party notifies the Indemnified Party within the Notice Period that it does not
dispute such liability and desires to defend against such claim or demand,
then, except as hereinafter provided, the Indemnifying Party shall have the
right to defend such claim or demand by appropriate proceedings, which
proceedings shall be promptly settled or prosecuted to a final conclusion, in
such a manner as to avoid any risk of the Indemnified Party becoming subject
to liability. If the Indemnified Party desires to participate in, but not
control, any such defense or settlement, it may do so at its own cost and
expense. If the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability with respect to
such claim, or elects not to defend such claim, whether by not giving timely
notice as provided above or otherwise, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right, but not the obligation, to defend against such claim, and if the
Indemnifying Party is conclusively determined to have the obligation hereunder
to provide indemnity with respect to such obligation hereunder, then the
Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for paying the cost of such dispute. 

---|--- 

 

    

13.5.2

 |  

If the Indemnified Party shall have a claim against the Indemnifying Party
hereunder which does not involve a claim or demand being asserted or sought to
be collected from it by a third person, the Indemnified Party shall promptly
send a Claim Notice with respect to such claim to the Indemnifying Party. 

---|--- 

 

    

13.5.3

 |  

As a condition to the Indemnifying Party's obligations hereunder, the
Indemnified Party will in good faith cooperate with and assist the
Indemnifying Party in the prosecution or defense of such claims at no
unreasonable expense to the Indemnified Party. No Indemnifying Party shall
consent to entry of judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to a
claim either (i) without the consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, or (ii) unless such judgment or settlement
includes as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or
plaintiff to such Indemnified Party of a release from all liability with
respect to such claim. No Indemnified Party shall consent to the entry of
judgment or enter the settlement of any such action, the defense of which has
been assumed by an Indemnifying Party, without the consent of such
Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

---|--- 

 

13.6Payment

 

. Payments under this Article 13 and under any other indemnity provision of
this Agreement shall be made as follows: if the Indemnifying Party is required
to make any payment hereunder, the Indemnifying Party shall promptly pay the
Indemnified Party the amount so determined. If there should be a dispute as
to the amount or manner of determination of any indemnity obligation owed
hereunder, the Indemnifying Party shall nevertheless pay when due such
portion, if any, of the obligation as shall not be subject to dispute. Upon
the payment in full of any claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated
to the rights of the Indemnified Party against any person or other entity with
respect to the subject matter of this claim.

 

13.7Recording

 

. As soon as practicable after the Closing, Purchaser shall file and record
all counterparts of the General Assignment in the appropriate counties and, if
necessary, with all relevant Governmental Bodies, and provide Seller, at
Purchaser's expense, with copies of all recorded counterparts of the General
Assignment.

   

13.8Cooperation and Further Assurances

 

. After the Closing, Seller and Purchaser agree to take such further actions
and to execute, acknowledge, and deliver all such further documents as are
necessary or useful in carrying out the purposes of this Agreement or of any
document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, including, but not limited to,
the execution of state change of operator forms and other required state
regulatory filings. Each Party also agrees to cooperate with each other by
providing reasonable information which may be required by the other Party for
the purpose of administering the Assets and preparing or reviewing the Post-
Closing Adjustment Statement.

 

14.BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS LEASES

 

14.1BIA Leases

 

. Hydrocarbon Interests in oil, gas or minerals to which the Bureau of Indian
Affairs ("BIA"), the Osage Agency, or any other entity associated with a
Native American tribe is a lessor, party in interest, or under which such
entity has a right to consent to assignment of the subject Hydrocarbon
Interest ("BIA Lease") will be subject to the following additional post-
closing obligations pending approval of assignment of such BIA Lease.

 

14.2BIA Lease Revenues

 

. From closing until such time as the consent for the transfer of any BIA
Lease has been granted as required under such BIA Lease (the "Consent Interim
Period"), Purchaser authorizes Seller, in its reasonable business judgment, to
market production from the BIA Lease on behalf of Purchaser, and to receive
revenues from the oil or gas purchasers from such marketing efforts. Seller
shall remit to Purchaser the revenues received for production from the BIA
Lease within fifteen (15) business days of Seller's receipt of such revenues
from oil and gas purchasers, net of severance Taxes and charges imposed by the
purchaser. Seller will continue to remit the royalty revenues due to the BIA
or tribal entity and the Taxes due the state on the wells for which Seller
receives 100% gross payment. It is understood by and Purchaser that where
royalty revenues are paid by the purchaser directly to the lessor under any
BIA Lease, Seller will have no liability to Purchaser regarding distribution
of revenue under the BIA Lease.

 

14.3Operation of BIA Leases

 

. During the Consent Interim Period, Seller will designate Purchaser to act
as it contract operator of the BIA Leases. The contract operation arrangement
will terminate with respect to an individual BIA Lease when the consent to the
assignment of the individual BIA Lease is granted, but will continue with
respect to other BIA Leases until such time as the consent to the assignment
all BIA Leases conveyed by Seller to Purchaser under the this Agreement has
been granted. At the end of the Consent Interim Period, Seller shall furnish
to Purchaser any executed letter-in-lieu or transfer/division orders or such
other transfer documents that may be required for notifying and amending
purchaser records. Final settlement of all revenues and expenses will be made
in the post-closing as provided. Nothing under the contract operation
agreement between Seller and Purchaser will alter the indemnities or other
obligations set forth in this Agreement.

   

15.TERMINATION

 

15.1Right of Termination

 

. This Agreement may be terminated at any time at or prior to the Closing
only:

 

    

15.1.1

 |  

by mutual consent of the Parties; 

---|--- 

 

    

15.1.2

 |  

by Seller, at Seller's option, if any of the conditions applicable to
Purchaser set forth above in Article 10 have not been satisfied as provided
therein or waived by Seller on or before the Closing Date; 

---|--- 

 

    

15.1.3

 |  

by Purchaser, at Purchaser's option, if any of the conditions applicable to
Seller set forth above in Article 11 have not been satisfied as provided
therein or waived by Purchaser on or before the Closing Date; 

---|--- 

 

    

15.1.4

 |  

by either Seller or Purchaser if the Closing has not occurred on or before
January 12, 2018, or such later date as the Parties may agree upon in writing;
and 

---|--- 

 

    

15.1.5

 |  

by Seller or Purchaser pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.8, if
applicable. 

---|--- 

 

15.2Effect of Termination

 

. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 15.1 above, this
Agreement shall become void and of no further force or effect (except for the
provisions of the final sentence of Section 3.1 and Sections 5.2.2, 9.2,
17.10, and this Section 15.2, which shall continue in full force and effect).
If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to either Section 15.1.1 or Section
15.1.5, neither Party shall have any further liability to the other as the
result of such termination. If this Agreement is terminated by Seller
pursuant to Section 15.1.2, Seller is ready, willing and able to close, and
Purchaser is in material breach of this Agreement, then the Parties shall
jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to release the Performance Deposit to Seller
as liquidated damages pursuant to Section 2.3 as its sole remedy, with all
other remedies being waived; provided, that if this Agreement is terminated
for any other reason hereunder, the Parties shall jointly instruct the Escrow
Agent to release the Performance Deposit to Purchaser. If this Agreement is
terminated by Purchaser pursuant to Section 15.1.3 and Seller has failed to
exercise its best efforts to cause the conditions set forth in Article 11 to
have been fulfilled on or before the Closing Date, then, in addition to the
return of the Performance Deposit to Purchaser pursuant to the above, Seller
shall deliver to Purchaser an amount equal to Five Million Nine Hundred Fifty
Thousand Dollars ($5,950,000) within thirty (30) days of such termination as
liquidated damages representing Purchaser's sole remedy for Seller's failure
to consummate the transaction contemplated herein. The Parties agree that the
above amount is a reasonable sum considering all the circumstances existing on
the date of this Agreement, including the relationship of the sum to the range
of harm to Purchaser that reasonably could be anticipated and the anticipation
that proof of actual damages would be costly or inconvenient. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, upon any termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 15.1, Seller shall be free immediately to
enjoy all rights of ownership of the Assets and to sell, transfer, encumber,
or otherwise dispose of the Assets to any party without any restriction under
this Agreement; and Purchaser shall be liable for all actual, incidental, and
consequential damages (including, without limitation, lost profits) if it
attempts to interfere in any way with any such enjoyment or action by Seller.

   

16.TAXES

 

16.1Apportionment of Ad Valorem and Property Taxes

 

. Seller shall be allocated and shall bear all ad valorem taxes, real
property taxes, Personal Property taxes, and similar Tax obligations (the
"Property Taxes") with respect to the Assets for any Tax period (or portion
thereof) ending prior to the Effective Date. Purchaser shall be allocated and
shall bear all Property Taxes with respect to the Assets for any Tax period
(or portion thereof) beginning on or after the Effective Date. Property Taxes
for any Tax period in which the Effective Date occurs shall be apportioned
based on the number of days in such Tax period before and after the Effective
Date, between Seller and Purchaser and, if already paid by Seller, an
appropriate increase in the Purchase Price shall be made pursuant to Section
2.4.5. If such Property Taxes are not already paid, but the Tax liability is
known or can be reasonably estimated, then Seller's portion of such Property
Taxes shall be reflected as a Purchase Price adjustment pursuant to Section
2.4.12. Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid to the taxing authorities all
Property Taxes of which it has knowledge not already paid relating to the Tax
period in which the Effective Date occurs, and if appropriate adjustments to
the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.4 were not made at the Closing or in
connection with the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement, Purchaser shall invoice
Seller (with copies of applicable Tax bills and assessments to confirm same)
for Seller's apportioned shares of such Property Taxes. Seller shall pay to
Purchaser its share of such Property Taxes within thirty (30) days of receipt
of said notice. Purchaser shall defend, indemnify, and hold Seller harmless
with respect to the payment of such Property Taxes of which Purchaser has
knowledge and which Purchaser is obligated to pay to the applicable taxing
authorities (including any interest or penalties assessed thereon), provided
Seller pays to Purchaser its share (as apportioned hereunder) within thirty
(30) days of being properly invoiced (with accompanying documents to support
the invoice) by Purchaser. For the Tax period in which the Effective Date
occurs, Seller agrees (i) to forward immediately to Purchaser copies of all
Property Tax reports and returns received by Seller after the Closing and (ii)
to provide Purchaser with appropriate information which is necessary for
Purchaser to file any required Property Tax reports and returns. For non-
operated Properties, the Property Taxes will be allocated between Seller and
Purchaser upon the receipt of joint interest billings in which such Property
Taxes are charged. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller or Purchaser may
contest with the appropriate taxing authority the amount of or liability for
any Property Tax apportioned to it pursuant to this Section 16.1. The Party
pursuing the contest shall indemnify the other Party from and against all
Costs incurred by the other Party in connection with the contest, and upon
final settlement or resolution of the contest, the economic burden of the
contested Tax shall be adjusted among the parties in a manner consistent with
the intent of this Section 16.1.

 

16.2Sales Taxes

 

. Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid, all sales, use, transfer, and
similar Taxes, if any, resulting from the sale and transfer of the Assets to
Purchaser hereunder (including without limitation, all applicable conveyance,
transfer and recording fees, and real estate transfer stamps or Taxes imposed
on the transfer of the Assets pursuant to this Agreement) and Purchaser shall
indemnify and hold harmless Seller from any such Taxes and the reasonable
expense, if any, of contesting the liability for such Taxes. The Parties
shall cooperate (including by the provision of exemption certificates,
documentation to support an occasional or isolated sale exemption, or other
evidence or documentation) to reduce the amount of any such Taxes. At the
Closing, Purchaser shall pay to Seller any such Taxes required to be collected
and remitted

   

by Seller, and Seller shall prepare and file all Tax returns required to be
filed with respect to such Taxes.

 

16.3Other Asset Taxes

 

. All production, severance, excise, and other similar Taxes that are based
upon production of, or income or revenues from, Hydrocarbons attributable to
the Assets prior to the Effective Date shall be allocated to and borne by
Seller, and all such Taxes relating to such production on or after the
Effective Date shall be allocated to and borne by Purchaser. All sales, use,
transfer, and similar Taxes arising from the acquisition or disposition of the
Assets prior to the Effective Date shall be paid by Seller, and all such Taxes
arising from the acquisition or disposition of the Assets on or after the
Effective Date shall be paid by Purchaser. The Party responsible for payment
of such Tax shall prepare and file all Tax returns required to be filed in
respect thereof. This Section 16.3 shall not apply to any Tax to the extent
specifically otherwise provided elsewhere in this Agreement.

 

16.4Income Taxes

 

. Each Party shall be responsible for its own income, franchise and similar
Taxes and each Party shall indemnify and hold harmless the other Party with
respect to such Taxes for which it is liable.

 

16.5Cooperation

 

. Each Party shall cooperate with the other Party and provide the other Party
with all information in its possession or to which it has access which may be
reasonably required by the other Party in connection with the preparation of
any Tax return relating to the Assets, the audit or examination of any such
returns by any Tax authority, and the determination of or contest of any Tax
relating to the Assets. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, neither Party shall be required at any time to disclose to the
other Party any Tax returns or other confidential Tax information except to
the extent required by Applicable Law or court order.

 

16.6Tax Indemnity

 

. Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser, and Purchaser shall
indemnify and hold harmless Seller, in each case with respect to the payment
of any Taxes for which the indemnifying Party is responsible pursuant to the
provisions of this Article 16. If a Party pays a Tax subject to
indemnification by the other Party, the indemnifying Party shall promptly
reimburse the payor Party, subject to any specific reimbursement terms
provided elsewhere in this Agreement.

---|---

 |  

After the Closing, Seller agrees not to disclose geological, seismic and other
proprietary data related to the Assets, or other information that Seller would
treat as confidential if it were the owner of the Assets or any confidential
information provided by Purchaser to Seller unless (i) the Purchaser shall
have consented thereto in writing, (ii) disclosure is required pursuant to a
court order or by subpoena or similar legal process, or (iii) disclosure is
made on advice of its counsel, pursuant to a request by a Governmental Body,
pursuant to Applicable Laws, or to comply with the rules and regulations of
any stock exchange, or (iv) such information has been previously made public
(except as a result of a breach of this Agreement); provided, however, Seller
may disclose such information to its representatives, agents, attorneys,
consultants, and auditors as needed, but in such event, the Seller shall use
reasonable efforts to cause such persons to keep such information
confidential. 

---|--- 

 

17.11Exhibits and Schedules

 

. All references in this Agreement to Exhibits shall be deemed to be
references to such Exhibits as the same may be amended and supplemented by
mutual agreement of the Parties through and as of the Closing, and all such
Exhibits, as amended and supplemented, are hereby incorporated into this
Agreement by reference; provided, that each Party may withhold its agreement
to any such amendments in its sole discretion.

   

17.12Publicity; Public Disclosure

 

. From and after the date hereof, prior to making any press or other similar
release or public announcements regarding the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or public disclosure regarding the existence of this Agreement,
the contents hereof or the transactions contemplated hereby as required by
applicable securities or other laws or regulations, or the applicable rules of

the other Party regarding the proposed contents thereof, but no approval

17.14Severability

 

. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or
incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other
conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
contemplated transactions is not affected in any material adverse manner to
either Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
contemplated transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

intermediaries) controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control
with, such first mentioned person or entity, or (ii) which beneficially owns,
holds, or controls fifty percent (50%) or more of the interest of such first
mentioned person or entity. The term "control" (including the terms
"controlled by" and "under common control with") means the possession,
directly or indirectly or as trustee or executor, of the power to direct or
cause the direction of the management policies of a person or entity, whether
through the ownership of stock, as trustee or executor, by contract or credit
arrangement or otherwise.

and warranties of Purchaser contained in Article 7 shall survive the Closing

covenants of the Parties under this Agreement (i) to be performed at or prior
to the Closing shall expire and be of no further force or effect after the
date that is sixty (60) days following 

---|--- 

   

    |  

the Closing, and (ii) to be performed after the Closing shall survive the
Closing until fully performed; provided, however, that any covenants of the
Parties under this Agreement relating to Taxes shall survive until sixty (60)

---|--- 

 

    

17.16.2

warranty of Seller that is not a Fundamental Representation or a
representation or warranty contained in Section 6.2.5: (i) for any individual
claim for Costs that does not exceed $50,000.00 (the "Individual Threshold");
(ii) until Purchaser has suffered Costs (including the total amounts of all
claims that exceed the Individual Threshold) in the aggregate in excess of an
amount equal to three percent (3%) of the Purchase Price (the "Aggregate
Indemnity Deductible"), after which point Seller will be obligated only to
indemnify Purchaser from and against further Costs including only the total
amount of all claims that exceed the Individual Threshold) in excess of the
Aggregate Indemnity Deductible; and (iii) in the aggregate in excess of twenty
percent (20%) of the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, in no event will Seller's aggregate liability under this Agreement
exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the unadjusted Purchase Price. 

---|--- 

 

17.17Attorney's Fees

 

. Any Party successfully pursuing a claim for the enforcement of any
provision of this Agreement, including, without limitation, agreements of
indemnity contained herein or any of the documents to be delivered pursuant
hereto, shall be entitled to recover from the unsuccessful Party reasonable
attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses incurred by the successful
Party in such action.

 

17.18Certain Limitations

 

. Seller and PURCHASER agree that, except for the liquidated damages
specifically provided for in Section 2.3, AND THE POSSIBILITY OF THE RECOVERY
BY SELLER OF INCIDENTAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES AS SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED IN
SECTION 15.2, the recovery by either Party of any damages suffered or incurred
by it as a result of any breach by the other Party of any of its
representations, warranties, COVENANTS or obligations under this Agreement
shall be limited to the actual damages suffered or incurred by the
nonbreaching Party as a result of the breach by the breaching Party of its
representations, warranties or obligations hereunder and in no event shall the
breaching Party be liable to the nonbreaching Party for any indirect,
consequential, special, exemplary or punitive damages (including, without
limitation, any damages on account of lost profits or opportunities, business
interruption or lost or delayed production) suffered or incurred by the
nonbreaching Party as a result of the breach by the breaching Party of any of
its representations, warranties or obligations hereunder. For purposes of the
foregoing, actual damages may, however, include indirect, consequential,
special, exemplary or punitive damages to the extent (i) the injuries or
losses resulting in or giving rise to such damages are incurred or suffered by
a person which is not Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, or its Affiliates
and (ii) such damages are

   

recovered against Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, by a person which is not
Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, or its Affiliates. This Section 17.18
shall operate only to limit a Party's liability and shall not operate to
increase or expand any contractual obligation of a party hereunder or cause
any contractual obligation of a party hereunder to survive longer than
provided in Section 17.16.

 

17.19Exchange

 

. Seller shall have the right to utilize all or part of the Assets and the
sales proceeds therefrom as part of a Tax deferred exchange pursuant to
Section 1031 of the IRC and applicable state and local Tax laws. In
connection with an exchange, and notwithstanding the terms of Section 17.4,
all or part of Seller's rights under this Agreement may be assigned, without
the need for Purchaser's consent, to an intermediary, escrow agent, trustee,
or other exchange accommodation party, provided that such assignment shall not
relieve Seller of its obligations to Purchaser hereunder. Purchaser shall
cooperate with Seller in effecting such an exchange, including, without
limitation, the execution of escrow instructions and other instruments,
provided that: (i) the acquisition and exchange of any exchange property
shall not impose upon Purchaser any additional financial obligation other than
as set out in this Agreement; (ii) Purchaser shall have no obligation to
become a holder of record title to any exchange property; (iii) Seller shall
indemnify and hold Purchaser harmless from any and all Costs which Purchaser
incurs or to which Purchaser may be exposed as a result of Purchaser's
participation in the contemplated exchange, including reasonable attorneys'
fees and costs of defense; (iv) the Closing shall not be delayed or affected
by reason of such exchange nor shall the consummation or accomplishment of
such exchange be a condition precedent or condition subsequent to Seller's
obligations under this Agreement; (v) Purchaser shall not, by this Agreement
or acquiescence to such exchange, have its rights under this Agreement
affected or diminished in any manner; and (vi) Purchaser shall not, by this
Agreement or acquiescence to such exchange, be responsible for compliance with
or deemed to have warranted to Seller that such exchange in fact complies with
Section 1031 of the IRC or any state or local Tax law. If any type of
exchange contemplated by Seller should fail to occur prior to Closing, for
whatever reason, the sale of the Assets shall nonetheless be consummated as
provided herein.

 

17.20Written Instructions

 

. Each Party covenants and agrees that when any person becomes entitled to
any distribution of the Performance Deposit or any Escrow Amount pursuant to
any provision of this Agreement, each such Party shall promptly, and in any
event within two (2) business days, execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent
joint written instructions (a "Joint Direction") setting forth the amounts to
be distributed in accordance with this Agreement. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, if any Party shall fail to execute and deliver a
Joint Direction within the time period specified in this Section 17.20, any of
Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, shall be entitled to receive the
applicable distributions from the Escrow Agent promptly upon delivery to the
Escrow Agent of a written instruction, order or judgment issued or entered by
a court of competent jurisdiction setting forth the amount to be paid to such
person.
