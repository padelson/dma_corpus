AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   THIS AGREEMENT and PLAN OF MERGER (this
"AGREEMENT") is entered into as of March 21, 2001 by and between Avnet, Inc.,
a New York corporation ("PARENT"), Alpha Acquisition Corp., a Texas
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("BUYER"), and Kent
Electronics Corporation, a Texas corporation ("COMPANY").   RECITALS  
WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Buyer and Company have
each approved the acquisition of Company upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth herein;   WHEREAS, to induce Parent and Buyer to
enter into this Agreement, (i) certain beneficial and record holders of
capital stock of Company are entering into an Inducement Agreement (the
"INDUCEMENT AGREEMENT") with Parent, the form of which is attached hereto as
Annex A to this Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, such record
holders have granted to Parent an irrevocable proxy to vote their capital
stock of Company in favor of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(ii) Larry D. Olson and Mark A. Zerbe have each executed and delivered an
employment agreement with Parent, effective as of the Effective Time, in form
and substance acceptable to Parent, and (iii) Company is entering into an
Option Agreement (the "OPTION AGREEMENT") granting Parent the right to
acquire up to 2,863,474 shares of common stock, without par value, of Company
("COMPANY COMMON STOCK") upon the terms and conditions set forth therein, in
the form of Annex B to this Agreement;   WHEREAS, Parent, Buyer and Company
intend the Merger to qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of
Section 368(a) of the Code;   WHEREAS, Parent, Buyer and Company desire to
make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in
connection with this Agreement and prescribe various conditions to the
Merger; and   WHEREAS, capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise
defined where referenced shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in
Article VIII hereof.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing
premises and of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:   7  ARTICLE I 
THE MERGER   SECTION 1.01 The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined below), Buyer will be
merged with and into Company and the separate corporate existence of Buyer
will thereupon cease (the "MERGER"). Company will be the surviving
corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the
"SURVIVING CORPORATION") and will continue to be governed by the laws of the
State of Texas. The separate corporate existence of Company with all its
rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises will continue
unaffected by the Merger and Company will succeed to all of the rights and
properties of Buyer and will be subject to all of the debts and liabilities
of Buyer.   SECTION 1.02 Closing. The closing of the transactions
contemplated hereby (the "CLOSING") will take place (i) at the primary
offices of Carter, Ledyard and Milburn at 10:00 A.M., New York time on the
second business day after the day on which the last of the conditions set
forth in ARTICLE V is fulfilled or waived in accordance with this Agreement
or (ii) at such other place and time or on such other date as the parties
hereto may agree (the date of the Closing, the "CLOSING DATE").   SECTION
1.03 Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement and provided
that this Agreement has not been terminated or abandoned pursuant to ARTICLE
VI, articles of merger (the "ARTICLES OF MERGER") shall be duly prepared,
executed and acknowledged by Company and thereafter delivered to
the Secretary of State of Texas for filing in accordance with Section 5.04 of
the Texas Business Corporation Act (the "TBCA"), on or as soon as practicable
after the Closing Date. The Merger will become effective immediately upon the
issuance of a certificate of merger by the Secretary of State of Texas
pursuant to Section 5.05 of the TBCA (or, if the Articles of Merger provide
for a subsequent time for effectiveness, at the time thereafter so provided
in the Articles of Merger, as provided in Section 10.03 of the TBCA); the
time of such effectiveness is hereinafter referred to as the "EFFECTIVE
TIME"; and the date of such effectiveness is hereinafter referred to as the
"EFFECTIVE DATE."   SECTION 1.04 Articles of Incorporation. The Articles of
Incorporation of Company in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
will be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation at and
after the Effective Time until duly amended in accordance with the terms
thereof and the applicable provisions of the TBCA.   SECTION 1.05 By-Laws.
The By-Laws of Company in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time will
be the By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation at and after the Effective Time
until duly amended in accordance with the terms thereof and the applicable
provisions of the TBCA.   SECTION 1.06 Officers and Directors. The persons
serving as directors of Buyer immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
continue as the directors of the Surviving    -2-  8 Corporation at and
after the Effective Time, and the individuals specified by Parent in writing
prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation at and after the Effective Time, in each case until
their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
Surviving Corporation\'s Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws.   SECTION
1.07 Intentionally Omitted.   SECTION 1.08 Conversion of Shares. Except as
otherwise provided herein, at the Effective Time:   (a) Each share of
Company Common Stock ("COMPANY SHARES") issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares canceled pursuant to this
Section 1.08) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive 0.87 of a
fully paid and nonassessable share ("CONVERSION RATIO") of Common Stock of
Parent, par value $1.00 per share ("PARENT Stock"); provided, however, that
if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different
number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, or
exchange of shares, the securities to be received by the shareholders of
the Company shall be appropriately and correspondingly adjusted to reflect
such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, combination or exchange of shares.   (b) Each Company Common Share
held immediately prior to the Effective Time by Company, Parent or Buyer or
any of their wholly-owned subsidiaries (other than shares held in trust or
otherwise in a representative capacity) (the "CANCELED SHARES") shall be
retired automatically, and no consideration shall be payable with respect
thereto.   (c) Each share of common stock of Buyer, par value $1.00 per
share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, be converted into one share of common stock, without par value, of
the Surviving Corporation.   SECTION 1.09 Surrender of Shares; Transfer
Books.   (a) Exchange Agent. Before the mailing of the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, Parent will appoint a bank or trust company to
act as exchange agent (the "EXCHANGE AGENT") for the payment of the
Merger Consideration. Parent will furnish the Exchange Agent forthwith upon
the Effective Time with cash (to the extent required by Section 1.09(e))
and certificates representing such number of shares of Parent Stock as the
Exchange Agent shall require in order to transmit the Merger Consideration
to shareholders surrendering certificates that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented Company Shares in accordance with paragraph (b) of
this Section 1.09    -3-  9  (b) Exchange Procedures for Shares of
Company Common Stock. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Exchange Agent to transmit to each holder of record of a
certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Company
Shares (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to such certificates shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be
in customary form) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of such certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder of
an outstanding certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented Company Shares shall, upon surrender to the
Exchange Agent of such certificate or certificates in accordance with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed, and acceptance thereof by the Exchange
Agent, be entitled to a certificate or certificates representing the number
of full shares of Parent Stock, if any, to be received by the holder thereof
pursuant to this Agreement and the cash, if any, payable in lieu of any
fractional shares. The Exchange Agent will accept such certificates upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent
may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. After the Effective Time, there will be no further
transfer on the records of the Surviving Corporation or its transfer agent of
Company Shares which have been converted pursuant to this Agreement into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, and if certificates immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented Company Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for transfer, they will be canceled against delivery of
certificates for Parent Stock (and cash to the extent required by Section
1.09(e)). If any certificate for such Parent Stock is to be issued in, or if
cash is to be remitted to, a name other than that in which the
certificate that formerly represented Company Shares surrendered for exchange
is registered, it will be a condition of such exchange that the certificate
so surrendered will be properly endorsed, with signature guaranteed, or
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such
exchange will pay to the Surviving Corporation or its transfer agent any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of certificates
for such Parent Stock in a name other than that of the registered holder of
the certificate surrendered, or establish to the satisfaction of the
Surviving Corporation or its transfer agent that such tax has been paid or is
not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.09(b),
each certificate that formerly represented Company Shares which have been
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration will be deemed
at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive
upon such surrender the Merger Consideration as contemplated by Section 1.08
and Section 1.09(e). No interest will be paid or will accrue on any
cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Stock.   (c)
Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
certificate that formerly represented Company Shares with respect to the
shares of Parent Stock to be received in respect thereof and no cash payment
in lieu of fractional shares will be paid to any such holder pursuant to
Section 1.09(e) until the surrender of such certificate in accordance with
this Article I. Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following surrender
of any such    -4-  10 certificate, there will be paid to the holder of
the certificate representing whole shares of Parent Stock issued in
connection herewith, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender the
amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Stock to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.09(e) and the
proportionate amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares
of Parent Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the proportionate
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but before such surrender and a payment date subsequent to
such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Stock.  
(d) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All
Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of certificates
that formerly represented Company Shares in accordance with the terms of this
Article I will be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to the Company Shares represented by such
certificates.   (e) No Fractional Shares; Exchange Agent.   (i) No
Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Parent Stock and no certificates
or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Stock will be issued in
connection with the Merger, and such fractional share interests will not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a shareholder of the
Surviving Corporation after the Merger.   (ii) Cash Payment in Lieu of
Fractional Shares. Each record holder of Company Shares converted pursuant to
the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a
share of Parent Stock (after taking into account all Company Shares held by
such holder) will be entitled to receive, in lieu thereof upon surrender of
the certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
Company Shares, a cash payment (without interest) in lieu of such fractional
share in an amount equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by
$25.84.   (iii) Termination of Exchange Agent\'s Duties. Any holders
of certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
Company Shares who have not complied with this Article I within six months
after the Effective Time will thereafter look only to Parent for payment of
the Merger Consideration.   (iv) No Liability. None of Parent, Buyer,
Company or the Exchange Agent will be liable to any person in respect of any
shares of Parent Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto)
or cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law. If any certificates that immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented Company Shares have not been surrendered
before such date on which any shares of Parent Stock, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Stock, or any dividends or distributions with
respect to shares of Parent Stock in respect of such certificate would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental entity, any
such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in    -5-  11 respect of
such certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.   SECTION 1.10 Options
and Warrants. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of
Company and the Board of Directors of Parent (or, if appropriate, respective
committees thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions and take such action
as may be required, under the Option Plans (as defined in Section 2.02) such
that, at the Effective Time,   (i) each Option Plan shall continue in
existence and each Option (as defined in Section 2.02) under each such Option
Plan, whether or not then exercisable, shall be assumed by Parent and
converted into an option ("ASSUMED OPTION") to acquire on the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under the Option, shares of Parent Stock;
provided, that (A)the number of shares of Parent Stock subject to such
Assumed Option under such Option Plan shall be determined by multiplying the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Option by the
Conversion Ratio (with such share number rounded down to the nearest whole
number), and (B) the exercise price of each such Assumed Option shall be
determined by dividing the exercise price of the Option by the Conversion
Ratio (with such exercise price rounded up to the nearest penny); provided
further, however, that, in the case of any Option to which Code Section 421
applies by reason of its qualification under any of Code Sections
422-424, the option exercise price, the number of shares that may be acquired
pursuant to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such
Option shall be determined to comply with Code Section 425(a), and   (ii)
each Warrant (as defined in Section 2.02), whether or not then exercisable,
will be converted into a right to acquire shares of Parent Stock, subject to
terms and conditions materially equivalent, in the reasonable judgment of the
Board of Directors of Parent, to the terms and conditions set out in such
Warrant; provided, that (iii) the number of shares of Parent Stock subject to
such right shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Warrant by the Conversion Ratio (with such share
number rounded down to the nearest whole number); and (iv) the exercise price
of such right shall be determined by dividing the exercise price of
such Warrant by the Conversion Ratio.   (b) Parent shall take all corporate
action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of
Parent Stock for delivery upon exercise of the Assumed Options. As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration
statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate forms) or a
post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement, with respect to the
shares of Parent Stock subject to the Assumed Options and shall use its best
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or
registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses in connection therewith) for so long as any Assumed Options
remain outstanding    -6-  12  SECTION 1.11 Affiliates. Certificates
representing Parent Stock issued to any director or executive officer of
Company or any other Person deemed by Company to be an "AFFILIATE," for
purposes of Rule 145(c) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"), of Company ("COMPANY AFFILIATES") will bear an appropriate
restrictive legend. On or prior to the Closing Date, Company will deliver to
Parent a list certified by an appropriate executive officer of Company of all
persons who are then Company Affiliates. Company will promptly amend or
supplement this list as changes occur. Company will cause each person named
in any such list, amendment or supplement to deliver promptly to Parent a
letter substantially in the form of ANNEX C to this Agreement.   SECTION
1.12 Closing Day Payments. On the Closing Date and without the further
consent of Parent or Buyer (provided, however, with respect to all payments
which are disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule as estimated payments, only
after reasonable consultation with Parent concerning the actual
payment amounts), Company shall be entitled to make any payment to employees,
advisors or other parties which are conditioned in whole or in part on the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, to the extent and only
to the extent such persons and such payments are specifically disclosed in
Section 1.12 of the Disclosure Schedule.   ARTICLE II  REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES OF COMPANY   Company makes the representations and warranties set
forth in this Article II to Parent and Buyer. All representations and
warranties of Company set forth in this Article II are made subject to the
exceptions which are noted in the schedules delivered by Company to Parent
and Buyer concurrently herewith and identified by the parties as the
"Disclosure Schedule". The Disclosure Schedule has been delivered by Company
to Parent and Buyer on the date hereof, and the Disclosure Schedule has been
reviewed and accepted by Parent and Buyer. Each exception noted in the
Disclosure Schedule is numbered to correspond to the applicable Section of
this Article II or other Article to which such exception refers; provided,
however, that all exceptions set forth in the Disclosure Schedule shall be
deemed to be disclosed not only in connection with the representation and
warranty specifically referenced on a specified section of the Disclosure
Schedule, but for all purposes relating to each of the other representations
and warranties of Company set forth in this Article II so long as the
relevance of such disclosure to such other representation or warranty
is reasonably apparent from the terms of such disclosure without
investigation by Parent or Buyer.   SECTION 2.01 Organization;
Subsidiaries   (a) Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the State of Texas, and, except as
disclosed in Section 2.01 of the Disclosure Schedule, each of its
Subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and is in good
standing as a foreign corporation qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction where    -7-  13 the properties owned, leased or operated,
or the business conducted by it requires such qualification, except for such
failure to so qualify or to be in such good standing which is not reasonably
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Company and its
Subsidiaries have the requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate
their respective properties and to carry on their respective businesses as
now being conducted.   (b) Section 2.01 of the Disclosure Schedule lists all
Subsidiaries of Company and correctly sets forth the capitalization of each
such Subsidiary, the jurisdiction in which Company and each such Subsidiary
is organized or formed and each jurisdiction in which Company and each such
Subsidiary is qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign corporation.
As used in this Agreement, the term "SUBSIDIARY" shall mean, with respect to
any party, any corporation or other organization, whether incorporated or
unincorporated or domestic or foreign to the United States of which (a) such
party or any other Subsidiary of such party is a general partner (excluding
such partnerships where such party or any Subsidiary of such party does not
have a majority of the voting interest in such partnership) or (b) at least a
majority of the securities or other interests having by their terms ordinary
voting power to elect a majority of the board of directors or others
performing similar functions with respect to such corporation or other
organization is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by such party or
by any one or more of its Subsidiaries, or by such party and one or more of
its Subsidiaries. Section 2.01 of the Disclosure Schedule correctly lists the
current directors and officers of Company and of each of its Subsidiaries.
True, correct and complete copies of the respective charter documents and by-
laws of Company and each of its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date hereof
have been made available to Buyer.   (c) All outstanding securities or other
ownership interests in each of the Subsidiaries listed on Section 2.01 of the
Disclosure Schedule, except as disclosed on Section 2.01 of the Disclosure
Schedule, are owned of record and beneficially by Company or another of
Company\'s wholly-owned Subsidiaries, subject to no lien, claim, charge or
encumbrance, and have been duly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable. Company does not directly or indirectly own or hold any
interest in any corporation, association or business entity other than those
listed on Section 2.01 of the Disclosure Schedule. There are no irrevocable
proxies, voting agreements, or voting trusts with respect to any of the
securities or other ownership interests of the Subsidiaries and no
restrictions on Company to vote any of the stock or other securities of any
of the Subsidiaries.   SECTION 2.02 Capitalization.   (a) The authorized
capital stock of Company consists of (i) 60,000,000 shares of Company Common
Stock; and (ii) 2,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per
share, which shares have been designated as Series A Preferred Stock (the
"PREFERRED STOCK"). As of February 12, 2001 (a) 28,634,737 shares of Company
Common Stock were issued and outstanding, (b) no shares of Preferred Stock

is the plaintiff and related countersuits. Except as disclosed in Section
2.13 of the Disclosure Schedule, there is no pending or, to Company\'s

similar entity that (i) involves a claimed amount against the Company or any
Subsidiary equal to or greater than $100,000, (ii) would reasonably be
expected to result in the payment by the Company or any Subsidiary of damages
or settlement in an amount equal to or greater than $100,000, or (iii) that

Material    -19-  25 Adverse Effect or could reasonably be expected to
impair Company\'s ability to consummate the Merger.   SECTION 2.14
Licenses; Compliance with Law; Accuracy of Certain Information. Except as
disclosed in Section 2.14 of the Disclosure Schedule, all licenses,
franchises, permits and other governmental authorizations (collectively,
"LICENSES") held by Company and its Subsidiaries that are used in Company\'s
Business are valid and sufficient for all business presently carried on by
Company, except where the failure to maintain such valid and

such Licenses is threatened or imminent. No such License has been revoked,
conditioned (except as may be customary) or restricted and no action
(equitable, legal or administrative), arbitration or other process is

benefits, in amounts customary and reasonable for the line of business of
Company and against all risks usually insured against by Persons of similar
size operating similar properties in the localities where such properties are
located under valid and enforceable policies issued by insurers of recognized
responsibility, except where failure to so insure would not be reasonably
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 2.17

a Company Material Adverse Effect:    -20-  26  (a) Each of Company and

of the Company Intellectual Property is subject to any outstanding order,
ruling, decree, judgment or stipulation by or with any court, tribunal,
arbitrator, or other Governmental Entity.   (b) Neither the Company nor any

secret; (ii) against the use by the Company or its Subsidiaries of any

would become a default), or impair the Company\'s or any of its
Subsidiaries\' rights or alter the rights or obligations of any third party
under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration
or cancellation of, any license agreement, contract or other arrangement of
any nature relating to Company Intellectual Property Rights or Third Party
Intellectual Property Rights.   SECTION 2.19 Labor Matters. There are no

Interest. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken or agreed or
intends to take any action, nor does the Company have any knowledge of any

interpretations of the SEC.   SECTION 2.24 Full Disclosure. No
representation or warranty by the Company herein (including the Schedules and
Annexes hereto) or in any certificate furnished by or on behalf of the

customary reclassification year-end adjustments). Except as and to the extent
reflected or reserved against in such consolidated balance sheets (including

contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.   SECTION 3.08 No Material Adverse Effect. Since June 30, 2000
there has not been any event which has had or is likely to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 3.09 Accuracy of Proxy

-27-  33 will contain all statements concerning Parent and Buyer which are
required to be set forth therein in accordance with the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act; and at such respective times, the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will not include any untrue statement of a material fact

to make the statements therein not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Parent and Buyer make no representation or warranty with respect to any
information concerning Company or any of Company\'s Subsidiaries or advisors
included or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus.  
SECTION 3.10 Reorganization. Neither Parent nor Buyer has taken or agreed or
intends to take any action, nor does Parent have any knowledge of any fact
or circumstance, which would prevent the Merger from constituting a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.   SECTION

officers, directors or employees has employed any broker or finder
or incurred any liability for any financial advisory, brokerage or finder\'s

Incorporated as its financial advisor, whose fees and expenses will be paid

hereby and all the information included in the Parent SEC Filings, contains
or will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omits or will omit
to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements herein or
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.   SECTION 3.13 Compliance with Law. All Licenses held by Parent
and its Subsidiaries that are material in connection with Parent\'s Business
are valid and sufficient for all business presently carried on by Parent and
its Subsidiaries, except where the failure to maintain such valid and
sufficient license would not be reasonably likely to result in a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. No suspension, cancellation or termination of any
such Licenses is threatened or imminent. Parent\'s Business is being
conducted in compliance with all applicable Laws and is not being conducted
in violation of any Law, except for violations which either individually or
in the aggregate are not reasonably likely to result in a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.   SECTION 3.14 Taxes. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries
have filed all Tax Returns required to be filed by them, or requests for
extensions to file such Tax Returns have been timely filed and granted and
have not expired, except where failures to file such Tax Returns or request
such extensions would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, and all such Tax Returns are
complete and accurate in all material respects. Parent and each of its
Subsidiaries    -28-  34 have paid (or Parent has paid on their behalf)
all Taxes, whether or not shown as due on such Tax Returns. The most recent

duties as advised by counsel (the "COMPANY SHAREHOLDERS MEETING" and "PARENT
SHAREHOLDERS MEETING", respectively). Each of Company and Parent shall,
through its Board of Directors recommend to their respective shareholders
approval of such matters and shall use its best efforts to obtain such
approval by its shareholders unless, (i) in the case of Company, Company\'s
Board of Directors determines in good faith, after receipt of written advice
from Locke Liddell and Sapp LLP, counsel to Company, that such action creates a
reasonable likelihood of constituting a breach of the fiduciary duties of
Company\'s Board of Directors to Company\'s shareholders under applicable
law, and (ii) in the case of Parent, Parent\'s Board of Directors determines
in good faith, after receipt of written advice from Carter, Ledyard and
Milburn, counsel to Parent, that such action creates a reasonable likelihood
of constituting a breach of the fiduciary duties of Parent\'s Board of
Directors to Parent\'s shareholders under applicable law. Company and Parent
agree to postpone, delay or adjourn their respective meetings, or to convene
a second meeting, in the event insufficient voting shares are present to
conduct the meeting.   (b) Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and Registration

the SEC with respect to the Registration Statement and advise Company of any
verbal comments received from the SEC with respect thereto. Parent shall also
take any action (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in
which it is now not so qualified) required to be taken under the securities
or "BLUE SKY" laws of the various States in connection with the issuance of
the Parent Stock pursuant to the Merger.   (c) Indemnification. Each of
Company and Parent (each an "INDEMNIFYING PARTY") agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless the other, each person who controls the other within the
meaning of the Securities Act, and each director and officer of the other,
against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (including
reasonable counsel fees and costs of investigation and defense) that are
based on the ground or alleged ground that the Registration Statement, at the
time of its effectiveness, includes an untrue statement of a material fact
concerning such Indemnifying Party or omits to state a material fact
concerning such Indemnifying Party required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein not misleading. These indemnity
obligations will remain in force after any termination of this Agreement.

No. 16 (Business Combinations) of the Accounting Principles Board of the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board, and the rules and regulations of the SEC. Notwithstanding

the other party.   SECTION 4.08 Notification of Defaults and Adverse
Events. Company and Parent will promptly notify each other if, subsequent to
the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Date: (i) an event

Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect, respectively, or (ii) any suit,
action or proceeding is instituted or, to the knowledge of Company or Parent,
threatened against or affecting Company or Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries which, if adversely determined, would be reasonably likely to
result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Each of Company and Parent will promptly notify the other if it
determines it is or will be unable to comply with any of its obligations
under this Agreement or fulfill any conditions under its control.   
-34-  40  SECTION 4.09 Satisfy Conditions to Closing. Parent and Company
shall each use its reasonable best efforts to cause all conditions to Closing

practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate
the effects of such anti-takeover or similar statute on the transactions
contemplated hereby.   SECTION 4.11 Indemnification; Insurance.   (a)
Indemnification. At all times after the Effective Time, Parent and Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless, each present and
former director and officer of Company and each such person\'s
personal representative, estate, testator or intestate successors (the
"INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") against any and all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, costs, expenses, judgments and amounts paid in settlement with
the approval of Parent and Surviving Corporation (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld) in connection with any actual or threatened claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or pertaining to any
action or omission occurring prior to the Effective Time (including without
limitation, any which arise out of or relate to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement), whether asserted or claimed prior to, or on or after, the
Effective Time, to the full extent Company would be permitted under the TBCA
or Company\'s Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws in effect as of the date
of this Agreement (to the extent consistent with applicable law), including,
without limitation, provisions relating to advances of expenses incurred in
the defense of any action or suit, provided that any determination required
to be made with respect to whether an Indemnified Party\'s conduct complies
with the standards set forth under Texas law and the Company\'s Articles of
Incorporation and By-laws shall be made by independent counsel appointed by
the Surviving Corporation\'s Board of Directors that shall be acceptable to
the Indemnified Party. In addition, Parent and Surviving Corporation shall
pay or reimburse, to the maximum extent permissible under the TBCA, expenses
incurred by an Indemnified Party in advance of the final disposition of any
such action or proceeding after Parent and Surviving Corporation receive a
written affirmation by the Indemnified Party of his good faith belief that he
has met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification under the TBCA
and a written undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party to repay
the amount paid or reimbursed if it is ultimately determined that
indemnification of the Indemnified Party is prohibited by Article 2.02-1E of
the TBCA. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation is brought against any Indemnified Party,
Parent shall be entitled to assume the defense of any such action or
proceeding. Upon assumption by Parent of the defense of any such action or
proceeding, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in such
action or proceeding and to retain its own counsel, but Parent and Surviving
Corporation shall not be liable for any legal fees or expenses subsequently
incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the
defense thereof    -35-  41 unless (i) Parent and Surviving Corporation
have agreed to pay such fees and expenses, (ii) the Indemnified Party shall
have been advised by counsel reasonably acceptable to Parent and Surviving
Corporation that representation of the Indemnified Party by counsel provided
by Parent is not possible due to conflicts of interest between Parent, Buyer
or the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Party, or (iii) Parent and
Surviving Corporation shall have failed in a timely manner to assume the
defense of the matter Parent shall not be liable for any settlement of any
claim effected without its written consent. Parent and Surviving Corporation
shall not, except with the written consent of the Indemnified Party, consent
to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include
as an unconditional term the release by the claimant or plaintiff of such
Indemnified Party from all further liability in respect of such claim. Any
Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section
4.11(a), upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall notify Parent and Surviving Corporation (but the failure
so to notify Parent and Surviving Corporation shall not relieve it from any
liability which it may have under this Section 4.11(a) except to the extent
such failure materially prejudices Parent and Surviving Corporation).
In addition to the foregoing, and without limiting in any manner the
foregoing, after the Effective Time Parent and Surviving Corporation shall
assume the obligations of Company under the indemnification agreements set
forth in Section 4.04(c), but only to the extent Company would be permitted
under the TBCA to perform its obligations under such indemnification
agreements.   (b) Insurance. For a period of six (6) years after the
Effective Date, Parent shall cause (or shall cause the Surviving Corporation)
to be maintained officers\' and directors\' liability insurance covering
Company\'s existing officers and directors who are currently covered in such
capacities by Company\'s existing officers\' and directors\' liability
insurance policies on terms substantially no less advantageous to such
officers and directors than such existing insurance   SECTION 4.12 Employee
Benefits. (a) At the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall offer
all persons who are at the Effective Time employees of Company and its
Subsidiaries benefits under Parent Benefit Plans which, in the aggregate, are
no less favorable to such employees than those that Parent currently provides
to its own employees. Each Parent Benefit Plan shall give credit for purposes
of eligibility to participate and vesting to employees of Company and its
Subsidiaries for service prior to the Effective Time with Company and its
Subsidiaries (and their predecessors, to the extent credit for service with
such predecessors was given by Company) to the same extent that such service
was recognized under a comparable Company Benefit Plan.   (b) Parent hereby
agrees that as of the Closing Date Company may pay to Company employees party
to the agreements set forth in Section 4.12 of the Disclosure Schedule the
payments and other benefits provided thereby regardless of such employee\'s
employment status with Company on or after the date thereof, to the extent
and only to the extent specifically disclosed in Section 4.12 of the
Disclosure Schedule.    -36-  42  SECTION 4.13 No Solicitation. From and
after the date hereof, Company shall not, and shall not authorize or permit
any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives to, directly or indirectly,
solicit or initiate (including by way of furnishing information) or take any
other action to facilitate knowingly any inquiries or the making of any
proposal which constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal from any person or entity, or engage in any discussion
or negotiations relating thereto or accept any Acquisition Proposal;
provided, however, that notwithstanding any other provision hereof, Company
may   (a) comply with Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with regard to
a tender or exchange offer; and   (b) at any time prior to the Closing:  
(i) engage in discussions or negotiations with a third party who (without any
solicitation, initiation, encouragement, discussion or negotiation, directly
or indirectly, by or with Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or Representatives after the date hereof) seeks to initiate such discussions
or negotiations, and may furnish such third party nonpublic information
concerning Company and its business, properties and assets if, and only to
the extent that:   (A) (1) the third party has first made a bona fide 
Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of Company believes in  good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisor) is reasonably  capable
of being completed, taking into account all relevant, legal,  financial,
regulatory and other aspects of the Acquisition Proposal and the  source of
its financing, and believes in good faith (after consultation  with its
financial advisor and after considering all of the terms,  conditions,
representations, warranties and covenants which are included in  such
Acquisition Proposal) that such Acquisition Proposal would, if  consummated,
result in a transaction more favorable to the shareholders of  Company, from
a financial point of view, than the transactions contemplated  by this
Agreement and believes in good faith (after consultation with its  financial
advisor) that the person making such Acquisition Proposal has, or  is
reasonably likely to have or obtain, any necessary funds or customary 
commitments to provide any funds necessary to consummate such Acquisition 
Proposal (any such Acquisition Proposal being referred to in this Agreement 
as a "SUPERIOR PROPOSAL") and (2) Company\'s Board of Directors shall 
conclude in good faith, after considering applicable provisions of state 
law, that such action may be necessary for the Board of Directors to act in 
a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, and  
(B) forty-eight hours prior to furnishing such information  to or entering
into discussions or negotiations with such person or entity,  Company (1)
provides prompt notice to Parent to the effect that it is  furnishing
information to or entering into discussions or negotiations with  such person
or entity and (2) receives from such person or entity an  executed
confidentiality agreement in    -37-  43  reasonably customary form on
terms not materially more favorable to such  person or entity than the terms
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement,  or   (ii) accept a Superior
Proposal from a third party, provided that the conditions set forth in
clauses Section 4.13(b)(i)(A) and Section 4.13(b)(i)(B) above have been
satisfied and Company complies with and terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 6.01(h).   Company shall immediately cease and terminate any
existing solicitation, initiation, encouragement, activity, discussion or
negotiation with any persons or entities conducted heretofore by Company or
any of its Subsidiaries of Representatives with respect to the foregoing. The
Company shall notify Parent orally and in writing of any such inquiries,
offers or proposals (including the terms and conditions of any such proposal
and the identity of the person making it) within twenty-four hours of the
receipt thereof, and shall keep Parent informed of the status and details of
any such inquiry, offer, or proposal except to the extent doing so would
constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors.  
SECTION 4.14 Rights Agreement. Company shall take all necessary
action (including, if required, redeeming all of the outstanding stock
purchase rights or amending or terminating the Rights Agreement) so that the
entering into of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not result in a
"Distribution Date" under the Rights Agreement.   SECTION 4.15 Option
Vesting. Except as contractually obligated prior to the date hereof, Company
shall not take any action at any time prior to the Closing which may serve to
accelerate the vesting of any Option granted by Company.   SECTION 4.16
Special Earnings Announcement. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
to publish or cause to be published no later than 15 days after the end of
the first month after the Effective Time (which month may be the month

figures contemplated by and in accordance with the terms of SEC Accounting
Release No. 135.   SECTION 4.17 Reorganization. Neither Parent, Buyer nor

applicable Laws and the policies of the NYSE.   (b) Approval from

Company Material Adverse Effect. The waiting period under the HSR Act shall
have expired, or early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act
shall have been granted.   (c) Absence of Governmental Litigation. Since the
date of this Agreement, no Governmental Entity shall have instituted a

Parent, Buyer and Company will be a party to that reorganization within the
meaning of Code Section 368(b) and that neither Parent, Buyer nor Company
will recognize any gain on the Merger; provided, however, that if counsel to

performance of this Agreement and the Merger shall have been duly and validly
taken by Company, except to the extent that the failure to take such
corporate    -39-  45 actions would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect or make execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement and the
Merger unenforceable or invalid.   (b) Representations and Compliance. The
representations and warranties of Company in this Agreement shall be true and
correct in all material respects (other than representations and warranties
that are already so qualified, which in each such case shall be true and

with the same effect as though made on and as of such date, except (i) that
representations and warranties which specifically relate to a particular date
or period shall be true and correct as of such date or for such period, and

complied in all material respects (other than covenants that are already so
qualified, which in each such case shall be complied with as written) with
all covenants requiring compliance by it prior to the Closing Date,

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and Buyer shall have
received an officer\'s certificate signed by the Chief Executive Officer of
Company certifying as to each of the foregoing.   (c) No Material Adverse
