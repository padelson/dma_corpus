 The Purchase Price, as so adjusted, is the "Adjusted Purchase Price". 

   

 2.3 _Purchase Price Allocation_ For Tax purposes, on or before the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall agree in writing as to the allocation of the Purchase Price among the Properties under the methodology required pursuant to Section 1060 of the Code (the "Purchase Price Allocation"). If an adjustment to the Purchase Price is made under this Agreement, the Parties shall adjust the Purchase Price Allocation to be consistent with the Adjusted Purchase Price. Seller and Buyer shall report the transactions contemplated hereby on all U.S. federal income tax returns (including Form 8594 and all other information returns and supplements thereto required to be filed by the Parties under Section 1060 of the Code) in a manner consistent with such Purchase Price Allocation. In the event that the allocation is disputed by any taxing authority, the Party receiving notice of such dispute will promptly notify and consult with the other Party and keep the other Party apprised of material developments concerning resolution of such dispute. 

   

 2.4 _Performance Deposit_. On or before noon Houston time, July 30, 2010, Buyer shall have initiated the wire transfer of immediately available funds (and provided reasonable evidence of such initiation) to Seller (or its designee) equal to Two Hundred Fifty Million Dollars ($250,000,000), which constitutes 38.46% of the Purchase Price ( the "Performance Deposit"). Seller shall provide Buyer wiring instructions for the Performance Deposit at least three (3) Business Days prior to July 30, 2010. 

  

 2.5 _Segregation of the Concession Agreement_. The Parties acknowledge that the sale and purchase of the Properties pursuant hereto contemplates a partition of the Merged Concession Agreement. Notwithstanding any undivided percentage interest set forth in the applicable Deed of Assignment for the Merged Concession Agreement, the Parties acknowledge and agree that it is their intent that, pursuant to the transactions contemplated by 

   ##### 

  

 

this Agreement, Buyer own a divided contractor interest in the Merged
Concession Agreement and that the Merged Concession Agreement be operated by
the Parties pursuant to the terms of the Partition Agreement. As an integral
part of this Agreement, the Parties agree to execute and deliver at Closing
the Partition Agreement, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit "M", relating
to the partition of the Merged Concession Agreement, the measures to apply
pending such segregation and the Parties contractor interest therein. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that it is their intent, after the Closing
Date, to use commercially reasonable efforts (including the expenditure of
money) to effect a permanent segregation and demerger of the Western Desert
Area, which requires the approval of the A.R.E. parliament. 

   

ARTICLE III 
  _PREFERENTIAL RIGHTS AND CONSENTS TO ASSIGNMENT_  

    

 3.1 _Preferential Rights to Purchase_. Seller shall use Buyers good faith allocation of the Purchase Price set forth in Exhibit "A" to provide any required preferential right to purchase notifications in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, using the form of Preferential Purchase Right Notice Letter attached as Exhibit "I". 

   

 3.1.1 If, as of the Closing Date, a holder of a preferential purchase right ("PPR") has notified Seller that it elects to exercise its PPR with respect to the Properties to which its PPR applies (determined by and in accordance with the agreement in which the PPR arises), then the Properties covered by that PPR will not be sold to the Party originally executing this Agreement as "Buyer" (subject to the remaining provisions in this Article), and the Purchase Price will be reduced by the value allocated to such Properties in Exhibit "A". Buyer remains obligated to purchase the remainder of the Properties not affected by an exercised PPR or a PPR for which the time to exercise has not expired. Upon the consummation of the sale of any Properties to the holder of such preferential right, any such Properties shall be deemed for all purposes to constitute "Excluded Properties". 

   

 3.1.2 After the Closing, if for any reason the purchase and sale of the Properties covered by the PPR is not or cannot be consummated with the holder of the PPR that exercised its PPR or if the time for exercising the PPR expires without exercise by any holder of the PPR, Seller may so notify Buyer and within ten (10) Business Days after Buyers receipt of such notice, Seller shall sell, assign and convey to Buyer and Buyer shall purchase and accept from Seller such Properties pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and for the value allocated to such Properties in Exhibit "A" (except the Closing Date with respect to such Properties will be the date of assignment of such Properties from Seller to Buyer). 

   

 3.1.3 If on the Closing Date any PPR applicable to some Properties has not been waived and the time to elect has not elapsed, Closing with respect to such Properties affected thereby shall proceed. If (i) the holder of a PPR validly exercises its preferential right to purchase after the Closing, 

   ##### 

  

   

or (ii) the Parties inadvertently close on a Property subject to a PPR either
without having provided the required notification to the holder of such PPR
or without such holder having waived such PPR or the time for such holder
to exercise such PPR having expired, and after closing on such Property, the
holder of such PPR elects to exercise such PPR, then within ten (10) Business
Days of (i) or (ii) above (x) Buyer and Seller shall execute such instruments
as reasonably necessary to revoke, extinguish and/or rescind the
original assignment of such affected Property(ies) to Buyer and/or re-convey
such affected Properties to Seller, as appropriate (each hereinafter a
"Rescission"), effective as of the Effective Time, (y) Seller shall cause an
amount equal to (1) Buyers good faith allocation of the Purchase Price set
forth in Exhibit "A" attributable to such affected Property(ies), or, in the
case of an affected Property that is not allocated a value in Exhibit "A", as
may be mutually agreed by the Parties; provided that if no such agreement is
reached, such matter shall be an Arbitrable Dispute; (2) decreased by the
amount of Operating Revenues attributable to such Properties after the
Effective Time that are actually accounted for, collected or retained by
Buyer; (3) increased by the Charges attributable to such Properties after the
Effective Time that are paid or accounted for by Buyer; and (4) increased by
the amount of taxes and assessments attributable to such Properties paid by
Buyer, to be paid to Buyer in accordance with wire instructions to be
provided by Buyer at least two (2) Business Days prior to the end of such ten
(10) Business Day period and (z) any Properties in which the holder of a PPR
validly exercises and acquires shall automatically, and without need to amend
this Agreement, be deemed to constitute Excluded Properties for all purposes
of this Agreement, and the Buyer shall have no further obligations with
respect to such Excluded Properties. If for any reason the purchase and sale
of such affected Property(ies) covered by the validly exercised PPR
contemplated by this Article 3.1.3 is not or cannot be consummated with the
holder of the PPR within ninety (90) Days after the Closing, Seller shall so
notify Buyer within three (3) Business Days, and within ten (10) Business
Days after Buyers receipt of such notice, Seller shall sell, assign and
convey to Buyer and Buyer shall purchase and accept from Seller
such Properties pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and for Buyers good
faith allocation of the Purchase Price set forth in Exhibit "A" (except
"Closing Date" with respect to any such Properties shall mean the date of
assignment of such Properties from Seller to Buyer). 

   

 3.1.4 Any PPR must be exercised subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the payment to Seller of a performance deposit in an amount corresponding to the percentage of the Purchase Price set forth in Article 2.4. 

  

 3.2 _Consents to Assignment_. 

   

 3.2.1 If a required consent has not been obtained prior to Closing, the Property with respect to which consent is required but not obtained shall be excluded 

   ##### 

  

   

from this Agreement and the Purchase Price shall be adjusted by the value
allocated to such Property in Exhibit "A" or, in the case of an affected
Property that is not allocated a value in Exhibit "A", as may be mutually
agreed by the Parties; provided that if no such agreement is reached prior to
Closing, such matter shall be an Arbitrable Dispute. Buyer remains obligated
to purchase from Seller the remainder of the Properties that are not subject
to such unobtained required consent. If Seller subsequently obtains any
required consents not obtained prior to or at Closing, Seller shall promptly
notify Buyer and within ten (10) Business Days after Buyers receipt of such
notice, Seller shall sell, assign and convey to Buyer and Buyer shall
purchase and accept from Seller such Properties pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement and for the value allocated to such Properties in Exhibit "A" or
otherwise determined by mutual agreement or determined pursuant to the
provisions of Article 18 for purposes of the adjustment to the Purchase Price
previously made with respect to such affected Property (except "Closing Date"
with respect to such Property shall mean the date of assignment of such
Property from Seller to Buyer). 

   

 3.2.2 With respect to Contracts and Other Agreements incident to ownership of or reasonably necessary for the operation of the Properties that require consent to assignment and which consent has not been obtained prior to Closing, Buyer at its option, shall have the right to elect to have this Article 3.2.2 apply with respect thereto, instead of having the affected Property (and the related Contract or Other Agreement) excluded from this Agreement as provided in Article 3.2.1. If Buyer elects to have this Article 3.2.2 apply to any such Contract or Other Agreement, Seller shall execute and deliver such instruments and take such other actions as Buyer may reasonably request in order to carry out the intent of this Agreement and the transfer of such Contracts or Other Agreements, including the execution of back-to-back agreements to effect the transfer from Seller to Buyer of the benefits and burdens of or on Seller under all such Contracts or Other Agreements under which Seller is obligated to perform (provided that entering into such back-to-back agreements does not result in a breach of any obligations under any such Contract or Other Agreement), to the extent that Seller is unable to transfer or assign such Contract or Other Agreement to Buyer. To the extent that Seller is unable to assign a Contract or Other Agreement with respect to which Seller has elected that this Article 3.2.2 shall apply, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to continue to hold such Contract or Other Agreement for the benefit of Buyer until such time as (x) such Contract or Other Agreement can be assigned to Buyer in accordance with the terms thereof, or (y) the Contract or Other Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms or otherwise at the direction of Buyer, to the extent such termination does not breach such Contract or Other Agreement. 

   

 3.3 _Affiliate Consents and Waivers_. Each Party shall cause its Affiliates to give any required consents and waive any PPR held by such Affiliates. 

    ##### 

 

   

ARTICLE IV 
  _TITLE REVIEW_  

   

 4.1 _Review of Title Records_. Not later than five (5) Business Days after the execution and delivery of the Agreement, Seller shall make available (during Sellers regular business hours and at their current location) for Buyers review, Records in Sellers and its Affiliates possession relating to title to the Properties. If Buyer requests copies of title Records, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide the requested copies to Buyer at Buyers expense. Buyer shall conduct its review of Records in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. 

  

 4.2 _Waiver_. Buyer (on behalf of Buyer Group and their successors and assigns) hereby waives for all purposes all objections, defects and Claims (whether known or unknown) associated with the title to the Properties except for Buyers rights with respect to Sellers representation set forth in Article 10.1.6. 

  

ARTICLE V 
  _CONDITION OF THE PROPERTIES_  

   

 5.1 _Condition of the Properties_. After execution and delivery of this Agreement, Seller (and any Affiliate of Seller) shall provide (and Seller shall use its reasonable endeavours to procure that Operating Company shall provide) Buyer access (during Sellers or such Affiliates regular business hours) to Seller-operated Properties (or Properties operated by Sellers Affiliate), and Seller will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain permission for Buyer to gain access to Third Party-operated Properties, to conduct a visual inspection of the same. 

   

 5.1.1 Any such inspection, including through the performance of Phase I Environmental Site Assessments, shall be conducted in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and subject to any releases or other agreements required by the operator of the Properties. Prior to Closing, Buyer may not operate equipment, conduct testing, sample materials, perform Phase II environmental audits, or conduct invasive activities during such inspection without Sellers prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Buyer shall be responsible for arranging, at its own cost, transportation to and from the Properties. During the time period between the Closing and the Adverse Condition Diligence Review Deadline, Buyer may not conduct testing, sample materials, conduct invasive activities related to environmental conditions or perform Phase II environmental audits without in any case obtaining any applicable Third Party operators prior written consent, and without obtaining Sellers prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, unless recommended in a Phase I environmental audit or required by applicable Law in which case Sellers prior written consent will not be required. 

   

 5.1.2 Buyers access to the Properties shall be at Buyers sole risk and expense; and Buyer hereby releases Seller Group from and shall fully 

   ##### 

  

    

indemnify, defend, protect and hold Seller Group harmless from and against
any and all Losses and Third Party Claims to the extent arising out of or
connected with Buyers inspection of the Properties or travel to or from or
presence on the Properties in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. 

  

 5.2 _Alleged Adverse Conditions_. As soon as reasonably practical (and on an ongoing basis), but no later than one hundred twenty (120) Days after the Closing Date (the "Adverse Condition Diligence Review Deadline"), Buyer shall notify Seller of any conditions that might constitute Alleged Adverse Conditions. Buyers notice of such conditions must include (i) a description of each individual condition to which Buyer takes exception (including any and all supporting documentation) and (ii) an estimate of the costs Buyer in good faith attributes to bringing such condition into compliance with applicable Environmental Laws. Seller and Buyer shall meet from time to time to attempt to agree on a resolution of Alleged Adverse Conditions. 

   

 5.2.1 If the Parties are unable to agree on resolution of any Alleged Adverse Conditions on or before sixty (60) Days after the Adverse Condition Diligence Review Deadline, Seller has the option, in its sole discretion, to either (a) bring the Alleged Adverse Condition into compliance with Environmental Laws (as in effect as of the Closing Date); or (b) deliver to Buyer an indemnity agreement in favor of Buyer Group, upon terms reasonably acceptable to Buyer, fully releasing Buyer Group from and protecting, defending, indemnifying and holding Buyer Group harmless from and against all Environmental Claims arising from or relating to such Alleged Adverse Condition. 

   

 5.2.2 If Seller elects, at its sole cost, to bring any Alleged Adverse Condition into compliance with Environmental Laws (as in effect as of the Closing Date), Seller may, by notice to Buyer, elect to continue attempting to remediate such condition to completion for up to one hundred eighty (180) Days after the Adverse Condition Diligence Review Deadline. Sellers remediation of any Alleged Adverse Condition may not materially interfere with the use of operation of the affected Property. If Seller does not remediate an Alleged Adverse Condition within such period, Buyer shall give Seller written notice of such failure or non-completion and within five (5) Business Days following the earlier to occur of the date that (i) Seller and Buyer agree in writing on the existence and value of the Alleged Adverse Condition or (ii) resolution of any dispute regarding the existence or value of the Alleged Adverse Condition in accordance with the provisions of Article 5.4, Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the value of such Alleged Adverse Condition, if any, as so agreed or determined. 

   

 5.2.3 If an Alleged Adverse Condition can be remediated, the adjustments or payments with respect to that Alleged Adverse Condition shall not exceed the Prudent Cost Response. 

   ##### 

  

   

 5.2.4 Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer shall not be entitled to an adjustment or other remedy relating to any Alleged Adverse Condition unless and until the aggregate value of all Aggregate Transaction Claims exceeds the Deductible, and then only to the extent such Aggregate Transaction Claims exceeds the Deductible; and Buyer shall be solely responsible for and bear all costs and expenses associated with any and all Aggregate Transaction Claims up to the Deductible. No payment shall be due with respect to any Alleged Adverse Condition for which Seller, at its option, delivers to Buyer an indemnity agreement in favor of Buyer in accordance with Article 5.2.1, nor shall any Alleged Adverse Condition for which Seller has indemnified Buyer be included as an Aggregate Transaction Claim. 

  

 5.3 _Waiver_. Buyer (on behalf of Buyer Group and their successors and assigns) waives for all purposes all objections and Claims (whether known or unknown) associated with environmental conditions (including Alleged Adverse Conditions) except for (a) Buyers rights with respect to Sellers indemnity under Article 8.3, (b) Alleged Adverse Conditions Buyer raised to Seller by proper notice within the applicable time period specified in, and as otherwise required by, Article 5.2, and (c) such Alleged Adverse Conditions as are settled by written agreement of the Parties or determined in accordance with Article 5.4. 

  

 5.4 If the Parties are unable to agree upon the existence, validity or value or cure of any Alleged Adverse Condition ("Adverse Condition Dispute"), then, within two hundred ten (210) Days after the Adverse Condition Diligence Review Deadline, such dispute shall be exclusively and finally resolved pursuant to this Article 5.4 by a single arbitrator, who shall be an environmental attorney with at least ten (10) years experience in oil and gas environmental matters, has not at any point in the past ten (10) years represented or been adverse to any Party and is selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller within fifteen (15) Days after the delivery and receipt by either Party of a notice of an Adverse Condition Dispute, and absent such agreement, by the Houston, Texas office of the AAA (the "Environmental Referee"). Except as otherwise provided in the preceding sentence, any Environmental Dispute arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with Article 18\. To the extent that the award of the Environmental Referee with respect to any Alleged Adverse Condition value is not taken into account as an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Article 6, then within ten (10) Days after the Environmental Referee delivers written notice to Buyer and Seller of the award with respect to an Alleged Adverse Condition value, and subject to the other terms hereof and after taking into account all previous adjustments to the Purchase Price in accordance with Article 6, (i) Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount, if any, so awarded by the Environmental Referee to Seller and (ii) Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount, if any, so awarded by the Environmental Referee to Buyer.

custody transfer meter) to the bottom of the flange as of the Effective Time
and Seller shall be entitled to the proceeds associated with such oil and
liquid hydrocarbon substances when sold. Oil and liquid hydrocarbon substances
in treating and separation equipment upstream of pipeline connections, as of
the Effective Time, shall not be considered merchantable and shall become the

 6.2.3 Buyer is entitled to all Operating Revenues attributable to the Properties for the period on and after the Effective Time and is responsible for all Charges (except producing, drilling and overhead costs payable to Seller or its Affiliates under operating agreements with Third Parties, other than pursuant to Article 6.2.2) attributable to the Properties for the period on and after the Effective Time. 

 

Actual amounts shall be accounted for in the Final Accounting Settlement,
unless previously accounted for under the Transition Agreement (or the
Partition Agreement). Whether Charges and Operating Revenues are attributable
to periods before or after the Effective Time shall be determined in
accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and Council of
Petroleum Accountants Societies (COPAS) standards, based on the accrual
method of accounting. 

   

 6.3 _Taxes_. Seller shall bear all Taxes and assessments, including excise taxes, severance or other production taxes, ad valorem taxes and any other federal, state or local taxes or assessments attributable to ownership or operation of the Properties prior to the Effective Time; and all deductions, credits or refunds pertaining to the aforementioned taxes and assessments, no matter when received, belong to Seller. Provided that Closing has occurred, Buyer shall bear all taxes and assessments, including sales taxes, excise taxes, severance or other production taxes, ad valorem taxes and any other federal, state or local taxes and assessments attributable to ownership or operation of the Properties on and after the Effective Time (excluding Sellers income taxes, franchise taxes or margin taxes from the Effective Time through Closing and excluding income or capital gains taxes from the sale of the Properties); and all deductions, credits and refunds pertaining to the aforementioned taxes and assessments, no matter when received, belong to Buyer. Ad valorem or property or other taxes based on revenue 

   #####

period occurring before and after the Effective Time. Actual amounts shall be
accounted for in the Final Accounting Settlement. Buyer shall be responsible
for and pay any and all Sales Tax on the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each Party is responsible for filing any tax returns and handling
payment of any tax due under Law during the period when it holds title to
the Properties. Seller and its Affiliates (other than Operating Company)
shall (and Seller shall use its reasonable endeavours to procure that
Operating Company shall) provide Buyer with copies of all statutory financial

(or its Affiliates) possession, where available. 

  

 6.4 _Credits_. Provided Closing has occurred, Buyer shall reimburse Seller for any and all prepaid insurance premiums, utility charges, rentals, deposits and any other prepays (excluding taxes) applicable to the period on and after the Effective Time that are attributable to the Properties unless already accounted for under the Transition Agreement or the Partition Agreement. Actual amounts shall be accounted for in the Final Accounting Settlement. 

  

 6.5 _Final Accounting Settlement_. As soon as reasonably practicable, but no later than one hundred eighty (180) Days after the end of the Transition Period, Seller shall deliver the Final Accounting Statement to Buyer. Within three (3) Business Days following delivery of the Final Accounting Statement, Seller shall provide to Buyers representatives all supporting documentation reasonably necessary for Buyers representatives to review and verify any adjustments set forth in such Final Accounting Statement. 

   

 6.5.1 As soon as reasonably practicable, but no later than sixty (60) Days after Buyer receives the Final Accounting Statement, Buyer may deliver to Seller a written report containing any changes Buyer proposes to such statement. Any adjustments covered by the Final Accounting Statement as delivered by Seller to which Buyer fails to object in the written report within the sixty (60) Day period shall be deemed correct and are final and binding on the Parties and not subject to further review, audit or arbitration. 

   

 6.5.2 As soon as reasonably practicable, but no later than forty-five (45) Days after Seller receives Buyers written report, the Parties shall meet to attempt to agree on any adjustments to the Final Accounting Statement. If the Parties fail to agree on final adjustments within that forty-five (45) Day period, either Party may submit the disputed items to the Accounting Referee. The Parties shall direct the Accounting Referee to resolve the disputes within thirty (30) Days after its receipt of relevant materials pertaining to the dispute (and the Parties agree to use their respective reasonable efforts to deliver such materials promptly to the Accounting Referee). 

   

 6.5.3 The Final Accounting Statement, whether as agreed between the Parties or as determined by a decision of the Accounting Referee, shall be binding on and non-appealable by the Parties. The Accounting 

   #####

specific disputed adjustments submitted by either Party and may not award
damages or penalties to either Party with respect to any matter. Seller and
Buyer shall share equally the Accounting Referees fees and expenses.

 6.6 _Post-Final Accounting Settlement Revenues_.

 6.6.2 Seller shall pay Buyer any and all Operating Revenues received by Seller (to the extent not accounted for in the Final Accounting Settlement or the Transition Agreement or the Partition Agreement) for the period after the Effective Time, except producing, drilling and overhead charges payable to Seller or its Affiliates and the sum per month specified in Article 6.2.2, which are to be retained by Seller. 

 

The Party responsible for making payment in Articles 6.6.1 or 6.6.2 above
shall make full payment to the other Party within thirty (30) Days after
receipt of the Operating Revenues in question. 

   

 6.7 _Post-Final Accounting Settlement Expenses_.

 6.7.2 Buyer shall reimburse Seller for any and all Charges paid by Seller (to the extent not accounted for in the Final Accounting Settlement, the Transition Agreement or the Partition Agreement) that are attributable to periods after the Effective Time. 

         #####

shall make full payment to the other Party within thirty (30) Days after
receipt of an applicable invoice and proof that such invoice was paid for the
Charges in question. 

    

 6.8 _Joint Interest Audits_. Seller is entitled (at Sellers expense) to resolve all Contractual Audits and audits by Governmental Authorities or EGPC (whether or not being conducted as of the Effective Time) that are applicable to any periods for which Seller is responsible under this Agreement and to pay or receive (as applicable) any amounts due or receivable attributable to Sellers current interest in the Properties that are subject to such audits. 

  

 6.9 _Cost Recovery Pool_. Buyer is entitled to the Cost Recovery Pool as a Property hereunder, and shall be permitted to use the same for the purposes of cost recovery under the applicable Concession Agreements. Seller shall (and shall cause its Affiliate to) deliver to Buyer from and after the date hereof and until the Closing Date, quarterly statements of the Cost Recovery Pool insofar as it relates to the Properties. In order to review and verify the Cost Recovery Pool and any adjustments with respect thereto, Seller shall, from time to time, and upon reasonable advance notice, provide to Buyers representatives access to its books and records relating to the Cost Recovery Pool. Such access shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Any dispute arising therefrom, or relating thereto, may be submitted by any Party to the Accounting Referee for determination. The Parties shall direct the Accounting Referee to resolve any submitted dispute within thirty (30) Days after its receipt of relevant materials pertaining to the dispute (and the Parties agree to use their respective reasonable efforts to deliver such materials promptly to the Accounting Referee) pursuant to the procedure set forth in Article 6.5.2. 

  

ARTICLE VII 
  _LOSS, CASUALTY AND CONDEMNATION_  

   

 7.1 _Notice of Loss_. Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of all instances of Casualty Loss that occur and become known to Seller between the date of this Agreement and Closing. 

  

 7.2 _Casualty Loss_. If, prior to Closing, any Properties are impacted by a Casualty Loss, Seller and Buyer shall meet to attempt to agree on an adjustment to the Purchase Price reflecting the reduction in value of the Properties because of such Casualty Loss. For this purpose "reduction in value" is based on the principle that Seller should generally bear the costs of repairing the Properties to the state existing immediately prior to the Casualty Loss, but if such repair results in equipment or facilities that are newer than or upgraded from that which existed immediately prior to the Casualty Loss, Buyer should bear a portion of such costs as is equitable given the benefit to Buyer of such newer or upgraded equipment or facilities. No adjustment associated with a Casualty Loss will exceed the reasonable value claimed by the Buyer in the applicable claim to Seller of such Casualty Loss. 

   

 7.2.1 If the Parties are unable to agree on resolution of a Casualty Loss, the Parties shall Close with the Purchase Price being decreased 

   ##### 

  

    

by the arithmetic average of the good faith estimates of the reduction in
value associated with such Casualty Loss by both Buyer and Seller; provided,
however, that within thirty (30) Days after the Closing Date, either Party
may initiate binding arbitration in accordance with Article 18 to resolve the
dispute. Any claim with respect to a Casualty Loss not referred to
arbitration within thirty (30) Days following Closing (or, with respect to
any Casualty Loss for which Seller provides notice that it will continue
attempting to cure after Closing, within thirty (30) Days after the one
hundred eighty (180) Day period cure period following Closing has expired)
shall be deemed waived by Buyer for all purposes. 

   

 7.2.2 Seller shall retain any and all insurance proceeds and other payments associated with or attributable to any Casualty Losses. 

  

ARTICLE VIII 
  _ALLOCATION OF RESPONSIBILITIES AND INDEMNITIES_  

   

 8.1 _Opportunity for Review_. Each Party represents that it has had an adequate opportunity to review all release, indemnity and defense provisions in this Agreement, including the opportunity to submit the same to legal counsel for review and advice.

 8.3 _Seller s Environmental Indemnity Obligation._ 

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, Seller shall release Buyer Group from and
subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, shall protect,
defend, indemnify and hold Buyer Group harmless from and against all
Environmental Claims (including such Claims associated with asbestos or NORM,
plugging and abandonment and Process Safety Management, as limited
by Articles 12.3, 12.4 and 12.5) to the extent relating to, arising out of,
or connected with, directly or indirectly, Sellers ownership or operation of
the Properties or any part thereof prior to the Closing Date. This indemnity
and defense obligation applies regardless of cause or of any negligent acts
or omissions (including sole negligence, concurrent negligence or strict 

  #####

(a) any Claim under Article 8.2 or 8.3, if Buyer has not provided Seller with

which a Claim Notice must be given within seventy-two (72) months from and
after Closing and (ii) any Claim under (A) Article 8.2(b) with respect to the

In calculating the foregoing deductible amounts set forth in this Article 8.7,
any dollar or materiality qualifiers in the representations and warranties

such Alleged Adverse Condition and/or any Claim relating thereto, the
threshold amounts with respect thereto shall not be applied more than once. 

   

 8.8 _Notice of Claims_. If a Claim is asserted against a Party for which the other Party may have an obligation of indemnity and defense (whether under this Article 8 or any other provision of this Agreement), the Party seeking indemnification ("Indemnified Party") shall give the Party from which the Indemnified Party seeks indemnification ("Indemnifying Party") prompt written notice of the Claim, setting forth the particulars associated with the Claim (including a copy of the written Claim, if any) as then known by the Indemnified Party ("Claim Notice"). 

  

 8.9 _Defense of Claims_. Within thirty (30) Days after the Indemnifying Party receives a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified Party whether or not the Indemnifying Party will assume responsibility for defense and payment of the Claim. The Indemnified Party is authorized, prior to and during such thirty (30) Day period, to file any motion, pleading or other answer that it deems necessary or appropriate to protect its interests, or those of the Indemnifying Party, and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume responsibility for defense and payment of the Claim, the Indemnified Party may defend against, or enter into any settlement with respect to, the Claim as it deems appropriate without relieving the Indemnifying Party of any indemnification obligations the Indemnifying Party may have with respect to such Claim. The Indemnifying Partys failure to respond in writing to a Claim Notice within the thirty (30) Day period shall be deemed an election by the Indemnifying Party not to assume responsibility for defense and payment of the Claim. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume responsibility for defense and payment of the Claim: (a) the Indemnifying Party shall defend the Indemnified Party against the Claim with counsel of the Indemnifying Partys choice (reasonably acceptable to Indemnified Party which shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in all reasonable respects in such defense), (b) the Indemnifying Party shall pay any judgment entered or settlement with respect to such Claim, (c) 

   ##### 

  

    

the Indemnifying Party shall not consent to entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement with respect to the Claim that (i) does not include a
provision whereby the plaintiff or claimant in the matter releases the
Indemnified Party from all liability with respect to the Claim or (ii)
contains terms that may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Party
(other than as a result of money damages covered by the indemnity), and (d)
the Indemnified Party shall not consent to entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement with respect to the Claim without the
Indemnifying Partys prior written consent. In all instances the Indemnified
Party may employ separate counsel and participate in defense of a Claim, but
the Indemnified Party shall bear all fees and expenses of counsel employed by
the Indemnified Party. 

  

 8.10 _Waiver of Certain Damages_. Each Party irrevocably waives and agrees not to seek indirect, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages of any kind in connection with any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement or breach hereof. For the avoidance of doubt, this Article 8.10 does not diminish or otherwise affect the Parties rights and obligations to be indemnified against, and provide indemnity for, Claims under any indemnities in this Agreement. 

  

 8.11 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for remedies that cannot be waived as a matter of Law, if Closing occurs, the indemnities set forth in this Agreement shall be the exclusive remedy for breach of any representation, warranty or covenant set forth in this Agreement; provided, however, nothing in this Article 8.11 shall be deemed to affect any Persons right to equitable relief (including specific performance) for breach of a covenant set forth in this Agreement.

subsequent to transfer of title); or 

   

 (c) conflict with, result in a breach of, constitute a default under or constitute an event that with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default under, accelerate or permit the acceleration of the performance required by, or require any consent, authorization or approval under: (i) any agreement of Buyer, or any mortgage, indenture, loan, credit agreement or other agreement evidencing indebtedness for borrowed money to which Buyer is a party, or (ii) any order, judgment or decree of any governmental authority. 

   

 11.1.4 _SEC Disclosure_. Buyer is acquiring the Properties for its own account for use in its trade or business, and not with a view toward or for sale associated with any distribution thereof, nor with any present intention of making a distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 

   

 11.1.5 _Litigation_. There is no litigation, action or proceeding pending against Buyer or, to Buyers knowledge, threatened against Buyer that would prevent timely consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

ARTICLE XII 
  _ADDITIONAL COVENANTS_  

   

 12.1 _[ Intentionally Omitted]_. 

   

 12.2 _Buyer s Assumption of Obligations_. If Closing occurs, and subject only to Sellers indemnities in Articles 5.2, 8.2, 8.3 and 8.6, and except for other matters that are Sellers or its Affiliates express obligations under this Agreement, Buyer hereby assumes, shall pay and shall timely perform and discharge all of Sellers duties and obligations associated with the Properties arising prior to, on or after the Closing (including any and all contractual duties and obligations arising therefrom) (collectively, the "Assumed Obligations"), and in fulfilling these obligations, Buyer shall comply with all Laws. 

   

 12.3 _Asbestos and NORM_. The Properties may currently or have in the past contained asbestos and NORM, and special procedures associated with assessment, remediation, removal, transportation or disposal of asbestos and NORM may be necessary, and Buyer acknowledges and agrees as follows from and after Closing. 

    

 12.3.1 Except with respect to a breach by Seller of any of its representations or warranties contained in Article 10, as limited by Article 8, Buyer accepts sole responsibility for and agrees to pay any and all costs and expenses associated with assessment, remediation, removal, transportation and disposal of asbestos and NORM associated with the Properties, and may not claim the fact that assessment, remediation, removal, transportation or disposal of asbestos and NORM are not complete or that additional costs and expenses are required in connection with assessment, remediation, removal, transportation or disposal of asbestos and NORM as an Alleged Adverse Condition or the basis for any other redress against Seller or its Affiliates, and Buyer (on behalf of Buyer Group and their successors and assigns) irrevocably waives any and all Losses and Third Party Claims they may have against Seller Group associated with the same; and 

   

 12.3.2 Except with respect to a breach by Seller of any of its representations or warranties contained in Article 10, as limited by Article 8, Buyer releases Seller Group from and shall fully protect, defend, indemnify, and hold Seller Group harmless from and against any and all Losses and Third Party Claims relating to, arising out of, or connected with, directly or indirectly, the assessment, remediation, removal, transportation and disposal of asbestos and NORM associated with the Properties, no matter whether arising before, on or after the Effective Time. This indemnity and defense obligation will apply regardless of cause or of any negligent acts or omissions (including sole negligence, concurrent negligence or strict liability), breach of duty (statutory or otherwise), violation of Law or other fault of Seller Group, or any pre-existing defect. For the removal of doubt, Buyers release under this Article 12.3 does not prevent Buyer from asserting the existence of an Alleged Adverse Condition under Article 5.2 for asbestos or NORM that is, as of a date prior to Closing, in a condition that violates existing Laws. The 

   ##### 

  

   

preceding sentence shall in no way expand Buyers rights under Article 5.2
or diminish Buyers waiver contained in Article 5.3. 

  

 12.4 _Plugging and Abandonment_. The Properties may contain wells and facilities that have been shut in or temporarily or permanently abandoned including such wells as are listed on Schedule 12.4, and Buyer acknowledges and agrees as follows from and after Closing: 

   

 12.4.1 Except with respect to a breach by Seller of any of its representations or warranties contained in Article 10, as limited by Article 8, Buyer hereby expressly assumes and accepts sole and exclusive responsibility for and agrees to pay all costs and expenses associated with Plugging and Abandonment of all wells and facilities associated with the Properties (whether or not listed on Schedule 12.4), and may not claim the fact that Plugging and Abandonment operations are not complete or that additional costs and expenses are required to complete Plugging and Abandonment operations as an Alleged Adverse Condition or the basis for any other redress against Seller or its Affiliates, and Buyer (on behalf of Buyer Group and their successors and assigns) irrevocably waives any and all Losses and Third Party Claims they may have against Seller Group associated with the same; and 

   

 12.4.2 Except with respect to a breach by Seller of any of its representations or warranties contained in Article 10, as limited by Article 8, Buyer releases Seller Group from and shall fully protect, defend, indemnify, and hold Seller Group harmless from and against any and all Losses and Third Party Claims relating to, arising out of, or connected with, directly or indirectly, Plugging and Abandonment operations, no matter whether arising before, on or after the Effective Time. This indemnity and defense obligation will apply regardless of cause or of any negligent acts or omissions (including sole negligence, concurrent negligence or strict liability), breach of duty (statutory or otherwise), violation of Law, or other fault of Seller Group, or any pre-existing defect. For the removal of doubt, Buyers release under this Article 12.4 does not prevent Buyer from asserting the existence of an Alleged Adverse Condition under Article 5.2 for any condition that, as of a date prior to Closing, violates existing Laws with respect to Plugging and Abandonment operations. The preceding sentence shall in no way expand Buyers rights under Article 5.2 or diminish Buyers waiver contained in Article 5.3. 

  

 12.5 _Process Safety Management_. Buyer acknowledges that Process Safety Management is an ongoing process, and Buyer acknowledges and agrees as follows from and after Closing: 

   

(a) Except with respect to a breach by Seller of any of its representations or
warranties contained in Article 10, as limited by Article 8, Buyer accepts
sole responsibility for and agrees to pay all costs and expenses associated
with Process Safety Management associated with the Properties (including
identification, evaluation and remediation), and may not claim the fact that
the Process Safety Management is not complete or that 

   ##### 

  

   

additional costs and expenses are required to comply with or complete Process
Safety Management as an Alleged Adverse Condition, or the basis for any other
redress against Seller, and Buyer (on behalf of Buyer Group and their
successors and assigns) irrevocably waives any and all claims they may have
against Seller Group associated with the same; and 

   

(b) Except with respect to a breach by Seller of any of its representations or
warranties contained in Article 10, as limited by Article 8, Buyer releases
Seller Group from and shall fully protect, defend, indemnify and hold Seller
Group harmless from and against any and all Claims relating to, arising out
of, or connected with, directly or indirectly, Process Safety Management
associated with the Properties, no matter whether arising before or after the
Effective Time. This indemnity and defense obligation will apply regardless of
cause or of any negligent acts or omissions (including sole negligence,
concurrent negligence or strict liability), breach of duty (statutory or
otherwise), violation of Law, or other fault of Seller Group, or any pre-
existing defect. For the removal of doubt, Buyers release under this Article
12.5 does not prevent Buyer from asserting the existence of an
Alleged Adverse Condition under Article 5.2 for any condition that, as of a
date prior to Closing, violates existing Laws with respect to Process Safety
Management. The preceding sentence shall in no way expand Buyers rights
under Article 5.2 or diminish Buyers waiver contained in Article 5.3. 

  

 12.6 _Imbalances_. Imbalances may exist as of the Effective Time. If Closing occurs, all Imbalances (whether for over-production or over-deliveries by Seller or under-production or under-deliveries by Seller) will pass to Buyer as of the Effective Time, and Buyer thereupon shall be entitled to all rights and shall assume all obligations with respect to any and all such Imbalances. There shall be no amounts paid to or by either Party to the other as a Purchase Price adjustment, as part of the Final Accounting Settlement or otherwise, based on Imbalances. Subject to Article 8, if Closing occurs: 

   

 12.6.1 Buyer accepts sole responsibility for and agrees to pay all costs and expenses, if any, associated with Imbalances, and Buyer (on behalf of Buyer Group and their successors and assigns) irrevocably waives any and all claims they may have against Seller Group associated with the same; and 

   

 12.6.2 Buyer releases Seller Group from and shall fully protect, defend, indemnify and hold Seller Group harmless from and against any and all Losses and Third Party Claims relating to, arising out of, or connected with, directly or indirectly, Imbalances, no matter whether arising before, on or after the Effective Time. 

  

 12.7 _Suspense Funds_. Buyer acknowledges that Suspense Funds may exist as of the Effective Time. Seller shall transfer at Closing any Suspense Funds held by Seller as operator of any Properties and the obligations with respect thereto to Buyer. This transfer shall be accounted for in the Final Accounting Statement. Subject to Article 6 and Article 8, if Closing occurs: 

    ##### 

  

      

 12.7.1 Buyer accepts sole responsibility for and agrees to pay all costs and expenses associated with the Suspense Funds, and Buyer (on behalf of Buyer Group and their successors and assigns) irrevocably waives any and all claims they may have against Seller Group associated with the same; and 

   

 12.7.2 Buyer releases Seller Group from and shall fully protect, defend, indemnify and hold Seller Group harmless from and against any and all Losses and Third Party Claims relating to, arising out of, or connected with, directly or indirectly, the Suspense Funds, no matter whether arising before, on or after the Effective Time. 

  

 12.8 _Sales Tax_. The Parties agree that this sale is an occasional sale of assets by Seller in which it does not trade in the ordinary course of business. The Parties shall take commercially reasonable actions to assert and establish the occasional sale exemption from Sales Tax associated with the transactions contemplated hereby. If Sales Tax is due and owing as a result of Sellers transfer of the Properties to Buyer, Buyer shall be solely responsible and liable for any and all such Sales Tax. Before the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall agree on the value of the tangible personal property being transferred and Buyer shall provide Seller with documentation detailing the basis for Buyers allocation of the Purchase Price to any such Properties that are subject to Sales Tax. Buyer shall provide Seller with an exemption certificate for any tangible personal property included in the Properties for which it claims a Sales Tax exemption. Seller shall invoice, and Buyer shall pay, any Sales Tax on Buyers acquisition of all nonexempt tangible personal property and Seller shall remit the Sales Tax to the applicable governmental entity or authority. If Seller is later required to pay any additional Sales Tax, interest, or penalty thereon, Buyer shall reimburse Seller within thirty (30) Days after receipt of Sellers written notice of the payment. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary (including Article 6 or Article 8), Buyer releases Seller Group from and shall fully protect, defend, indemnify and hold Seller Group harmless from and against any and all Losses and Third Party Claims (no matter when asserted) relating to, arising out of, or connected with, directly or indirectly, Sales Tax resulting from or associated with Sellers transfer of Properties to Buyer. 

   

 12.9 _Guaranty Agreement_. 

  

 12.9.1 Buyer has caused its ultimate parent company or an Affiliate of Buyer (who is acceptable to Seller) to execute and deliver the Guaranty Agreement in the form of Exhibit H-1 simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement. 

  

 12.9.2 Seller has caused its ultimate parent company or an Affiliate of Seller (who is acceptable to Buyer) to execute and deliver the Guaranty Agreement in the form of Exhibit H-2 simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement. 

  

 12.10 _Transition Agreement_. 

   ##### 

  

 

Each of Buyer and Sellers shall use reasonable endeavours to agree upon the
final terms and conditions of the Transition Agreement prior to Closing. Such
terms and conditions shall include the identity of the parties to the
Transition Agreement and the contracts that will be subject to the transition
arrangements contemplated thereunder. Buyer, Seller and Operating Company (and
any relevant operating company of Buyer) shall execute and deliver the
Transition Agreement, and Buyer and Seller shall execute Letters-in-Lieu (in
each case) as provided in the Transition Agreement on the Closing Date. On
the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall further execute notice
letters customarily given under the Contracts in connection with a transfer
of ownership of the Properties. During the term of the Transition Agreement,
Seller shall use its reasonable endeavours to procure the amendment of any
contracts under which Operating Company acts as agent for Seller in respect
of activities relating to the Properties, the effect of such amendment being
to replace Operating Company in such capacity with Buyers nominated
operating company. 

   

 12.11 _Seismic Data_. 

 

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer is
responsible for obtaining any necessary consents to Sellers assignment of
any Third Party Seismic Data licenses or other agreements or for Buyer to
enter into new licenses or other agreements, in each case as may be needed to
permit Buyer to continue to utilize any Third Party Seismic Data covering the
Properties after the Closing Date. Seller shall reasonably assist Buyer in
contacting the relevant Third Parties, but Buyer shall be solely responsible
for and shall bear all costs and transfer and other fees required to obtain
assignments or new licenses or other agreements in connection with
Third Party Seismic Data. With respect to any of Sellers wholly-owned
seismic data pertaining to the Properties, Buyer and Seller shall execute and
deliver the Seismic License at Closing. 

    

 12.12 _Interim Period_. During the Interim Period, Seller shall maintain and operate the Properties and dispose of production from the Properties in the ordinary course of business consistent with the Sellers past custom and practice with respect to the Properties. 

   

 12.12.1 Without the consent of Buyer (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), during the Interim Period, Seller shall not, with respect to the Properties: 

   

 (a) except with respect to matters indemnified by Seller that are referenced in Exhibit "C", waive, compromise or settle any right or claim which reasonably would be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; 

   

 (b) incur any obligation in excess of $500,000 with respect to the Properties for which Buyer would be responsible after Closing, other than in connection with transactions in the normal, usual and customary manner, of a nature and in an amount consistent with past practices employed by Seller with respect to the Properties and/or in connection with situations believed in good faith by Seller to constitute an emergency (in which case Sellers obligation is limited to notifying Buyer as soon as reasonably practicable of such emergency and obligations); 

   ##### 

  

   

 (c) encumber, sell, lease, or otherwise dispose of any of the Properties having a value in excess of $500,000 (excluding sales of hydrocarbons therefrom), except to the extent replaced by equivalent property or to the extent used, consumed or abandoned in the normal operations of Sellers business; or 

   

 (d) enter into a contract or commitment for any capital expenditure or acquisition or construction of fixed assets in either case for which Buyer would be responsible after Closing in an amount individually in excess of $500,000, except in connection with situations believed in good faith by Seller to constitute an emergency (in which case Sellers obligation is limited to notifying Buyer as soon as reasonably practicable of such emergency and obligations). 

   

 12.12.2 Regardless of whether all of the operations conducted by Seller during the Interim Period with respect to any of the Properties have been fully completed by Seller prior to Closing, upon Closing Buyer shall assume full responsibility for the completion of all such operations applicable to the Properties, subject, however, to the terms of the Transition Agreement during the Transition Period. 

   

 12.12.3 Buyer acknowledges Seller owns undivided interests in certain of the Properties and that Seller does not operate all of the Properties, and Buyer agrees that the acts or omissions of Third Party working interests owners (including Third Party operators) shall not constitute a breach of the provisions of this Article 12.12, nor shall any action required by a vote of working interest owners constitute such a breach so long as Seller has voted its interest in a manner that complies with the provisions of this Article 12.12. Furthermore, Seller shall not be deemed or held to be in breach of any of Sellers representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement to the extent that any such breach arises out of or in connection with the actions of Buyer or Buyers Affiliates as operators or co-owners of any of the Properties prior to the Closing. 

  

 12.13 _Consents to Assign_. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall attempt to obtain consents necessary to assign the Properties to Buyer at Closing. 

  

 12.14 _Notification of Breaches_. Until Closing: 

   

 12.14.1 Buyer shall notify Seller promptly upon Buyers knowledge that any of Sellers or Buyers representations or warranties in this Agreement are untrue in any material respect or will be untrue in any material respect as of the Closing Date or that any covenant or agreement to be performed or observed by Seller prior to or on the Closing Date has not been so performed or observed in any material respect or that any title defect or noncompliance with any Environmental Law exists. 

   

 12.14.2 Seller shall notify Buyer promptly upon Sellers knowledge that any of Buyers representations or warranties in this Agreement 

   ##### 

  

    

are untrue in any material respect or will be untrue in any material respect
as of the Closing Date or that any covenant or agreement to be performed or
observed by Buyer prior to or on the Closing Date has not been so performed
or observed in a material respect. 

   

 12.14.3 If any of Buyers or Sellers representations or warranties are untrue or will become untrue in any material respect between the date of execution of this Agreement and the Closing Date, or if any of Buyers or Sellers covenants or agreements to be performed or observed prior to or on the Closing Date shall not have been so performed or observed in any material respect, but if such breach of representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall (if curable) be cured by the Closing, then such breach shall be considered not to have occurred for all purposes of this Agreement. 

  

 12.15 _Third Party-Owned Software_. Buyer shall be responsible for the purchase of all Third Party-Owned Software that is needed or is appropriate for Buyers operation of the Properties as currently operated by Seller. Seller will use reasonable efforts to procure for Buyer the rights (including seeking and obtaining relevant vendor consents) to access and use (or permit Seller to access and use on Buyers behalf) all Third Party-Owned Software during the Transition Period only, and Buyer shall bear all costs and fees, if any, to procure such consents and shall reimburse Seller in the Final Accounting Settlement for any such costs or fees incurred by Seller in connection therewith. Buyer acknowledges that Buyers rights to access and use Third Party-Owned Software under Third Party consents so procured by Seller will expire at the end of the Transition Period, and Buyer agrees to obtain its own licenses for all Third Party-Owned Software that Buyer deems necessary or appropriate in connection with the operation of the Properties after the Transition Period. Upon termination of the Transition Period, Buyer shall certify to Seller in writing that all Third Party-Owned Software for which consents were obtained for it by Seller either has been de-installed or have been licensed by Buyer from the applicable vendor. Seller shall have the right to confirm, at Sellers expense, that post-Transition Period use by Buyer of all Third Party-Owned Software has either ceased or continues under license(s) Buyer has acquired from the applicable vendors. 

  

 12.16 _Financial Statements_. Both prior to and after the Closing, Seller shall provide Buyer with access (upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours) to (i) information reasonably requested by Buyer from Sellers operating and financial Records relating primarily to the Properties for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009 which were previously made available to Sellers auditors for purposes of preparing BP Egypts (or other applicable organizations) annual audited and quarterly reviewed financial statements for those years with respect to the Properties and (ii) information reasonably requested by Buyer from BP Egypts (or other applicable organizations) corresponding records for any completed fiscal quarter for the fiscal year to be ended December 31, 2010 prior to the Closing, including (in each case) Records reasonably requested with respect to oil and natural gas reserves and production and direct lease operating costs with respect to each of the Properties and the gross revenues from each of the Properties and such other information relating to the Properties as Buyer may reasonably request in order for Buyer to prepare financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2009 and periods ended June 30, 2010, in each case to the extent necessary to be included by Buyer in any filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended 

   ##### 

  

 

(the "Exchange Act") with respect to or as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "SEC Basis Financial
Statements") (it being acknowledged that Seller shall not be required to
prepare any pro formas and forward-looking statements). Seller shall cause
Sellers and Sellers Affiliates personnel to reasonably cooperate with Buyer
in providing such access and to reasonably assist Buyer in locating and
interpreting such Records and Seller shall reasonably instruct IBM in IBMs
capacity as Sellers contractor to provide reasonable assistance to Buyer in
the preparation of the SEC Basis Financial Statements. In
connection herewith, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause, both prior to and after Closing, Sellers independent public
accountants to make available to Buyer the personnel of Sellers independent
public accountants and Seller shall consent to Sellers independent
public accountants consulting on the preparation of the SEC Basis Financial
Statements, provided that Buyer provides to such independent
public accountants customary indemnities, waivers and agreements with respect
to such audit work papers and other files as such independent public
accountants and Seller shall request. Seller shall reasonably cooperate with
the Buyers independent public accountants in the preparation, audit and/or
review of the SEC Basis Financial Statements so that Buyer may file the SEC
Basis Financial Statements within the time period required by the Exchange
Act, which cooperation will include the delivery of one or more customary
representation letters from Seller to such independent public accountants as
may be reasonably required by such independent public accountants to perform
an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards or a review
in accordance with AICPA standards and to render an opinion acceptable to the
SEC with respect to the audit or review of the SEC Basis Financial
Statements, it being understood that such representation letters
shall acknowledge (i) Sellers use of estimates and allocations in the
preparation of the SEC Basis Financial Statements, and (ii) Sellers belief
that the SEC Basis Financial Statements represent the financial conditions
and results of operations of the Properties, and that such estimates
and allocations were made on a reasonable basis. The cost incurred by Seller
and its Affiliates in providing the financial Records (including fees of
accountants) to Buyer and assisting Buyer as provided in this Article shall
be borne by Buyer. Buyer releases Seller Group from and shall fully protect,
defend, indemnify and hold Seller Group harmless from and against any and all
claims, liabilities, losses or damages (including costs of investigation and
attorneys and experts fees and expenses) relating to, arising out of, or
connected with, directly or indirectly, the preparation or furnishing of any
such records to Buyer, any actions, representations or certifications of
Sellers and its Affiliates personnel or auditors with respect to
the information contained in such Records, or Buyers use of the information
contained in such Records, the inclusion of such financial Records in any
debt or equity offering documents or related materials, regardless of cause
or of any negligent acts or omissions (including sole negligence, concurrent
negligence or strict liability), breach of duty (statutory or otherwise),
violation of Law, or other fault of Seller Group, or any pre-existing
defect. 

  

12.17. _Replacement of Seller Guarantees_. Buyer shall obtain, effective as of
the Closing Date, the release of Seller Guarantees and any obligations of
Seller or its Affiliates related thereto, in form and substance satisfactory
to Seller, and, at the Closing, shall return or reimburse Seller for any such
cash deposits and replace all bonds, letters of credit, guarantees and other
surety arrangements and credit assurances provided, funded or otherwise
supported by Seller or their Affiliates (in each case relating exclusively to
the East Badr El Din Concession Agreement or to the Western Desert Area). In
the event Buyer is unable to obtain all such releases and the 

    ##### 

  

    

return of all such bonds, letters of credit, guarantees and other credit
support vehicles, then Buyer agrees to reimburse Seller and its Affiliates
upon request for any amounts paid or suffered thereunder after the Closing
Date and (a) shall secure such obligation by providing to Seller and its
Affiliates at the Closing back-to-back irrevocable stand-by letters of credit
issued by nationally recognized financial institutions (or other back-to-back
credit support) acceptable to Seller for the benefit of Seller and such
Affiliates with respect to each of Seller Guarantees that remains in effect
on and after the Closing Date, satisfactory in form and substance to
Seller in their sole discretion, for the full amount and time period (plus
additional 30 Day periods) that Seller or their Affiliates are liable in
respect of any such remaining Seller Guarantee or obligated to perform
thereunder and (b) shall use its reasonable efforts after the Closing Date
to obtain all such releases and returns promptly. 

   

ARTICLE XIII 
  _ANTITRUST_  

  

As promptly as practicable and in any event not more than two (2) Business
Days after the date of this Agreement, the Parties shall submit any other
filings required in connection with the Antitrust Laws required for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the
applicable statutes and shall as promptly as practicable furnish any
supplementary information that may be requested in connection therewith. 

  

Each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses incurred in connection with
any such filing and provision of information, and Buyer and Seller shall each
bear one-half of the costs of any filing fee required under the applicable
Antitrust Laws. Subject to applicable Antitrust Laws, the Parties hereto
shall have the right to review in advance all characterizations of the
information relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby that appear in any filing made with a Governmental Authority as
contemplated herein. Buyer and Seller agree to respond promptly to any
inquiries from Governmental Authorities, including the Department of Justice
or the Federal Trade Commission, concerning such filings and to comply in all
material respects with the filing requirements of the applicable Antitrust
Laws. Buyer and Seller shall consult and cooperate with each other and,
subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, shall promptly furnish
all information to the other Party that is necessary in connection with
Buyers and Sellers compliance with the applicable Antitrust Laws. Buyer and
Seller shall keep each other fully apprised with respect to any requests from
or communications with Governmental Authorities, including the Department of
Justice or the Federal Trade Commission, concerning such filings and shall
consult with each other with respect to all responses thereto and consider
any comments of the other Party in good faith. Each of Seller and Buyer shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions reasonably
necessary and appropriate in connection with any Antitrust Law filing
to consummate the transactions hereby as soon as practicable; provided _,_
however, in no event will either of the Parties or their respective
Affiliates be required to agree to any divestiture, transfer or licensing of
its properties, assets or businesses, or to the imposition of any limitation
on the ability of any of the foregoing to conduct its businesses or to own or
exercise control of its assets and properties.

 15.3.2 no injunction, order or award restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting consummation of, or granting material damages associated with, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or sale of any one or more of the Properties has been issued by any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction and remains in effect, and no suits, actions or other proceedings are pending before any such Governmental Authority in which a Third Party seeks to restrain, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of, or obtain material damages associated with, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or sale of any one or more of the Properties; provided that if such an injunction, order, award, suit, action or other proceeding applicable to some (but not all) of the Properties is pending on the Closing Date, Closing with respect to the unaffected Properties shall proceed and the Parties shall conduct a second closing for the affected Properties if and when the above-referenced condition to Closing is removed. If the above-referenced condition to Closing is not removed as to the affected Properties within one hundred twenty (120) Days after the Closing Date, the affected Properties, automatically and without need for amendment of this Agreement, shall be removed from this Agreement and shall be deemed Excluded Properties, and Buyer shall not be obligated to make payment to Seller for that portion of the Purchase Price allocated to such Properties, and the Parties shall have no further obligations to each other with respect to the same; and 

   

 15.3.3 all material consents and approvals (except for consents and approvals of governmental entities or authorities customarily obtained subsequent to transfer of title) have been obtained; provided, however, if on the Closing Date material consents applicable to some (but not all) of the Properties have not been obtained, Closing with respect to the unaffected Properties shall proceed, and the Parties shall conduct a second closing for the affected Properties, if and when the above-referenced condition to Closing is removed. If the above-referenced condition to Closing is not removed as to the affected Properties within one hundred eighty (180) Days after the Closing Date, the affected Properties (automatically and without need for amendment of this Agreement) shall be removed from this Agreement, and Buyer shall 

   ##### 

  

   

not be obligated to make payment to Seller for that portion of the Purchase
Price allocated to such Properties in Exhibit "A" (or, in the case of an
affected Property that is not allocated a value on Exhibit "A", as may be
mutually agreed by the Parties; provided that if no such agreement is
reached, such matters shall be an Arbitrable Dispute), and the Parties shall
have no further obligations to each other with respect to the same, 

   

 15.3.4 Seller shall have received the approval of EGPC and any applicable Governmental Authority of the A.R.E. to the assignment by Seller to Buyer of the relevant interest in and under the Concession Agreements, such approval to be evidenced by the execution of the Deed of Assignment by EGPC and the applicable Governmental Authority; 

   

 15.3.5 Seller shall have received the approval of the applicable Governmental Authority of the A.R.E. to assign that certain Terminalling Agreement dated January 12, 1989 by and between EGPC, Phillips Petroleum Company and Amoco Egypt Oil Company (as amended), and the notice period required for assignment thereunder shall have been waived or shall have expired; 

   

 15.3.6 Seller shall have procured that all Third Parties that are parties to the Material Contracts (other than the Merged Concession Agreement and the East Badr El Din Concession Agreement) shall have executed novation agreements in a similar form to that set forth in Exhibit "L"; 

   

 15.3.7 EGPCs PPR under the East Badr El Din Concession Agreement shall have been waived, expired, or exercised; and 

   

 15.3.8 Operating Company and any applicable operating company of Buyer shall have entered into, or be prepared to enter into simultaneously with the Closing hereof, the Transition Agreement, which shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Parties. 

 

provided that if all conditions precedent to Closing in respect of the sale
and purchase of the BP Egypt Properties have been satisfied or waived in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement at a time when any of the
conditions precedent referred to in Articles 15.3.4 through
15.3.7 (inclusive) shall not have been satisfied or waived in writing by both
Parties, then: 

  

(a) Closing with respect to the BP Egypt Properties shall proceed and for the
purposes of such Closing, the provisions of this Agreement shall apply as if
all references to the BP Delta Properties shall be deemed excluded therefrom
(and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by that portion allocated to the BP
Delta Properties in Exhibit "A", with no adjustments in respect of the BP
Delta Properties) with all other applicable provisions of this Agreement
continuing to apply accordingly; and 

    ##### 

  

    

(b) if after the Closing, with respect to the BP Egypt Properties, all
conditions precedent to Closing in respect of the sale and purchase of the BP
Delta Properties are satisfied or waived in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement, then the Parties shall proceed to Closing with respect to the
BP Delta Properties (and the provisions with respect to Closing shall
apply accordingly solely to the BP Delta Properties, with the Buyer being
obliged to pay that portion of the Purchase Price allocated to the BP Delta
Properties in Exhibit "A" as adjusted with respect to the BP Delta Properties
according to the provisions of this Agreement) with all other
applicable provisions of this Agreement continuing to apply accordingly. 

   

 15.4 _Timing for satisfaction of the Conditions Precedent in Article 15.3_. 

   

 Seller shall submit the unexecuted Deeds of Assignment in the forms set out in Exhibit "D-1" and Exhibit "D-2" to the applicable Governmental Authority of A.R.E. and EGPC for approval immediately following execution of this Agreement, provided always that once the form of such Deeds of Assignment has been approved by the applicable Governmental Authority of A.R.E and EGPC, the Parties agree that they shall not execute the same and submit such Deeds of Assignment to the applicable Governmental Authority of A.R.E. and EGPC for execution so as to satisfy the condition precedent in Article 15.3.4 unless and until the conditions precedent in Articles 15.3.1, 15.3.2, 15.3.3, 15.3.5, 15.3.6, 15.3.7 and 15.3.8 have been satisfied. Seller shall be entitled to hold and retain any Deeds of Assignment executed by EGPC and the applicable Governmental Authority received from such Person, pending Closing. In the event Buyer has or obtains possession of the same, or the Properties are otherwise are considered to have been conveyed to Buyer, and Buyer does not proceed to Closing, without limiting the rights of the Parties hereunder, Buyer shall promptly return, turn over, and reconvey the Properties (and any such Deeds of Assignment) to Seller. 

  

 15.5 _Execution of Partition Agreement_. 

   

 Immediately following execution of the Deeds of Assignment by the Parties as anticipated in Article 15.4, the Parties shall sign the Partition Agreement and the same shall not come into force and effect unless and until EGPC and the applicable Governmental Authority of A.R.E. execute the Deed of Assignment for the Merged Concession Agreement. 

  

ARTICLE XVI 
  _THE CLOSING_  

   

 16.1 _Closing_. No later than seven (7) Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall provide Buyer a statement ("Closing Statement") setting forth an estimate, prepared in good faith, of the Adjusted Purchase Price, taking into account the adjustments permitted hereunder. Buyer shall have four (4) Days to review the Closing Statement. On the Day following expiration of such four (4) Day review period, Buyer shall submit a written report containing any changes Buyer proposes to be made to the Closing Statement. The Parties shall attempt to agree on a final Closing Statement no later than two (2) Days prior to Closing. If the Parties are unable to agree by that date, Sellers good faith estimate shall be used to determine the Adjusted Purchase Price to be used at Closing. If the Closing Payment is a positive number, such amount shall constitute the dollar amount to be paid by Buyer to Seller at Closing pursuant 

    ##### 

  

    

to Article 16.3.1. If the Closing Payment is a negative number, the absolute
value of such amount shall constitute the dollar amount to be paid by
Seller to Buyer pursuant to Article 16.2.1. Seller or Buyer, as applicable,
also shall provide to the other Party wiring instructions designating the
account(s) to which Buyer or Seller, as applicable, shall deliver the Closing
Payment. Closing shall be held on the Closing Date in Sellers office at 200
WestLake Park Boulevard, Houston, Texas 77079 or such other place as Seller
may notify Buyer before the Closing Date. 

   

 16.2 _Seller s Obligations at Closing_. At Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer, unless waived by Buyer, the following: 

    

 16.2.1 if the Closing Payment is a negative number, the Closing Payment by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s) designated by Buyer in accordance with this Agreement; 

   

 16.2.2 the Deeds of Assignment, assigning all of Sellers right, title and interests in the Properties, executed by an Attorney-in-Fact of Seller and acknowledged, in four (4) multiple originals (or such greater number as may be required by any Governmental Authority or EGPC or as the Parties agree); 

   

 16.2.3 four (4) originals of the Certificate executed by an authorized officer or an Attorney-in-Fact of Seller; 

   

 16.2.4 four (4) originals of a Secretarys Certificate or Assistant Secretarys Certificate certifying as to the due authorization of Sellers signatory to the documents signed at Closing; 

   

 16.2.5 four (4) originals of the Transition Agreement executed by Operating Company, BP Egypt and BP Delta; 

   

 16.2.6 if applicable, four (4) originals of the Seismic License executed by an authorized officer or an Attorney-in-Fact of Seller;

   ##### 

  

  

 16.3 _Buyer s Obligations at Closing_. At Closing, Buyer shall deliver to Seller (collectively), unless waived by Seller, the following: 

   

 16.3.1 if the Closing Payment is a positive number, the Closing Payment by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s) designated by Seller in accordance with this Agreement; 

   

 16.3.2 the documents referred to in Articles 16.2.2, 16.2.3, 16.2.5, 16.2.6, 16.2.7 and 16.2.8, executed by an authorized officer or an Attorney-in-Fact of Buyer (and, with respect to Article 16.2.5, any applicable operating company) and acknowledged; 

   

 16.3.3 four (4) originals of the Certificate executed by an authorized officer or an Attorney-in-Fact of Buyer; 

   

 16.3.4 four (4) originals of (i) certificates of the appropriate governmental authorities, dated as of a date not earlier than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, evidencing Buyers existence and good standing in the States of Delaware, and (ii) certificates of the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of Buyer (and with respect to the Guaranty Agreement, Buyers Affiliate), dated on the Closing Date, certifying (A) that a true and correct copy of the resolutions of Buyers board of directors authorizing this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are attached thereto have been duly adopted and are in full force and effect; (B) that true and correct copies of the certificate of formation, all amendments thereto and bylaws (or other applicable organizational documents) of Buyer are attached thereto; and (C) as to the incumbency and authorization of Buyers signatory executing on behalf of Buyer this Agreement and the other documents executed in connection herewith and Buyers Affiliates signatory, with respect to the Guaranty Agreement); and

ARTICLE XVII 
  _TERMINATION_  

   

 17.1 _Grounds for Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated (except for the individual provisions specifically referenced in Article 17.2 below) at any time prior to Closing (unless another date is stated below): 

    

 17.1.1 by the Parties mutual written agreement; 

   

 17.1.2 by either Party, if consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement would violate any non-appealable final order, decree or judgment of any state or federal court or agency enjoining, 

   ##### 

  

   

restraining, prohibiting or awarding substantial damages in connection with
(a) Sellers proposed sale of Properties to Buyer, or (b) consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

   

 17.1.3 by Seller, if Buyer refuses or fails to fulfill its obligations under Article 2.4, without necessity of notice or right to cure; 

   

 17.1.4 by either Party, if at any time prior to the Closing Date, such Party becomes aware that any condition precedent to such Partys obligation to Close cannot be satisfied prior to the Closing Date, provided, however, that the terminating Party shall have given the other Party at least five (5) Business Days ("cure period") in which to attempt to cure the situation and at the end of such cure period, the relevant condition precedent remains unable to be satisfied prior to the Closing Date; 

   

 17.1.5 notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, by the Seller or Buyer, if Closing has not occurred on or before July 19, 2011 (unless such date is extended by mutual agreement of the Parties); provided, however, that no Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Article 17.1.5 if such Party is at such time in material breach of any provision of this Agreement; or 

   

 17.1.6 by either Party, if the Termination Defect Amount meets or exceeds the requisite amount set forth in the definition of such term. 

  

 17.2 _Effect of Termination; Failure to Close_. Except as otherwise provided in this Article 17.2, if this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article 17.1, such termination is without liability to either Party, except performance of obligations in this Article 17.2, Articles 5.1.2, 17.3, 17.4, 18.1, 18.2, 19.1, 19.3, 19.7, 19.8, 19.10, 19.12, 19.13, 19.14, 19.15, 19.16, 19.17 and 19.20, all of which provisions survive termination of this Agreement. If Closing does not occur, Seller shall on the earlier of (i) August 1, 2011 or (ii) within three (3) Business Days after termination of this Agreement, refund the Performance Deposit together with Computed Interest thereon through the end of the Day immediately preceding the date of such refund to Buyer unless Closing did not occur because of Buyers material breach of this Agreement or Buyers failure or refusal to Close that is not permitted by the terms of this Agreement. If Closing does not occur because of Buyers material breach of this Agreement or Buyers failure or refusal to Close that is not permitted by the terms of this Agreement, Seller shall, on the earlier of (i) August 1, 2011 or (ii) within three (3) Business Days after termination of this Agreement, refund to Buyer an amount equal to (i) the Performance Deposit together with Computed Interest thereon through the end of the Day immediately preceding the date of such refund minus (ii) an amount equal to five percent (5%) of the Purchase Price together with Computed Interest thereon from July 30, 2010 through the end of the Day immediately preceding the date of such refund (the "Reverse Breakup Fee"). Sellers retention of the Reverse Breakup Fee shall constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty. Each Party agrees that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that the Reverse Breakup Fee shall be retained by Seller in accordance with this Article 17.2, the payment of such Reverse Breakup Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of any member of the Seller Group 

    ##### 

  

    

against any member of the Buyer Group, and in no event will any member of the
Seller Group seek to recover any other money damages or seek any other remedy
based on a claim at law or in equity with respect to (1) any loss suffered,
directly or indirectly, as a result of the failure of the transactions
contemplated hereby to be consummated, (2) the termination of this Agreement,
(3) any liabilities or obligations arising under this Agreement, or (4) any
claims or actions arising out of or relating to any breach, termination or
failure of or under this Agreement, and no member of the Buyer Group shall
have any further liability or obligation to any member of the Seller Group
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby. The provisions for payment of the Reverse Breakup Fee as liquidated
damages in this Article 17.2 have been included because, in the event of
termination of this Agreement as described in Article 17.2, both Buyer and
Seller agree that the actual damages that would be incurred by Seller are
reasonably expected to approximate the amount of the Reverse Breakup Fee and
because the actual amount of such damages would be difficult, if not
impossible, to measure precisely and Buyer waives any rights to claim
otherwise, and Seller shall have no liability or obligation to any member of
the Buyer Group relating to or arising out of the Reverse Breakup Fee. 

   

 17.3 _Dispute over Right to Terminate_. If there is a dispute between the Parties over the right of a Party to terminate this Agreement, Closing shall not occur on the Closing Date, and the Party that disputes the right of the other Party to terminate is entitled, within thirty (30) Business Days after the Closing Date, to initiate litigation to resolve the dispute. If the Party that disputes the other Partys right to terminate this Agreement does not initiate litigation within the thirty (30) Business Day period, this Agreement shall be deemed properly terminated as of the original date of termination (without prejudice to Sellers right to retain the Reverse Breakup Fee together with any interest earned thereon pursuant to Article 17.2), and the Party that disputes or has a right to dispute termination of this Agreement, on behalf of itself, its Affiliates, and the officers, directors, agents, employees, successors and assigns of itself and its Affiliates, irrevocably waives any and all claims it and they may have against the terminating Party for termination of this Agreement. 

   

 17.4 _Confidentiality_. Notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement remain in full force and effect, provided that if and when Closing occurs and effective on the Closing Date, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate to the extent (and only to the extent) it applies to the Properties conveyed at Closing. 

   

ARTICLE XVIII 
  _ARBITRATION_  

   

 18.1 _Friendly Consultation_. In the event of any Arbitrable Dispute, the Parties shall attempt in the first instance to resolve such dispute through friendly consultations between the Parties. The Parties agree to attempt to resolve all Arbitrable Disputes arising hereunder promptly, equitably and in a good faith manner. 

    ##### 

  

     

 18.2 _Arbitration_. 

    

 18.2.1 The Parties shall attempt to resolve any Arbitrable Dispute promptly by negotiation between representatives who have authority to settle the controversy. Either Party may give the other Party written notice of any Arbitrable Dispute not resolved in the normal course of business. Within thirty (30) Days after delivery of the notice, the receiving Party shall submit to the other a written response. The notice and response shall include (a) a statement of that Partys position and a summary of arguments supporting that position, and (b) the name and title of that Partys representative and of any other Person who will accompany the representative. Within thirty (30) Days after delivery of the initial notice, the executives of both Parties shall meet at a mutually acceptable time and place, and thereafter continue to meet as often as they reasonably deem necessary, to use their good faith and reasonable efforts to attempt to resolve the dispute. All negotiations pursuant to this clause shall be confidential and shall be treated as compromise and settlement negotiations for purposes of applicable rules of evidence. 

   

 18.2.2 If an Arbitrable Dispute has not been resolved within sixty (60) Days after delivery of the initial notice set forth in Article 18.2.1, or if the Parties failed to meet within thirty (30) Days after delivery of such notice, the Parties shall endeavor to settle the dispute by mediation under the AAA Mediation Procedure then currently in effect. Either Party may ask AAA to select a mediator or the Parties may mutually agree on a mediator. 

   

 18.2.3 If any Arbitrable Dispute has not been resolved within sixty (60) Days after a Party initially asked the AAA to select a mediator pursuant to Article 18.2.2, then, at the request of either Party, such Arbitrable Dispute shall be submitted to binding arbitration in accordance with the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect (the "AAA Rules"). 

   

 18.2.4 Except as otherwise provided in Article 5.4 any arbitration hereunder will be conducted before a panel that shall consist of two (2) Party-appointed arbitrators, one (1) appointed by Seller and one (1) appointed by Buyer and a third neutral arbitrator who shall chair the panel. No arbitrator may be a current or former officer, director, employee or consultant of, or other person who has had a business or personal relationship with, a Party or of any of its Affiliates. Each arbitrator must be an attorney licensed in the State of Texas and must have not less than seven (7) years of experience in the U.S. oil and gas industry. The third arbitrator (if applicable) shall be selected as provided in the AAA Rules. 

   

 18.2.5 The arbitration shall proceed under the AAA Rules and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Section 1, et. seq. If there is any inconsistency between this Article 18 and the AAA Rules or the Federal Arbitration Act, this Article 18 shall control. The arbitrators may, in 

   ##### 

  

   

their discretion, limit or expand discovery in any arbitration proceeding.
The arbitrators award shall be in writing. The Parties expressly covenant
and agree to be bound by the award of the arbitrators as a final
determination of the matter in dispute, and a judgment thereon may be entered
in any court of competent jurisdiction. In rendering an award the arbitrators
shall abide by (a) the terms and conditions of this Agreement and (b) the
Laws of the State of Texas. The arbitrators shall not have jurisdiction or
authority to add to, detract from or alter in any way the provisions of this
Agreement. The arbitrators may award equitable relief, such as specific
performance, as well as monetary damages for any Partys breach of such
Partys obligations under this Agreement, but in no event may the arbitrators
award punitive damages or any other damages expressly waived in Article
8.10. 

   

 18.2.6 The arbitration shall take place in Houston, Texas. 

   

 18.2.7 The arbitration panel may apportion the costs of arbitration between the Parties in such manner as it deems reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the Arbitrable Dispute, the conduct of the Parties and the result of arbitration. The arbitration panel shall be empowered and directed to enter an award by default against any Party to the arbitration who declines to pay when required by the arbitration panel its share of such fees and costs. In addition, the arbitration panel, shall be entitled to award to a Party such Partys reasonable attorneys fees and expert fees, as determined by the arbitration panel considering those factors mentioned in the first sentence of this Article 18.2.7, incurred in connection with such Partys preparation for and participation in the arbitration. 

   

 18.2.8 The arbitrators shall follow the Code of Ethics for Arbitrators in Commercial Disputes approved by the American Bar Association House of Delegates on February 9, 2004 and approved by the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors of the American Arbitration Association. 

   

 18.2.9 Notwithstanding the other provisions set forth in this Article 18, a court of competent jurisdiction may issue a pre-arbitral injunction, pre-arbitral attachment, or other order in aid of arbitration proceedings and the enforcement of any award. Without prejudice to such provisional remedies as may be available under the jurisdiction of a court, the arbitral tribunal shall have full authority to grant provisional remedies and to direct the Parties to request that any court modify or vacate any temporary or preliminary relief issued by such court. 

   

 18.2.10 Before a request to arbitrate under Article 18.2.3 is given or prior to the selection of the arbitrator(s), nothing contained herein shall prevent a Party from applying to a court that would otherwise have jurisdiction for provisional or interim measures. After the arbitrator(s) has been selected, they shall have sole jurisdiction to hear such applications, 

   ##### 

  

   

except that any measures ordered by the arbitrator(s) may be immediately and
specifically enforced by a court otherwise having jurisdiction over the
Parties.

 19.3 _Brokers, Agents and Finders_. Neither Seller or any of its Affiliates has retained any brokers, agents or finders in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby for which Buyer or its Affiliates shall have any liability. Seller releases Buyer Group from and shall fully protect, indemnify and defend Buyer Group and hold them harmless from and against any and all claims relating to, arising out of, or connected with, directly or indirectly, commissions, finders fees or other remuneration due to any agent, broker or finder claiming by, through or under Seller or its Affiliates.

 19.4 _Records_. At Closing and through the Transition Period, Seller shall grant Buyer reasonable access to the Records. No later than the end of the Transition Period (except as provided below), Seller shall furnish Buyer electronic copies of the Records that are maintained by Seller and such copies of the Records shall become the property of the Buyer; with the 

    ##### 

  

    

understanding that Seller may retain originals or copies of any Records. If

to the Records and a right to copy the Records at Sellers expense as
reasonably requested by Seller. In addition, Buyer shall afford Seller full
access to records and data produced after the Closing Date and reasonably
requested by Seller in connection with any claim by Buyer for indemnity or
breach of Sellers representations, warranties or covenants under this
Agreement (excluding, however, attorney work product and attorney-client
communications entitled to legal privilege), and a right to copy such records
and data at Sellers expense. 

   

 19.5 _Further Assurances_. After Closing and on an on-going basis: (a) Buyer shall execute and deliver or use reasonable efforts to cause to be executed and delivered any other instruments of conveyance and take any other actions as Seller reasonably requests to more effectively put Seller in possession of any property that was not intended to be (i) a Property or (ii) conveyed or was conveyed in error (including reassignment from Buyer to Seller of any Properties that were conveyed in violation of valid preferential purchase rights or material consents to assignment disclosed in Schedules to this Agreement and subject commensurate payment adjustment), or to implement Buyers assumption of obligations pursuant to Article 12.2; and (b) Seller shall execute and deliver or use reasonable efforts to cause to be executed and delivered any other instruments of conveyance and take any other actions as Buyer reasonably requests to more effectively put Buyer in possession of the Properties conveyed or to have been conveyed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Except to the extent constituting Excluded Properties, Seller and Buyer agree that it is the intent of the Parties that Seller assign and convey to Buyer all of the upstream oil and gas assets relating to the Properties owned by Seller as contractor, which were reflected in the financial information provided to Buyer in the Data Room or were, as of the Effective Time (and with respect to upstream oil and gas assets acquired by Seller after the Effective Time but prior to Closing, as of the Closing Date) located in the Western Desert Area or East Badr El Din Concession Area of the A.R.E. The Parties shall execute and deliver documents conveying all of Sellers right, title and interest in the federal, state and tribal interests in the Properties on forms approved by the governmental authority or tribal authority, executed by an Attorney-in-Fact of Seller and acknowledged, in the number required by the governmental authority or tribal authority or such greater number as the Parties agree as promptly as reasonably practicable following Closing. For a period of two (2) years after the Closing Date, to the extent any Affiliate of Seller (other than Operating Company) has given notice to terminate a Contract pursuant to its terms, Buyer shall have the right (in its sole discretion) to retain such Contract under the same terms and conditions therein and to extend the term thereof up to a date ending two (2) years after the Closing Date. 

   

 19.6 _Survival of Certain Obligations_. Except for the representation and warranty in Article 10.1.6, which shall survive indefinitely and the representation and warranty in Article 10.1.23, which shall terminate six (6) years after the Closing Date, the representations and warranties of the Parties in Articles 10 and 11 terminate twenty-four (24) months after the Closing Date; and thereafter no action can be commenced either in court or disputes brought to arbitration based on breach of those representations and warranties, without prejudice to the right to recovery in connection with actions or disputes commenced in the appropriate forum prior to the end of such periods. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, waivers, 

    ##### 

  

    

disclaimers, releases and obligations of indemnity and defense contained in
this Agreement survive the Closing indefinitely. 

   

 19.7 _Amendments and Severability_. No amendments, waivers or other modifications of terms of this Agreement shall be effective or binding on the Parties unless they are written and signed by both Parties. Invalidity of any provisions in this Agreement shall not affect the validity of this Agreement as a whole, and in case of such invalidity, this Agreement shall be construed as if the invalid provision had not been included herein. 

   

 19.8 _Successors and Assigns_. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, this Agreement may not be assigned, (in whole or in part), without the express prior written consent of the non-assigning Party, except that Seller may assign its rights to proceeds hereunder. The terms, covenants and conditions contained in this Agreement are binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their permitted successors and assigns. 

   

 19.9 _Headings_. Titles and headings in this Agreement have been included solely for ease of reference and shall not be considered in interpretation or construction of this Agreement. 

   

 19.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement (including administration of binding arbitration pursuant to Article 18) is governed by the Laws of the State of Texas, excluding any choice of law rules that would direct application of Laws of another jurisdiction. Any action permitted by this Agreement to be commenced in court shall be brought and maintained exclusively in federal or state court located in Harris County, Texas, and each Party hereby waives any objection it may have thereto. 

   

 19.11 _No Partnership Created_. It is not the purpose or intention of this Agreement to create (and it shall not be construed as creating) a joint venture, partnership or any type of association, and neither Party is authorized to act as an agent or principal for the other Party with respect to any matter related hereto. 

    

 19.12 _Public Announcements_. Seller (on behalf of Seller Group) and Buyer (on behalf of Buyer Group) agree not to issue any public statement or press release concerning this Agreement or the transaction contemplated by it (including price or other terms) without prior notice to and written consent of the other Party; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to any such issuance (i) to a governmental authority, listing authority or other entity when required by Law or to the extent such data and information is required to be furnished in compliance with any applicable Laws, listing agreement or exchange regulation or pursuant to any legal proceedings or because of any order of any court binding upon the issuing Party, or (ii) to the extent that it must be disclosed pursuant to any rules or requirements of any government or stock exchange having jurisdiction over the issuing Party, in each case after prior consultation with the other Party. 

  

 19.13 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing contained in this Agreement entitles anyone other than Seller or Buyer or their permitted successors and assigns to any claim, cause of action, remedy or right of any kind whatsoever, except with respect to 

    ##### 

  

    

waivers and indemnities or other provisions in this Agreement that
expressly provide for waivers or indemnification of Buyer Group or Seller
Group, in which case members of such groups are considered third party
beneficiaries for the sole purposes of those waiver and indemnity
provisions. 

   

 19.14 _Indemnities Applicability_. The release, defense, indemnification and hold harmless provisions provided for in this Agreement shall be applicable whether or not the claims, demands, suits, causes of action, losses, damages, liabilities, fines, penalties and costs (including attorneys fees and costs of litigation) in question arose solely or in part from the active, passive or concurrent negligence, strict liability, breach of duty (statutory or otherwise), violation of Law, or other fault of any Indemnified Party, or from any pre-existing defect. 

   

 19.15 _Waiver of Consumer Rights_. As partial consideration for the Parties entering into this Agreement, each Party can and does hereby waive the provisions of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Consumer Protection Act, Article 17.41 et seq., Texas Business and Commerce Code, a law that gives consumers special rights and protection, and all other consumer protection Laws of the State of Texas, or of any other state that may be applicable to this transaction, that may be waived by such Party. It is not the intent of either Party to waive and neither Party does waive any Law or provision thereof that is prohibited by Law from being waived. Each Party represents that it has had an adequate opportunity to review the preceding waiver provision, including the opportunity to submit the same to legal counsel for review and advice, and after consultation with an attorney of its own selection voluntarily consents to this waiver and understands the rights being waived herein. 

   

 19.16 _Not to be Construed Against Drafter_. Each Party has had an adequate opportunity to review each and every provision of this Agreement and to submit the same to legal counsel for review and advice. Based on the foregoing, the rule of construction, if any, that a contract is construed against the drafter shall not apply to interpretation or construction of this Agreement. 

   

 19.17 _Conspicuousness of Provisions_. The Parties agree that provisions of this Agreement in "bold" or all capitalized type satisfy any requirement of the "express negligence rule" and other requirement at law or in equity that provisions be conspicuously marked or highlighted. 

   

 19.18 _Possible Exchange_. Each Party reserves the right to structure the transactions contemplated under the terms of this Agreement as a non-simultaneous like-kind exchange pursuant to Section 1031 of the Code, as amended. If a Party elects to so structure this transaction, the Parties shall execute all documents reasonably necessary for such Party to effectuate the non-simultaneous like-kind exchange. 

   

 19.19 _Execution in Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, that when taken together constitute one valid and binding agreement. 

   

 19.20 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement supersede all prior and contemporaneous negotiations, understandings, letters of intent, understandings and agreements (whether oral or written) between the Parties or their 

    ##### 

  

    

Affiliates relating to the terms of purchase and sale of the Properties and
constitute the entire understanding and agreement between the Parties with
respect to the sale, assignment and conveyance of the Properties and other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 19.21 _Time Periods_. Whenever any period of time (but not a date certain) for performance is specified hereunder, if either Party is stayed or enjoined from taking the action required during such period, then the period shall automatically be adjusted to end on the later of the original period of time and thirty (30) Days after expiration of the stay or injunction. 

   

 19.22 _Time of the Essence_. Time is of the essence with respect to all provisions of this Agreement that specify a time for performance; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not be construed to limit or deprive a Party of the benefits of any grace or cure period allowed in this Agreement.
