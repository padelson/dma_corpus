 §2.6. _Allocation of Purchase Price_. (a) Sellers and Purchaser agree to allocate the aggregate Purchase Price to be paid pursuant to this Agreement as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes in accordance with the Code (specifically Section 1060 or Section 338, as applicable, of the Code (or any comparable provisions of state or local law) or any successor provision). Sellers and Purchaser agree that Sellers shall prepare and provide to Purchaser a draft allocation of such Purchase Price (the " _Allocation Schedule_ ") as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.3 among the Companies and the Singapore Assets within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date. Purchaser shall notify Sellers within thirty (30) days of receipt of such draft allocation of any reasonable objection Purchaser may have thereto.

    ##### 

  

     

by the IRS or by court decision. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, the foregoing agreement of this Section 2.6 shall survive the
Closing Date without limitation. 

   

ARTICLE III 

   

 _REPRESENTATIONS OF EACH SELLER_  

   

 Each Seller, solely with respect to matters concerning itself and not with respect to matters concerning any other Seller, represents and warrants to Purchaser as follows: 

   

 §3.1. _Existence and Good Standing of Seller; Ownership of Equity Interests and Singapore Assets_. Such Seller is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (to the extent applicable) under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or formation, with full corporate power and authority to conduct the EDP Business as presently conducted and to own or use the properties and assets that it purports to own or use in the EDP Business. Such Seller is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing under the laws of each state or other jurisdiction in which either the ownership or use of the EDP Business requires such qualification, except for such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified and, where applicable, in good standing, does not have a Material Adverse Effect on such Seller or the EDP Companies and the EDP Asia Business, taken as a whole. Such Seller is the lawful owner, beneficially and of record, of the Equity Interests set forth opposite its name on _Annex D_ , free and clear of all Liens, except for Liens set forth in _Section 4.5_ of the Sellers Disclosure Letter or Liens created by Purchaser. Quintiles Asia has good title to the Singapore Assets, free and clear of all Liens, except for Permitted Liens. 

  

 §3.2. _Authorization; Non-Contravention_. (a) Such Seller has the requisite power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Transaction Documents to which it is a party, to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, as applicable. The execution, delivery and performance by such Seller of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents to which it is a party, and the consummation by it of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, as applicable, have been duly authorized and approved by such Seller and no other corporate or other action on the part of such Seller is necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance by such Seller of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which such Seller is a party and the consummation by such Seller of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, as applicable. This Agreement and, when executed and delivered, the Transaction Documents to which such Seller is a party, have been, or will have been, as the case may be, duly executed and delivered by such Seller and, assuming that this Agreement and the Transaction Documents to which such Seller is a party constitute a valid and binding obligation of the other parties thereto, constitute a valid and binding obligation of such Seller enforceable against such Seller in accordance with their respective terms, except to the extent that their enforceability may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally and by general equitable principles. 

  

 (b) The execution and delivery and performance by such Seller of this Agreement and, when executed and delivered, the Transaction Documents to which it is a party, as applicable, do not or, as the case may be, will not (i) conflict with or violate any of the provi-

described above. 

   

 (e) Each party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, permit the other party and its representatives to copy any Files and Records that such other party is entitled to access under this Section 6.2 or, where reasonably necessary and available, to use the original documents.

For example, such access process may provide procedures related to normal hours of access, retrieval and delivery of the requested Files and Records by the party holding such Files and Records rather than permitting direct access of the requesting party to the storage facility or source and allocation of responsibility for expenses associated with retrieval and copying of Files and Records. 

  

 (g) Purchaser hereby agrees to cause the EDP Companies to fulfill their respective Files and Records retention and access obligations under the Reorganization Agreements.

without the prior written consent of Sellers and Purchaser.

 (c) With respect to each employee benefit plan, policy or practice, including vacation plans, policies or practices, sponsored or maintained by Purchaser or its Affiliates, Purchaser shall grant, or cause to be granted to, all U.S. EDP Employees from and after the Closing Date credit for all service with Sellers, the EDP Companies and their respective Affiliates and predecessors, prior to the Closing Date for all purposes (including eligibility to participate, vesting credit, eligibility to commence benefits, benefit accrual and early retirement subsidies (but excluding severance, which shall be governed by Section 6.5(a)(ii) exclusively)); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that nothing in this Section 6.5(c) shall prevent Purchaser from amending or terminating any such plan, policy or practice at any time, subject to continued compliance with this Section 6.5. 

   

 §6.6. _Notification of Certain Matters_. Purchaser, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, shall promptly notify each other in writing of (i) any material actions, suits, claims or proceedings in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement commenced or, to the knowledge of Purchaser or the Knowledge of Sellers, as applicable, threatened against the EDP Business or the EDP Companies, as the case may be, (ii) the existence or occurrence, or failure to occur, of any fact or event of which, to the knowledge of Purchaser or to the Knowledge of Sellers, as applicable, would cause any representation or warranty of Purchaser or Sellers, respectively, contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate at any time from the date of this Agreement to the Closing assuming such representation or warranty is made at such time; (iii) the failure of Purchaser or Sellers to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant to be complied with by it hereunder; (iii) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any fact or event which would be reasonably likely to cause any condition set forth in Article VII not to be satisfied; (iv) any written notice or other written communication from any Person alleging that the consent or approval of such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (v) any written notice or other written communication from any Governmental or Regulatory Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than notices and communications regarding transfer of Permits as contemplated by the Reorganization Agreements).

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the context of this Section 6.8, "commercially reasonable efforts" shall include; 

   

 (i) if Purchaser or Sellers receive a formal request for additional information or documentary material from an Antitrust Authority, Purchaser and Sellers shall substantially comply with such formal request as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event within sixty (60) days following the date of its receipt thereof; 

   

 (ii) promptly upon any filing, Purchaser or Sellers, as the case may be, shall provide the other party a complete copy of any filing with any Antitrust Authority and each of Purchaser and Sellers shall promptly respond to any request from the other for information or documentation reasonably requested by the other party in connection with the development and implementation of a strategy and negotiating positions with any Antitrust Authorities; _provided_ , that access to any such filing, information or documentation shall, at such partys request, be re-

 (e) Purchaser shall be responsible for the payment of Sellers and the EDP Companies expenses in connection with obtaining the approval of any Antitrust Authority, including legal fees and expenses, in substantially complying with any formal request for additional information or documentary material from any Antitrust Authority and in connection with any litigation.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6.10(a) does not prohibit or prevent, during the Covenant Period, Sellers respective Affiliates in India, China, South Africa, Argentina, or Mexico from performing any Contract or work order in existence as of the Closing Date for labeling, storage, or distribution services that are not incidental to a comprehensive clinical program managed for a sponsor by Sellers or their respective Affiliates. 

  

 (b) Purchaser agrees that, during the Covenant Period, Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, engage in or carry on any business anywhere in the world selling products or services in competition with Sellers and their respective Affiliates business as conducted on the Closing Date, other than the EDP Business. 

   

 §6.11. _Non-Solicitation_. (a) Purchaser agrees that during the Covenant Period, Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, solicit, request, induce or attempt to influence, directly or indirectly, any employee of Sellers or their Affiliates as of the date hereof to terminate his or her employment with any such party; _provided_ , _however_ : (i) this Section 6.11(a) shall not apply with respect to any employees of an EDP Company or the employees of the EDP Asia Business following the Closing and (ii) Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not be precluded by this Section 6.11 from (x) hiring any employee of Sellers or their Affiliates who responds independently to a general advertisement or solicitation for employment that was not targeted at employees of Sellers or their Affiliates or (y) hiring any Person who has quit or resigned from Sellers or their Affiliates, or who has been terminated by Sellers or their Affiliates, prior to commencement of communications between Purchaser or its Affiliates and such Person. 

  

 (b) Sellers agree that during the Covenant Period, Sellers shall not, and shall cause their Subsidiaries not to, solicit, request, induce or attempt to influence, directly or indirectly, any employee of an EDP Company to terminate his or her employment relationship with such party;  _provided_ , _however_ , that a Seller and its Affiliates shall not be precluded by this Section 6.11 from (i) hiring any employee of an EDP Company who responds independently to a general advertisement or solicitation for employment that was not targeted at post-Closing Date employees of an EDP Company or (ii) hiring any Person who has quit or resigned from an EDP Company, or who has been terminated by an EDP Company, prior to commencement of communications between a Seller or its Affiliates and such Person. 

   

 §6.12. _Sellers  Marks_. Purchaser, the EDP Companies (after the Closing) and each of their respective Affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, successors, assigns, agents, or representatives shall not register, or attempt to register, and shall not directly or indirectly use, in 

   ##### 

  

  

any fashion, including in signage, corporate letterhead, business cards,
Internet web sites, marketing material and the like, or seek to register, in
connection with any products or services anywhere in the world in any medium,
any Intellectual Property that includes, is identical to or is confusingly
similar to, any of the trademarks, service marks, domain names, trade names or
other indicia of origin (i) set forth in _Section 6.12_ of the Sellers
Disclosure Letter or (ii) known by, or made known to, Purchaser, the EDP
Companies and their respective Affiliates to be owned as of the Closing Date
by Sellers or any Affiliate of Sellers (other than the EDP
Companies) (collectively, " _Sellers  Marks_"), nor shall any of them
challenge or assist any third party in opposing the rights of Sellers or any
Affiliate of Sellers anywhere in the world in any such Intellectual Property.
For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall any of the
Intellectual Property of the EDP Companies following Closing include
Intellectual Property that includes, is identical to or is confusingly
similar to, any of Sellers Marks. The parties agree that Sellers and the
U.S. Company shall cause Quintiles Supplies to take all necessary corporate
action to change Quintiles Supplies corporate name to a name that does not
include "Quintiles" or a name confusingly similar to "Quintiles", effective
as of the Closing, and Sellers counsel is hereby authorized to make
appropriate filings with the Secretary of State of the State of New
Jersey, immediately following the Closing to effectuate such name change. Any
provisions contained in any Contracts between Sellers or any Affiliate of
Sellers (other than the EDP Companies), on the one hand, and the EDP
Companies, on the other hand, relating to the use of the name "Quintiles" or
any derivatives thereof or anything confusingly similar thereto, including
all name protection and license agreements, shall immediately and
automatically terminate as of the Closing Date. Purchaser shall ensure that,
as soon as practicable (but in no event more than ninety (90) days following
the Closing Date with respect to materials that publicly display Sellers
Marks or are otherwise distributed to the public (including letterhead,
advertising materials, marketing brochures, signage and the like)), any
materials bearing Sellers Marks are either destroyed or otherwise
permanently altered so that the former use of Sellers Marks is entirely
unrecognizable and undetectable. Furthermore, Purchaser shall ensure that, as
soon as practicable (but in no event more than ninety (90) days following the
Closing Date) any hypertext links to Internet web sites operated by Sellers
or their Affiliates and any other use of Sellers Marks are removed from any
Internet web sites operated by the EDP Companies or their respective
Affiliates;  _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing,
Purchaser shall ensure such removal on or before the fifth (5th) day after
it, the EDP Companies or Purchaser become aware of such links or use. 

   

 §6.13. _Kansas City Facility Assignment_. Immediately following the Closing, Quintiles, Inc. shall assign to the U.S. Company all of its rights under, and transfer to the U.S. Company all of its obligations and liabilities arising under, the Operation, Maintenance and Utility Service Agreement and the Services Agreement as contemplated by the Kansas City Assignment and Assumption Agreement and the Kansas City Sublease entered into by and between Quintiles, Inc. and the U.S. Company in connection with the Reorganization, and the U.S. Company shall assume all such obligations and liabilities. 

  

 §6.14. _Tax Returns; Apportionment of Taxes_. (a) Sellers shall have the exclusive authority to file or cause to be filed all Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to Sellers for all taxable years or periods and with respect to the EDP Business and the EDP Companies for all taxable years or periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date and shall pay all Taxes shown as due on such Returns. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, Purchaser shall have the exclusive authority to file or cause to be filed all Returns that are required to be 

   ##### 

  

  

filed with respect to the EDP Business and the EDP Companies for any taxable
year or other taxable period; _provided_ , _however_ , that items set forth
on such Returns relating to an Overlap Period shall be treated in a manner
consistent with the past practices of Sellers and the EDP Companies with
respect to such items unless otherwise required by Law or Order; and 
_provided_ , _further_ , that such Returns relating to an Overlap Period shall
not be filed without Sellers prior written consent, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Sellers shall pay Purchaser, on or
before the due date thereof, the amount of all Taxes shown as due on any
Return relating to an Overlap Period that are allocable to the taxable
periods, or portions thereof, ending on or before the Closing Date (as
determined under subsection (b) herein), but only to the extent such Taxes
exceed the amount of Taxes that were taken into account in determining the
Final Working Capital. 

   

 (b) Any Taxes with respect to the EDP Business and the EDP Companies that relate to the Overlap Period shall be apportioned between the portion of such period ending on or prior to the Closing Date and the portion of such period beginning after the Closing Date as follows: (i) except as provided in (ii) and (iii) below, to the extent feasible, on a specific identification basis, according to the date of the transaction giving rise to the Tax, (ii) in the case of Taxes other than income, sales and use and withholding Taxes, on a per diem basis, and (iii) in the case of income, sales and use and withholding Taxes, as determined from the books and records of Sellers and the EDP Companies as though the taxable year of Sellers or the EDP Company terminated at the close of business on the Closing Date. 

   

 (c) In the event that a chargeable gain arises under Section 179 Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 as a result of the Purchaser acquiring the U.K. Company, Sellers agree that Quintiles Limited and the U.K. Company will make a joint election under Section 179A Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 within two years after the end of the accounting period of the U.K. Company in which the time of accrual fell, as defined in Section 179A(2) of that act. 

   

 (d) Purchaser, at its expense, shall cooperate with Sellers and use its commercial best efforts to establish with applicable Governmental and Regulatory Authorities, effective as of Closing, Tax identification numbers and registrations for the EDP Companies that are separate and independent from Sellers and their respective Affiliates (other than the EDP Companies), including VAT and PAYE Tax registrations for the U.K. Company and unemployment and FICA Tax registrations for the U.S. Company and Quintiles Supplies. 

   

 (e) Quintiles Limited and Purchaser agree, and Purchaser agrees to cause the U.K. Company, to each file tax returns consistent with the allocation methodology described in _Section 6.14(e)_ of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule. To the extent that (i) the tax losses or tax written down values allocated to the U.K. Company as of June 1, 2005 are changed on inquiry by HM Revenue and Customs under the provisions of Section 343 Taxes Act 1988 and (ii) as a consequence, a deferred tax liability arises to the U.K. Company at June 1, 2005, as computed under United Kingdom generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied, then Sellers shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal to the tax benefit to Sellers, if any, or the tax liability to Purchaser, if any, within ninety (90) days of such benefit being realized for tax purposes by Sellers or such liability being realized for tax purposes by Purchaser, as applicable. 

    ##### 

  

     

 §6.15. _U.K. Employee Transfer Regulations_. (a) For a period of one year after the Closing Date, with respect to the U.K. EDP Employees, Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the EDP Companies) not to, detrimentally change the U.K. EDP Employees contractual terms, salary, benefits and/or remuneration. 

  

 (b) In the event a U.K. Employee listed on _Schedule 6.15(b)_ of the Sellers Disclosure Letter is terminated by the U.K. Company within a period of twelve (12) months after the Closing Date and Purchaser notified Sellers in writing of such U.K. Employees termination within three (3) months after the Closing Date, Sellers shall indemnify Purchaser and the EDP Companies from and against the severance payment to which such U.K. Employee is entitled under the U.K. Employment Agreement to which such U.K. Employee is a party or under Law and shall reimburse Purchaser and the EDP Companies within thirty (30) days of receipt of an invoice for any such amounts,  _provided_ that (i) such payment is actually made by Purchaser or the U.K. Company to such U.K. Employee on termination of his or her employment and (ii) Sellers obligation to indemnify does not exceed the amount set forth opposite such U.K. Employees name on _Schedule 6.15(b)_ of Sellers Disclosure Letter. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Sellers shall be under no obligation to indemnify Purchaser or the EDP Companies under this Section 6.15(b) for any protective award claims, any unfair dismissal claims, any discrimination claims or other claims whatsoever and howsoever relating to such U.K. Employees employment or the termination thereof. 

   

 §6.16. _Tax Refunds_. (a) Any Tax refund (including any interest in respect thereof) received by Purchaser, the EDP Companies, or any of the Affiliates thereof and any amounts of overpayments of Tax credited against Tax which Purchaser, the EDP Companies or any of the Affiliates thereof otherwise would be or would have been required to pay that relate to the EDP Business with respect to any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date shall be for the account of Sellers, and Purchaser shall pay over to Sellers any such refund or the amount of any such credit within five (5) days after receipt or entitlement thereto. 

  

 (b) Any Tax refund (including any interest in respect thereof) received by Sellers or any of their Affiliates and any amounts of overpayments of Tax credited against Tax which Sellers or any of their Affiliates otherwise would be or would have been required to pay that relate to the EDP Business with respect to any taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date shall be for the account of Purchaser, and Sellers shall pay over to Purchaser any such refund or the amount of any such credit within a reasonable time after receipt or entitlement thereto. 

   

 §6.17. _Assistance and Cooperation_.

   ##### 

  

  

all correspondence received from any Governmental or Regulatory Authority in
connection with any Tax audit or information request with respect to which
taxable periods for which any other party may have liability under Section
6.14. 

   

 §6.18. _Amended Returns_. Neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall file or cause to be filed any amended Return or claims for refund of the EDP Companies or with respect to the EDP Business relating to any period (or portion thereof) that ends on or prior to the Closing Date without the prior written consent of Sellers which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. None of Sellers, and none of their respective Affiliates shall, without the prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, file or cause to be filed any amended Return with respect to the EDP Companies or the EDP Business to the extent such filing, if accepted, might reasonably be expected to change materially and adversely the Tax liability of Purchaser for any taxable period. An amended Return or claim for Tax refund for any Overlap Period hereunder shall be filed, or caused to be filed, by the party responsible for filing the original Return for such taxable period hereunder, if either Sellers or Purchaser so requests, except that such filing shall not be done without the consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, of Sellers (if the request is made by Purchaser) or of Purchaser (if the request is made by Sellers). Any amended Return or claim for Tax refund with respect to the EDP Companies for any tax period that begins and ends after the Closing Date shall be filed, or caused to be filed, only by Purchaser. 

  

 §6.19. _Assignability_. (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that any attempted direct or indirect assignment or transfer of all or any portion of any Contract, work order, or Permit pursuant to any Transaction Document is ineffective for any reason, in order to provide Purchaser and the EDP Companies with the maximum permitted realization and value of any such Contract, work order, or Permit, Sellers agree that they will, at the request and under the direction of the relevant EDP Company, in the name of such Seller or otherwise as such EDP Company shall specify, take all reasonable actions and do or cause to be done all such things as shall in the reasonable opinion of Purchaser be necessary or proper (i) to assure that the material rights of Sellers under such Contracts, work orders, or Permits shall be preserved for the benefit of, or transferred or issued to, Purchaser and its Affiliates, (ii) to facilitate receipt of the consideration to be received by Sellers under such Contracts or, work orders, which consideration shall be held for the benefit of, and promptly delivered to, Purchaser, and (iii) to enforce all material rights of Sellers under such Contracts and work orders;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Sellers from any Losses arising from, or in connection with, such Contract, work order, or Permit except to the extent such Losses have resulted from actions taken or omitted due to any Sellers willful misconduct, gross negligence or knowing violation of Law. 

  

 (b) Purchaser acknowledges that certain consents to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Transaction Documents may be required from parties to Contracts (including the Material Contracts) and work orders entered into by Sellers or its Affiliates and that such consents have not been and may not be obtained. Purchaser agrees (i) that neither Sellers nor any of their respective Affiliates shall have any liability whatsoever arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any consents that may have been or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Transaction Documents, or because of the default under or acceleration or termination of any such Contract or work order as a 

    ##### 

  

     

result thereof and (ii) to assume any and all liabilities and obligations
under such Contracts and work orders (irrespective of whether or not any such
consents have been obtained). Purchaser further agrees that, notwithstanding
any provision to the contrary herein, no representation, warranty or covenant
of Sellers contained herein or the Transaction Documents shall be breached
or deemed breached as a result of (x) the failure to obtain any such consent,
or any default, acceleration or termination resulting from such failure, or
(y) any lawsuit, action, claim, proceeding or investigation commenced or
threatened by or on behalf of any Person arising out of or relating to the
failure to obtain any consent or any default, acceleration or termination

The limitations set forth in the immediately preceding sentence shall not apply to claims for indemnification for breaches of representations and warranties set forth in 

    ##### 

  

     

(i) Section 4.19(b) (Sufficiency of Assets) and Section 4.21 (The

connection with the Reorganization); _provided_ , that Sellers may cure any
breach thereof by delivering, transferring or assigning to Purchaser or the
Companies the tangible asset or Intellectual Property not delivered to
Purchaser or the Companies on or before the Closing Date, (ii) the Excluded
Seller Representations, (iii) the representations and warranties with respect
to Employee Benefits Plans (Section 4.14) (but only to the extent such
representations and warranties relate to liabilities arising under Title IV
of ERISA or any similar statute) and (iv) the Excluded Purchaser
Representations. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article VIII,
individual claims or series of related claims that are equal to or less than
$25,000 shall not be taken into consideration for purposes of
determining whether or not a Loss (including a Pre-Closing Customer Loss) has
occurred; _provided_ , that individual claims or series of related claims
that are equal to or less than $50,000 shall not be taken into consideration
for purposes of determining whether or not a Loss arising from the failure of
the representations and warranties contained in Section 4.10 (Compliance with
Laws; Permits) to be true and correct has occurred. 

   

 (e) Subject to the other limitations on Sellers obligations to indemnify in this Article VIII, Sellers shall only be under an obligation to indemnify pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(v) for the aggregate amount of 

    

 (i) the portion of a Pre-Closing Customer Loss that exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the lesser of (x) the then-applicable deductible under the Sellers EandO Insurance (as defined below) and (y) $2.5 million (such lesser amount, the " _Deemed Deductible_ ");  _provided_ , that Sellers obligation to indemnify pursuant to this clause (i) shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the Deemed Deductible; plus 

   

 (ii) one hundred percent (100%) of the portion of a Pre-Closing Customer Loss that is greater than the Deemed Deductible and equal to the positive difference, if any, between (x) the then-applicable deductible and (y) the Deemed Deductible; _provided_ , that if a Pre-Closing Customer Loss is not recoverable under the Sellers EandO Insurance, Sellers shall only be under an obligation to indemnify Purchaser for fifty percent (50%) of the portion of the Pre-Closing Customer Loss that is greater than the Deemed Deductible and equal to the positive difference, if any, between (x) the then-applicable deductible and (y) the Deemed Deductible; plus 

   

 (iii) the actual recovery, if any, by a Seller of such Pre-Closing Customer Loss under the Sellers EandO Insurance; plus 

   

 (iv) fifty percent (50%) of the portion of a Pre-Closing Customer Loss that (x) exceeds the then-applicable deductible and (y) is not recoverable under the Sellers EandO Insurance. 

  

For example, 

   

       | (A)  |   | if the Pre-Closing Customer Loss is $1.75 million
and the Deemed Deductible is $2.5 million, Sellers would be under an
obligation to indemnify Purchaser for $0.5 million;  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

   

       | (B)  |   | if the Pre-Closing Customer Loss is $3.0 million,
the Deemed Deductible is $2.5 million, the then-applicable deductible is $2.8
million and the Pre-Closing Customer Loss is not recoverable under the
Sellers EandO Insurance, Sellers would be under an obligation to indemnify
Purchaser for the aggregate of (i) $1.25 million ( _i.e._ , fifty percent
(50%) of the Deemed Deductible), (ii) $150,000 ( _i.e.,_ fifty percent (50%)
of the portion of the Pre-Closing Customer Loss that is greater than the
Deemed Deductible and equal to the positive difference between (x) the then-
applicable deductible and (y) the Deemed Deductible), and (iii) $100,000 (
_i.e._ , fifty percent (50%) of the portion of the Pre-Closing Customer Loss
that (x) exceeds the then-applicable deductible and (y) is not recoverable
under the Sellers EandO Insurance).  
---|---|---|--- 
      
     | (C)  |   | if the Pre-Closing Customer Loss is $4.5 million, the
Deemed Deductible is $2.5 million, the then-applicable deductible is $3.0
million and Sellers actually recover $1.5 million under the Sellers EandO
Insurance, Sellers would be under an obligation to indemnify Purchaser for
the aggregate of (i) $1.25 million ( _i.e._ , fifty percent (50%) of the
Deemed Deductible), (ii) $500,000 ( _i.e.,_ one hundred percent (100%) of
the portion of the Pre-Closing Customer Loss that is greater than the Deemed
Deductible and equal to the positive difference between (x) the then-
applicable deductible and (y) the Deemed Deductible) and (iii) $1.5 million (
_i.e._ , the actual recovery by Sellers under the Sellers EandO Insurance);
and  
      
     | (D)  |   | if the Pre-Closing Customer Loss is $8.0 million, the
Deemed Deductible is $2.5 million (and the then-applicable deductible is
equal to the Deemed Deductible) and Sellers actually recover $3.0 million
under the Sellers EandO Insurance, Sellers would be under an obligation to
indemnify Purchaser for the aggregate of (i) $1.25 million ( _i.e._ , fifty
percent (50%) of the Deemed Deductible), (ii) $3.0 million ( _i.e._ ,
the actual recovery by Sellers under the Sellers EandO Insurance) and (iii)
$1.25 million ( _i.e._ , fifty percent (50%) of the portion of the Pre-
Closing Customer Loss that exceeds the then-applicable Deductible and is not
recoverable under the Sellers EandO Insurance).  
   

  

During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on March 31, 2007,
Sellers shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
maintain errors and omissions claims-made insurance generally covering Pre-
Closing Customer Losses on terms and conditions substantially similar to the
terms and conditions set forth in _Section 8.2(e)_ of the Sellers
Disclosure Letter (the " _Sellers  EandO Insurance_") (other than deductible
amounts); _provided_ , that Sellers shall be under no obligation to add the
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates as an "additional insured" under the
Sellers EandO Insurance or otherwise provide the Purchaser or its Affiliates
any rights thereunder. In addition to the obligations set forth in Section
8.4(a), Purchaser shall promptly provide written notice to Sellers if
Purchaser or its Affiliates become aware that any EDP Business services
provided to customers of the EDP Business prior to the Closing Date were
negligently performed; _provided_ , that the failure to so notify the Sellers
shall not affect the Sellers indemnification obligation hereunder except as
and to the extent that such failure shall actually and adversely affect the
ability to recover under the Sellers EandO Insurance or otherwise affect the
defense of such claims. Sellers agree to promptly notify their
applicable insurance carrier or adjustor in the event that it receives
written notice (whether from Purchaser or 

    ##### 

  

     

otherwise) that any EDP Business services provided to customers of the EDP
Business prior to the Closing Date were negligently performed and agrees to
take all reasonable steps to insure that such insurance carrier or adjustor
reimburses Sellers for such Pre-Closing Customer Losses that Purchaser
reasonably believes are recoverable under the Sellers EandO Insurance. 

   

 (f) Each Seller shall jointly and severally indemnify Purchaser and its Affiliates and the EDP Companies and hold them harmless from and against any Losses attributable to: (i) all liability for Taxes (or non-payment thereof) of the EDP Companies for all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and the portion through the end of the Closing Date for any Overlap Period, (ii) all liability for any breach of Sellers representations and warranties contained in Section 4.11 (Taxes) (as such representations and warranties would read if all references to "material", "materially", "material adverse effect", "Material Adverse Effect" and "Knowledge of Sellers" were deleted therefrom) and Section 4.21 (The Reorganization; but only with respect to Transfer Taxes payable in connection with the Reorganization) and (iii) all liability for Taxes imposed on Quintiles Clinical pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state, local or foreign law or regulation. 

  

 §8.3 _Indemnification Procedure_. (a) Within a reasonable period of time after the incurrence of any Losses by any Person entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2 (an " _Indemnified Party_ "), including any claim by a third party described in Section 8.4, which would give rise to indemnification hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the party from which indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") a certificate which shall: 

  

 (i) state that the Indemnified Party has paid or properly accrued Losses for which such Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement; 

   

 (ii) specify in reasonable detail each individual item of Loss included in the amount so stated, the date such item was paid or properly accrued, the basis for any anticipated liability and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty, breach of covenant or claim to which each such item is related, if any, and the computation of the amount of Loss to which such Indemnified Party claims to be entitled hereunder; and 

   

 (iii) attach thereto all supporting documents, calculations, correspondence and all other documents related to each item of Loss set forth on the certificate. 

   

 (b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party shall object to the indemnification of an Indemnified Party in respect of any claim or claims specified in any certificate, the Indemnifying Party shall, within thirty (30) days after receipt by the Indemnifying Party of such certificate, deliver to the Indemnified Party a notice to such effect and the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall, within the thirty (30) day period beginning on the date of receipt by the Indemnified Party of such objection, attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims to which the Indemnifying Party shall have so objected. If the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall succeed in reaching agreement on their respective rights with respect to any of such claims, the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall promptly prepare and sign a memorandum setting forth such agreement. Should the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party be unable to agree as to any par- 

    ##### 

  

     

ticular item or items or amount or amounts, then the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party shall submit such dispute to a court of competent
jurisdiction set forth in Section 10.8. 

   

 (c) Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8.2(b) above, claims for Losses specified in any certificate to which an Indemnifying Party shall not object in writing within thirty (30) days of receipt of such certificate, claims for Losses covered by a memorandum of agreement of the nature described in Section 8.3(b), claims for Losses the validity and amount of which have been the subject of judicial determination as described in Section 8.3(b) and claims for Losses the validity and amount of which shall have been the subject of a final judicial determination, or shall have been settled with the consent of the Indemnifying Party, as described in Section 8.4, are hereinafter referred to, collectively, as " _Agreed Claims_ ". Within ten (10) days of the determination of the amount of any Agreed Claims, the Indemnifying Party shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Indemnified Party an amount equal to the Agreed Claim by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the bank account or accounts designated by the Indemnified Party in a notice to the Indemnifying Party not less than two (2) Business Days prior to such payment. 

   

 §8.4 _Third Party Claims_. (a) Except in the case of a claim pursuant to Section 8.2(f), which shall be governed by Section 8.4(b), if a claim by a third party is made or threatened against any Indemnified Party, and if such party intends to seek indemnity with respect thereto under this Article VIII, such Indemnified Party shall promptly cause written notice to the Indemnifying Party of such claims; _provided_ , that the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party of such claim shall not affect the Indemnifying Partys indemnification obligation hereunder except as and to the extent that such failure shall actually and adversely affect the defense of such claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice to assume the conduct and control, through counsel reasonably of its choosing and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party, of the settlement or defense thereof and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate fully with it in connection therewith. So long as the Indemnifying Party is reasonably contesting any such claim in good faith, the Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle any such claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to pay or settle any such claim; _provided_ , that in such event it shall waive any right to indemnity by the Indemnifying Party for such claim unless the Indemnifying Party shall have consented in writing to such payment or settlement. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after the receipt of the Indemnified Partys notice of a claim of indemnity hereunder that it elects to undertake the defense thereof, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to contest, settle or compromise the claim. The Indemnifying Party shall not, except with the consent of the Indemnified Party, enter into any settlement except if the Indemnifying Party acknowledges its obligations to indemnify the Indemnified Party for any Losses related to such Claim and such settlement does not include any acknowledgement of misconduct by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable respects in connection with the defense of any claim, including making available records relating to such claim and furnishing, without expense to the Indemnifying Party and/or its counsel, such employees of the Indemnified Party as may be reasonably necessary for the preparation of the defense of any such claim or for testimony as witnesses in any proceeding relating to such claim. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Purchaser shall promptly notify Sellers in writing of all notifications and other communications with any taxing authority relating to any Tax audit or other proceeding relating to the Tax liability of Sellers with respect to the EDP Business and the EDP Companies relating to a taxable year or period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date. The failure of Purchaser to give Sellers such written notice shall excuse Sellers from its obligations under Section 8.2(a) hereof with respect to any increased Tax liability directly attributable to any such notification or other communication if the failure to provide such written notice materially adversely affected the ability of Sellers to contest any claim arising from such Tax audit or other proceeding. Sellers and their duly appointed representatives shall have the exclusive authority to control any audit or examination by any taxing authority, initiate any claim for refund, amend any Return, and contest, resolve and defend against any assessment for additional Taxes, notice of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes of or relating to any liability of Sellers for all taxable periods and with respect to the EDP Business and the EDP Companies for all taxable years or periods (or portions thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Sellers nor their duly appointed representatives shall, without the prior written consent of Purchaser, enter into any settlement of any contest or otherwise compromise any issue that affects or may affect the Tax liability of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the EDP Companies) for any taxable year or period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, Purchaser shall have the exclusive authority to control any audit or examination by any taxing authority, initiate any claim for refund, amend any Return, and contest, resolve and defend against any assessment for additional Taxes, notice of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes of or relating to the EDP Business (including the EDP Companies) for all taxable periods after the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Purchaser nor its duly appointed representatives shall, without the prior written consent of Sellers, enter into any settlement of any contest or otherwise compromise any issue that affects or may affect the Tax liability of Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates (including the EDP Companies) for any taxable year or period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date. 

   

 §8.5 _Exclusive Remedy; Limitations_. (a) With the exception of any claims based on fraud, Sellers and Purchaser agree that the indemnification provisions contained in this Article VIII shall, after the Closing, be the exclusive remedy for any and all Losses suffered, incurred or paid with respect to any breach of the covenants, agreements, representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement and the Transaction Documents (other than the Master Independent Contractor Agreements or any additional remedies expressly set forth in the other Transaction Documents);  _provided_ , _however_ , that in addition to such indemnification, the parties may seek equitable remedies, including specific performance in accordance with applicable Laws. 

  

 (b) No party shall be entitled to recover under this Article VIII for any Losses to the extent such Losses arise out of changes after the Closing Date in applicable Law or GAAP, or interpretations thereof. 

   

 (c) If any Indemnified Party is indemnified for any Losses by a third party then the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to all rights and remedies of such Indemnified Party against such third party, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with and assist the Indemnifying Party in asserting all such rights and remedies against such parties. 

     ##### 

 

    

 (d) Each party shall take and cause its Affiliates to take all reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss (including seeking recovery from insurance or other collateral sources) upon becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto, including incurring costs only to the minimum extent necessary to remedy the breach which gives rise to the Loss. No party shall be entitled to recover under this Article VIII for any Losses to the extent such Losses are actually recovered by an Indemnified Party under any applicable insurance policies or other collateral sources. If there is a recovery by an Indemnified Party under any insurance policy or from any other collateral source subsequent to its indemnification by the Indemnifying Party, such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over the amount of such re covery to the Indemnifying Party (but no more than the amount of Losses for which the Indemnifying Party has indemnified the Indemnified Party). 

   

 (e) The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under Section 8.2(a) shall be reduced by the amount of any corresponding Current Liabilities or reserves set forth in the Closing Date Working Capital. 

   

 (f) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, THE OBLIGATION OF SELLERS TO INDEMNIFY PURSUANT TO SECTION 8.2(a)(v) SHALL BE PURCHASERS SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY PRE-CLOSING CUSTOMER LOSS. 

   

 §8.6 _Tax Benefit_. (a) If Sellers make any payment under Section 8.2(a) hereof and such payment gives rise to a Tax Benefit to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, then promptly following the filing of the Return (or Returns) reflecting such Tax Benefit, Purchaser shall pay to Sellers the amount of such Tax Benefit. The determination of any such Tax Benefit shall be made in good faith by Purchaser and, if requested by Sellers, shall be verified in writing by an independent certified public accounting firm selected by Purchaser and reasonably satisfactory to Sellers. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Tax Benefit_ " shall mean the sum of the amount by which the actual Tax liability of a corporation to the appropriate taxing authority is reduced (including, without limitation, by or as a result of a deduction, increase in basis, entitlement to refund, credit or otherwise, whether available in the current taxable year, as an adjustment to the taxable income in any other taxable year or as a carryforward or carryback, as applicable) plus any interest (on an after-Tax basis) from such government or jurisdiction relating to such Tax liability. 

  

 (b) Any indemnity payment made pursuant to this Agreement will be treated as an adjustment to Purchase Price for Tax purposes unless a determination (as defined in Code Section 1313) or similar event under Tax law with respect to the Indemnified Party causes any such payment not to constitute an adjustment to the Purchase Price for U.S. federal income Tax purposes or foreign Tax purposes, as the case may be. 

   

ARTICLE IX 

   

 _TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT_  

   

 §9.1. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated, and the transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned, at any time prior to the Closing:

 (c) by Sellers, if: (i) any of the representations and warranties of Purchaser contained in this Agreement shall fail to be true and correct, (ii) there has been a failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.3, (iii) there shall be a breach by Purchaser of any covenant or agreement of Purchaser in this Agreement that, in the case of clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above, (x) would result in the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.3(a) or 7.3(b) and (y) which is not curable or, if curable, is not cured upon the thirtieth (30th) day after written notice thereof is given by Sellers to Purchaser, or (iv) there has been a breach by Purchaser of its obligation to close notwithstanding that Purchasers conditions to Closing set forth in Article VII have been satisfied (or any intentional breach by Purchaser of any pre-Closing obligation that leads to a failure of any such condition to be satisfied); _provided_ , that Sellers may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(c) if Sellers are in material breach of this Agreement; or 

   

 (d) by Purchaser, if: (i) any of the representations and warranties of Sellers contained in this Agreement shall fail to be true and correct, (ii) there has been a failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2, (iii) there shall be a breach by Sellers of any covenant or agreement of Sellers in this Agreement that, in the case of clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above, (x) would result in the failure of a condition set forth in Sections 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) and (y) which is not curable or, if curable, is not cured upon the thirtieth (30th) day after written notice thereof is given by Purchaser to Sellers, or (iv) there has been a breach by Sellers of their respective obligations to close notwithstanding that Sellers conditions to Closing set forth in Article VII have been satisfied (or any intentional breach by Sellers of any pre-Closing obligation that results in a failure of any such condition to be satisfied); _provided_ , that Purchaser may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(d) if Purchaser is in material breach of this Agreement. 

   

 §9.2. _Effect of Termination_. (a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1 by either Purchaser, on the one hand, or Sellers, on the other hand, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other party or parties specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall become void and have no effect, and, subject to Section 9.2(b) there shall be no liability hereunder on the part of Purchaser or Sellers, except that Sections 6.2(b) and 6.2(e) (Access and Information), Section 6.4 

   ##### 

  

  

(Public Announcements), Section 9.1 (Termination), this Section 9.2 and
Article X shall survive any termination of this Agreement. Nothing in this
Section 9.2 shall relieve any party to this Agreement of liability for breach
of this Agreement. 

   

 (b) In the event of the termination of this Agreement at any time prior to the Closing by: 

   

 (i) Purchaser pursuant to Section 9.1(d)(iv), then Sellers shall pay to Purchaser, within three (3) Business Days following termination of this Agreement, a fee, by wire transfer in immediately available funds to an account specified by Purchaser, in the amount equal to $22,000,000, such amount representing Purchasers sole and exclusive remedy for any liabilities or damages arising out of any such breach of this Agreement; or 

   

 (ii) Sellers pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(iv), then Purchaser shall pay to Sellers within three (3) Business Days following termination of this Agreement, a fee, by wire transfer in immediately available funds, to an account specified by Sellers, in the amount equal to $22,000,000, such amount representing Sellers sole and exclusive remedy for any liabilities or damages arising out of any such breach of this Agreement. 

   

Each of Sellers and Purchaser agrees that the provisions contained in this
Section 9.2(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, that the damages resulting from termination of this Agreement set
forth in this Section 9.2(b) of this Agreement are uncertain and incapable of
accurate calculation and that the amounts payable pursuant to this Section
9.2(b) are reasonable forecasts of the actual damages which may be incurred
by Sellers and Purchaser under such circumstances. The amounts payable
pursuant to this Section 9.2(b) hereof constitute liquidated damages and not
a penalty and shall be the sole monetary remedy in the event of termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(iv) or Section 9.1(d)(iv). If
either party fails to pay the other party any amounts due under this Section
9.2(b), such party shall pay the costs and expenses (including reasonable
legal fees and expenses) of the other party in connection with any action,
including filing of any lawsuit or other legal action, taken to
collect payment. Any amounts not paid when due pursuant to this Section
9.2(b) shall bear interest from the date such payment is due until the date
paid at a rate equal to eight percent (8%).

Purchaser agrees not to, and agrees to cause its Affiliates and Subsidiaries (including the EDP Companies) not to, assert any Claim against the Seller Releasees.

 (b) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that: 

   

 (i) none of Sellers, the EDP Companies or any of their respective directors, officers, stockholders, employees, Affiliates, controlling Persons, agents, advisors or representatives makes or has made any oral or written representation or warranty, either express or implied (except the specific representations and warranties of Sellers set forth in Articles III and IV of this Agreement), as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the information (including set forth in management summaries relating to the EDP Business or the EDP Companies, in materials furnished in the EDP Business data room, in presentations by the EDP Business manage-

ment or otherwise) provided or made available to Purchaser or its directors,
