NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations,

agree as follows:

 

_ARTICLE I_ 
  
  _THE MERGER_

 

Section 1.1. _The  Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company, in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL, and
the separate corporate  existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The
Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving
Corporation_ ") and, following the  Merger, shall be a wholly owned, indirect
Subsidiary of Parent Holdco, and the separate corporate existence of the
Company, with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises,
shall continue unaffected by the Merger, except as set  forth in this
Agreement.

 

Section 1.2. _Closing_.     The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ")
shall take place: (a) at 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the fifth (5th)
Business Day following the satisfaction  or waiver (if permissible under
applicable Law) of all of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be  satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing),
at the offices of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver and Jacobson LLP, One New York
Plaza, New York, NY 10004 or (b) at such other date, time, or place  as
agreed to in writing by Parent Holdco and the Company. The date on which the
Closing actually occurs is referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_."

 

Section 1.3. _Effective    Time_. Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, on the Closing Date, the Company shall cause a certificate of merger
(the " _Certificate of Merger_ ")    to be duly executed and filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with Section 251 of
the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time when the Certificate
of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of  State of the State of
Delaware or at such later date and time as the parties shall agree in writing
and specify in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL (such
date and time, the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

_ARTICLE II_ 
  
  _EFFECTS OF THE MERGER_

 

Section 2.1. _Effects    of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects
specified in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

 

Section 2.2. _Certificate    of Incorporation_. Subject to _Section 5.10_,
at the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of the  Company or Merger Sub, the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Charter_ ") shall remain
the certificate of incorporation of the  Company as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended as provided therein or
by applicable Law.

 

Section 2.3. _Bylaws_.     Subject to _Section 5.10_, at the Effective
Time, as a result of the Merger and without any further action on the part of
the Company or Merger Sub, the bylaws  of the Surviving Corporation (the "
_Bylaws_ ") shall remain the bylaws of the Company as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter  amended as provided therein or
in the Charter or by applicable Law.

 


 

   

Section 2.4. _Directors_.     The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly
elected or appointed and qualified or until their  earlier death, resignation
or removal in accordance with the Charter and the Bylaws.

 

Section 2.5. _Officers_.     The officers of the Company immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the
officers of the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly
elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier  death, resignation
or removal in accordance with the Charter and the Bylaws.

 

Section 2.6. _Effect  on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any capital
stock of the Company, the Company, Parent Holdco, Parent or Merger Sub:

 

(a) _Merger  Consideration_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share (the " _Common Stock_ ," and each a " _Share_ " or collectively, the "
_Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective  Time
(other than Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall automatically be
converted into the right to receive $44 in cash (the " _Merger Consideration_
"),  without interest. As of the Effective Time, such Shares shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no longer be
outstanding, and each holder thereof shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive  the Merger Consideration,
without interest, upon surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares or
delivery of an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section
2.7_.

 

(b) _Cancellation of  Cancelled Shares_. Each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time held by (i) the Company in treasury or
by Parent Holdco, Parent or Merger Sub, or (ii) any wholly owned Subsidiary of
the Company or any  wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent Holdco (other than
Parent and Merger Sub) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered
or deliverable in exchange therefor  (collectively, " _Cancelled Shares_ ").

 

(c) _Conversion of  Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall automatically be converted into one fully paid and
nonassessable share  of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation and will constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 2.7. _Payment_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent;  Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
Holdco shall cause Parent to designate a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the
payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Article II_, and
in connection therewith,  shall enter into an agreement reasonably acceptable
to the Company relating to the Paying Agent's responsibilities with respect to
this Agreement. On or prior to the Effective Time, Parent Holdco shall deposit
or cause Parent to deposit with the  Paying Agent, in trust for the benefit
of the holders of Shares entitled thereto, a cash amount sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the
" _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose
except as set forth herein; _provided_ , that  the Paying Agent may invest
the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent; _provided_ , that such
investments shall be in short term obligations of, or  guaranteed in full by,
the United States of America with maturities no more than thirty (30) days and
no such investments shall relieve Parent Holdco or Parent from making the
payments required by this _Article II_. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be payable to Parent Holdco, Parent or
the Surviving Corporation and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable
under  this _Article II_ shall be promptly returned to the Surviving
Corporation. To the extent that there are any losses with respect to any such
investments such  that the Exchange Fund is insufficient to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration, Parent Holdco shall, or shall cause Parent to, promptly
cause to be replaced or restored an amount in cash to ensure the prompt
payment of the aggregate Merger  Consideration under this _Article II_. No
investment losses resulting from investment of the funds deposited with the
Paying Agent shall diminish the rights of  any holder of Shares entitled
thereto to receive the Merger Consideration as provided herein. Any portion of
the Exchange Fund made available to the Paying Agent in respect of any
Dissenting Shares will be returned to the Surviving Corporation;  provided,
however, that if any Dissenting Shares lose their status as such, Parent
Holdco shall, or shall cause Parent to, promptly deposit with the Paying Agent
an aggregate amount of funds sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration with
respect to  such Shares. 
 

 

 


 

   

 

(b) _Procedures for  Surrender_.

 

(i) _Common Stock  Certificates_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but in any event no later than three (3) Business Days  after
the date on which the Effective Time occurs), Parent Holdco shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each Record Holder of a certificate or certificates
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares
(each such  certificate, a " _Certificate_ "), which Shares were converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (without interest) pursuant
to _Section 2.6(a)_, (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary
form and with such other provisions as Parent and the Company shall reasonably
agree), and  which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section
2.7(e)_ to the Paying Agent), and (B) instructions for effecting the surrender
of Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section
2.7(e)_) to the Paying Agent in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration (without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes
required by applicable Law in accordance with _Section 2.7(g)_) therefor.

 

(ii) Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss
in lieu thereof as  provided in _Section 2.7(e)_) for cancellation, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the  instructions thereto, and such other customary documents
as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the applicable
Merger Consideration (without interest)  pursuant to the provisions of
_Section 2.6(a)_ in respect of each Share (after giving effect to any required
withholding taxes as provided in _Section 2.7(g)_) formerly represented by
such Certificate, and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in _Section 2.7(e))_ so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If
payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name a surrendered  Certificate is registered, it will be a
condition precedent of payment that the Certificate so surrendered be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting such payment has paid all transfer and other  similar Taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate and has established to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Taxes have been paid or
are  not required to be paid.

 


 

   

(iii) _Book-Entry  Shares_. Any holder of non-certificated Shares represented
by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and whose Shares were converted
pursuant to the  provisions of _Section 2.6(a)_ into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an
executed letter of  transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger
Consideration. In lieu thereof, each registered holder of one (1) or more
Book-Entry Shares shall automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to
receive, and Parent Holdco shall, or shall  cause Parent to, cause the Paying
Agent to pay and deliver as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article II_ in respect of each Share formerly represented by such Book-Entry
Share, and the Book-Entry Share so exchanged shall forthwith be cancelled.
Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to  Book-Entry Shares shall
only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are
registered.

 

(c) _Closing of  Transfer Books_. From and after the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation shall be closed and there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation  of the Shares that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Until surrendered as contemplated by _Section
2.7(b)_, each Certificate and  Book-Entry Share shall, from and after the
Effective Time, represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
without interest thereon, as contemplated by _Section 2.6(a)_  and will not
evidence any interest in, or any right to exercise the rights of a stockholder
or other equity holder of, the Company or the Surviving Corporation. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, such 
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for
transfer or any other reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration, subject to compliance with the exchange procedures
provided in this _Article II_. The right to receive the Merger Consideration
in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ upon surrender of any Shares
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Shares.

 

(d) _Termination of  Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed
to the Record Holders of Shares six (6) months after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to the Surviving  Corporation. Any Record Holder of Shares who
has not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only
to the Surviving Corporation,  Parent Holdco and Parent, which shall remain
responsible for payment of the Merger Consideration for such Shares as
provided in this _Article II_, without any  interest thereon and subject to
any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with
_Section 2.7(g)_. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share  has not been
surrendered immediately prior to the date on which the Merger Consideration in
respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity, any Merger Consideration in 
respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, immediately prior to such time become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
or their  successors, assigns or personal representatives previously entitled
thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, none of the
Surviving Corporation, Parent Holdco, Parent, Merger Sub, the Paying Agent or
any other Person shall be liable  to any Record Holder of Shares for any
amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

 


 

   

(e) _Lost, Stolen or  Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, and if reasonably required by
Parent Holdco or Parent, the  posting by such holder of a bond in a customary
and reasonable amount and upon such terms as may be reasonably required by
Parent Holdco or Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying  Agent with respect to
such Certificate, Parent Holdco will or shall cause Parent to, cause the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent to pay in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect
of  the Shares previously evidenced by such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, without any interest thereon and subject to any withholding of
Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with _Section 2.7(g)_.

 

(f) _Dissenting  Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares) and that are held by holders of
such Shares who have not  voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement or
consented thereto in writing and who are entitled to and have properly
exercised, and have not lost, or properly withdrawn their demand for,
appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with,  and who have
complied in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting
Shares_ ") will not be converted into the right to receive the Merger 
Consideration, and in lieu thereof, such Dissenting Shares will be converted
into the right to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares
in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262 of the DGCL unless and
until any such  holder fails to perfect or effectively waives, withdraws or
loses its rights to appraisal under the DGCL or a court of competent
jurisdiction determines that such holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, then, such  Dissenting Shares will be
deemed to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into, and to have
become exchangeable solely for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive
the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.6(a)_, without any interest
thereon, upon surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share formerly
representing such Shares. At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting 
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights
provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and as provided in the previous sentence.
The Company will give Parent Holdco and Parent (i) prompt notice of any
demands received by  the Company for appraisals of Shares, and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such notices and demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall not, without the prior written  consent of Parent, make any payment
with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to
do any of the foregoing.

 

(g) _Withholding_.     Each of Parent Holdco, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such Taxes as
it is required to deduct and withhold with  respect to the making of such
payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "),
or under any other applicable provision of Law. To the  extent that amounts
are so deducted and withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Entity, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such 
deduction and withholding was made. Without limiting the foregoing and for the
avoidance of doubt, the Company shall satisfy or cause to be satisfied, timely
and in full, all Tax withholdings required in respect of the vesting or
payment events in  respect of any Company Equity Award for which the required
Tax remittance is due prior to the Effective Time.

 


 

   

Section 2.8. _Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) Each option to acquire Shares (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ "),
whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action by Parent Holdco, Parent,  Merger Sub, the Company or the holder
of that Company Stock Option, shall, as of the Effective Time, be cancelled
and converted automatically into the right to receive an amount in cash
(without interest) equal to the product of (i) the excess, if  any, of the
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share of such Company Stock
Option, multiplied by (ii) the total number of Shares subject to such Company
Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to any
applicable Tax withholding. Any Company Stock  Option with an exercise price
per Share that is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be
canceled for no consideration as of the Effective Time.

 

(b) Each Company restricted share or restricted share unit award (each, a "
_Company RSA Award_ ") that is outstanding and subject solely to time- based
vesting requirements as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, including
any portion of a Company PS  Award for which the applicable performance
period has ended prior to the Effective Time but that then remains subject to
continued time-based vesting, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
by Parent Holdco, Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or  the holder of that
Company RSA Award, shall, as of the Effective Time, be cancelled and converted
automatically into the right to receive (a) in respect of each Share subject
to such Company RSA Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, an  amount
in cash (without interest) equal to the Merger Consideration and (b) the
amount, payable in cash (without interest), of all then unpaid dividends and
dividend equivalents that have accrued as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time with  respect to such Company RSA Award that would otherwise
become payable at the time of the Company RSA Award's vesting, in each case,
subject to any applicable Tax withholding.

 

(c) Each Company restricted share unit award that is outstanding and subject
to performance-based  vesting requirements as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, (each, a " _Company PS Award_ " and, together with the Company
Stock Options and Company RSA  Awards, the " _Company Equity Awards_ "), by
virtue of the Merger and without any action by Parent Holdco, Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or the holder of that  Company PS Award, shall, as of the
Effective Time, be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to
receive (i) an amount in cash (without interest) equal to the Merger
Consideration in respect of each Share subject to such Company PS Award 
immediately prior to the Effective Time assuming, for this purpose, that (x)
Company PS Awards granted in 2018 were achieved at 200% of target and (y)
Company PS Awards granted in 2019 were achieved at 150% of target; and (ii)
the amount, payable in  cash (without interest) of all then unpaid dividends
and dividend equivalents that have accrued as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time with respect to such Company PS Award that would otherwise
become payable at the time of the Company PS  Award's vesting, in each case
subject to any applicable Tax withholding.

 


 

   

(d) The Surviving Corporation shall pay the holders of Company Equity Awards
the cash payments  described in _Section 2.8(a)_, _Section 2.8(b)_ and
_Section 2.8(c)_ on or as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing
Date, but in any event within five (5) Business Days thereafter.

 

(e) As of the Effective Time, the Company's 2013 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan
and any other equity  or equity-based compensation plan maintained by the
Company will terminate and all rights thereunder, including in respect of
Company Stock Options, Company RSA Awards and Company PS Awards, will be
cancelled, in each case, without liability to the  Company, Parent Holdco,
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates or
Subsidiaries, other than the obligation to make the payments described in this
_Section 2.8_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board or any
authorized committee thereof shall adopt such resolutions as may reasonably be

or "Risk Factors" sections or any other disclosures contained therein to the
extent that such statements are cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in
nature but, for the purposes of clarification, including and  giving effect
to any factual or historical statements included in any such statements),

(b) set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by the  Company to Parent
Holdco and Parent concurrently with entering into this Agreement (the "
_Company Disclosure Schedule_ ") (it being acknowledged and agreed that 
disclosure of any item in any section or subsection of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, whether or not an explicit cross reference appears, shall be deemed
to qualify or apply to any other section or subsection to which the relevance
of such item is  reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure), the
Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent Holdco, Parent and Merger Sub
as follows:

 


 

   

Section 3.1. _Organization    and Power_. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (with
respect to jurisdictions that recognize that concept) under the Laws of its
respective jurisdiction of organization and  each has all requisite corporate
or similar power and authority to own, lease, license, and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as currently conducted,
except where the failure to be in good standing or to have such  corporate or
similar power and authority would not constitute a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed
to do business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that 
recognize that concept) as a foreign corporation (or other applicable entity)
in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its
properties or assets or conduct of its business requires such qualification or
licensing, except in  such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified
or licensed or to be in good standing would not constitute a Company Material
Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent true, complete and
correct copies of the certificate of  incorporation and bylaws or other
similar organization documents for each of the Company's Subsidiaries, in each
case as amended and in effect as of the date of this Agreement.

authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights. All of the outstanding shares of capital  stock or equity
interests of each Subsidiary of the Company are owned by the Company, directly
or indirectly, free and clear of all Liens, other than Permitted Liens.

 

Section 3.3. _Capitalization_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 80,000,000 shares
of Common Stock and  20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01
per share (the " _Company Preferred Stock_ "). At the close of business on
April 5, 2019 (the " _Capitalization Date_ "), (i) 21,952,777 Shares were
issued and outstanding (including 201,686 Shares subject to outstanding
Company RSA Awards), (ii) 307,792 Shares  subject to outstanding Company PS
Awards (which number would be 521,116 Shares if maximum performance levels
were achieved for any Company PS Awards that remain subject to performance-
based vesting), (iii) 588,533 Shares were held by the Company in  its
treasury, (iv) 428,383 Shares were reserved for issuance in respect of
outstanding Company Stock Options, (v) 1,382,101 Shares were available for

preemptive right, subscription right or any similar right under any 
provision of the DGCL, the organizational documents of the Company or any
Contract to which the Company is a party or otherwise bound.

 


 

   

(b) Except as set forth in this _Section 3.3_ and for changes since the
Capitalization Date resulting from the exercise, vesting or settlement of
Company Stock Options, Company RSA Awards and Company PS Awards outstanding as
of the close of business on  the Capitalization Date, in each case,
consistent with the terms of each such Company Equity Award, as of the close

issued, reserved for issuance, or outstanding  (i) shares of capital stock or
voting securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) securities
of the Company convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock or
voting securities of the Company, or bonds, debentures, notes  or other
indebtedness of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries having the right to
vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to
vote) on any matter on which the Company's stockholders may vote, (iii)
securities,  options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments, profits
interests, stock-based performance units, stock appreciation rights, phantom
stock agreements, arrangements or other rights or undertakings of any kind to
which the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of
them is bound obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue or
sell, or cause to be issued or sold, additional shares of capital stock or
other voting or equity securities or interests of the  Company or of any of
its Subsidiaries (or any security convertible or exercisable therefor) or

interest, stock-based performance unit, stock appreciation right, phantom
stock agreement, arrangement or other rights or undertaking and (iv) there are
no outstanding obligations of the Company to repurchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire any Company  capital stock. From the close of business on the
Capitalization Date through the date hereof, no options or other rights to
acquire Shares or other Company Equity Awards, or rights to acquire shares of
Company Preferred Stock have been granted, and  no shares of Company
Preferred Stock or Shares have been issued, except for Shares issued pursuant
to the exercise, settlement, or conversion of Company Equity Awards
outstanding as of the close of business on the Capitalization Date, in each
case,  consistent with the terms of each such Company Equity Award.

 

(c) All outstanding Company Equity Awards were granted under the Company's
2013 Omnibus Equity  Incentive Plan. Section 3.3(c) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth, as of the close of business on the Capitalization Date,
each outstanding Company Equity Award and, to the extent applicable, (i) the

price that is less than  the fair market value of a Share on the date that it
was granted. There is no agreement or arrangement (whether in writing or
otherwise) to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or with
respect to which the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries has or could expect
to have liability (contingent or otherwise), in each case, that contains a
promise or commitment to grant a stock option or other equity or equity-based
award that has not been satisfied or that need not be satisfied  for failure
to satisfy a condition to promise or commitment.

each such Company Equity Award. All outstanding Shares are, and all such
Shares that may be issued prior to the Effective Time will be  when issued,
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject
to preemptive rights.

involves management or other employees who have a  significant role in the
Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Adverse Effect, and (ii), except in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Company  and its Subsidiaries have

Parent pursuant to _Sections 5.1(b)(i)_ , _(ii)_ , _(iii)_ , _(iv)_ , _(v)_ ,
_(ix)_ , _(x)_ , _(xi)_ , _(xiii)_ , _(xv)_ , or _(xvii)_.

Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the  circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. The Proxy Statement will comply in all material respects with
the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the  Company makes no

Subsidiaries has waived any statute of limitations with respect to Taxes or
agreed to any extension of time with respect to any Tax assessment,
deficiency, which waiver or extension currently remains in effect.

 

(j) No Tax rulings, requests for rulings, applications for change in
accounting methods or closing  agreements have been entered into with, issued
by, or filed with any Governmental Entity with respect to the Company or any

  _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT HOLDCO, PARENT AND MERGER SUB_

 

Except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by Parent Holdco and
Parent to the Company  concurrently with entering into this Agreement (the "
_Parent Disclosure Schedule_ ") (it being acknowledged and agreed that
disclosure of any item in any section  or subsection of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, whether or not an explicit cross reference appears, shall be deemed
qualify or apply to any other section or subsection to which the relevance of
such item is reasonably apparent on the face of such  disclosure that such
disclosure also qualifies or applies to such other sections or subsections),
Parent Holdco, Parent and Merger Sub, jointly and severally hereby represent
and warrant to the Company as follows:

 

Section 4.1. _Organization_. Parent Holdco is a German stock corporation,
Parent is an Illinois corporation and Merger Sub is a Delaware corporation, in
each case, duly organized, validly existing and in good standing  (with
respect to jurisdictions that recognize that concept) under the Laws of its
respective jurisdiction of organization and each has all requisite corporate
or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and to  carry on its business as currently conducted, except where the
failure to be in good standing or to have such corporate or similar power and
authority would not constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each of
Parent Holdco, Parent and Merger  Sub is duly qualified or licensed to do
business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize
that concept) as a foreign corporation (or other applicable entity) in each
jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation  of its properties or
assets or conduct of its business requires such qualification or licensing,
except in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed
or to be in good standing would not constitute a Parent Material Adverse 
Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Parent Material Adverse Effect_ "
means any fact, circumstance, change, event, occurrence or effect that, 
individually or in the aggregate, has, or would reasonably be expected to
have, a material adverse effect on Parent Holdco's, Parent's or Merger Sub's
ability to timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger. Parent  Holdco and Parent have made available to the Company

of Parent Holdco, Parent and Merger Sub, in each case as amended and in effect
as of the date of this Agreement.

 

Section 4.2. _Merger  Sub_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists solely of 100 shares
of common stock, par  value $0.01 per share, all of which are validly issued
and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub
is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent free and clear of all
Liens.

 

(b) Merger Sub has been formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
transactions contemplated  by this Agreement, including the Merger, and has

or obligations other than in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby and activities incidental to its  formation.

Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary actions on the part of each

Agreement by Parent, as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub (which such
adoption shall occur promptly following the execution of this Agreement) and
the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the
State of  Delaware, and no other actions on the part of Parent Holdco, Parent
or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize the consummation of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and  delivered by each of Parent Holdco, Parent and Merger
Sub and (assuming the due and valid authorization, execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the Company) constitutes a valid and binding obligation of
each of Parent Holdco, Parent and Merger  Sub, enforceable against each of
them in accordance with its terms, except as limited by the Enforceability
Exceptions.

by this Agreement, including the Merger.

(a) Except as may be required under, and other applicable requirements of, the
HSR Act and the  DGCL, neither the execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement by Parent Holdco, Parent and Merger Sub nor the consummation by
Parent Holdco, Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby
will require Parent Holdco, Parent or  Merger Sub to make any notice to, or
filing with, or obtain any permit, authorization, consent or approval of, any
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction, with such exceptions as would
not constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in
_Section 3.5_, neither the execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement by Parent Holdco, Parent or Merger Sub nor the consummation by

a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 


 

   

Section 4.5. _Information    Supplied_. None of the information supplied or

time the Proxy Statement is first  mailed to the Company's stockholders or at
the time of the Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein

representation or warranty with respect to statements made or incorporated by
reference in  the Proxy Statement based on information supplied by or on
behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

 

Section 4.6. _Litigation_.     (a) As of the date hereof, there is no

transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or
on behalf of Parent Holdco, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates.

or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage in and otherwise  participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding an Acquisition Proposal or that would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) cooperate
with, assist, participate in or facilitate any such inquiries, proposals, 
offers, discussions or negotiations or any effort or attempt to make any
Acquisition Proposal, including by granting a waiver, amendment or release
under any pre-existing confidentiality, "standstill" or similar provision, and
(iv) provide non-public  information to any Person relating to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries with respect to an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ ,  that the Company shall
promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) make available to
Parent Holdco, Parent and Merger Sub any material non-public information
concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that is provided to any such
Person  or group of Persons which was not previously made available to Parent
Holdco, Parent or Merger Sub. The Company shall promptly notify Parent Holdco
and Parent in writing of the identity of each Person or group of Persons (a "
_Go-Shop Party_ ") from whom the Company received a written Acquisition
Proposal after the execution of this Agreement and prior to the No-Shop Period
Start Date (a " _Go-Shop Acquisition Proposal_ "), which the Company Board has
determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor of
nationally recognized  reputation and outside legal counsel) that such Go-
Shop Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead
to, a Superior Proposal, and the material terms and conditions of such Go-Shop
Acquisition Proposal.

 


 

   

(b) Except as permitted by this _Section 5.2(b)_ and _Section 5.2(c)_, from
and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall not, and shall
cause its  Subsidiaries not to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause its Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i) initiate, solicit
or knowingly encourage any inquiries with respect to or the making of any
proposal or offer that constitutes  or would reasonably be expected to lead
to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue, engage in or otherwise
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or knowingly
cooperate in any way with or knowingly facilitate, an  Acquisition Proposal
or a proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal (other than, in response to an  unsolicited inquiry, to
refer the inquiring Person to this _Section 5.2_), (iii) provide any non-
public information to any Person relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or a proposal or offer
that would reasonably be expected to  result in an Acquisition Proposal, (iv)
enter into any letter of intent, term sheet, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, option agreement, merger
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or  other agreement
(other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "), (v) 
waive, terminate, modify, fail to enforce or release any Person (other than
Parent Holdco, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates) under any
"standstill" or similar agreement or obligation, or exempt any person (other
than Parent Holdco,  Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates) from
the restrictions of Article 13 of the Company's certificate of incorporation
or similar provisions of any Takeover Statute or (vi) propose, resolve or
agree to do any of the foregoing. Except  as permitted by _Section 5.2(c)_ ,
following the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries and instruct its Representatives  to, immediately terminate
and cease all discussions and negotiations with any Person or group or its
Representatives, including discussions and negotiations with Go-Shop Parties
that were permitted pursuant to _Section 5.2(a)_ , that would be prohibited by
this _Section 5.2(b_ ); _provided_ , _that_ notwithstanding the foregoing
provision of this _Section 5.2(b)_ to the contrary (but subject to the
remaining provisions of this _Section 5.2(b)_ ),    the Company may
continue the actions permitted pursuant to _Section 5.2(a_ ), subject to the
requirements of _Section 5.2(f)_ , with any Go-Shop Party until the earlier of
(x) the time that such Go-Shop Party fails to constitute an Excluded Party and
(y) 11:59 p.m. (New York time) on the day that is fifteen (15) days  after
the No-Shop Period Start Date (the earlier to occur of clauses (x) and (y)
with respect to any Go-Shop Party or Excluded Party, the " _Cut-off Time_ ").
  Following the No-Shop Period Start Date (other than in respect of any
Excluded Party), or in respect of any Excluded Party, following the Cut-off
Time, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and shall instruct
its Representatives to,  immediately (A) cease providing any further non-
public information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries or any
Acquisition Proposal to any such Person or its Representatives and the Company
shall request the prompt return or destruction  of all non-public information
concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries theretofore furnished to any such
Person (or such Person's Representatives) with whom a confidentiality
agreement was entered into at any time within the twelve (12) month  period
immediately preceding the date hereof and (B) terminate all access granted to
any such Person and its Representatives to any physical or electronic data.
For the avoidance of doubt, following the No-Shop Period Start Date (other
than in  respect of any Excluded Party), or in respect of any Excluded Party,
following the Cut-off Time, the Company shall cease to engage in the
activities described in _Section  5.2(a)_. Without limiting the foregoing, it
is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in _Section 5.2_ by
any Representative of  the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed
to be a breach of _Section 5.2_ by the Company.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.2(b)_ and
without limiting _Section 5.2(a)_, but subject to the requirements of _Section
5.2(f)_ , at any time following the date hereof and prior to the time the
Stockholder Approval is obtained, if the Company receives a bona fide
written  Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach or deemed
breach of this _Section 5.2_, the Company and its Representatives may (i)
provide information  with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to such
Person or group of Persons (including their respective Representatives and
prospective equity and debt financing sources) if the Company receives from
such Person or group of Persons (or has  received from such Person or group
of Persons) an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , that the
Company shall make available to Parent Holdco,  Parent and Merger Sub any
material non‑public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries
that is provided to any such Person or group of Persons which was not
previously made available to Parent Holdco, Parent or Merger Sub prior to or
at  the same time as it is provided to such Person or group, and (ii) engage
or participate in any discussions or negotiations with such Person or group of
Persons (including their respective Representatives and prospective equity and
debt financing  sources) if, prior to taking any action described in _clause
(i)_ or _(ii)_   above, the Company Board determines in good faith after
consultation with its financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation
and outside legal counsel that (x) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or
would reasonably be expected to lead to,  a Superior Proposal and (y) that
the failure to take the actions specified in _clauses (i)_ and/or _(ii)_ of
this sentence with respect to such Acquisition Proposal would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. It is understood and agreed
that any contacts, disclosures, discussions or  negotiations made in
compliance with this _Section 5.2(c)_ shall not, in and of themselves,
constitute a Change of Recommendation or otherwise constitute a  basis for
Parent Holdco, Parent or Merger Sub to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.4_.

 


 

   

(d) Except as set forth in this _Section 5.2(d)_ or in _Section 5.2(e)_ , the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) shall not (i) (A) withhold, withdraw,
qualify  or modify (or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend
or modify), in each case in a manner adverse to Parent Holdco, Parent or
Merger Sub, the Company Recommendation, (B) (1) (x) adopt or approve or (y)
endorse or recommend or (2)  propose publicly to adopt, endorse, approve or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, (C) following the date on which any
Acquisition Proposal or any material modification thereto is first made public
or sent or given to the stockholders of the  Company, fail to issue a press
release publicly reaffirming the Company Recommendation within five (5)
Business Days after a request by Parent Holdco or Parent to do so (or, if
earlier, by the second (2nd) Business Day prior to the  Termination Date),
(D) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, or (E)
publicly adopt, approve or recommend, or submit to the Company's stockholders
for approval or adoption, or publicly propose to adopt, approve or 
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any of the foregoing, a " _Change of
Recommendation_ ") or (ii) approve, authorize, cause or permit the Company or
its  Subsidiaries to enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement, or
publicly propose to take any such action. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior
to the time the Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company Board may (x)
effect a Change of  Recommendation under _clause (i)(A)_ or _clause (i)(D)_
of the  definition thereof in response to an Intervening Event, or (y) if the
Company receives an Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of
this _Section 5.2_  that the Company Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation
and outside legal counsel, constitutes a Superior Proposal, effect a Change of
Recommendation under _clauses (i)(A)_ , _(C)_ or _(D)_ of the definition
thereof (or, solely to the extent effected privately by the Company Board in
connection with an action by the Company Board taken in connection with a
Change or Recommendation  effected under _clauses (i)(A)_ , _(C)_ or _(D)_ ,
under _clause (B)(1)(y)_ of the definition thereof) and/or terminate this
Agreement  pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_ in order to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement providing for such Superior Proposal, and, in the case
of either _clause (x)_ or _(y)_ of this sentence:

 

(i) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with its financial  advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside
legal counsel, that failure to make a Change of Recommendation would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under
applicable Law (any such determination, a " _Withdrawal Determination_ ");

 

(ii) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent Holdco and
Parent (a " _Triggering Notice_ "), at least four (4) Business Days in
advance, that it will effect a Change of Recommendation and/or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_, which notice shall specify the basis
for the Change of Recommendation and/or termination and, in the case of a
Superior Proposal, the identity of  the Person or group of Persons making
such Superior Proposal, and the material terms thereof (it being understood
and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any other material
term or condition of such Superior Proposal shall require a  new Triggering
Notice and a new two (2) Business Day period) and provide Parent Holdco and
Parent with a copy of the documents required by clause (ii) of _Section
5.2(f),_  to the extent not previously provided (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, any agreements to be entered into in connection with the Superior
Proposal) or describe the Intervening Event in writing in reasonable detail,
as the case may be;

 


 

   

(iii) after providing the Triggering Notice and prior to effecting such Change
of Recommendation  and/or terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.3(a)_, the Company shall have caused its Representatives to negotiate with
Parent Holdco, Parent and  Merger Sub in good faith to permit Parent Holdco,
Parent and Merger Sub (to the extent Parent Holdco, Parent and Merger Sub
desire to negotiate) during such four (4) Business Day period to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this  Agreement as would obviate
the need for the Company to effect a Change of Recommendation and/or terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_;

 

(iv) at the end of such four (4) Business Day period, and after taking into
account any proposals  (including any proposal to amend the terms of or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) committed to in writing by Parent
Holdco, Parent and Merger Sub since receipt of the Triggering Notice (the "
_Parent Proposal_ "), the Company Board has again made a Withdrawal
Determination in response to such Superior Proposal or such Intervening Event
(it being understood and agreed that if, in light of the  Parent Proposal,
the Company Board is no longer able to make a Withdrawal Determination with
respect to such Superior Proposal or Intervening Event, then the Company,
Parent Holdco, Parent and Merger Sub shall immediately enter into an amendment
to  this Agreement that incorporates the terms of such Parent Proposal); and

 

(v) the Company is in compliance in all material respects with _Section 5.2_.

 

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.2_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall be deemed to prohibit the Company or the Company Board or any committee
thereof from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under applicable
Law or the NYSE, including  taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d‑9 or Rule 14e‑2(a) or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to
stockholders); _provided_ , that if such disclosure is a Change of
Recommendation the Company shall comply with this _Section 5.2_ ;  or (ii)
making any "stop‑look‑and‑listen" communication to stockholders of the Company
pursuant to Rule 14d‑9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communications to stockholders of the Company); _provided_ , that if such
disclosure is a Change of Recommendation, the Company shall comply with this
_Section 5.2_.

 


 

 


 

   

(f) The Company shall promptly (but in no event more than twenty-four (24)
hours after receipt  thereof) notify Parent Holdco and Parent in writing of
any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry that would reasonably be expected to
result in an Acquisition Proposal, the identity of the Person making any such
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and the  material terms of any such
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. The Company shall (i) keep Parent reasonably
informed on a reasonably current basis of the status including any change to
the material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and  (ii)
provide to Parent Holdco and Parent as soon as practicable after receipt by
the Company thereof with un-redacted copies of all offers, proposals, drafts
and final versions (and any amendments thereto) of agreements and financing
documents,  including, in each case, schedules, exhibits and side letters
thereto and any other documents or agreements referred to in or to be entered
into in connection therewith, and material written correspondence, from any
third party in connection with any  Acquisition Proposal.

 

Section 5.3. _Proxy  Statement_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof (and in any
event, within twenty  (20) Business Days after the date hereof), the Company
shall prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement relating to
the Stockholders Meeting (together with any amendments thereof or supplements
thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ "), and each of the Company and Parent Holdco
shall, or shall cause their respective Affiliates to, prepare and file with
the SEC all other documents required by the  Exchange Act in connection with
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and Parent Holdco
and the Company shall cooperate with each other in connection with the
preparation of the Proxy Statement and any such other filings.   Subject to
_Section 5.2_, the Proxy Statement shall include the Company Recommendation;
_provided_ , that if the Company Board shall have effected a Change of
Recommendation in accordance with _Section 5.2_, then in submitting  this
Agreement to the Company's stockholders, the Company Board may submit this
Agreement to the Company's stockholders without the Company Recommendation, in
which event the Company Board may communicate the basis for its lack of
recommendation to  the Company's stockholders in the Proxy Statement or an
appropriate amendment thereof or supplement thereto. Notwithstanding any
Change of Recommendation, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated,
the Company shall be nonetheless required to  hold the Stockholders Meeting
and submit this Agreement to the Company's stockholders thereat. Parent Holdco
and the Company agree to provide or cause to be provided all information with
respect to itself, its Affiliates and their respective  Representatives as
may be reasonably requested by the other party for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement and any such other filings. The Company shall include in the Proxy
Statement (i) the Fairness Opinion, in its entirety, together with a summary 
thereof, and (ii) the information required by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL
such that the Proxy Statement constitutes a notice of appraisal rights under
Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts
to cause the Proxy  Statement when filed to comply as to form, in all
material respects, with the provisions of the Exchange Act, the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder and the rules of the NYSE.

 


 

   

(b) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy
Statement cleared by the  SEC as promptly as practicable after such filing.
Each party shall as promptly as reasonably practicable notify the other
parties of the receipt of any comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy
Statement and of any request by the SEC for any  amendment or supplement
thereto or for additional information and shall as promptly as reasonably
practicable provide to the other party copies of all material written
correspondence with the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company
and  Parent Holdco shall each use its reasonable best efforts to promptly
provide responses to the SEC with respect to all comments received on the
Proxy Statement from the SEC and to make any amendments or filings as may be
necessary in connection  therewith. The Company shall cause the definitive
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company's stockholders as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the tenth (10th) calendar day after the filing of
the preliminary Proxy Statement, or  if the SEC Staff advises that it has
comments thereon, on the date on which the SEC staff advises that it has no
further comments thereon.

 

(c) Subject to applicable Law, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement
or filing any other  required filings (or, in each case, any amendment
thereof or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with
respect thereto, the Company shall (unless and until a Change of
Recommendation has occurred) provide Parent Holdco and  Parent with an
opportunity to review and comment on such document or response and shall
consider in good faith including in such document or response comments
reasonably proposed by Parent Holdco and Parent.

 

(d) If prior to the Effective Time, any event occurs with respect to the
Company or any of its  Subsidiaries on the one hand, or Parent Holdco or any
of its Subsidiaries, including Parent or the Merger Sub, on the other hand, or
any change occurs with respect to other information supplied by any of the
foregoing parties for inclusion in the  Proxy Statement, which is required to
be described in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement, such
applicable party shall promptly notify the other party of such event, and such
applicable party shall cooperate in the prompt filing  with the SEC of any
necessary amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement and, as required by
Law, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment or
supplement to the Company's stockholders.

 

Section 5.4. _Stockholders Meeting_. Within three  (3) Business Days after
the date hereof, the Company shall make the inquiry (e.g., the "broker
search") required by Rule 14a-13(a)(1) under the Exchange Act. As soon as
practicable following completion of the "broker search" required by the 
immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall establish a record date for
a Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall not change the record date or
adjourn the Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent
(such consent not to  be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);
_provided_ , _however_ ,  that if at any time the current record date for the
Stockholders Meeting is not reasonably likely to satisfy the requirements of
applicable Law, the certificate of organization or bylaws of the Company, the
Company shall, in consultation with Parent  Holdco, set a new record date.
Unless there has been a Change of Recommendation, the Company shall, through
the Company Board, recommend to its stockholders that they give the
Stockholder Approval. Unless there has been a Change of Recommendation,  the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to, following clearance of the
Proxy Statement, (i) solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of
adopting this Agreement and (ii) secure the Stockholder Approval. Subject to
Section 5.2, the  Company shall take, in accordance with applicable Law and
its certificate of incorporation and bylaws, all reasonable action necessary
to duly call, convene and hold a meeting of holders of Shares (the "
_Stockholders Meeting_ ") as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
mailing of the Proxy Statement (not sooner than twenty (20) Business Days and
in any event within thirty-five (35) days  following such mailing) to
consider and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement; _provided_ , that the
Company may postpone or adjourn to a later date the  Stockholders Meeting (i)
with the consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), (ii) to allow time for the filing and dissemination
of any supplemental or amended disclosure document that the Company  Board
has determined, after consultation with outside legal counsel, in good faith
is required to be filed and disseminated under applicable Law, (iii) if there
are insufficient Shares represented (either in Person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum  necessary to conduct the business of the Stockholders
Meeting, (iv) if the Company has not received proxies representing a
sufficient number of shares of Common Stock to adopt this Agreement, (v) if
required by applicable Law, or (vi) if, in the good  faith judgment of the
Company Board (after consultation with outside legal counsel), the failure to
do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
obligations under applicable Law; _provided_ , that any such postponement or
adjournment shall not, in the aggregate, exceed twenty (20) days, except as
required by applicable Law or by the Company's certificate of incorporation
or  bylaws. Without the prior written consent of Parent, the adoption of this
Agreement and the approval of the Merger shall be the only matter (other than
(x) procedural matters and (y) an advisory vote with respect to golden
parachute compensation  arrangements in accordance with applicable federal
securities laws) which the Company shall propose to be acted on at the
Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall, upon the request of Parent, advise
Parent at least on a daily basis on each of the  last five (5) Business Days
prior to the scheduled date of the Stockholders Meeting as to the aggregate
tally of affirmative proxies received by the Company.

 


 

 


 

   


 

 

Section 5.5. _Reasonable    Best Efforts; Filings; Other Actions_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the
Company, Parent Holdco,  Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable
best efforts to promptly take, or to cause to be taken, any and all actions,
and to do, or to cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
in doing and, in the case of Parent Holdco, to  cause Parent, Merger Sub and
their respective Subsidiaries to cooperate as necessary or appropriate with
the other parties and to do, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
this Agreement or applicable Law or otherwise to consummate and make 
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as
practicable, including to (i) use their respective reasonable best efforts to
obtain from any Governmental Entities and any third parties any actions, non-
actions, clearances,  waivers, consents, approvals, expirations or
terminations of waiting periods, permits or orders required to be obtained by
the Company, Parent Holdco, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
Subsidiaries in connection with the authorization,  execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, (ii) make all registrations, filings, notifications or
submissions which are necessary or advisable with respect to this Agreement
and  the Merger under (A) any applicable federal or state securities Law, (B)
the HSR Act, and (C) any other applicable Law, (iii) defend against any
lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or  the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, and (iv) execute and deliver any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided_ , that in no event shall Parent Holdco, Parent, the Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries be required to pay prior to the Effective
Time any fee, penalty or other consideration to any third  party to obtain
any consent or approval required for the consummation of the Merger under any
Contract.

 


 

   

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the other provisions of this
_Section 5.5_, Parent Holdco, Parent and the Company each agrees to make, or
cause to be made, an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with  respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as promptly as practicable (and in any event within ten (10)
Business Days) after the date hereof (unless a later date is mutually agreed
between the parties hereto), and each party hereto  agrees to supply, or
cause to be supplied, as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional
information and material that may be requested by a Governmental Entity
pursuant to any Regulatory Law, and to take all other actions necessary to
cause  the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods,
consents or approvals under the HSR Act as promptly as possible after the date
of this Agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the
parties hereto shall  request and use reasonable best efforts to obtain early
termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, and no party shall agree
to extend any waiting period under any Regulatory Law applicable to or commit
not to consummate any of the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement
without the prior written consent of all other parties. Subject to this
_Section 5.5_ , in the event that the  parties receive any request for
additional information and documentary material pursuant to the HSR Act, the
parties will use their respective reasonable best efforts to submit an
appropriate response to, and certify compliance with, such request as 
promptly as practicable.

 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the other provisions of this
_Section 5.5_, and except as otherwise set forth in more specificity below,
the Company, Parent Holdco, Parent and Merger Sub shall each, and the Company
and Parent Holdco shall cause  each of their respective Subsidiaries to, use
reasonable best efforts to take any and all actions necessary to resolve such
objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby under any Regulatory Law, subject  to the limitations set
forth herein. If any Action, including any Action by a private party, is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the transactions
contemplated hereby as violative of any Regulatory Law, the Company, Parent 
Holdco, Parent and Merger Sub shall each cooperate, and the Company and Parent
Holdco shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to cooperate, in all
respects and use its respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist
any such Action  and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is in effect and that
restricts, prevents or prohibits consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including by pursuing all  reasonable avenues of administrative and
judicial appeal, but shall not be required to agree to any Action, Order or
settlement that would be a Significant Limitation. In addition, Parent Holdco,
Parent and the Company shall defend through  litigation on the merits any
claim asserted in court or before a Governmental Entity by any party in order
to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any Order (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent the Closing, in  each
case, prior to the Termination Date; _provided_ , that such litigation shall
in no way limit the obligations of Parent Holdco, Parent, Merger Sub or the 
Company to use their reasonable best efforts to, and to take any and all steps
necessary to, eliminate each and every impediment under any Regulatory Law to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as possible and in
any event  prior to the Termination Date. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto shall use reasonable best
efforts to propose, negotiate, commit to and effect, by agreement, consent
decree or otherwise, behavioral limitations,  conduct restrictions or conduct
commitments, including the creation, change, modification or termination of
business relationships, contractual rights, course of conduct or related
conduct obligations or the business relationships with customers  and/or
suppliers, including any behavioral or conduct action that limits the freedom
of action (collectively, " _Conduct Remedies_ "; and, for the avoidance of 
doubt, the term "Conduct Remedies" excludes any Divestiture Action) with
respect to any assets, properties, businesses, services, products, operations
or product lines of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case as
may be required in  order to (x) obtain approvals from any Governmental
Entities or expiration or termination of waiting periods under any applicable
Regulatory Law and (y) avoid the entry of, or the commencement of litigation
seeking the entry of, or to effect the  dissolution of, any Order which would
otherwise have the effect of preventing the Closing, materially delaying the
Closing or delaying the Closing beyond the Termination Date. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event  shall the Parent
Holdco or its Subsidiaries or the Company or its Subsidiaries: (A) be
obligated to agree to any Conduct Remedies with respect to the businesses of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, if the effect of such Conduct Remedies would
or  would reasonably be expected to be material and adverse, on the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (a " _Significant Limitation_ "); (B)
be obligated  (i) to agree to Conduct Remedies with respect to any of the
assets, properties, businesses, services, products, operations or product
lines of any member of the Parent Group, or (ii) to propose, negotiate, commit
to, effect or agree to, by consent  decree, hold separate order or otherwise,
any Divestiture Action, with respect to any member of any of the Parent Group
or the Company Group; or (C) be required to take or commit to take any such
action, or agree to any such condition or restriction  unless such action,
commitment, agreement, condition or restriction is conditioned upon the
consummation of the Merger and binding on the Company or Parent, Parent Holdco
and Merger Sub only if and when the Closing occurs.

 


 

   

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of this _Section 5.5_, each of the
Company, its Subsidiaries, Parent Holdco, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i)
cooperate in all respects and consult with each other in connection with any
filing or submission and in  connection with any investigation or other
inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party, including by
allowing the other parties to have a reasonable opportunity to review in
advance and comment on drafts of filings and submissions  and reasonably
considering in good faith the comments of the other parties; (ii) subject to
any restrictions under any Regulatory Law, promptly notify each other of any
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, any 
Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement and promptly provide copies
to the other party of any such written communications, and of any material
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private
party, in each  case regarding the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (iii) discuss with and permit the other party (and its counsel) to
review in advance, and consider in good faith the other party's reasonable
comments in connection with, any proposed  communication that it gives to any
Governmental Entity or other Person; (iv) unless required by applicable Law,
not agree to participate in any meeting, telephone call, or conference with
any Governmental Entity in respect of any filing,  investigation or other
inquiry with respect to this Agreement and the transactions and other
agreements contemplated hereby unless it consults with the other parties in

(f) The parties shall cooperate to submit a draft joint voluntary notice to
CFIUS with respect to  the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "
_Draft CFIUS Filing_ ") as soon as practicable after the date of this
Agreement (and in any event the  parties will use reasonable best efforts to
make such filing within fifteen (15) Business Days after the date hereof or as
promptly as practicable thereafter, and subject to the Company providing all
required information for such filing). After  receipt of confirmation that
CFIUS has no further comments or inquiries related to the Draft CFIUS Filing,
the parties shall promptly submit a formal joint voluntary notice to CFIUS
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the  "
_CFIUS Filing_ "). The parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to

required by  CFIUS or any CFIUS member agency, with any request for
additional information, documents or other materials, and will use their best
efforts to cooperate with each other in connection with both the Draft CFIUS
Filing and the CFIUS Filing and in  connection with resolving any

parties shall each use their best efforts to promptly inform the other party
of any oral communication with, and provide copies of written  communications
with, CFIUS or any CFIUS member agency regarding any such filings; _provided_
, that no party shall be required to share communications containing  its
confidential business information if such confidential information is
unrelated to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties
shall undertake reasonable best efforts to promptly take, or cause to be
taken, all action, and do,  or cause to be done all things necessary or
advisable to obtain CFIUS Approval as soon as practicable, and in any event
prior to the Termination Date, including, but not limited to, executing a

respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates be required to take any of the following

decree, hold  separate order or otherwise, (A) a Divestiture Action of any
member of the Company Group, on the one hand, or the Parent Group, on the

Governmental Entity or other Person in order to avoid entry of, or to have

Order that would restrain or prevent the Closing by the Termination Date.

 

(g) The parties shall cooperate to jointly assemble all information necessary
to notify the U.S.  Department of State's Directorate of Defense Trade
Controls (" _DDTC_ ") of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and
provide all information prescribed  by 22 C.F.R. § 122.4(c), and by published
guidance provided by DDTC (the " _DDTC Notice_ "). The parties shall submit
the DDTC Notice at least sixty (60) days  prior to the Closing Date, and as
soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement (and in any event the
parties shall use reasonable best efforts to make such filing within fifteen
(15) Business Days after the date hereof, subject to the Company  providing
all required information for such filing). The parties shall use their best
efforts to promptly inform the other party of any oral communications with,
and provide copies of written communications with, DDTC; _provided_ , that no
party shall be required to share communications containing its confidential
business information if such confidential information is unrelated to the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, the parties shall
undertake best efforts to act promptly and cooperatively in providing all
information required to amend existing licenses and/or agreements (issued by
any Governmental Entity), and to  obtain all required approvals pertaining to
import and export of the products or services of the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

 


 

   

(h) During the period from the date hereof until the Effective Time (or such
earlier date on which  this Agreement may be terminated), except (a) as
required by applicable Law, or (b) as expressly contemplated by this
Agreement, neither Parent Holdco nor the Company shall, and shall not permit
any of their respective Affiliates (including Parent  and Merger Sub) to,
take any action or fail to take any action which is intended to or which would
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, materially
prevent or delay or impede the ability of any of the parties hereto to
obtain  any necessary approvals or clearances of any Governmental Entity
required for the transactions contemplated hereby, to perform its covenants
and agreements under this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or otherwise  prevent or delay or impede the consummation
of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 5.6. _Access  and Reports; Cooperation_.

 

(a) Subject to applicable Law, from and after the date of this Agreement to
the Effective Time or  the earlier termination of this Agreement, upon
reasonable prior written notice, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent Holdco, Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Representatives reasonable access, during normal  business hours,
to its officers, employees, properties, offices and other facilities, books,
Contracts and records; _provided_ , that (i) the foregoing shall not  require
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to permit access to (A) any information
that is subject to attorney‑client privilege or other privilege or trade
secret protection or the work product doctrine, (B) any information that in
the reasonable  opinion of the Company (after consulting outside counsel)
would violate any applicable Law, (C) such documents or information that are
reasonably pertinent to any Action between the Company and its Affiliates, on
the one hand, and Parent Holdco and  its Affiliates, on the other hand, (D)
any information related to the negotiation and execution of this Agreement or
to transactions potentially competing with or alternative to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or proposals from other  third parties
relating to any competing or alternative transactions (including Acquisition
Proposals) and the actions of the Company Board (or any committee thereof)
with respect to any of the foregoing, whether prior to or after execution of
this  Agreement, or (E) any information related to a Change of Recommendation
or the actions of the Company Board (or any committee thereof) with respect
thereto, and (ii) any such investigation shall be conducted in such a manner
as not to interfere with  the normal business or operations of the Company or
its Subsidiaries or otherwise result in any undue burden with respect to the
prompt and timely discharge by employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries of
their normal duties and Parent Holdco and  Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to minimize to the extent reasonably practicable any
disruption to the businesses of the Company that may result from any such
requests for access. In addition, the Company, its Subsidiaries and  Parent
Holdco and Parent shall cooperate in good faith to arrange for, as reasonably
agreed by Parent and the Company, communication strategies for, and joint
meetings of the Company and Parent Holdco and Parent with, the Company's
customers,  suppliers, employees and unions; _provided,_ that such meetings
do not unreasonably interfere with the operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Each of  Parent Holdco, Parent and the Company, as each deems
advisable and necessary, may reasonably designate commercially sensitive
material provided to the other as "Outside Counsel Only Material" or with
similar restrictions, and such materials and the  information contained
therein shall be given only to the outside counsel of the recipient, or
otherwise as the restriction indicates, and be subject to any additional
confidentiality or joint defense agreement between the parties. The Company
and  Parent Holdco shall reasonably cooperate in good faith, and shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to, obtain any consents or give any
notices that would be reasonably required under any Contracts of the Company
or its Subsidiaries in  connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Nothing in this _Section 5.6_ will be construed to require the
Company, any of its  Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives
to prepare any reports, analyses, appraisals, opinions or other information.
Any access to the properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries will be
subject to the Company's reasonable  security measures, policies and
insurance requirements and will not include the right to sample soil,
sediment, groundwater, surface water, air or building materials prior to the
Effective Time without the Company's prior written consent.

 


 

   

(b) Each of Parent Holdco, Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause their
respective  Representatives and Affiliates to, hold and treat in confidence
all documents and information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries
furnished to Parent Holdco, Parent or Merger Sub or their respective
Representatives in connection with the  transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of
February 15, 2019, by and between the Company and Parent Holdco (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ") as if all such documents and information were
Evaluation Material (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement), which
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in
accordance  with its terms until the Effective Time and shall apply to Parent
and Merger Sub as if they were direct parties thereto.

 

Section 5.7. _Publicity;    Communications_. The initial press release
regarding the Merger shall be a joint press release by the Company and Parent
Holdco and thereafter (unless and until a Change of Recommendation has
occurred or in connection with the matters  described in _Section 5.2_) each
party shall consult with the other parties prior to issuing any press releases
or otherwise making public announcements,  statements or filings (including
internal communications to employees) with respect to the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as may be required
by Law or by the applicable rules of any stock exchange (in  which case, such
party shall, to the extent practicable, use commercially reasonable efforts to
consult with the other parties before issuing such press release or making
such public announcement or filing); _provided_ , however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will not be obligated to engage in
such consultation with respect to the substantive matters contained in
repeat  disclosures already made.

 

Section 5.8. _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, the compensation and benefit arrangements of
the Company and its  Subsidiaries in effect on the date hereof shall continue
in accordance with their terms. For the period from the Closing Date until
September 30, 2019 (assuming the Closing Date occurs prior to September 30,
2019) or, if shorter, the applicable  Continuing Employee's period of
employment, Parent Holdco shall, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiary to,
provide each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who continues in
employment with Parent Holdco, the Surviving Corporation or their 
Subsidiaries following the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Continuing
Employees_ ") with a base salary or regular hourly wage (whichever is
applicable) no  lower than that in effect for the applicable Continuing
Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and, for such period,
Continuing Employees shall continue to participate in the Company's short-term
cash incentive programs in which they  participated immediately prior to the
Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, Company Equity Awards that were
granted prior to the date of this Agreement and that are outstanding as of the
Closing Date shall be treated as provided in Section  2.8. For the period
beginning on the Closing Date and ending on September 30, 2020, (or, if
shorter, the applicable Continuing Employee's period of employment) (the "
_Continuation    Period_ "), Parent Holdco shall, or shall cause its
applicable Subsidiary to, (i) provide each Continuing Employee with (A) a base
salary or regular hourly wage (whichever is applicable) and annual cash
incentive opportunity that is, in  each case, no lower than that in effect
for the applicable Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, which cash incentive opportunity shall be earned based on the
achievement of performance goals approved by Parent after  consultation with
management. For those Continuing Employees who were granted annual long-term
equity incentive awards by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement,
the annual incentive opportunity will be increased and/or a long-term cash 
incentive opportunity will be granted, in either case, to reflect that the
Continuing Employee will not be granted long-term equity incentive
opportunities following the Closing Date. In addition, until the end of the
Continuation Period, Parent  Holdco shall, or shall cause its applicable
Subsidiary to, provide the Continuing Employees with other employee benefits
(other than any equity-based, change in control, retention, defined benefit
pension, retiree medical or similar benefits (the " _Excluded Benefits_ "))
that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the employee benefits (other
than Excluded Benefits) provided to the Continuing Employees as  of
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Not later than October 31, 2019 (or
thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, if later), the Surviving Corporation
shall pay each Continuing Employee who is then employed and a participant in a
Company  annual bonus plan an amount equal to the individuals' pro-rata
annual bonus for 2019 (based on the period employed during 2019 prior to
September 30, 2019 or, if later, the Closing Date). The Surviving Corporation
shall automatically assume the  Company Benefit Plans and shall perform the
obligations of the Company thereunder in accordance with the terms and
conditions thereof. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this
_Section 5.8_ and any applicable collective bargaining agreement, the terms of
the collective bargaining agreement shall prevail.

 


 

   

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, during the Continuation
Period, the Surviving  Corporation shall provide each Continuing Employee
whose employment is terminated by Parent Holdco or one of its Subsidiaries
without cause with severance in amounts and on terms and conditions set forth
in _Section 5.8(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Company
Severance Policy_ ").

 

(c) Parent Holdco will cause any employee benefit plans of Parent Holdco and
its Subsidiaries in  which the Continuing Employees are entitled to
participate after the Closing Date to take into account for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and benefit accruals service prior to the Effective Time
by such employees to the Company and its Subsidiaries  (and any predecessors)
as if such service was with Parent Holdco or its Subsidiaries; _provided_ ,
that no service shall be credited for purposes of any Excluded  Benefits or
to the extent it would result in duplication of benefits.

 

(d) With respect to any employee benefit plans maintained by Parent Holdco and
its Subsidiaries for  the benefit of the Continuing Employees following the
Closing Date, Parent Holdco shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive any
eligibility requirements or pre-existing  condition limitations or waiting
period requirements with respect to any such plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee to the same
extent waived under the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the  Closing
Date, and (ii) give effect, in determining any deductible, co-insurance and
maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to any eligible expenses paid by such
employees during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs (or such
plan year in  which a Continuing Employee commences participation in any new
plan of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) under any analogous
Company Benefit Plans.

 

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee or
other service provider  any right to continue in the employ or service of
Parent Holdco, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the
rights of Parent Holdco, Parent, the  Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, which rights are hereby expressly
reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any Continuing Employee or
other service provider at any time for any reason  whatsoever, with or
without cause. In no event shall the terms of this Agreement be deemed to (i)
establish, amend, or modify any Company Benefit Plan or any other employee
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by 
Parent Holdco, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent
Holdco, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates to  amend, modify or terminate any Company Benefit
Plan or any other employee benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement in
accordance with its terms after the Closing Date. Nothing in this _Section
5.8_ shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any Continuing
Employee or current or former service provider of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or  dependents thereof).

 

Section 5.9. _Expenses;    Transfer Taxes_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, whether or not the Merger
is consummated, all  costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such expense, except that (i)
all filing fees under the HSR Act shall be borne  by Parent Holdco and (ii)
if this Agreement is terminated (1) pursuant to _Section 7.2(c)_ , only in
connection with any Order by a Governmental Entity with  respect to the HSR
Act, (2) pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_ and, at (A) the time of such
termination, the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1(b)(i)_ or _Section
6.1(c)_ shall not have been satisfied (with regard to the condition  in
_Section 6.1(c)_ , as a result of a Law or Order under the HSR Act), (B) the
failure of one or more conditions set forth in _Section 6.1(b)(i)_ or _Section
6.1(c)_ to be satisfied is not primarily caused by any breach of _Section 5.5_
of this Agreement by any member of the Company Group and (C) all of the other
conditions to the obligations of Parent Holdco, Parent and Merger Sub to 
consummate the Merger set forth in this Agreement (other than _Section
6.1(b)(i)_ or _Section 6.1(c)_ ) have been satisfied or waived (and, in the
case of those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Closing, such conditions would be satisfied if the Closing were then to
occur), then all  out-of-pocket legal fees, costs and expenses incurred by
the Company from and after the date on which the parties receive a "request
for additional information or documentary material" from the Federal Trade
Commission or Department of Justice,  Antitrust Division, as applicable,
pursuant to the HSR Act (a " _Second Request_ ") incurred pursuant to _Section
5.5(a)_ \- _Section 5.5(d)_ solely in connection with such Second Request
through the date of the termination of  this Agreement shall be reimbursed by
Parent Holdco in an aggregate amount not to exceed $5 million.

 


 

   

(b) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 2.7(b)(i)_, all transfer,
documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes imposed with
respect to the transfer of Shares pursuant to the Merger shall be borne by the
Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 5.10. _Indemnification;    Directors ' and Officers' Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent Holdco shall, and shall cause
the Surviving  Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, each present and former director,
officer and employee of the Company, including any employee who serves as a
fiduciary of a Company Benefit Plan  (collectively, together with such
Person's heirs, executors or administrators, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ")
against any costs or expenses (including reasonable  attorneys' fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement incurred in connection with any actual or threatened Action,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of,
related to  or in connection with any action or omission occurring or alleged
to have occurred whether prior to or at the Effective Time (including in
connection with such Indemnified Parties' service as a director, officer,
employee or other fiduciary of the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
services performed by such Persons at the request of or for the benefit of the
Company or its Subsidiaries), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, including, for the avoidance of  doubt, in
connection with (i) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii)
actions to enforce this provision or any other indemnification, exculpation or
advancement right of any Indemnified Party. Without limiting the foregoing,
for a  period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the Charter
and the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less
favorable to the Indemnified Parties with respect to indemnification,
exculpation from liabilities and  rights to advancement of expenses than
those set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Company, which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would  adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnified Party. In addition, from and
after the Effective Time, Parent Holdco shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, advance costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) as
incurred by  any Indemnified Party promptly (and in any event within ten (10)
days) after receipt by the Surviving Corporation or Parent Holdco of a request
for such advance to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law;
_provided_ , that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
unsecured undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
(after exhausting all available appeals)  that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification.

 


 

   

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain and fully pre-pay
the premium for (and,  following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent Holdco and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, maintain with reputable and financially sound carriers) the
extension of (i) the directors' and officers' liability  coverage of the
Company's existing directors' and officers' insurance policies and (ii) the
Company's existing fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, " _D
andO    Insurance_"), in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period
(whichever is greater) of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with
respect to any claim arising from facts or events that existed or occurred at
or prior  to the Effective Time with terms, conditions, retentions, coverage
limits and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as the coverage
provided under the Company's existing policies in effect on the date hereof.
If the Company and the  Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain
such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent Holdco and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a  period of six (6) years
from and after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the date
hereof with terms, conditions, retentions, coverage limits and limits of
liability that are at least as favorable as the coverage provided in the 
Company's existing policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent Holdco and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, purchase comparable insurance as the DandO Insurance for such
six‑year period with terms,  conditions, retentions and limits of liability
that are at least as favorable as the coverage provided under the Company's
existing policies as of the date hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) in
no event shall the Company or the Surviving  Corporation be required to
expend for any such policies pursuant to this _Section 5.10(b)_ an annual
premium amount in excess of 250% of the aggregate of the  annual premiums
paid by the Company as of immediately prior to the Effective Time for such
insurance, and (B) if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed
such maximum amount, the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a
policy  with the greatest coverage available for such maximum amount.

 

(c) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns shall (i)
consolidate with or  merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any individual, corporation or  other entity, then, in each such case,
proper provisions shall be made so that such surviving or acquiring Person(s),
as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this
_Section 5.10_.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 5.10_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

 

(e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this _Section 5.10_ shall be
in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws or comparable governing documents of
the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries, under any applicable Contracts
existing on the date hereof, copies of which have been provided to Parent, or
Laws. All rights to indemnification, exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective  Time and rights to
advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any
Indemnified Party (whether asserted or claimed prior to, at, or after the
Effective Time) as provided in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or
comparable  governing documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any Contract between such Indemnified Party and the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect
(and shall be so maintained) and  shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any
such Indemnified Party. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be
construed to or shall release, waive or impair any  rights to insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Indemnified Party, it being
understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this _Section
5.10_ is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such
policies.

 


 

   

Section 5.11. _Section    16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all steps reasonably necessary to cause any dispositions of
equity securities (including derivative securities) of the Company in
connection with this Agreement and the  transactions contemplated hereby by
each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 5.12. _Transaction    Litigation_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent Holdco and Parent, and Parent Holdco and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, in each case, within two (2) Business Days, of
any Actions commenced against such  party or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives in connection with, arising from or relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (" _Transaction   
Litigation_ ") (including by providing copies of all pleadings with respect
thereto) and thereafter keep the other party promptly and reasonably informed
with respect to the status thereof. Parent Holdco and Parent shall have the
right  to participate in the defense, settlement or prosecution of any
Transaction Litigation and the Company shall consult with Parent Holdco and
Parent with respect to the defense, settlement and prosecution of any
Transaction Litigation. For purposes of  this _Section 5.12_, "participate"
means that (i) the Company shall provide Parent Holdco and Parent (and their
outside counsel) an opportunity to review and to  propose comments to all
filings or responses to be made by the Company in connection with any
Transaction Litigation commenced, or to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened in writing, (ii) the Company will keep Parent Holdco and Parent
reasonably  apprised of proposed strategy and other significant decisions
with respect to the Transaction Litigation (to the extent that the attorney-
client privilege between the Company and its counsel is not undermined or
otherwise affected), and (iii) the  Company shall consider in good faith any

contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) without these agreements, Parent Holdco,
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company would not enter into this Agreement, and

in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent Holdco, Parent and Merger
Sub in the circumstances in which such Termination Fee is payable for the
efforts and resources expended and the opportunities forgone while 
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay the Termination Fee when
due or any portion thereof  and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
Holdco or Parent and Merger Sub commences a suit which results in a final and
nonappealable Order against the Company for such Termination Fee or any
portion thereof, the Company shall pay to Parent Holdco  or Parent interest
on the amount of the Termination Fee (or any portion thereof that has not been
paid timely in accordance with this Agreement) at the prime lending rate set
forth in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was 
required to be made. Any interest payable hereunder shall be calculated on a
daily basis from the date such amounts were required to be paid until (but
excluding) the date of actual payment. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in  this Agreement, in the event this Agreement is
terminated by the Company for any reason at a time when Parent Holdco or
Parent would have had the right to terminate this Agreement, Parent Holdco or
Parent shall be entitled to receipt of any  Termination Fee that would have
been (or would have subsequently become) payable had Parent Holdco or Parent
terminated this Agreement at that time.

 

(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
that the Termination  Fee is paid pursuant to this _Section 7.5(b)_, except
in the case of fraud, Parent Holdco's or Parent's right to receive payment of
the Termination Fee and such  other amounts described herein shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of Parent Holdco, Parent and their Affiliates and
Representatives against the Company and its Affiliates and Representatives
under this Agreement or arising out of or related to  this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, and upon payment of such amount, none of the
Company or any of its Affiliates or Representatives shall have any liability
or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the 
transactions contemplated hereby, in each case whether based on contract, tort
or strict liability, by the enforcement of any assessment, by any legal or
equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable Law
or otherwise.

 


 

   

Section 7.6. _Full  Exculpation of Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, no Company Related Party (other
than Parent Holdco, Parent and Merger Sub) shall have any rights or claims
against any Financing Sources  Related Parties in connection with this
Agreement, the Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, and no Financing Sources Related Parties shall have any rights or
claims against any Company Related Party (other than Parent  Holdco, Parent
and Merger Sub) in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise; provided that, following consummation of the
Merger,  the foregoing will not limit the rights of the parties to the Debt
Financing under any agreement related thereto. Without limiting Parent
Holdco's, Parent's and Merger Sub's rights under the Financing Agreement, no
Financing Sources Related Parties  shall be subject to any special,
consequential, punitive or indirect damages or damages of a tortious nature.

of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in

Section 8.7. _Specific    Performance_.

 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would  not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including
failing to take such actions as are required of them in order to consummate
the Merger) in accordance with its  specified terms or otherwise breach or
threaten to breach such provisions. The parties acknowledge and agree that the
parties hereto shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity, to an injunction,  specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof. In furtherance of the foregoing, it is acknowledged and
agreed that each of the  Company, on the one hand, and Parent Holdco, Parent
and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall be entitled to specific performance
of Parent Holdco's, Parent's and Merger Sub's, on the one hand, and the
Company's, on the other hand, obligations  pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement to complete the Closing; including to consummate the Merger, in the
event that all of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_  and _Section
6.2_, in the case of the Company, or _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.3_, in the
case of Parent Holdco, Parent or Merger Sub, have been satisfied (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the  Closing,
and any conditions the failure of which to be satisfied is caused by a breach
by Parent Holdco, Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on
the other hand, or their respective representations, warranties, covenants
or  agreements contained in this Agreement).

 

(b) Without limiting _Section 8.7(a)_,  each of the parties agrees that it
will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that (i) there is adequate remedy at law or (ii)
an award of specific performance is not an appropriate  remedy for any reason
at law or in equity. Any party seeking an order or injunction to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other  security in connection with any such order or injunction.

 

Section 8.8. _Entire  Agreement_. This Agreement (including any exhibits
hereto), the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure Schedule and

and oral, among the parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

 

Section 8.9. _Parties    in Interest_. Each of Parent Holdco, Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company hereby agrees that their respective
representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein are solely for the
benefit of the other parties hereto, in  accordance with and subject to the
terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to, and does not,
confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder, including the right to rely upon the  representations and
warranties set forth herein; _provided_ , that (a) if the Effective Time
occurs, the holders of Shares shall be third party beneficiaries of,  and
shall be entitled to rely on, _Article II_ solely to the extent necessary to
receive the Merger Consideration to which such holders are entitled
hereunder,  (b) if the Effective Time occurs, the Indemnified Parties shall
be third party beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to rely on, _Section
5.10_ (Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance), and (c) the
Financing Sources Related Parties shall be express third party beneficiaries
of _Sections 7.6_ , _8.2_ (last sentence), _8.5(a)(ii)_ , _8.5(b)_ and _8.9_ ,
each of such Sections shall expressly inure to the benefit of the Financing
Sources Related Parties and the Financing Sources Related Parties shall be
entitled to rely on and the Financing Sources shall be entitled to  enforce
the provisions of such Sections.

not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If
any provision of this Agreement, or the application  thereof to any Person or
any circumstance, is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be
substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and

with this Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the
extent signed and delivered by  means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail
delivery of a ".pdf" format data file, shall be treated in all manner and
respects as an original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to
have the same binding legal effect as if it were the  original signed version
thereof delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such agreement or
instrument shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e‑mail delivery of a
".pdf" format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any 
amendment or consent hereto or thereto or the fact that any signature or
agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of a
facsimile machine or e‑mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense
to the formation of a  contract and each party hereto forever waives any such
defense.
