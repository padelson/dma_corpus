ARTICLE I

THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

Section 1.1 _The Offer_.

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with Section 8.1 and none of the events set forth in paragraph (2)(iii) of
Annex I shall exist or have occurred and be continuing, as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within 10 Business Days) after the date of this
Agreement, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) commence
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act) the
Offer to purchase for cash all outstanding Shares at the Offer Price.

Purchaser to) consummate the Offer in accordance with its terms and accept for
payment and pay for all Shares (without interest) validly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that Purchaser becomes obligated to
purchase pursuant to the Offer. The obligation of  



 

2  Purchaser to accept for payment and pay for Shares (without interest)
tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to the
satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or Purchaser, of each of the Offer
Conditions.

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ ") that contains, among other things, the terms set forth in this
Agreement, the Minimum Condition and the other conditions and requirements set
forth in Annex I. Parent and Purchaser expressly reserve the right to ( _x_ )
increase the Offer Price and ( _y_ ) to waive any Offer Conditions and make
any other changes to the terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that unless otherwise provided by this Agreement, without the
prior written consent of the Company, neither Parent nor Purchaser shall ( _i_
) decrease the Offer Price, ( _ii_ ) change the form of consideration payable
in the Offer, ( _iii_ ) decrease the number of Shares sought to be purchased
in the Offer, ( _iv_ ) impose additional conditions to the Offer, ( _v_ )
except as required by any Governmental Entity, amend or modify any terms in a
manner adverse to the holders of Shares, ( _vi_ ) change or waive the Minimum
Condition or ( _vii_ ) extend or otherwise change the expiration date of the
Offer other than as required or permitted by this Agreement.

(d) Unless extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the Offer shall expire at midnight (New York City time) on the
date that is 20 Business Days following the commencement (within the meaning
of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of the Offer (the " _Initial
Expiration Date_ ") or, in the event the Initial Expiration Date has been
extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the
date to which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration Date, or
such later date to which the Initial Expiration Date has been extended
pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, is referred
to as the " _Expiration Date_ ").

(e) The Offer may be extended from time to time as follows:

(i) If, on or prior to any then scheduled Expiration Date, all of the Offer
Conditions (including the Minimum Condition and all other Offer Conditions)
shall not have been satisfied, or waived by Parent or Purchaser if permitted
hereunder, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to), at the
request of the Company, extend the Offer for one or more successive periods
of not more than 10 Business Days in order to permit the satisfaction of such
conditions, each until the earlier of ( _x_ ) the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 and ( _y_ ) ( _A_ ) the date that is 180
days after commencement of the Offer (the " _Initial Outside Date_ ") or ( _B_
) the date that is 270 days after commencement of the Offer in the event that
the HSR Condition or the Governmental Approval Condition shall not have been
satisfied, or waived by Parent or Purchaser if permitted hereunder, by the
Initial Outside Date (the " _Extended Outside Date_ "), if any such extension
of not more than 10 Business Days would otherwise end after the Initial
Outside Date or the Extended Outside Date, as applicable;



 

3 (ii) Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, without consent of the Company,
extend the Offer for one or more successive periods of not more than 10
Business Days each, if at any otherwise scheduled Expiration Date any of the
Offer Conditions shall have not been satisfied, or waived by Parent or
Purchaser if permitted hereunder; and 

(iii) Purchaser shall extend the Offer for any period or periods required by
applicable law, rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") or its staff or Nasdaq or
its staff.

(f) Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, provide for a "subsequent offering
period" in accordance with Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Offer, Purchaser
shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) accept for payment, and pay for,
all Shares that are validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
during any such "subsequent offering period" promptly after any such Shares
are tendered during such "subsequent offering period." The Offer Documents
will provide for the possibility of a "subsequent offering period" in a manner
consistent with the terms of this Section 1.1(f).

(g) Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration
Date without the prior written consent of the Company, except in the
event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1 or as
required by applicable law. In the event that this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 8.1, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to)
promptly terminate the Offer and shall not acquire any Shares pursuant to the
Offer.

(h) On the date of the commencement of the Offer (within the meaning of Rule
14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act), Purchaser shall (and Parent shall
cause Purchaser to) file with the SEC, pursuant to Regulation M-A under the
Exchange Act (" _Regulation M-A_ "), a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule
TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and
exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ") that will comply in all material
respects with the provisions of all applicable Federal and other securities
Laws. The Schedule TO shall include, as exhibits, the Offer to Purchase and a
form of letter of transmittal and summary advertisement (collectively,
together with any amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_
"). Parent and Purchaser shall take all steps necessary to cause the Offer
Documents to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of the Shares,
in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. Each of
Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall correct promptly any information
provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material  



 

4  respect or as otherwise required by applicable law. Parent and Purchaser
further agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents, as
so corrected (if applicable), to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to
holders of the Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the
Exchange Act. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents before they are
filed with the SEC, and Parent and Purchaser shall give due consideration to
all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the
Company and its counsel. In addition, Parent and Purchaser shall provide the
Company and its counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform
them of any oral comments, that Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may receive
from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule TO
or the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of such comments, and any
written or oral responses thereto. Parent and Purchaser shall give the Company
and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review any such written responses
and shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel. Parent and Purchaser
shall use their reasonable best efforts to respond promptly to any comments of
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents. The Company hereby
consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the Company
Recommendation, as such Company Recommendation may be amended and until such
Company Recommendation may be withdrawn, in each case as permitted by this
Agreement. If Purchaser terminates or withdraws the Offer, or this Agreement
is terminated prior to the purchase of Shares in the Offer, Purchaser shall
promptly return, and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Purchaser
to return, all tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof.

(i) The Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of
any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend
or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), cash
dividend, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination or
other like change with respect to Common Stock occurring on or after the date
of this Agreement and prior to the time Purchaser accepts for payment and pays
for any Shares tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (the "
_Acceptance Time_ "), if any.

Section 1.2 _Company Actions_.

(a) Contemporaneous with the filing of the Schedule TO, the Company shall, in
a manner that complies with Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange
Act, file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule
14D-9 with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and
exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") that shall, subject to the
provisions of Section 6.4, contain the Company Recommendation and that will
comply in all material respects with the provisions of all applicable Federal
and other securities Laws. The Company shall take all steps necessary to cause
the Schedule 14D-9 to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the  



 

5  Exchange Act. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall correct
promptly any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and
to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable law. The Company
shall take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected
(if applicable), to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act.
Parent, Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
review the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC, and the Company
shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto by Parent, Purchaser and their counsel. In addition, the
Company shall provide Parent, Purchaser and their counsel with copies of any
written comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that the Company
or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the Companys receipt of
such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto. The Company shall
give Parent, Purchaser and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to review
any such written responses, and the Company shall give due consideration to
all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent,
Purchaser and their counsel. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Schedule 14D-9.

(b) If approval of the stockholders of the Company is required under the DGCL
to consummate the Merger, as promptly as practicable following the Acceptance
Time and the expiration of any "subsequent offering period" provided by
Purchaser pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, if applicable,
and in any event within 14 days after the Acceptance Time and the expiration
of such "subsequent offering period" provided by Purchaser pursuant to and in
accordance with this Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file with the
SEC in preliminary form a proxy or information statement for the Special
Meeting (together with any amendments thereof or supplements thereto and any
other required solicitation materials or information, the " _Proxy Statement_
") relating to the Merger and this Agreement that shall, subject to the
provisions of Section 6.4(c), contain the Company Recommendation. The Company
shall take all steps necessary to cause the Proxy Statement to be filed with
the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the
extent required by the DGCL, the Exchange Act or the SEC (or its staff). Each
of Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall correct promptly any information
provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement if and to the extent that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or
as otherwise required by applicable law. The Company shall take all steps
necessary to cause the Proxy Statement, as so corrected (if applicable), to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and
to the extent required by the DGCL, the Exchange Act or the SEC (or its
staff). Parent, Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review the Proxy Statement before it is filed with the SEC, and
the Company shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent, Purchaser and their counsel.
 



 

6  In addition, the Company shall provide Parent, Purchaser and their counsel
with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral
comments, that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement promptly after the
Companys receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto.
The Company shall give Parent, Purchaser and their counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review any such written responses, and the Company shall give
due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by Parent, Purchaser and their counsel. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Proxy Statement.

(c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly after execution
of this Agreement furnish or cause to be furnished to Parent and Purchaser (
_i_ ) a list of the names and addresses of the record holders of Shares as of
the most recent practicable date, as well as mailing labels containing such
names and addresses and ( _ii_ ) all lists of stockholders, security position
lists, computer files and all other information identifying the beneficial
owners of Shares as of the most recent practicable date which the Company or
its transfer agent has in its possession or control or can obtain without
unreasonable effort or expense. The Company shall furnish or cause to be
furnished to Parent and Purchaser such additional information (including
updates of the items provided pursuant to the preceding sentence) and such
other assistance as Parent or Purchaser or their respective agents may
reasonably request for the purpose of communicating the Offer to the record
and beneficial owners of Shares. Subject to the requirements of applicable
law, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer
Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Offer, the
Merger and the other Transactions, Purchaser shall hold in confidence the
information contained in any such labels, listings and files, shall use such
information only in connection with the Offer, the Merger and the other
Transactions, and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon the
Companys written request, promptly deliver to the Company the original and
all copies of such information then in its possession or control.

Section 1.3 _Board of Directors_.

(a) Upon the Acceptance Time, and from time to time thereafter as Shares are
acquired by Parent or Purchaser, subject to compliance with the provisions of
the Constituent Documents of the Company, applicable Law and the
applicable Marketplace Rules of the NASDAQ, Purchaser shall be entitled to
designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on
the Board of Directors of the Company as is equal to the product of (i) the
total number of directors on the Board of Directors of the Company (after
giving effect to the directors elected or designated by Purchaser pursuant to
this sentence) multiplied by (ii) the percentage that the aggregate number of
Shares beneficially owned by Parent, Purchaser and any of their affiliates
bears to the total number of Shares then outstanding (disregarding any
unvested and  



 

7  unexercisable Company Stock Options, Warrants and all other unvested rights
to acquire shares of the Company Common Stock). The Company shall, upon
any exercise of such right by Purchaser, take all such actions as are
necessary or desirable to (A) elect or designate to the Board of Directors of
the Company the individuals designated by Purchaser and permitted to be so
elected or designated by the first sentence of this Section 1.3(a), including
promptly filling vacancies or newly created directorships on the Board of
Directors of the Company, promptly increasing the size of the Board of
Directors of the Company (including by action of the Board of Directors of
the Company and by the amendment of the by-laws of the Company, if necessary,
so as to increase the size of the Board of Directors of the Company) and/or
promptly securing the resignations of such number of its incumbent directors
as are necessary or desirable to enable Purchasers designees to be so elected
or designated to the Board of Directors of the Company, and (B) cause the
Persons designated by Purchaser to constitute the same percentage (rounded up
to the next whole number) as is on the Board of Directors of the Company of
the members of (I) each committee of the Board of Directors of the Company
(II) each board of directors (or similar body) of each Company Subsidiary, and
(III) each committee (or similar body) of each such board of directors (or
similar body), in each case to the full extent permitted by the provisions of
the Constituent Documents of the Company, applicable Law and the NASDAQ
Marketplace Rules. From and after the Acceptance Time and until the Effective
Time, the Company shall take all action necessary to elect to be treated as a
"controlled company" as defined by NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 4350(c)(5) and make
all necessary filings and disclosures associated with such status. The
Company shall promptly upon execution of this Agreement take all actions
required pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section
1.3(a), including mailing to shareholders (together with the Schedule 14D-9)
the information required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder to enable Purchasers designees to be elected or
designated to the Board of Directors of the Company. Purchaser shall supply
the Company with information with respect to Purchasers designees and
Parents and Purchasers respective officers, directors and affiliates to the
extent required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder. The provisions of this Section 1.3(a) are in addition
to and shall not limit any rights that any of Purchaser, Parent or any
of their respective affiliates may have as a holder or beneficial owner of
Shares as a matter of applicable law with respect to the election of directors
or otherwise.

(b) In the event that Purchasers designees are elected or designated to the
Board of Directors of the Company pursuant to Section 1.3(a), then, subject to
the Constituent Documents of the Company, until the Effective Time, the
Company shall cause the Board of Directors of the Company to maintain at least
such number of "independent directors," as defined by the NASDAQ Marketplace
Rules, as may be required by the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules or the federal
securities laws, at least one of whom shall be an "audit committee financial
expert," as defined in Item 401(h) of  



 

8  Regulation S-K and the instructions thereto (any such "independent
directors" as of the date of this Agreement (and their successors as
provided below), the " _Continuing Directors_ "); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if any Continuing Director is unable to serve due to death, disability or
resignation, the Company, Purchaser and Parent shall take all necessary
action (including creating a committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company) so that the entire Board of Directors of the Company shall be
entitled to designate another Person or Persons to fill such vacancy or
vacancies, and such Person or Persons thereafter shall be deemed to be a
Continuing Director for purposes of this Agreement. If no Continuing Director
then remains, the other directors shall designate Persons to fill such
vacancies and such Persons shall be deemed Continuing Directors for all
purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, if Purchasers designees constitute a majority of the Board of
Directors of the Company after the Acceptance Time and prior to the Effective
Time, then the affirmative vote of a majority of the Continuing Directors
shall be required ( _i_ ) to authorize any agreement between the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Parent, Purchaser or any of
their Affiliates (other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), on the
other hand, ( _ii_ ) for the Company to amend or terminate this Agreement, (
_iii_ ) to exercise or waive any of the Companys rights, benefits or remedies
hereunder, ( _iv_ ) to extend the time for performance of Parents or
Purchasers obligations hereunder or ( _v_ ) to amend the Constituent
Documents of the Company. The Continuing Directors shall have the authority to
retain such counsel (which may include current counsel to the Company) and
other advisors at the reasonable expense of the Company as determined
appropriate by the Continuing Directors, and shall have the authority to
institute any action on behalf of the Company to enforce the performance of
this Agreement.

Section 1.4 _The Top-Up Option_.

(a) The Company hereby grants to Purchaser an irrevocable option (the " _Top-
Up Option_ ") to purchase that number of Shares (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_
") equal to the lowest number of Shares that, when added to the number of
Shares owned by Parent, Purchaser and their respective affiliates at the time
of such exercise, shall constitute one Share more than the number of Shares
necessary for Purchaser to be merged with and into the Company pursuant to
Section 253 of the DGCL at a price per Share equal to the Offer Price (a "
_Short Form Merger_ ").

(b) The Top-Up Option shall be exercisable once or multiple times at any time
and from time to time after the Acceptance Time and prior to the earlier
to occur of ( _A_ ) the Effective Time and ( _B_ ) the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1; _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding anything continued in this Agreement to the contrary the Top-
Up Option shall not be exercisable if ( _i_ ) any provision of any applicable
Law or any judgment, injunction, order or decree of any Governmental Entity
shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up
Option Shares in respect to such exercise, ( _ii_ ) the issuance of the Top-
Up Option Shares would require  



 

9  shareholder approval under the rules of Nasdaq, ( _iii_ ) the number of Top-
Up Option Shares would exceed the number of authorized but unissued Shares or
( _iv_ ) after issuance of Shares pursuant to the Top-Up Option, it will be
insufficient to allow Purchaser to effect the Short Form Merger and;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Top-Up Option shall terminate
concurrently with the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1.

(c) In the event Purchaser wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Purchaser
shall so notify the Company in writing, and shall set forth in such notice (
_i_ ) the number of Shares owned by Parent, Purchaser and their respective
affiliates immediately preceding the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares
and ( _ii_ ) the place and time for the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up
Option Shares (the " _Top-Up Closing_ "). The Company shall, as soon as
practicable following receipt of such notice, notify Parent and Purchaser
in writing of the number of Shares then outstanding and the number of Top-Up
Option Shares. At the Top-Up Closing, Purchaser shall pay the Company the
aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Option Shares by delivery
of, at Purchasers option, ( _A_ ) immediately available funds by wire
transfer to an account designated by the Company, ( _B_ ) a promissory note,
bearing interest at 6-Month USD LIBOR Rate, and due six months after the Top-
Up Closing, or ( _C_ ) any combination thereof, and the Company shall cause
to be issued to Purchaser a certificate representing the Top-Up Option Shares.

(d) Parent and Purchaser acknowledge that the Shares which Purchaser may
acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the
U.S. securities laws and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption
thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent and
Purchaser represent and warrant to the Company that Purchaser is, or will be
upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an "accredited investor," as
defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Purchaser
agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Options Shares to be acquired
upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by Purchaser
for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in
connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the
Securities Act).

Section 1.5 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Purchaser shall be merged with
and into the Company and the separate corporate existence of Purchaser shall
thereupon cease. The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger
(with respect to all post-closing periods, the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").
At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this
Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the applicable provisions of the
DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto,
at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Purchaser shall vest in the Surviving

Purchaser shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

Article VII, take place at the offices of Debevoise and Plimpton LLP, 919 Third
Avenue, New York, New York at 9:00 a.m. New York City time on the second
Business Day after all of the conditions set forth in Article VII have been
fulfilled or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing) in accordance with this Agreement, or at such
other place and time and/or on such other date as the Company and Parent may
agree in writing (the " _Closing Date_ ").

Section 1.7 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as
soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file a certificate
of merger as contemplated by the DGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "),
together with any required related certificates, with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware, in such form as required by, and executed in
accordance with, the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as
the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with such Secretary of State on the
Closing Date, or at such later time as Parent and the Company shall agree and
specify in the Certificate of Merger. As used herein, the " _Effective Time_ "
shall mean the time at which the Merger shall become effective.

Section 1.8 _Certificate of Incorporation_. The certificate of incorporation
of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated at the Effective
Time to be in the form of Exhibit A and, as so amended and restated, such
certificate of incorporation shall be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation (the " _Certificate of Incorporation_ "), until
thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

Section 1.9 _By-Laws_. The by-laws of Purchaser in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation (the "
_By-Laws_ ") until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable
Law.

Section 1.10 _Directors_. The directors of Purchaser immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of

in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and the By-Laws.

Section 1.11 _Officers_. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of

Section 1.12 _Stockholder s Meeting_. If approval of the stockholders of the
Company is required under the DGCL to consummate the Merger: 

(a) The Company, acting through (or upon authorization by) the Board of
Directors of the Company, shall, in accordance with and subject to the
requirements of the Companys Constituent Documents and applicable law:



 

11 (i) ( _A_ ) as promptly as practicable following the Acceptance Time and
the expiration of any "subsequent offering period" provided by Purchaser
pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, if applicable, duly set a
record date for, call and give notice of a special meeting of its stockholders
(the " _Special Meeting_ ") for the purpose of considering and taking action
upon this Agreement (with the record date and meeting date set in consultation
with Purchaser), and ( _B_ ) as promptly as practicable following
the Acceptance Time and the expiration of any "subsequent offering period"
provided by Purchaser pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, if
applicable, convene and hold the Special Meeting;

(ii) cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders as
promptly as possible after the date that the SEC staff advises that it has no
further comments thereon or that the Company may commence mailing the proxy
statement; and

(iii) use its reasonable best efforts to secure any approval in favor of the
approval and adoption of the Agreement by the stockholders of the Company that
is required by the Companys Constituent Documents and the DGCL and any other
applicable law to effect the Merger.

(b) The Company shall not postpone or adjourn the Special Meeting except that,
after receiving the written consent of the Parent, the Company may adjourn or
postpone the Special Meeting to the extent legally necessary to ensure that
any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the
Companys stockholders or, if as of the time for which the Special Meeting is
originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are
insufficient Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Special Meeting. After the
Acceptance Time, the Company shall prepare and distribute as promptly as
practicable any such required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement
and following any such adjournment or postponement of the Special Meeting, the
Company shall take all action necessary to reconvene the Special Meeting as
promptly as practicable after such adjournment or postponement.

(c) At the Special Meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof, Parent
shall vote, or cause to be voted, all of the Shares then owned by it,
Purchaser or any of their respective affiliates in favor of the approval and
adoption of this Agreement and to deliver or provide, in its capacity as a
stockholder of the Company or otherwise, any other approvals that are required
by the DGCL and any other applicable law to effect the Merger.



 

12 Section 1.13 _Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders_. Notwithstanding the
terms of Section 1.12, in the event that Parent, Purchaser and their
respective affiliates shall own, in the aggregate, at least 90% of the
outstanding Shares, following the Acceptance Time and the expiration of any
"subsequent offering period" provided by Purchaser pursuant to and in
accordance with this Agreement, if applicable, the parties hereto shall take
all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective
as promptly as practicable thereafter, without a meeting of stockholders of
the Company, in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

Section 1.14 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of any holder thereof, each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded
Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive an amount equal to the
Offer Price, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), subject to
any applicable withholding Taxes.

(b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of any holder thereof, all shares of Company Common Stock (other than
Excluded Shares) shall cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and
retired, and each certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ")
shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded
Shares) formerly represented thereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of any such shares that, at the
Effective Time, were unvested Company Restricted Stock shall be converted into
Parent Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of Section 1.16(d).

(c) Each Excluded Share at the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to be
outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

(d) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of any holder thereof, each share of common stock of Purchaser issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be converted
into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of the Surviving
Corporation and such shares shall constitute the only issued and outstanding
shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.



 

13 Section 1.15 _Treatment of Company Stock Options_.

(a) _Company Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, Parent will assume
each then outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock
granted pursuant to a Company Benefit Plan (a " _Company Stock Option_ "),
whether or not exercisable at the Effective Time and regardless of the
exercise price thereof, in a manner consistent with the requirements of
Section 424(a) of the Code. Pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence,
the following process shall be applied to effect the assumption of such
Company Stock Options. Parent shall determine the ratio (the " _Company
Option Ratio_ ") of ( _i_ ) the exercise price for a share of Company Common
Stock subject to each Company Stock Option (the " _Company Exercise Price_ ")
to ( _ii_ ) the Offer Price. Parent shall also determine the product of ( _i_
) the remainder of ( _A_ ) the Offer Price minus ( _B_ ) the Company Exercise
Price, multiplied by ( _ii_ ) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option (such product hereinafter called the "
_Company Option Spread_ "). Parent shall establish the exercise price to
purchase a share of Parent Common Stock (the " _Parent Exercise Price_ ")
under each assumed option such that the ratio of ( _i_ ) the Parent Exercise
Price to ( _ii_ ) the average closing price of a share of Parent Common Stock
for the five trading days ending on the trading day immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the " _Parent Closing Value_ ") is equal to the Company Option
Ratio. Parent shall determine the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
subject to each assumed Company Stock Option by dividing ( _i_ ) the Company
Option Spread by ( _ii_ ) the remainder of ( _A_ ) the Parent Closing Value
minus ( _B_ ) the Parent Exercise Price; _provided_ , _that_ if the Company
Option Spread is zero, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to
each assumed Company Stock Option shall equal the Offer Price multiplied by
the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock
Option and divided by the Parent Closing Value;  _provided_ , _further_ ,
that any fractional share of Parent Common Stock resulting from such quotient
shall be cashed out based on the Parent Closing Value and taking into account
the applicable portion of the Parent Exercise Price related thereto. Each
assumed Company Stock Option shall be deemed vested immediately following the
Effective Time as to the same percentage of the total number of shares subject
thereto as it was vested immediately prior to the Effective Time, except
to the extent such Company Stock Option by its written terms as set forth in
the relevant option agreement as in effect immediately prior to the date
hereof provides for acceleration of vesting by reason of the Transactions
contemplated hereby. Each assumed Company Stock Option will otherwise
continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) _Registrations_. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall take all corporate
action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of
Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Company Stock Options or in
connection with any other Company Benefit Plan for which shares of Parent
Common Stock are required to be  



 

14  reserved for issuance, the number of which is set forth in Section 3.3 of
the Company Disclosure Letter. Reasonably promptly after the Effective
Time, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-3 or Form S-8, as
the case may be (or any successor or other appropriate forms), with respect to
the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such options or Company Benefit
Plans for which registration of shares of Parent Common Stock is required and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of
such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the
current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so
long as such options remain outstanding or for so long as such registration
statement is required with respect to any other Company Benefit Plan.

(c) _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and the
Company shall take all such reasonable steps as may be required and are
consistent with applicable Law and regulations to cause any dispositions of
Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company
Common Stock) in the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 1.16 _Company Restricted Stock Units and Company Restricted Stock_.

(a) _Amendments; Plan Termination_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company
shall amend any agreement evidencing the grant of ( _i_ ) any restricted
stock unit granted pursuant to a Company Benefit Plan (a " _Company Restricted
Stock Unit_ ") or ( _ii_ ) any shares of unvested restricted stock granted
pursuant to a Company Benefit Plan (" _Company Restricted Stock_ ") that
would provide for the acceleration of vesting of more than 50% of the unvested
portion of a Company Restricted Stock Unit or Company Restricted Stock by
reason of the Transactions contemplated hereby to provide that only 50%
of any unvested portion of such Company Restricted Stock Unit or Company
Restricted Stock would be subject to accelerated vesting by reason of the
Transactions contemplated hereby. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
terminate, effective as of the Effective Time, each Company Benefit Plan that
grants Company Restricted Stock Units, Company Restricted Stock or Company
Stock Options (including, but not limited to, the Audible, Inc. 1999 Stock
Incentive Plan), in accordance with the terms of each such plan.

(b) _Vested Company Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each
then outstanding Company Restricted Stock Unit that ( _i_ ) has become vested
on or before the Closing by its written terms as set forth in the relevant
award agreement as in effect immediately prior to the date hereof and as
amended pursuant to Section 1.16(a) and ( _ii_ ) has not been settled as of
the Closing Date shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without  



 

15  any action on the part of the holders thereof, each such vested Company
Restricted Stock Unit shall cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled, and
any award agreement (or portion thereof) evidencing the grant of any such
Company Restricted Stock Unit shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration with respect to the Company Restricted Stock
Units formerly represented thereby.

(c) _Unvested Company Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders
thereof, Parent shall assume each then outstanding Company Restricted Stock
Unit that has not become vested on or before the Closing by its written terms
as set forth in the relevant award agreement as in effect immediately
prior to the date hereof and as amended pursuant to Section 1.16(a), such
that any holder of such assumed Company Restricted Stock Units shall have the
right to receive at the time and subject to the terms and conditions specified
in the relevant award agreement as in effect immediately prior to the date
hereof and as amended pursuant to Section 1.16(a) that number of shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the quotient of ( _i_ ) the Offer Price,
multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
award agreement, divided by ( _ii_ ) the Parent Closing Value; _provided_ that
any fractional share of Parent Common Stock resulting from such quotient shall
be cashed out based on the Parent Closing Value. Each assumed Company
Restricted Stock Unit will otherwise continue to have, and be subject to, the
same terms and conditions as are in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time and as amended pursuant to Section 1.16(a).

(d) _Company Restricted Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of each then outstanding share of Company
Restricted Stock that has not become vested on or before the Effective Time by
its written terms as set forth in the relevant award agreement, as in effect
immediately prior to the date hereof and as amended pursuant to Section
1.16(a), shall be reinvested in that number of shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the quotient of ( _i_ ) the Offer Price, multiplied by the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such award agreement, divided by (
_ii_ ) the Parent Closing Value; _provided_ that any fractional share of
Parent Common Stock resulting from such quotient shall be cashed out based on
the Parent Closing Value. By virtue of such reinvestment, immediately
following the Effective Time, the rights of each holder of any such Company
Restricted Stock shall be converted into rights in respect of the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock determined pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence, which shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as
were in effect with respect to such Company Restricted Stock immediately prior
to the Effective Time.

Section 1.17 _Treatment of Warrants_. As of the Effective Time, each warrant
to acquire Company Common Stock (each, a " _Warrant_ "), other than the
Warrants held by the Parent and its wholly owned Subsidiaries (the " _Excluded
Warrants_ ") (which  



 

16  Excluded Warrants shall terminate as of the Effective Time), shall be
converted into the right to receive, in lieu of the Company Common Stock
immediately issuable upon exercise of the Warrant, the Merger Consideration
which the shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such
Warrant would be entitled to receive at the Effective Time had the Warrant
been exercised immediately prior thereto, minus the exercise price of such
Warrant.

Section 1.18 _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding Parent Common Stock or
Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares
or different class by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock
split, split-up, combination or exchange of shares, or a stock dividend or
dividend payable in any other securities shall be declared with a record date
within such period, or any similar event shall have occurred, the Offer Price
shall be appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Common
Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
event.

Section 1.19  _Appraisal Rights_. No holder of Dissenting Shares (a "
_Dissenting Stockholder_ ") shall be entitled to any Merger Consideration in
respect of such Dissenting Shares unless and until such holder shall have
failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such holders
right to seek appraisal of its Dissenting Shares under the DGCL, and any
Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to receive only the payment provided
by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to the Dissenting Shares owned by
such Dissenting Stockholder. If any Person who otherwise would be deemed a
Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed properly to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost the right to seek appraisal with respect to any
Dissenting Shares, such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be treated as though
such Dissenting Shares had been converted into the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 1.14. The Company shall give Parent ( _i_ ) prompt notice
of any written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands,
and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law received by the
Company relating to stockholders rights of appraisal and ( _ii_ ) the
opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demand
for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to
any demands for appraisals of Dissenting Shares, offer to settle or settle
any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

ARTICLE II

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

Section 2.1 _Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint
a commercial bank or trust company to act as exchange agent hereunder for the
purpose of exchanging Certificates for the Merger Consideration (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "). At or  



 

17  prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent,
in trust for the benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock, an
amount of cash representing the aggregate Merger Consideration payable
pursuant to Section 1.14. Any cash deposited with the Exchange Agent shall
hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_."

Section 2.2 _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder
of record, as of the Effective Time, of a Certificate ( _i_ ) a letter of
transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which letter shall be in
customary form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify, and ( _ii_ ) instructions for effecting the surrender of such
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and
such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a
check in the amount equal to the Merger Consideration that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.14 and this Article
II. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable pursuant to
Section 1.14. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock
which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check in
the proper amount of any Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.14 may be
issued with respect to such Company Common Stock, as the case may be, to such
a transferee if the Certificate representing such shares of Company
Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.

Section 2.3 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger
Consideration paid upon conversion of shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of Article I and this Article II shall be deemed to
have been issued or paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
shares.

Section 2.4 _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for six months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or otherwise on the
instruction of Parent, and any holders of the Certificates who have not
theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent
for the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented thereby to which such holders are entitled pursuant
to Section 1.14. Any such portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by
holders of shares of Company Common Stock five years after the Effective Time
(or such earlier date immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity) shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.



 

18 Section 2.5 _No Liability_. None of Parent, Purchaser, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a
public official or Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. 

Section 2.6 _Investment of the Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest
any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent on a daily
basis; _provided_ that no such gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts
payable to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Article I or this
Article II. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall promptly be paid to Parent.

Section 2.7 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in
such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with
respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby.

Section 2.8 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation and
Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock or any other equity rights in the Company such amounts
as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
or any provision of state, local or non-U.S. Law. To the extent that amounts

ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data, and ( _B_ )
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal controls over
financial reporting. Other than as described in Part I, Item 4 of the

expected to be materially adverse to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, and ( _c_ ) other liabilities and obligations that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
materially adversely affect the ability of the Company to perform its
obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

resolved and fully paid. Neither the Company nor any of the Company

or a Company Subsidiary is required to file such Tax Returns or pay or remit
such type of Tax.

current use, occupancy or operation thereof.

Section 3.15 _Brokers_. No Person other than Allen and Co. (the " _Company
Financial Advisor_ ") is entitled to any brokerage, financial advisory,

30  or commission payable by the Company or any Company Subsidiary in connection
with the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.
The Company has furnished to Parent and Purchaser a true and complete copy of
each agreement between the Company or any Company Subsidiary and the Company

Section 3.16 _Employee Benefit Plans and Related Matters; ERISA_.

(a) Section 3.16(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete and
correct list of the Company Benefit Plans. With respect to each such Company
Benefit Plan, the Company has provided or made available to Parent a complete
and correct copy of such Company Benefit Plan, if written, or a description of
such Company Benefit Plan if not written, and to the extent applicable, ( _i_
) all trust agreements, insurance contracts or other funding arrangements, (
_ii_ ) the two most recent actuarial and trust reports for both ERISA funding
and financial statement purposes, ( _iii_ ) the two most recent Forms 5500
with all attachments required to have been filed with the IRS or the
Department of Labor or any similar reports filed with any comparable
governmental authority in any non-U.S. jurisdiction having jurisdiction over
any Company Benefit Plan and all schedules thereto, ( _iv_ ) the most recent
IRS determination letter, ( _v_ ) all current summary plan descriptions, (
_vi_ ) all material communications received from or sent to the IRS, the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or the Department of Labor (including a
written description of any oral communication), ( _vii_ ) any actuarial study
of any pension, disability, post-employment life or medical benefits provided
under any such Company Benefit Plan, ( _viii_ ) all current employee
handbooks and manuals, ( _ix_ ) statements or other communications regarding
withdrawal or other multiemployer plan liabilities (or similar liabilities
pertaining to any non-U.S. employee benefit plan sponsored by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, if any) and ( _x_ ) all amendments and modifications
to any such Company Benefit Plan or related document. None of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary has communicated to any current or former employee
thereof any intention or commitment to amend or modify any Company Benefit
Plan or to establish or implement any other employee or retiree benefit or
compensation plan or arrangement and, to the knowledge of the Company, no
such material communication has been made orally, other than, in each case,
amendments, modifications, establishments and implementations as would be
permitted after the date hereof pursuant to Section 5.1.

(b) _Qualification_. Each Company Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under
section 401(a) of the Code, and the trust (if any) forming a part thereof, is
so qualified and has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS,
or has pending or has time remaining in which to file, an application for such
determination from the Internal Revenue Service, and the Company is not aware
of any reason why any such determination letter should be revoked or not be
reissued. All amendments and actions required to bring each Company Benefit
Plan into conformity with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and
other applicable Law have been made or taken,  



 

31  except to the extent such amendments or actions are not required by law to
be made or taken until after the Closing Date. Each Company Benefit Plan has
been operated in all material respects in accordance with applicable Law. No
Company Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of section
4001(a)(3) of ERISA or is a "multiple employer plan" within the meaning
of section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has at any time during the last six years contributed to or been
obligated to contribute to any such plan. To the Companys knowledge, no
material events have occurred with respect to any Company Employee Plan that
could result in payment or assessment by or against the Company of any
material excise taxes under the Code.

(c) _Liability_. No Company Benefit Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA or
any of the minimum funding standards of ERISA or the Code. There has been no
event or circumstance that has resulted in any material liability to the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries under or pursuant to Title I or IV
of ERISA, the penalty, excise Tax or joint and several liability provisions of
the Code relating to employee benefit plans or any applicable provision
of Law in any jurisdiction outside of the United States. There has not been
any event or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to result in any
material liability (other than for the payment of benefits in the ordinary
course) in respect of the Company Benefit Plans. Except as is otherwise
reflected in the Financial Statements, there are no "unfunded benefits
liabilities" in respect of any Company Benefit Plan that is a defined benefit
or similar type plan. No Company Benefit Plan is a multiemployer plan (as
defined in section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) or a "multiple employer plan" within
the meaning of section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA. No Person is or will become
entitled to post-employment benefits of any kind by reason of employment with
or providing services to the Company or any Company Subsidiary other than
coverage mandated by section 4980B of the Code. Each Company Benefit Plan may
be amended or terminated after the Closing Date without material cost other
than for claims incurred prior to the date of such amendment or termination.

(d) _Acceleration or Increases in Compensation_. There is no contract,
agreement, plan or arrangement to which the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries is a party covering any employee, former employee, officer,
director, shareholder or contract worker of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, which, individually or collectively, either alone or in
combination with another event could give rise to the payment of any amount
that would not be deductible pursuant to Section 280G of the Code or
would otherwise result in the acceleration of payment of any benefits or an
increase in the amount of benefits (including any indemnity or redundancy pay)
payable, whether pursuant to the terms of any such Company Benefit Plan, at
Law, by contract or otherwise, as a result of the entering into, or the
consummation of the Transactions contemplated by, this Agreement.



 

32 (e) _Post-Employment Benefits_. No employee or former employee of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary is or may become entitled to post-employment
benefits of any kind by reason of his or her employment, including, death or
medical benefits (whether or not insured), other than ( _i_ ) coverage
provided pursuant to the terms of any Company Benefit Plan specifically set
forth in Section 3.16(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule or mandated by
section 4980B of the Code, or ( _ii_ ) retirement benefits payable under any
plan qualified under section 401(a) of the Code.

(f) _Deferred Compensation Arrangements_. Each Company Benefit Plan that is a
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1)
of the Code) has been operated since January 1, 2005 in good faith compliance
with Section 409A of the Code, and the Treasury regulations and IRS guidance
thereunder. Each Company Stock Option has been granted with an exercise price
no lower than "fair market value" (within the meaning of Sections 409A and 422
of the Code) as of the grant date of such option.

(g) _Independent Contractors_. The Company and each of the Company
Subsidiaries has properly classified all individuals (including
independent contractors and leased employees) under applicable Law, except
where failure to properly classify any such person would not result in
material employment or benefit liability to the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries. Any person (other than the non-employee members of the
Companys board of directors) providing services to the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries who has not been classified as an employee is not
eligible to participate in any Company Benefit Plan and is not entitled to
receive any benefits or other compensation under or pursuant to any such
Company Benefit Plan in respect of such non-employee service.

(h) _Claims and Actions_. There are no pending claims by or on behalf of any
of the Company Benefit Plans, by any employee or otherwise involving any such
plan or the assets of any plan (other than routine claims for benefits).
There is no action, suit, investigation, audit or proceeding pending against
or involving or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against or
involving, any Company Benefit Plan before any Governmental Entity.

Section 3.17 _Employees, Labor Matters_. Except as set forth in Section 3.17
of the Company Disclosure Letter, none of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is a party to or bound by any collective bargaining agreement, and
there are no labor unions or other organizations representing, purporting to
represent or attempting to represent any employees employed by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary. Since January 1, 2002, there has not occurred or, to
the knowledge of the Company, been threatened any material strike, slowdown,
picketing, work stoppage, concerted refusal to work overtime or other similar
labor activity or organizing campaign with respect to any employees of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary. Except as set forth in Section 3.17 of the
 



 

33  Company Disclosure Letter, there are no labor disputes currently subject to
any grievance procedure, arbitration or litigation and there is no
representation petition pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened with respect to any employee of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries. The Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries have complied
with all Laws pertaining to the employment or termination of employment of
their respective employees, including all such laws relating to labor
relations, equal employment, fair employment practices, prohibited
discrimination or distinction and other similar employment practices or acts,
except for any failure so to comply that, individually and in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to result in any material employment or
benefit liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

or any Company Subsidiary, to the extent recovery thereon is in excess of the
warranty accrual reflected in the most recent balance sheet of the Company
included in the Company SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof, would

Section 3.25 _Disclosure_. Neither this Agreement, including the Company
Disclosure Letter, nor any certificate or other document furnished by the
Company to Parent or Purchaser pursuant hereto, contains any untrue statement
of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the
statements contained herein and therein, when taken together as a whole, in
light of the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading. To the
knowledge of the Company, there is no fact (other than matters of a general
economic or political nature which do not affect the Company uniquely) which,

pursuant to which consideration is paid to such officer, director or employee
to be approved as an Employment Compensation Arrangement and to satisfy the
requirements of the non-exclusive safe-harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d)
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 6.4 _No Solicitation_.

(a) The Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any Company
Subsidiary or any of its or their respective Representatives to, directly or
indirectly ( _i_ ) initiate, solicit, knowingly facilitate or knowingly
encourage any inquiry or the making of any proposal that constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal (as defined in Section
6.4(f)), ( _ii_ ) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, merger agreement or other agreement, arrangement or
understanding relating to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to,
any Takeover Proposal, or ( _iii_ ) continue or otherwise participate in any

Parent or the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Offer,
the Merger or any other Transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to, but not after, the Acceptance Time,
the Company may, in response to a _bona fide_ written Takeover Proposal that
was unsolicited and did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section
6.4(a), and subject to compliance with Section 6.4(c):

(x) furnish information with respect to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to the Person making such Takeover Proposal and its
Representatives pursuant to and in accordance with a confidentiality
agreement containing terms and conditions no less restrictive than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, _provided_ that such
confidentiality agreement shall not contain any provisions that would prevent
the Company from complying with its obligation to provide the required
disclosure to Parent pursuant to Section 6.4(b), and _provided further_ , that
all such information provided to such Person has previously been provided to
Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or concurrently with the time it is
provided to such Person; and

(y) participate in discussions or negotiations with such Person and its
Representatives regarding such Takeover Proposal;

_provided_ , in each case, that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, by resolution duly adopted after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation, that ( _i_ ) the failure to furnish such information or
participate in such discussions or negotiations is reasonably likely to  



 

50  breach its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under
applicable Law, and ( _ii_ ) such Takeover Proposal would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal (as defined in Section 6.4(f)). The
Company shall ( _A_ ) immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons or their
Representatives conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to
any Takeover Proposal and will request the prompt return of any confidential
information previously furnished to such Persons in connection therewith, and
( _B_ ) use its reasonable best efforts promptly to inform its
Representatives of the obligations undertaken in this Section 6.4. Without
limiting the foregoing, any violation of the restrictions set forth in this
Section 6.4 by any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
whether or not such person is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.4 by
the Company.

(b) As promptly as practicable after the receipt by the Company of any
Takeover Proposal or any inquiry with respect to, or that could reasonably
be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal, and in any case within 24
hours after the receipt thereof, the Company shall provide oral and written
notice to Parent of ( _i_ ) such Takeover Proposal or inquiry, ( _ii_ ) the
identity of the Person making any such Takeover Proposal or inquiry, and (
_iii_ ) the material terms and conditions of any such Takeover Proposal or
inquiry (including any amendments or modifications thereto). The Company shall
keep Parent fully informed on a current basis of the status of any such
Takeover Proposal, including any changes to the terms and conditions thereof,
and promptly provide Parent with copies of all written correspondence or other
communications and other written materials, and summaries of all oral
correspondence or other communications, sent or provided to or by the Company
and its Representatives in connection with any Takeover Proposal.

(c) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall, directly or indirectly, ( _i_ ) effect a Change in the
Company Recommendation (subject to the next following sentence in this
Section 6.4(c)) or ( _ii_ ) approve any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, merger agreement or other agreement, arrangement or
understanding relating to, or that may reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to, but
not after, the Acceptance Time, the Board of Directors of the Company may, in
response to a Superior Proposal, effect a Change in the Company
Recommendation, _provided_ that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, by resolution duly adopted after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation, that the failure to do so is reasonably likely to
breach its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under
applicable Law, and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Board of Directors of
the Company may not effect such a Change in the Company Recommendation unless
( _i_ ) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have first provided prior
written notice to Parent that it is prepared to effect a Change in Company
Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal, which notice shall attach
 



 

51  the most current version of any written agreement relating to the
transaction that constitutes such Superior Proposal, and ( _ii_ ) Parent does
not make, within five Business Days after the receipt of such notice, a
proposal that the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, is
at least as favorable to the stockholders of the Company as such Superior
Proposal. The Company agrees that, during the five Business Day period prior
to its effecting a change in the Company Recommendation, the Company and its
Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent and its
Representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent.

(d) The Company agrees that it will deliver to Parent a new written notice of
Takeover Proposal with respect to each Takeover Proposal that has been
materially revised or modified prior to taking any action to recommend or
agreeing to recommend such Takeover Proposal to the stockholders of the
Company and that a new three Business Day period shall commence for purposes
of this Section 6.4 with respect to each such materially revised or modified
Takeover Proposal from the time Parent receives the written notice of the
Takeover Proposal with respect thereto.

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 6.4 shall prohibit the Company from
complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act in
respect of any Takeover Proposal or making any disclosure to the stockholders
of the Company if the Board of Directors determines in good faith, by
resolution duly adopted after consultation with its outside counsel, that the
failure to make such disclosure would breach its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, _provided_ ,  _however_
that neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall, except as expressly permitted by Section 6.4(c), effect a Change in
Company Recommendation or approve or recommend, or publicly propose
to approve or recommend, a Takeover Proposal.

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

" _Takeover Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer in respect of ( _i_ ) a
merger, consolidation, business combination, share exchange, reorganization,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction (including a
joint venture or licensing arrangement with similar effect) involving the
Company or any Company Subsidiary (any of the foregoing, a " _Business
Combination Transaction_ ") with any Person other than Parent, Purchaser or
any controlled Affiliate thereof (a " _Third Party_ "), ( _ii_ ) the Companys
acquisition of any Third Party in a Business Combination Transaction in which
the shareholders of the Third Party immediately prior to consummation of such
Business Combination Transaction will own 15% or more of the Companys
outstanding capital stock immediately following such Business Combination
Transaction, including the issuance by the Company of 15% or more of any class
of its voting equity securities as consideration for assets or securities of a
Third Party, or ( _iii_ ) any direct or indirect  



 

52  acquisition, whether by tender or exchange offer or otherwise, by any Third
Party of 15% or more of any class of capital stock of the Company or of 15%
or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, in a single transaction or a series of related transactions.

" _Superior Proposal_ " means any _bona fide_ written proposal or offer made
by a Third Party in respect of a Business Combination Transaction involving,
or any purchase or acquisition of, ( _i_ ) all or substantially all of the
voting power of the Companys capital stock or ( _ii_ ) all or substantially
all of the consolidated assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
which Business Combination Transaction or other purchase or acquisition
contains terms and conditions that the Board of Directors determines in good
faith, by resolution duly adopted after consultation with its outside counsel
and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, would result in
a transaction that ( _x_ ) if consummated, would be more favorable to the
stockholders of the Company than the Transactions, taking into account all of
the terms and conditions of such proposal and of this Agreement (including any
proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement), and ( _y_ ) is
reasonably capable of being consummated on the terms so proposed, taking into
account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal.

Section 6.5 _Employee Matters_.

(a) Until the first anniversary of the Effective Time (the " _Benefits
Continuation Period_ "), the Surviving Corporation shall provide, or cause to
be provided, for those employees of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries who continue as employees of the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation during the Benefits Continuation
Period, compensation and employee benefits that are substantially comparable
in the aggregate to those provided by the Company or the applicable Company
Subsidiary to such employees immediately before the date of this Agreement
(but excluding for all purposes, in each case, any Company equity-based or
long-term incentive plans or arrangements); _provided_ that ( _i_ ) with
respect to employees who are subject to collective bargaining or employment
agreements (including change in control agreements), compensation, benefits
and payments shall be provided in accordance with such agreements and ( _ii_
) during the Benefits Continuation Period, the Surviving Corporation shall pay
severance benefits to such Company employees in accordance with the terms of
the severance plans maintained by the Company and its subsidiaries
immediately prior to the date of this Agreement. The foregoing shall not be
construed or interpreted to restrict in any way the Surviving Corporations or
Parents ability to amend, modify or terminate any Company Benefit Plan or to
terminate any Persons employment at any time or for any reason.

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall ( _i_ ) waive any applicable pre-existing
condition exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage  



 

53  requirements in any replacement or successor welfare benefit plan of the
Surviving Corporation that an employee of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is eligible to participate in following the Effective Time to the
extent such exclusions or waiting periods were inapplicable to, or had been
satisfied by, such employee immediately prior to the Effective Time under the
relevant Company Benefit Plan in which such employee participated, ( _ii_ )
provide each such employee with credit for any insurance and deductible paid
prior to the Effective Time (to the same extent such credit was given under
the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying
any applicable deductible requirements or out-of-pocket limits and ( _iii_ )
recognize service prior to the Effective Time with the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting (but not
for any other purpose) to the same extent such service was recognized by the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries under any similar Company Benefit Plan in
which such employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time;
provided that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent it would result in
any duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

(c) With respect to matters described in this Section 6.5, the Company will
use all reasonable efforts to consult with Parent (and consider in good faith
the advice of Parent) prior to sending any notices or other communication
materials to its employees or former employees. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall provide Parent with reasonable access to such employees or
former employees for purposes of Parent providing notices or
other communication materials regarding Parent compensation and benefit plans
and the matters described in this Section 6.5; provided that such notices or
other communication materials are approved in advance by the Company, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(d) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall ( _i_ ) provide any and all
notices to, ( _ii_ ) make any and all filings or registrations with, and (
_iii_ ) obtain any and all consents or approvals of, any labor organization,
works council or any similar entity, council or organization, required to be
made or obtained in connection with this Agreement or the consummation of the
Transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 6.6 _Fees and Expenses_. Subject to Section 8.3, whether or not the

advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or
events that occurred on or before the Effective Time (including for acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions contemplated hereby); _provided_ , that in no

or procure such directors and officers insurance liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance immediately prior to the Effective Time.

by applicable law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of any securities exchange, consult with each other before issuing any
press release or, to the extent practical, otherwise making any public

commercially reasonable efforts to give prompt notice to Parent to the extent
that it acquires actual knowledge of ( _i_ ) the occurrence or non-occurrence
of any fact or event whose occurrence or non-occurrence, as the case may be,
reasonably would be likely to cause any Offer Condition to fail to be
satisfied at any time from the date of this Agreement to the Acceptance Time
(except to the extent any Offer Condition refers to a specific date), ( _ii_ )
the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence
of which would be reasonably likely to cause any representation or warranty
of the Company contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect as of the date hereof or as of the Closing Date and ( _iii_ )
any failure of the Company to comply with or timely satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder.
Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to give prompt notice to
Company to the extent that it acquires actual knowledge of ( _i_ ) the

Parent contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect as of the date hereof or as of the Closing Date and ( _ii_ ) any
failure of Parent or Purchaser to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder.

Section 6.9 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

Section 6.10 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "fair price," "business
combination" or "control share acquisition" statute or other similar statute
or regulation is or shall become applicable to the Transactions contemplated
hereby, Parent, the Company and their respective Boards of Directors shall use
all reasonable efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as are
necessary so that the Transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and shall otherwise
act to minimize the effects of any such statute or regulation on the
Transactions contemplated hereby.

61  incapable of being cured by Parent prior to the Initial Outside Date or is
not cured by the earlier of ( _x_ ) ten Business Days following
written notice to Parent by the Company of such breach and ( _y_ ) the
Initial Outside Date and ( _B_ ) would result in a failure of any condition
set forth in Sections 7.3(a) or (b); or

_provided_ , _however_ , that no party hereto shall be relieved or released
from any liability or damages arising from a willful breach of any provision
of this Agreement. 

Section 8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

(a) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to any of the following
provisions, the Company shall pay to Parent a fee equal to $10 million (the "
_Termination Fee_ "):

(i) Sections 8.1(c)(ii) or (iii);

(ii) Section 8.1(d)(ii);

(iii) Section 8.1(b)(ii), _provided_ that ( _A_ ) after the date of this
Agreement, any Person makes a Takeover Proposal or amends or reasserts a
Takeover Proposal made prior to the date of this Agreement and such Takeover
Proposal becomes publicly known prior to the earlier of the Acceptance Time
or the Expiration Date, and ( _B_ ) within 18 months after the date of such
termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement to consummate, or
consummates, the transactions contemplated by a Takeover Proposal; and 
_provided_ , _further_ , that, solely for purposes of this Section
8.3(a)(iii), the term "Takeover Proposal" shall have the meaning ascribed
thereto in Section 6.4(f), except that all references to 15% shall be changed

Termination Fee shall be payable immediately prior to termination of this
Agreement in the event of termination by the Company, and not later than one
Business Day after the receipt by the Company of a notice of termination from
Parent in the event of termination by Parent, in each case by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent (except
that, in the case of termination pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(ii), such payment
shall be made on the date of the first to occur of either of the events
referred to in clause (B) of Section 8.3(a)(iii)). If the Company is required
to pay Parent a Termination Fee, or this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 8.1(b)(ii) under the circumstances described in Section

within one Business Day of receipt of written notice from Parent requesting
payment thereof.

(c) The parties each agree that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3
are an integral part of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any amounts due under this
Section 8.3 and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that
results in a judgment against the Company for such amounts, the Company shall
pay interest on such amounts from the date payment of such amounts were due
to the date of actual payment at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on
the date such payment was due, together with the costs and expenses of Parent
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses) in connection with such suit.

64 Section 9.3 _Interpretation_.

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, Exhibits or
Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit or Schedule to
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever
the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement,
they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."

(b) Items disclosed on one particular Company Disclosure Schedule relating to
one section of this Agreement shall be deemed to be constructively disclosed
or listed on other Company Disclosure Schedules relating to other sections of
this Agreement only to the extent it is reasonably apparent on the face of
such other Company Disclosure Schedules that such disclosure is applicable to
such other Company Disclosure Schedules.

Section 9.4 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed in
two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but
all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement
shall become effective when each party hereto shall have received counterparts
thereof signed and delivered (by telecopy or otherwise) by all of the other
parties hereto.

Section 9.5 _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. 

(a) This Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto) and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

(b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each party hereto, and, except as provided in Section 6.7, nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person
not a party to this Agreement any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature
whatsoever.

Section 9.6 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any law or public
policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the Transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon such determination
that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of
being enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the Transactions contemplated
hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent
possible.



 

65 Section 9.7 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties,
in whole or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the
prior written consent of the other party, and any attempt to make any such
assignment without such consent shall be null and void, except that Purchaser
may assign, in its sole discretion, any or all of its rights, interests and
obligations under this Agreement to any direct wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent without the consent of the Company, but no such assignment shall
relieve Purchaser of any of its obligations under this Agreement. Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective
successors and assigns.

Section 9.8 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties, by
action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any
time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the
Merger by the stockholders of the Company and Parent, but, after any such

rules of any relevant stock exchange requires further approval by such
stockholders without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties. 

Section 9.9 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of

performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties, (
_b_ ) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and ( _c_ ) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such
party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights
under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those
rights. 

Section 9.10 _GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_.

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE
INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF

the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and of
the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the
Transactions contemplated hereby, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert,
as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or
enforcement hereof or of any such document, that it is not subject thereto or
that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable
in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this
Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and
the parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims with respect to such
action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in such a New York State,
Delaware State or Federal court. The parties hereby consent to and grant any
such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties solely for such
purpose and over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of
process or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in
the manner provided in Section 9.2 or in such other manner as may be permitted
by law shall be valid and sufficient service thereof.

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
