1.03 _Equity Awards_.

 

(a) Each Seller Stock Option, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding
and unexercised immediately prior to the Closing shall, effective as of the
Closing, become fully vested and shall remain outstanding in accordance with
its terms. Seller shall retain all Liabilities and obligations in respect of
all Seller Stock Options, including all responsibility for
the administration, exercise and settlement of such Seller Stock Options in
accordance with the terms of the applicable Seller Equity Plan, and any tax
withholding, payroll tax or other tax obligations that arise in connection
with any such exercise or settlement.

(b) At the Closing, each Seller RSU Award, or portion thereof, that is held by
an Employee and is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the Closing
shall, without any further action on the part of any holder thereof, be
substituted for a cash-settled restricted stock unit award with respect to
Purchaser Common Stock (or, in the case of any Seller RSU Award held by an
Employee located in a non-U.S. jurisdiction, a stock-settled Purchaser RSU
Award, if determined by Purchaser in its discretion following the date of this
Agreement in accordance with _Section_ _ _ _4.09(f)_ of the
Disclosure Schedules) (a " _Purchaser RSU Award_ ") as follows:

(i) The number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock subject to each Purchaser
RSU Award shall be equal to the product (rounded up to the nearest whole share
unless otherwise agreed by Seller and Purchaser) of (A) the number of shares
of Seller Common Stock subject to the corresponding Seller RSU Award
immediately prior to the Closing and (B) the Purchaser Ratio; _provided_ that,
with respect to any Seller RSU Award that is subject to performance-based
vesting (A) with respect to any performance year that includes the
Closing Date, the number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock subject to each
Purchaser RSU Award shall be based on target-level performance, and such
Purchaser RSU Awards shall not be subject to performance-based vesting
criteria for such performance year, and (B) with respect to any performance
year that commences after the Closing Date, Purchaser or its Affiliates shall
establish the applicable performance goals following the Closing.

 

(ii) Except as set forth in this _Section_ _ _ _1.03(b)_ , each Purchaser RSU
Award shall be subject to the same terms (including, with respect to
performance-based vesting Purchaser RSU Awards, the same potential number of
shares that were subject to the Seller RSU Award, as adjusted under this
_Section_ _ _ _1.03_ ), vesting conditions, settlement dates and other terms
and conditions that were in effect immediately prior to the Closing for the
corresponding Seller RSU Award. With respect to each Purchaser RSU Award,

1.04 _Purchase Price Adjustments_.

 

(a) _Equity Award Adjustment Amount_. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Equity Award Adjustment Amount_ " means an amount (positive or negative)
equal to the product of (a) the difference of (i) the Seller Closing Equity
Award Value minus (ii) the Seller Pre-Signing Equity Award Value, multiplied
by (b) sixty percent (60%). If the Equity Award Adjustment Amount is a
positive number, the Estimated Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount
of the Equity Award Adjustment Amount on a dollar-for-dollar basis pursuant to
_Section_ _ _ _1.01_ _(_ _b)_. If the Equity Award Adjustment Amount is a
negative number, the Estimated Purchase Price shall be increased by the
absolute value of the amount of the Equity Award Adjustment Amount on a
dollar-for-dollar basis pursuant to  _Section_ _ _ _1.01_ _(_ _b_ _)_.

(b) _Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount_. At least five (5) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser a
statement (the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ ") setting forth SellerÂ’s good
faith estimate of, as of the open of business on the Closing Date (assuming
completion of the Reorganization Transactions), (i) the Net Working Capital
(the " _Estimated Net Working Capital_ "), (ii) the amount of Cash and the
amount of Adjusted Cash (such estimated amount of Adjusted Cash, the "
_Estimated Cash_ "), (iii) the amount of Debt (the " _Estimated Debt_ ") and
(iv) the amount of Transaction Expenses (the " _Estimated Transaction
Expenses_ "), along with reasonable supporting documentation with respect to
the calculation of such amounts. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Estimated
Closing Adjustment Amount_ " means an amount (positive or negative) equal to
the Estimated Net Working Capital, minus the Target Working Capital, plus the
Estimated Cash, minus the Estimated Debt, minus the Estimated Transaction
Expenses. If the Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount is a positive number, the
Estimated Purchase Price shall be calculated by adding the amount of the
Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount to the Base Purchase Price on a dollar-
for-dollar basis pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _1.01_ _(_ _c)_. If the Estimated
Closing Adjustment Amount is a negative number, the Estimated Purchase Price
shall be calculated by subtracting the absolute value of the amount of the
Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount from the Base Purchase Price on a dollar-
for-dollar basis pursuant to  _Section_ _ _ _1.01_ _(_ _c_ _)_. The Estimated
Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis
that is consistent with past practices and prior periods and the accounting
principles, practices, procedures, policies and methods set forth on
_Exhibit_ _ _ _C_ ; _provided_ , that in the event of any conflict between
GAAP and the sample calculation set forth on _Exhibit C_ , _Exhibit C_ shall
govern. 

(c) _Post-Closing Statement_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Closing Date (but not later than ninety (90) days thereafter), Purchaser will
prepare and deliver to Seller a statement (the " _Post-Closing Statement_ ")
setting forth, as of the open of business on the Closing Date (assuming
completion of the Reorganization Transactions), (i) the Net Working Capital
(the " _Closing Net Working Capital_ "), (ii) the amount of Cash and the
amount of Adjusted Cash (such amount of Adjusted Cash, the " _Closing Cash_
"), (iii) the amount of Debt (the " _Closing Debt_ ") and (iv) the amount of
Transaction Expenses (the " _Closing Transaction Expenses_ "), along with
reasonable supporting documentation with respect to the calculation of such
amounts. The Post-Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with

 



-4- ##### Table of Contents

  

 GAAP applied on a basis that is consistent with past practices and prior
periods and the accounting principles, practices, procedures, policies and
methods set forth on  _Exhibit_ _ _ _C_ ; _provided_ , that in the event of
any conflict between GAAP and the sample calculation set forth on _Exhibit C_
, _Exhibit C_ shall govern. In preparation of the Post-Closing
Statement, Purchaser and its Representatives shall have the access afforded
to them pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _4.10(b)_.

(d)  _Dispute Notice_. In its review of the Post-Closing Statement, Seller
and its Representatives shall have the access afforded to them pursuant to
_Section_ _ _ _4.10(b)_. The Post-Closing Statement shall be binding and
conclusive upon, and deemed accepted by, Seller unless Seller shall have
notified Purchaser in writing (the " _Dispute Notice_ ") of any objections
thereto consistent with the provisions of this  _Section_ _ _ _1.04(d)_
within forty-five (45) calendar days after the delivery of the Post-Closing
Statement to Seller. The Dispute Notice shall specify in reasonable detail
each item on the Post-Closing Statement that Seller disputes and SellerÂ’s
calculation of each such item. Any item not included as disputed in such
notice shall be deemed accepted by Seller and Purchaser.

 

(e) _Disputes_. Disputes between Purchaser and Seller relating to the Post-
Closing Statement that cannot be resolved by Purchaser and Seller within
fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt by Purchaser of the Dispute Notice,
or such longer period as Seller and Purchaser shall mutually agree in writing,
may be submitted, by notice from Seller or Purchaser to the other,
for resolution to KPMG LLP or any other nationally recognized independent
accounting firm selected jointly by Purchaser and Seller (the " _Independent
Accounting Firm_ "). Each of Purchaser and Seller shall submit to the
Independent Accounting Firm (with a copy delivered to the other party hereto
on the same day), within ten (10) Business Days after the date of engagement
of the Independent Accounting Firm, a memorandum (which may include supporting
exhibits) setting forth their respective positions in any disputed items.
Each of Purchaser and Seller may (but shall not be required to) submit to the
Independent Accounting Firm (with a copy delivered to the other party hereto
on the same day), within forty-five (45) days after the date of the
engagement of the Independent Accounting Firm, a memorandum responding to the
initial memorandum submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm by the other
party hereto. Unless requested by the Independent Accounting Firm in writing,
no party hereto may present any additional information or arguments to the
Independent Accounting Firm, either orally or in writing. During the review by
the Independent Accounting Firm, Purchaser and Seller and their respective
accountants will each make available to the Independent Accounting Firm such
personnel, and such information, books and records and work papers and
otherwise cooperate in good faith with the Independent Accounting Firm, as may
be reasonably required by the Independent Accounting Firm to fulfill its
obligations under this _Section_ _ _ _1.04_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the accountants of Seller or Purchaser shall not be obliged to make any
work papers available to the Independent Accounting Firm, except in
accordance with such accountantsÂ’ normal disclosure procedures and then only
after the Independent Accounting Firm has signed a customary agreement
relating to such access to work papers in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to such accountants.

(f) _Independent Accounting Firm_ _Â’_ _s Determination_. The Independent
Accounting Firm shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator. Promptly, but
no later than ninety (90) days after its acceptance of its appointment as the
Independent Accounting Firm, the Independent Accounting Firm shall determine,
based solely on the written submissions of

 



-5- ##### Table of Contents

  

 Purchaser and Seller and not by independent review, those items in dispute
on the Post-Closing Statement and shall render a written report as to the
resolution of each dispute and the resulting calculation of the Final Closing
Adjustment Amount. Any such determination of an item in dispute shall be (i)
with respect to Cash (including Adjusted Cash) and Net Working Capital,
neither lower than the amount specified by Purchaser in the Post-Closing
Statement nor higher than the amount specified by Seller in the Dispute Notice
and (ii) with respect to Debt and Transaction Expenses, neither higher than
the amount specified by Purchaser in the Post-Closing Statement nor lower
than the amount specified by Seller in the Dispute Notice. The Independent
Accounting Firm shall have exclusive jurisdiction over, and resort to the
Independent Accounting Firm as provided in this _Section_ _ _ _1.04(f)_
 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties hereto against one
another or any other Person with respect to, any disputes arising out of or
relating to the Post-Closing Statement and shall be enforceable in a court of
law. The substance of the Independent Accounting FirmÂ’s determination shall
not be subject to review or appeal, absent a showing of fraud. The fee of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by Seller and
fifty percent (50%) by Purchaser.

(g) _Final Closing Adjustment Amount_. The Post-Closing Statement shall become
final and binding upon Purchaser and Seller upon the earliest of (i) the
failure by Seller to object thereto within the period permitted under, and
otherwise in accordance with the requirements of, _Section_ _ _ _1.04(d)_ (it
being understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that Seller and Purchaser shall
be deemed to have agreed upon all items and amounts that are not disputed by
Seller in the Dispute Notice), (ii) the written agreement between Purchaser
and Seller with respect thereto and (iii) the decision by the Independent
Accounting Firm with respect to disputes under _Section_ _ _ _1.04(f)_. The
Post-Closing Statement, as deemed to be agreed pursuant to clause (i) above,
or as adjusted pursuant to the written agreement of Purchaser and Seller or
the decision of the Independent Accounting Firm, when final and binding, is
referred to herein as the " _Final Post-Closing Statement_." The " _Final
Closing Adjustment Amount_ " determined using the Final Post-Closing
Statement means an amount equal to the Closing Net Working Capital, minus the
Target Working Capital, plus the Closing Cash, minus the Closing Debt, minus
the Closing Transaction Expenses. The Estimated Purchase Price shall be
either (1) decreased by the amount, if any, by which the Final Closing
Adjustment Amount is less than the Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount, or (2)
increased by the amount, if any, by which the Final Closing Adjustment Amount
is greater than the Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount. Any adjustment to the
Estimated Purchase Price provided for in this _Section_ _ _ _1.04(g)_ is
referred to as the " _Purchase Price Adjustment_."

(h) If the Final Closing Adjustment Amount is greater than the Estimated
Closing Adjustment Amount, Purchaser shall, within five (5) Business Days
after the Final Closing Adjustment Amount is determined and the Final Post-
Closing Statement becomes final and binding, pay or cause to be paid, to
Seller cash in the amount of such Purchase Price Adjustment. If the Final
Closing Adjustment Amount is less than the Estimated Closing Adjustment
Amount, Seller shall, within five (5) Business Days after the Final Closing
Adjustment Amount is determined and the Final Post-Closing Statement becomes
final and binding, pay or cause to be paid, to Purchaser cash in the amount
of such Purchase Price Adjustment.

(i) Payments made under  _Section_ _ _ _1.04(h)_ shall be adjustments to the
Purchase Price for all purposes.

1.05 _Withholding_.

 

(a) Purchaser and each of its Affiliates shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making
of such payment under any applicable Tax Law. To the extent that Purchaser or
a Purchaser Designee determines that any such withholding is required with
respect to any payment hereunder, Purchaser shall notify Seller no less than
fifteen (15) Business Days prior to making such payment, and Purchaser and
Seller shall cooperate (and Purchaser shall cause any Purchaser Designee to
cooperate) in good faith to take such commercially reasonable actions as may
be necessary to minimize any such withholding. To the extent that any amounts
are deducted or withheld pursuant to this _Section 1.05_ , such amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the

Material Contract or counterparty thereto and (y) neither Seller nor any of

required in connection with the consummation of the Transactions, the
Business Subsidiaries (for the avoidance of doubt, including (if applicable)
SaleCo2 and its Subsidiaries) (after giving effect to the Reorganization
Transactions (including the transactions contemplated by Section 1.7 of the
Reorganization Agreement)) will have substantially the same rights and

respect to the Business immediately following the Closing as Seller and
the Business Subsidiaries had immediately prior to consummation of the

2.25 _Insurance_. Seller and the Business Subsidiaries maintain insurance in
such amounts and against such risks in all material respects as is customary
for the industries in which Seller (to the extent related to the Business) and
the Business Subsidiaries operate and as the management of Seller has in good
faith determined to be reasonable. Except as would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Business Material Adverse Effect,
all material insurance policies maintained by or on behalf of Seller (to
the extent related to the Business) and the Business Subsidiaries are in full
force and effect, all premiums and other payments due on such policies have
been paid by Seller and the Business Subsidiaries and all claims thereunder
have been filed in due and timely fashion.

2.26 _Disclaimer_. Except as set forth in this _Article II_ or the
other Transaction Documents, none of Seller, its Affiliates or any of its

SellerÂ’s post-Closing operations or otherwise in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice in all material respects;

 

(q) make any election pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701-3(c),
or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law, with respect to
the Company or any Business Subsidiary, other than any such election for
SaleCo2 required by the Reorganization Agreement;

 

(r) enter into any new line of business that is materially different from the
existing lines of business of the Business; or

 

(s) announce an intention to enter into, authorize or enter into, or permit
any of its Subsidiaries to authorize or enter into, any written agreement or
otherwise make any commitment to contravene the foregoing.

Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to give Purchaser, directly
or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Business or the Business
SubsidiariesÂ’ operations prior to the Closing. Prior to the Closing, Seller
shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
complete control and supervision over the Business SubsidiariesÂ’ operations.

4.02  _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Stockholders Â’ Meeting_.

(a) Subject to PurchaserÂ’s timely performance of its obligations under
_Section 4.02(b)_ , Seller shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement, prepare and cause to be filed with the
SEC in preliminary form the Proxy Statement. Subject to the ability of
the board of directors of Seller to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in
accordance with _Section 4.06_, the board of directors of Seller shall
include the Seller Recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Seller shall
promptly notify Purchaser upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or
the staff of the SEC or any request from the SEC or the staff of the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement, and shall provide Purchaser
with copies of all correspondence between Seller and its Representatives, on
the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand. Seller
shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) respond as promptly as reasonably
practicable to any comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect
to the Proxy Statement, (ii) have the Proxy Statement cleared by the staff of
the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable after such filing and (iii) cause
the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders as promptly
as practicable thereafter. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the
Proxy Statement, or response to SEC comments with respect thereto, will be
made by Seller without providing Purchaser a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment thereon, which comments to Seller shall consider in good faith;
_provided_ , that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to a Superior
Proposal or an Adverse Recommendation Change. If at any time prior to the
Closing any event or circumstance relating to Seller or any of the Business
Subsidiaries or its or their respective officers or directors should be
discovered by Seller which, pursuant to the Exchange Act, should be set forth
in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement, Seller shall promptly
inform Purchaser. Each of Seller and Purchaser agrees to promptly correct any
information provided by such party for use in the Proxy Statement which shall
have become false or misleading.

(b) Purchaser shall provide to Seller all information concerning Purchaser and
its Affiliates as may be reasonably requested by Seller in connection with
the Proxy Statement and shall otherwise assist and cooperate with Seller in
the preparation of the Proxy Statement and resolution of comments of the SEC
or its staff related thereto. Purchaser will cause the information relating
to Purchaser and its Affiliates supplied by it for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement, at the time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement or any amendments
or supplements thereto, and at the time of the StockholdersÂ’ Meeting, not to
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

(c) In accordance with SellerÂ’s Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws, applicable Law and the rules
of Nasdaq, Seller shall, as promptly as practicable, establish a record date
for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders
(the " _Stockholders Â’ Meeting_"), for the purpose of obtaining the Seller
Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , that if Seller determines that it is
necessary or advisable to do so, Seller, at the StockholdersÂ’ Meeting, may
also seek stockholder approval for actions reasonably necessary to comply
with the requirements of the Investment Company Act following SellerÂ’s
registration as a registered investment company at or after the Closing.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Seller may
postpone or adjourn the StockholdersÂ’ Meeting (i) for up to ten (10) Business
Days to solicit additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining the Seller
Stockholder Approval, if Seller determines in good faith such postponement or
adjournment is necessary or advisable to obtain the Seller Stockholder
Approval, (ii) for the absence of quorum and (iii) to allow reasonable
additional time for the filing and/or mailing of any supplemental or amended
disclosure which Seller has determined after consultation with outside legal
counsel is necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended
disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the stockholders of Seller prior
to the StockholdersÂ’ Meeting.

4.03 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing (or until the earlier termination
of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 6.01_), upon reasonable
notice, Seller shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable: (i) afford
Purchaser and its Representatives reasonable access to the personnel,
properties and Books and Records of the Business; and (ii) furnish to
Purchaser and its Representatives such additional Tax and operating data and
other information regarding the Business (or copies thereof) as Purchaser may
from time to time reasonably request (including, in the case of each clause
(i) and (ii), furnishing such access and information as may be reasonably
requested by Purchaser in order to (x) determine the Foreign Sale Purchase
Price or prepare the PurchaserÂ’s Allocation or (y) identify the Section
338(h)(10) Subsidiaries or determine whether to make any elections under
Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereunder and by the Reorganization Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ , that
any such access or furnishing of information shall be conducted
at PurchaserÂ’s expense, during normal business hours, under the supervision
of Seller or its

 



-36- ##### Table of Contents

  

 Representatives and in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with
the normal operations of the business of Seller or the Business Subsidiaries;
_provided_ , _further_ , that neither Seller nor any of the Business
Subsidiaries shall be required to disclose any information to Purchaser if
such disclosure would, in SellerÂ’s reasonable judgment (after consulting with
its outside legal counsel): (w) contain information that in the reasonable,
good faith judgment of Seller is competitively sensitive; (x) jeopardize any
attorney-client or other legal privilege or the protections of the work
product doctrine; (y) contravene any applicable Laws, fiduciary duty
or Contract to which Seller or any of the Business Subsidiaries is a party;
or (z) expose Seller or any of the Business Subsidiaries to risk of liability
for disclosure of sensitive or personal information; _provided_ that, in any
such case, Seller or the applicable Business Subsidiaries shall provide such
information in redacted form as necessary to preserve such privilege or
protections or comply with such Law or Contract or otherwise make appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements, to the extent practicable.

(b) The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of March 22, 2016,
between Seller and Purchaser (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), shall
continue in full force and effect (including with respect to any information
provided to Purchaser pursuant to _Section 4.03(a)_ ) until the Closing, at
which time such Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate, other than with
respect to the confidentiality and non-use obligations contained therein with
respect to Evaluation Material (as defined therein) not related to the
Business, which obligations shall continue in full force and effect for a
period of five (5) years from the Closing Date. If this Agreement is, for any
reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect in all respects. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the parties agree and acknowledge that the standstill
and similar restrictions in the Confidentiality Agreement shall not apply upon
the execution and delivery of this Agreement solely to the extent required to
permit any action expressly contemplated hereby and in accordance herewith and
solely until any valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms.

 

(c) For a period of five (5) years from the Closing Date ( _provided_ , that
with respect to trade secrets of the Business, the confidentiality
obligations in this _Section 4.03(c)_ shall remain in effect for so long as
the relevant information remains a trade secret under applicable Law), Seller
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, hold in confidence any nonpublic
information (" _Business Information_ ") to the extent relating to the
Business from and after the Closing; _provided_ that the foregoing restriction
shall not apply to information that (i) is or becomes generally available to
the public other than through an action or inaction by Seller or its
Representatives in breach of the terms of this Agreement, (ii) is received by
Seller or its Representatives from Purchaser or any of its Representatives in
the ordinary course of business pursuant to commercial or business
arrangements unrelated to the Transactions (but such information shall remain
subject to the confidentiality restrictions governing such relationship),
(iii) is received by Seller or its Representatives from a source other than
Purchaser or any of its Representatives, or (iv) was independently developed
by Seller or its Representatives without use of Business Information;
_provided_ that, in the case of clause (iii) above, the source of such
information was not to the knowledge of Seller (after due inquiry) bound by a
confidentiality agreement with or other contractual, legal or fiduciary
obligation of confidentiality to Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to such information. In the event that Seller or any of its
Representatives are requested or required by Law to disclose any of the
Business Information

 



-37- ##### Table of Contents

  

 other than as expressly permitted under the terms of this Agreement, Seller
or such Representative will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
promptly notify Purchaser of any such request or requirement so that
Purchaser may, at its election (at PurchaserÂ’s expense), seek a protective
order or other appropriate remedy as Purchaser, in its sole discretion, deems
appropriate. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prevent Seller or
its Representatives, as the case may be, from complying with applicable Law
that seeks disclosure of the Business Information if: (i) a motion for a
protective order, motion to quash and/or other motion that was filed to
prevent the production or disclosure of the Business Information has been
denied; and (ii) SellerÂ’s legal counsel has advised Seller that compliance is
required by applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller disclose only
that portion of the Business Information that SellerÂ’s or its
RepresentativesÂ’ legal counsel advises Seller or such Representative is
required by applicable Law to be disclosed and that Seller and its
Representatives will exercise commercially reasonable efforts to preserve the
confidentiality of the remainder of the Business Information, including by
providing Purchaser, if permitted by Law, advance written notice of the
information to be disclosed as far in advance of its disclosure as
practicable, and reasonably cooperating with Purchaser to obtain an
appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential
treatment will be afforded the information so disclosed; or (iii) Purchaser
consents in writing to having the Business Information produced or disclosed.
In no event shall Seller, or any of its Representatives, oppose an action by
Purchaser to obtain a protective order, motion to quash and/or other relief to
prevent the production or disclosure of the Business Information or to obtain
an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential
treatment will be afforded the information so disclosed.

 

4.04 _Reorganization Transactions_. In furtherance and not in limitation of
_Section 4.05(a)_ , Seller shall, and shall cause the Business Subsidiaries
to, use reasonable best efforts to complete the Reorganization Transactions,
subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Reorganization Agreement and applicable Law. Seller shall provide Purchaser
information regarding the Reorganization Transactions in accordance with
_Section 4.03(a)_ and keep Purchaser reasonably informed on a timely basis
with respect to all material activity concerning the status of the
Reorganization Transactions. Seller will not (i) terminate the Reorganization
Agreement, (ii) amend the Reorganization Agreement in any manner that is or
could reasonably be expected to be adverse to the Business Subsidiaries, the
Business, Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (including from a Tax
perspective or otherwise), or the Transactions ( _provided_ , that, if such
adverse impact is reasonably expected to be only _de minimis_ in nature, then
PurchaserÂ’s prior written consent shall not be required so long as Seller
shall have consulted in good faith with Purchaser in advance) or (iii) permit
the (A) extension of the time for the performance of any obligation or other
act of either Seller or the Company thereunder, (B) waiver of any inaccuracy
in the representations and warranties of Seller contained therein or in any
document delivered pursuant thereto or (C) waiver of compliance with any
agreement or condition contained therein in any manner that is or could
reasonably be expected to be adverse to the Business Subsidiaries, the
Business, Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (including from a Tax
perspective or otherwise), or the Transactions (provided, that, if such
adverse impact is reasonably expected to be only _de minimis_ in nature, then
PurchaserÂ’s prior written consent shall not be required so long as Seller
shall have consulted in good faith with Purchaser in advance), in the cases of
clauses (i) through (iii), without PurchaserÂ’s prior written consent. Seller
shall provide Purchaser with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
all substantive documentation relating to the Reorganization Transactions.

4.05 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Regulatory and Other Consents_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each of Seller and
Purchaser will cooperate with each other and use their respective reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause
to be done, and to assist and cooperate with each other in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to (a) consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby as soon as practicable, (b) cause the
conditions to the consummation of the Closing set forth in _Article V_ to be
satisfied and (c) obtain or deliver all Consents of all
Governmental Authorities and Third Parties that may be or become necessary,
proper or advisable for the performance of its and the other partyÂ’s
obligations pursuant to this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither Seller
nor any of the Business Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any consent or
other similar fee, "profit sharing" or other similar payment or other
consideration, or the provision of additional security (including a guaranty)
to obtain the Consent of any Person under any Contract. For the avoidance of
doubt, obtaining the Consents described in the first sentence of this _Section
4.05(a)_ is not a condition to the consummation of the Closing by virtue of
this _Section 4.05(a)_.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Seller
and Purchaser (i) agrees to (x) make an appropriate filing of a Notification
and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Sale as promptly
as reasonably practicable and in any event, unless otherwise agreed by Seller
and Purchaser, within fifteen (15) Business Days after the date hereof, (y)
effect all other necessary notifications or registrations under the Antitrust
Laws as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, and (z)
supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act or any
other filing under the Antitrust Laws and use their reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all other actions consistent with this _Section
4.05_ necessary to obtain all Consents under any Antitrust Law as soon as
practicable and (ii) shall use its reasonable best efforts to (x) take all
action necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar Law is
or becomes applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(y) if any state takeover statute or similar Law becomes applicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (with respect to
PurchaserÂ’s obligations under this clause (b), to the extent caused by the
actions of Purchaser), take all action necessary to ensure that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise
minimize the effect of such Law on the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(c) If any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby under the Antitrust Laws of any applicable jurisdictions
or if any Action is instituted or threatened by any Governmental Authority or
any private party challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as
violative of the Antitrust Laws of any applicable jurisdictions, each of
Seller and Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly resolve
such objections and Actions. In furtherance of the foregoing, Purchaser, at
PurchaserÂ’s sole cost, shall and shall cause its Affiliates to, promptly take
any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment
and obtain all Consents under any Antitrust Law that may be required by
any Governmental Authority (and to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of or vacate or lift, any Governmental Order, that would otherwise
have the effect of

 



-39- ##### Table of Contents

  

 preventing or materially delaying the consummation of the Closing) so as to
enable Purchaser and Seller to consummate the Closing as promptly as
practicable, and in any event before the Outside Date, including committing
to or effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders, trust, or otherwise,
(i) the sale or disposition of, or prohibition or limitation on the ownership
or operation by Purchaser and the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries of specific assets or categories of assets or businesses; (ii)
the amendment or termination of existing contracts, licenses or other
relationships; (iii) the entering into of new contracts, licenses or
other relationships; and (iv) behavioral commitments limiting or modifying
PurchaserÂ’s or any of its AffiliatesÂ’ rights of ownership in, or ability to
conduct the business of, one or more of its operations, divisions, businesses,
product lines or assets. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Seller nor
any of the Business Subsidiaries shall be required to commit to or effect any
such action that is not conditioned upon the substantially concurrent
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall not effect or
commit to effect any such action without PurchaserÂ’s prior written consent.
Further, and for the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser will take any and all
actions necessary in order to ensure that (x) no requirement for any non-
action by or Consent of any Governmental Authority with respect to any
Antitrust Laws, (y) no Governmental Order with respect to any Antitrust Laws
and (z) no other matter relating to any Antitrust Laws would
preclude consummation of the Sale by the Outside Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything to the contrary contained herein, nothing in this
Agreement shall require Purchaser (or permit Seller, without PurchaserÂ’s prior
written consent) to take or agree or commit to take any action, or agree to
any condition or restriction or other mitigation, whether contemplated in this
_Section 4.05_ or otherwise, involving Seller, Purchaser or their respective
Subsidiaries, including the Business, that would have, or would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect
on Purchaser or the Business, in each case measured on a scale relative to the
Business, taken as a whole, regardless of whether any such action, condition,
restriction or mitigation is in respect of Seller, Purchaser or their
respective Subsidiaries or the Business (any of the foregoing, a " _Burdensome
Condition_ ").

 

(d) Each of Seller and Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and in connection with any investigation or
other inquiry by or before a Governmental Authority relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any inquiry,
investigation or Action initiated by a Governmental Authority or a private
Person, and (ii) keep the other party hereto informed in all material respects
and on a reasonably timely basis of any communication received by such party
from, or given by such party to, any Governmental Authority and of any
communication received or given by a private Person in connection with any
inquiry, investigation or Action, in each case regarding any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, each of Seller and Purchaser shall consult and
cooperate with the other party hereto in connection with any analysis,
appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal to
be made or submitted in connection with any such inquiry, investigation or
Action. In addition, Seller and Purchaser shall permit counsel for the other
party reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good faith
the views of the other party in connection with, any proposed written
communication to any Governmental Authority. Each of Seller and
Purchaser agrees not to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion,
either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental

 



-40- ##### Table of Contents

  

 Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent not
prohibited by such Governmental Authority, gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate. Neither Seller nor Purchaser shall
consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period
or to any voluntary delay of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or withdraw its notification and
report form pursuant to the HSR Act or any other filing made pursuant to any
Antitrust Law unless the other party has given its prior written consent to
such extension or delay, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. Purchaser and Seller may, as each deems proper, necessary or
advisable, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided
to the other under this _Section 4.05_ as "outside counsel only." Such
materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the
outside antitrust counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless
express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials or
its legal counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
4.05_, materials provided to the other party or its outside counsel may be
redacted to remove references concerning the valuation, pricing and other
competitively sensitive terms from an antitrust perspective in the Contracts
of Purchaser, Seller and their respective Subsidiaries.

 

4.06 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement (and subject to _Section
4.06(c)_), Seller shall, shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective directors, officers, and employees to, and shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause its and their respective other Representatives to, (i)
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing solicitation of,
or discussions or negotiations with, any Third Party relating to any
Competing Proposal or any inquiry, discussion, offer or request that would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal, (ii) request the
prompt return from, or destruction by, all such Third Parties of all copies
of confidential information previously provided to such Third Parties by
Seller, its Subsidiaries or their Representatives in connection therewith and
(iii) terminate access to any physical or electronic data rooms relating to a
possible Competing Proposal.

(b) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement (including 
_Section 4.06(c)_), from and after the date of this Agreement until the
Closing or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms, Seller shall not, shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective directors, officers, and employees not to, and shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective other
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit or
knowingly facilitate or encourage the making of any Competing Proposal or any
inquiries regarding, or the submission of any proposal or offer that
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to any Competing
Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in negotiations or discussions with (it
being understood that, in response to an inquiry, Seller may inform Persons
of the provisions of this _Section 4.06_), or furnish any material non-public
information to, any Third Party relating to a Competing Proposal or any
inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing
Proposal, (iii) approve, authorize, endorse, declare advisable, adopt, enter
into or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, authorize, endorse, declare
advisable, adopt, enter into or recommend any Competing Proposal or any

acquisition agreement, merger agreement, or other agreement providing for or
constituting any

 Competing Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) (a "
_Company Acquisition Agreement_ "), or (iv) resolve, agree or publicly propose
to do any of the foregoing; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the board of directors of Seller determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such
action could reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directorsÂ’
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, Seller shall be permitted to grant a
waiver of or terminate any "standstill" or similar obligation of any Third
Party with respect to Seller or any of the Business Subsidiaries to allow
such Third Party to submit a Competing Proposal, in which case Seller shall
similarly waive or terminate any "standstill" or similar obligations
applicable to Purchaser and its Affiliates contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
after the date of this Agreement and prior to the date that the Seller
Stockholder Approval is obtained, in the event that Seller (or its
Representatives on SellerÂ’s behalf) receives a written Competing Proposal from
any Third Party that did not result from a material breach of this _Section
4.06_, (i) Seller and its Representatives, to the extent such clarification is
reasonably necessary, may contact such Third Party solely to request and
obtain clarification of the terms and conditions thereof (without the board
of directors of Seller being required to make a determination under clause
(ii) of this _Section 4.06(c)_ ) and (ii) Seller and its board of directors
(including any duly authorized committee thereof) and its Representatives
may, subject to compliance with _Section 4.06(d)_, engage in negotiations or
substantive discussions with, or furnish any information and other access to,
any Third Party making such Competing Proposal and its Representatives,
Affiliates and prospective debt and equity financing sources, in each case of
this clause (ii), if SellerÂ’s board of directors determines in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel) that such Competing Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal
or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and that the
failure to take such action could reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with the directorsÂ’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, (x) prior to furnishing any material non-public information
relating to Seller and the Business Subsidiaries or the Transactions, Seller
enters into with such Person, to the extent such Person is not already
subject to a confidentiality agreement with Seller that satisfies the
definition of Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement and (y) Seller shall substantially
concurrently provide or make available to Purchaser any non-public
information that Seller provides to any Third Party if such access was not
previously made available to Purchaser or its Representatives.

earlier, the termination of this Agreement), Seller shall, as promptly as
reasonably practicable, and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours of
receipt by Seller or any of its Representatives of any Competing Proposal,
deliver to Purchaser a written notice setting forth: (i) the identity of the
Third Party making such Competing Proposal and (ii) the material terms and
conditions of any such Competing Proposal (including an unredacted copy of any
written materials). Seller shall keep Purchaser reasonably informed of the
status of, and any material developments regarding, any such Competing
Proposal (including any material amendment or modification of any such
Competing Proposal (including any change to the economic terms thereof), and
including by providing to Purchaser copies of any written materials) on a
prompt basis, and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours thereafter.
Seller shall not, and shall cause its

 Subsidiaries not to, enter into any agreement with any Person (relating to a
Competing Proposal or otherwise) which prohibits or otherwise would prevent
the provision of any information to Purchaser in accordance with, or Seller
from otherwise complying with, the terms and conditions of this Agreement or
the consummation of the Transactions as contemplated hereunder.

 

(e) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the board of
directors of Seller (including any committee thereof) shall not (i)(A)

this clause (i) being referred to as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ")
or (ii) approve, cause or authorize or permit Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries to enter into any Company Acquisition Agreement or resolve, agree
or publicly propose to take any such action.

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
prior to the receipt of the Seller Stockholder Approval, the board of
directors of Seller may, subject to compliance with _Section 4.06(g)_, (x)
make an Adverse Recommendation Change (A) in response to a Competing Proposal
that the board of directors of Seller has determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, constitutes a
Superior Proposal in circumstances not involving a material breach of this
_Section 4.06_, (B) under clause (A) or (C) of the definition of Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event and (y) if Seller
has received a Competing Proposal in circumstances not involving a material
breach of this _Section 4.06_ that the board of directors of Seller has
determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and
financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal, authorize, adopt or
approve such Superior Proposal and cause or permit Seller to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal concurrently with
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 6.01(c)(ii)_,
in each case if the board of directors of Seller determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to
take such action could reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
directorsÂ’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Adverse
Recommendation Change may be made and no termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 4.06(f)_ may be effected, in each case until after the

make an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to clause (x) of _Section
4.06(f)_ (a " _Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to clause (y) of  _Section 4.06(f)_ (a " _Notice of
Superior Proposal_ "); _provided_ , that, (i) such notice shall specify, in
reasonable detail, the reasons therefor, including, if the basis of the
proposed action by SellerÂ’s board of directors is (A) a Superior Proposal,
the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal, the identity
of the Third Party making any such Superior Proposal and a copy of the

Representatives to, discuss and negotiate in good faith with Purchaser and
PurchaserÂ’s Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement; and (iii) following such Notice Period, (x) in
the case of an Intervening Event, SellerÂ’s board of directors, after taking
into account any modifications to the terms of this Agreement and/or the
Transactions to which Purchaser would agree, determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to effect such Adverse
Recommendation Change could reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law or (y) in the case of a
Superior Proposal, SellerÂ’s board of directors, after taking into account any
revisions to the terms of this Agreement and/or the Transactions to which
Purchaser would agree, determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such Competing Proposal
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal. Any such purported termination to
enter into a definitive agreement for a Superior Proposal shall not be
effective unless and until Seller pays the Termination Fee in full. Any
material change to (1) the facts or circumstances relating to such Intervening
Event or (2) the terms (including any change to the financial terms) or any
other material amendment of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice
of Adverse Recommendation Change or Notice of Superior Proposal, as
applicable, and Seller shall be required to comply again with the requirements
of this  _Section 4.06(g)_, except that the Notice Period in such case shall
be two (2) Business Days.

(h) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the board of directors
of Seller (or any duly authorized committee thereof) from (i) taking and
disclosing to SellerÂ’s stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated by Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or
(ii) making any disclosure to SellerÂ’s stockholders if the board of directors
of Seller determines in good faith, after consultation with SellerÂ’s outside
counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure would reasonably be likely
to be inconsistent with applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
in this _Section 4.06(h)_ shall be deemed to modify or supplement the
definition of (or the requirements pursuant to this _Section 4.06_ with
respect to an) Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

(i) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means a confidentiality
agreement containing confidentiality terms that are not materially less
favorable in the aggregate to Seller than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood and agreed that such
confidentiality agreement need not restrict the making, confidentially, of
Competing Proposals (and related communications) to Seller or SellerÂ’s board
of directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof)).

 

(ii) " _Competing Proposal_ " means any bona fide proposal or offer made by
any Third Party to purchase or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, in
one transaction or a series of transactions, pursuant to a merger,
consolidation or other business combination, sale of shares of capital stock,
sale of assets, tender offer, exchange offer or similar transaction (i)
beneficial ownership (as defined under

 



-44- ##### Table of Contents

  

 Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), including if such ownership would be
through the equityholders of any such Third Party, of more than twenty-five
percent (25%) of any class of equity securities of Seller (unless such
proposal or offer does not, and would not reasonably be expected to, conflict
with, impede, delay or prohibit (including by imposing a Third Party consent
right with respect to) the consummation of the Sale and the Reorganization
Transactions as contemplated hereunder and, as a condition to SellerÂ’s entry
into a definitive agreement with respect to such proposal or offer, any such
Third Party agrees to vote, or cause to be voted, all Seller
equity securities directly or indirectly beneficially owned by such Third
Party and its controlled Affiliates in favor of the Sale and the
Reorganization Transactions at the StockholdersÂ’ Meeting or any adjournment or
any postponement thereof (a " _Permitted WholeCo Proposal_ ")) or (ii) any
one or more assets or businesses of Seller and the Business Subsidiaries that
constitute more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the consolidated assets of
Seller (excluding in both the numerator and the denominator for purposes of
calculating such percentage any Excluded Assets), it being understood that any
proposal or offer solely with respect to any or all of the Excluded Assets
(for the avoidance of doubt excluding for this purpose any capital stock of
Seller held in treasury) and no Transferred Assets shall be deemed not to be a
Competing Proposal (so long as such proposal or offer does not, and would not
reasonably be expected to, conflict with, impede, delay or prohibit
(including by imposing a Third Party consent right with respect to) the
consummation of the Sale and the Reorganization Transactions as contemplated
hereunder).

 

(iii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a Competing Proposal (with all percentages
in the definition of Competing Proposal increased to sixty-five percent
(65%)) made by a Third Party on terms that the board of directors of Seller
determines in good faith, after consultation with SellerÂ’s financial and legal
advisors, and considering such factors as the board of directors of Seller
considers to be appropriate, including the consideration, terms, conditions,
timing, likelihood of consummation, financing terms and legal, financial, and
regulatory aspects of such Competing Proposal, (A) are more favorable from a
financial point of view to Seller and its stockholders than the Transactions
(including any revisions to the terms of this Agreement and/or the
Transactions committed to by Purchaser to Seller in writing in response to
such Competing Proposal under the provisions of _Section 4.06(g)_) and (B)
that the board of directors of Seller determines is reasonably likely to be
completed on the terms proposed.

 

4.07 _Further Assurances; Post-Closing Cooperation_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, at any time or from time to time after the
Closing, each of Seller and Purchaser shall execute and deliver such other

or to otherwise effect the Transactions.

 

4.08 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 a comparable role with, any of the Business Subsidiaries (but not in the
capacity of any roles of such persons with Seller) to claim indemnification
from such entity under the terms of their respective organizational documents
as in effect on the date hereof unless such changes are required by Law and
then only to the minimum extent required by Law. Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall or, if the Company is unable to, Purchaser shall cause the
Company as of the Closing to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-
cancellable extension of the directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability coverage of
SellerÂ’s existing directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ insurance policies and fiduciary
liability insurance policies (collectively, the " _D andO Insurance_"), covering
persons who are currently or who were officers or directors of, or in a
comparable role with, any of the Business Subsidiaries (but not in the
capacity of any roles of such persons with Seller), for a claims reporting or
discovery period of six years from and after the Closing with respect to any
claim related to any period of time at or prior to the Closing from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as SellerÂ’s current
insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the
coverage provided under SellerÂ’s existing policies; _provided_ , that the
premium for such "tail" insurance shall not exceed 300% of the annual premium
currently paid by Seller.

 

(b) Following the Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company to, as
the primary source of indemnification, indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the current and former directors and officers of, or persons in a comparable
role with, the Business Subsidiaries (but not in the capacity of any roles of
such persons with Seller) for any damages, Taxes, Liabilities, costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees) in connection with any
actual or threatened Action or investigation (whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative) arising from any acts or omissions by such
persons, in their respective capacities as directors or officers of, or in a
comparable role with, the Business Subsidiaries (but not Seller) prior to the
Closing Date, other than acts or omissions arising out of the Excluded Assets
or the Retained Liabilities.

 

(c) If Purchaser or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each
case, Purchaser shall make proper provision so that the successors and
assigns of Purchaser shall assume all of the obligations of Purchaser set
forth in this _Section 4.08_.

(d) The provisions of this _Section_ _ _ _4.08_ are intended for the benefit
of the current and former officers and directors of, or persons in a
comparable role with, the Business Subsidiaries (but not in the capacity of
any roles of such persons with Seller), and shall be enforceable by such
individuals (in such capacities) and their heirs and representatives.

 4.09 _Employee Benefits_.

(a) With respect to the Employees as of the Closing, for a period of twelve
(12) months after the Closing, Purchaser agrees to provide or cause its

for such Employee immediately prior to the Closing, (ii) annual cash bonus
opportunities that are no less favorable to each Employee than are in effect

 



-46- ##### Table of Contents

  

 for such Employee immediately prior to the Closing, (iii) equity incentive
compensation opportunities that are no less favorable than the equity
incentive compensation opportunities provided to similarly situated employees
of AOL, Inc., and (iv) 401(k) benefits, medical benefits and other welfare
benefits that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than those provided to
similarly situated employees of AOL, Inc.

honor all Benefit Plans and Non-U.S. Benefit Plans, in each case, in
accordance with their respective terms and subject to any rights to amend or
terminate such plans.

(c) Without limiting anything in this _Section 4.09_, as of the Closing and
for a period of twelve (12) months thereafter, Purchaser agrees to provide or
cause its Subsidiaries to provide to each Employee with severance payments and
benefits that are no less favorable than the severance payments and benefits
for which such Employee would be eligible immediately following the Closing
for a similar termination of employment under the applicable Benefit Plan or
Non-U.S. Benefit Plan set forth in  _Section 4.09(c)_ of the Disclosure
Schedules, taking into account any service with Purchaser and its Affiliates
through such date of termination.

 

(d) With respect to each benefit plan, program, practice, policy or
arrangement maintained by Purchaser or its Subsidiaries following the Closing
and in which any of the Employees participate (the " _Purchaser Plans_ "), and
except to the extent necessary to avoid duplication of benefits, for purposes
of determining eligibility to participate and vesting, and for purposes of
vacation accrual and level of severance benefits, service with Seller and the
Business Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to the extent Seller or any of
the Business Subsidiaries provides past service credit) shall be treated as
service with Purchaser and its Subsidiaries to the same extent such service
has recognized for such Employees under the analogous Benefit Plan or Non-U.S.
Benefit Plan, as applicable, as of the Closing. Purchaser shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of the applicable Purchaser
Plans that provides medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision and/or other
health benefits to any Employee to (i) waive eligibility waiting periods,
evidence of insurability requirements and pre-existing condition limitations
to the extent waived or not included under the corresponding Benefit Plan or
Non-U.S. Benefit Plan, and (ii) provide Employees with credit under the
applicable Purchaser Plans for amounts paid by such Employees prior to
the Closing during the plan year in which the Closing occurs under a
corresponding Benefit Plan or Non-U.S. Benefit Plan for purposes of applying
deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had
been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Purchaser Plans.

(e) Purchaser agrees that it shall notify Seller in writing within ten (10)
days following the earlier to occur of (i) the termination of employment or
(ii) the notice of termination of employment, in either case for any reason,
of any of the individuals identified on _Section 4.09(e)(i)_ of the
Disclosure Schedules in accordance with the terms of _Section 4.09(e)(ii)_
of the Disclosure Schedules. Seller agrees that, on and following the Closing,
it shall comply with terms of each of the applicable acquisition agreements
related to the Acquisition Holdback Stock (and any other amounts to be paid
by Seller (or any of its Affiliates) under such agreements, excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, Acquisition Holdback Cash to the extent such Acquisition
Holdback Cash is included in the Transfers pursuant to Section 1.1(e) of the

 



-47- ##### Table of Contents

  

 Reorganization Agreement) as though it was a direct party thereto with
respect to matters to the extent relating to the Acquisition Holdback Stock
(and any other related payments), including delivering the shares of
Acquisition Holdback Stock to the individuals entitled thereto in accordance
with and at the times specified under the applicable acquisition agreements
relating to such shares of Acquisition Holdback Stock; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that Seller may, in its discretion, accelerate the vesting and/or
delivery of shares of Acquisition Holdback Stock under the acquisition
agreement set forth in _Section 4.09(e)(iii)_ of the Disclosure Schedules in
their entirety on or prior to the Closing.

(f) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of _Sections
4.09(a)_ through  _4.09(d)_ are subject to any applicable Law that protects
any EmployeeÂ’s acquired rights or otherwise requires Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (including the Business Subsidiaries) to honor terms and conditions
of employment, compensation, benefits or continuity of service and are
without limitation to Purchaser and its AffiliatesÂ’ ability to provide more
generous terms and conditions, compensation or benefits to the Employees of
the Business Subsidiaries following the Closing. Without limiting the
foregoing, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall take the actions set forth in
_Section_ _4.09(f)_ of the Disclosure Schedules.

 

(g) Seller shall, or shall cause its Business Subsidiaries to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions necessary in respect of
consulting obligations and similar notice and bargaining obligations that
arise on or before the Closing Date in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions.

 

(h) Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, employ the Employees
who are foreign nationals working in the United States (the " _Alien
Employees_ "), under terms and conditions such that Purchaser or its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, will be considered the successor-in-interest to
the Business for U.S. immigration purposes. Accordingly, Purchaser shall,
or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, assume all immigration-related
Liabilities that have arisen or will hereafter arise in connection with the
submission of petitions to the United States Citizenship and Immigration
Service requesting the grant of employment-based non-immigrant and immigrant
visa benefits on behalf of the Alien Employees.

(i) Upon the exercise or settlement of any Seller Stock Options held by
Employees or Former Business Employees, Seller shall be responsible for
ensuring the satisfaction of all applicable Tax withholding, payroll Tax or
other Tax obligations that arise in connection with any such exercise
or settlement. To the extent that (i) Seller is responsible under applicable
Law for the remittance of any such Tax obligation to the applicable
Governmental Authority, Seller shall promptly remit such Tax obligations to
the applicable Governmental Authority; and (ii) Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates is responsible under applicable Law for the remittance of any such
Tax obligation to the applicable Governmental Authority, (A) Seller shall
promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day) notify Purchaser of
such exercise or settlement, (B) Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate to
estimate the Tax obligation in advance of the option exercise settlement date,
and (C) Seller shall (or shall cause its plan broker to) promptly (and in any
event within two (2) Business Days after the option exercise settlement date)
pay to Purchaser in cash in a lump sum the actual amount withheld in U.S.
Dollars (with Purchaser or its applicable Affiliate being responsible
for calculating the exact Tax obligation due based on its payroll records and
remitting such Tax obligation to the applicable

 



-48- ##### Table of Contents

  

 Governmental Authority in the required currency). To the extent there is any
shortfall in the amount of such Tax obligation withheld relative to the amount
of such Tax obligation due, Seller shall promptly (and in any event within
five (5) Business Days following notification thereof from Purchaser)
reimburse Purchaser for the amount of any such shortfall required to be
remitted to the applicable Governmental Authority. To the extent there is any
excess in the amount of such Tax obligation withheld relative to the amount of
such Tax obligation due, Purchaser shall promptly (and in any event within
five (5) Business Days following its receipt of such excess, or if such excess
is remitted to the applicable Governmental Authority prior to it being
determined that an excess amount has been withheld, upon such excess being
received by Purchaser from the applicable Governmental Authority) pay such
amount to Seller and Seller shall cause such funds to be restored to the
optioneeÂ’s account at the plan broker.

(j) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this _Section 4.09_ with respect to Employees are included for the sole and
exclusive benefit of the respective parties hereto and shall not create any
right (i) in any other person, including Employees, former employees, any
participant or any beneficiary thereof in any Benefit Plan, Non-U.S. Benefit
Plan or Purchaser Plans or (ii) to continued employment with the Business
Subsidiaries or Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 4.09_ to the contrary, nothing in
this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall be treated as an adoption,
amendment or other modification of any Benefit Plan, Non-U.S. Benefit Plan or
any other employee benefit plans of Seller or the Business Subsidiaries.

auditing or other Books and Records that are retained by Seller or are
obtained by Purchaser or its Affiliates, as the case may be, (including any
documents relating to any governmental or non-governmental Actions or
investigations) relating to the conduct of the Business prior to the Closing
Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, during such seven-year (7-year) period,
Purchaser and the Business Subsidiaries may dispose of any such Books and
Records if Purchaser first offers the Books and Records to Seller in writing
and Seller thereafter notifies Purchaser in writing that it wishes to reject
such offer. Seller and Purchaser shall not, and Purchaser shall not permit the
Business Subsidiaries to, dispose of any such Books and Records at any time
after such seven-year (7-year) period without first offering the Books
and Records to the other party hereto in writing at least sixty (60) days
prior to such disposal.

accordance with _Section 4.10(a)_, Seller and Purchaser shall, and Purchaser

necessary, a reasonable number of times with officers and employees of such
party and its Subsidiaries on a mutually convenient basis in order to obtain

partyÂ’s sole expense, during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior

Liabilities, including those described in Sections 1.4(a), 1.4(c), 1.4(e) and
1.4(g) of the Reorganization Agreement or (y) to the extent necessary to
ensure compliance with this Agreement or applicable Law. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither Seller nor Purchaser (nor any of their Affiliates) shall
be required to disclose any information under this _Section 4.10_ (A) if such
disclosure would be reasonably likely to: (1) contain information that in the
reasonable, good faith judgment of the disclosing party (after consultation
with outside counsel) is competitively sensitive; (2) jeopardize any
attorney-client or other legal privilege or the protections of the work
product doctrine; (3) contravene any applicable Laws, fiduciary duty or
Contract to which the disclosing party or any of its Affiliates is a party;
or (4) expose the disclosing party or any or its Affiliates to risk of
liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal information; _provided_
that, in any such case, the disclosing party shall provide such information
in redacted form as necessary to preserve such privilege or protections or
comply with such Law or Contract or otherwise make appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements, to the extent practicable or (B) in connection with
any litigation or similar dispute between the parties hereto; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the foregoing shall not limit any of the partiesÂ’ rights of
discovery. Any such access or furnishing of information shall be conducted
under the supervision of the disclosing party or its Representatives and in
such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the normal operations of
the business of the disclosing party and its Affiliates.

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Seller and
Purchaser shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, provide to
the other party such cooperation, documentation and information as either of
them reasonably may request in connection with (i) filing any Tax Return,
amended Tax Return or claim for refund, (ii) determining a liability for Taxes
or a right to refund of Taxes (including pursuant to this Agreement) or (iii)
preparing for or conducting any audit, examination, litigation or other Action
with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation and information shall include
providing necessary powers of attorney, copies of all relevant portions of
relevant Tax Returns, together with all relevant portions of relevant
accompanying schedules, relevant work papers, relevant documents relating to
rulings or other determinations by Governmental Authorities and relevant
records concerning the ownership and Tax basis of property and other relevant
information, which any such party may possess. Each party shall make its
employees reasonably available on a mutually convenient basis at its cost to
provide an explanation of any documents or information so provided.

4.11 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

accordance with its terms, or with respect to terminations that would not
reasonably be expected to be material to the Business, taken as a whole).

 

(b) Seller shall promptly advise Purchaser of any fact, change, event or
circumstance that has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Business
Material Adverse Effect, and each party shall promptly advise the other of any
fact, change, event or circumstance that is reasonably likely to cause the
failure of any condition to Closing set forth in _Section 5.02_ or
_Section 5.03_ , as applicable; _provided_ , that any failure to give notice
in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach shall not in and
of itself be deemed to constitute the failure of any condition set forth in 
_Section 5.02_ or _Section 5.03_ to be satisfied.

4.12 _Guarantees_.

 

(a) Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to cause itself or one or more
of its Affiliates to be substituted in all respects for Seller, effective as
of the Closing, in respect of all obligations of Seller under any guarantees,
bonding arrangements, keepwell agreements, net working capital maintenance
agreements, reimbursement obligations, letters of credit, letters of comfort
or any similar agreements, in each case to the extent relating to the Business
(and not any Excluded Assets or Retained Liabilities), binding Seller for the
benefit of the Business or the Business Subsidiaries, and Seller shall
reasonably cooperate in PurchaserÂ’s efforts, in each case to the extent that
the Company has not been so substituted for Seller pursuant to the
Reorganization Agreement (the " _Guarantees_ "). In no event shall Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates be obligated to pay any money to any Person to
effect the substitutions described in this _Section 4.12_.

(b) With respect to any Guarantees that remain outstanding after the Closing
Date, (i) Seller and Purchaser shall continue to cooperate and use their
respective reasonable best efforts to terminate, or, if the parties are unable

damages, Liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneysÂ’

Seller is or would reasonably be expected to be liable under such Guarantee
(including after taking into account clause (ii) above). To the extent that
Seller has performance obligations under any Guarantee that remains
outstanding after the Closing Date, Purchaser will use reasonable best efforts
to (x) perform such obligations on behalf of Seller or (y) otherwise take
such action as is reasonably requested by Seller so as to put Seller in the
same position as if Purchaser, and not Seller, had performed or were
performing such obligations.

(a) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall provide, shall cause the Business
Subsidiaries to provide, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to

none of Seller (at any time) or any of the Business Subsidiaries (prior to the

Subsidiaries, in each case, in connection with any Financing consisting of a
syndicated credit facility), (C) nothing shall obligate Seller or
any Business Subsidiary to provide, or cause to be provided, any legal
opinion or to provide, or cause to be provided, any information or take, or
cause to be taken, any action to the extent doing so could reasonably be

Business SubsidiaryÂ’s organizational documents or any Contract binding on
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or any confidentiality obligations binding
on Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or (y) the loss of any attorney-client
privilege and (D) nothing shall obligate Seller or any Business Subsidiary to
provide carve-out financial statements or other carve-out financial
information, in each case whether audited or unaudited, in respect of the
Business or the Business Subsidiaries. The cooperation of Seller and the
Business Subsidiaries shall not unreasonably interfere with ongoing operations
of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise materially impair the
ability of any Representative of Seller or any of the Business Subsidiaries
to carry out its duties to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries. Purchaser shall

materials relating to the Financing), and (iii) any action taken by any of
them at the request of Purchaser pursuant to this _Section 4.13_, except, in
the case of clauses (i) and (iii), to the extent such losses, damages, claims,
costs or expenses arose from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
Seller or any of the Business Subsidiaries, as determined in a final, non-
appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

(b) All non-public or otherwise confidential information obtained by
Purchaser, its Representatives or its Financing Sources pursuant to this
_Section 4.13_ shall be kept confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, except that Purchaser shall be permitted to
disclose such information to the Financing Sources, rating agencies and
prospective lenders and investors during syndication of the Financing subject
to the ratings agencies and prospective lenders and investors entering into
customary confidentiality undertakings with respect to such information
(including through a notice and undertaking in a form customarily

Seller regarding the defense or settlement of any such Action and (iii) shall
not compromise, settle, come to an arrangement regarding or agree to

Seller or entirely from proceeds of SellerÂ’s insurance, except for any
applicable deductible which shall be paid by Seller) without the prior
written consent of Purchaser (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

4.15  _Voting of Shares_. Purchaser shall and shall cause its Affiliates to
vote all shares of Seller Common Stock beneficially owned by it or any of its
Affiliates in favor of authorizing the Sale and the Reorganization
Transactions at the StockholdersÂ’ Meeting.

4.16 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Company Purchase Price Allocation_.

 

(i) Purchaser and Seller agree to allocate, and, as applicable, to cause their
applicable Affiliates to allocate, the Company Purchase Price among the
assets of the Section 338(h)(10) Subsidiaries and any other relevant assets
acquired (or deemed acquired for U.S. federal income tax purposes in
connection with the acquisition of the Shares) in accordance with
Sections 1060 and 338(h)(10) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder. Purchaser shall provide Seller with a proposed
allocation of the Company Purchase Price (the " _Purchaser Â’s Allocation_") no
later than one hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date. If Seller
disagrees with PurchaserÂ’s Allocation, Seller may, within thirty (30) days
after delivery of PurchaserÂ’s Allocation, deliver a notice (the " _Seller Â’s
Allocation Notice_") to Purchaser to such effect, specifying those items as
to which Seller disagrees and setting forth SellerÂ’s proposed allocation. If
the SellerÂ’s Allocation Notice is duly delivered, Seller and Purchaser shall,
during the twenty (20) days following such delivery, use commercially
reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in
order to determine the allocation of the Company Purchase Price. If Seller and
Purchaser are unable to reach such agreement, they shall promptly thereafter
cause the Independent Accounting Firm to resolve any remaining disputes. Any
allocation of the Company Purchase Price determined pursuant to the decision
of the Independent Accounting Firm shall incorporate, reflect and be
consistent with the terms of this Agreement. Any costs and expenses of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by the Seller, on the one
hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand. The allocation, as prepared by
Purchaser if no SellerÂ’s Allocation Notice has been timely given, as adjusted
pursuant to any

 



-53- ##### Table of Contents

  

 agreement between Seller and Purchaser or as determined by the Independent
Accounting Firm (the " _Company Purchase Price Allocation_ "), shall be
conclusive and binding on Purchaser and Seller. The Company Purchase Price
Allocation and the Foreign Sale Purchase Price shall be adjusted as necessary
and appropriate to reflect any payments treated as an adjustment to the
purchase price for Tax purposes pursuant to _Section 4.16(c)_ of this
Agreement or Section 7.6 of the Reorganization Agreement or in the event the
beneficial ownership of any Non-Transferrable Asset is not transferred to the
Company pursuant to Section 1.7 of the Reorganization Agreement.

 

(ii) Each of Purchaser and Seller shall timely file IRS Form 8594 and all U.S.
federal, state, local and foreign Tax Returns in accordance with the Company
Purchase Price Allocation and the Foreign Sale Purchase Price. The Company
Purchase Price Allocation shall be used in preparing IRS Form 8883 (and any
similar forms under applicable state and local Law) pursuant to  _Section
4.16(b)(ii)_. Except to the extent otherwise required pursuant to a
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign Law), Purchaser, Seller and
their respective Affiliates shall not take any Tax position that is
inconsistent with the Company Purchase Price Allocation or the Foreign Sale
Purchase Price on any Tax Return, in any Tax Proceeding or otherwise.

 

(b) _Section 338(h)(10) Elections_.

 

(i) At PurchaserÂ’s request, Purchaser and Seller shall (or shall cause their
relevant Affiliates to) make and timely file joint elections under Section
338(h)(10) of the Code (and any corresponding elections under applicable state
or local Law) with respect to any of the Business Subsidiaries set forth on
_Schedule 4.16(b)(i)_ (the Business Subsidiaries with respect to which
Purchaser requests such elections, the " _Section 338(h)(10) Subsidiaries_,"
and such elections, the " _Company Section 338(h)(10) Elections_").

 

(ii) Purchaser and Seller shall (and shall cause their relevant Affiliates to)
cooperate in the preparation of all forms, attachments and schedules
necessary to effectuate the Company Section 338(h)(10) Elections and the
Reorganization 338(h)(10) Elections (collectively, the " _Section 338(h)(10)
Elections_ "), including IRS Form 8023, IRS Form 8883 and any similar forms
under applicable state and local Law (such forms with respect to the Company
Section 338(h)(10) Elections, collectively, the " _Company Section 338(h)(10)
Forms_ ," and, collectively with the Reorganization 338(h)(10) Forms, the "
_Section 338(h)(10) Forms_"), in a manner consistent with the Company
Purchase Price Allocation and the Foreign Sale Purchase Price. Each of
Purchaser and Seller shall timely file (or cause to be timely filed) the
Company Section 338(h)(10) Forms with the applicable Governmental Authorities.

(iii) Purchaser and Seller shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to, as promptly as practicable following the Closing Date, cooperate with each
other to take all actions necessary and appropriate (including filing such
other forms, returns, elections, schedules and other documents as may be
required) to effect, perfect and preserve the Company Section 338(h)(10)
Elections in accordance with the

 provisions of Section 338 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder (and any comparable provisions of applicable state or
local Law). Purchaser and Seller shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, (A) report the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Reorganization Agreement in a manner consistent with the Section
338(h)(10) Elections for all Tax purposes and (B) except to the extent
otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section
1313(a) of the Code (or any similar provision of state or local Law), take no
Tax position contrary to the Section 338(h)(10) Elections or the Section
338(h)(10) Forms on any Tax Return, in any Tax Proceeding or otherwise.

(iv) Purchaser and Seller shall not, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates not to, take any action to (A) modify any of the forms or other
documents (including any corrections, amendments or supplements thereto) that
are required in connection with the Section 338(h)(10) Elections or (B)
modify or revoke any of the Section 338(h)(10) Elections after the filing of
the Section 338(h)(10) Forms without the prior written consent of the other
party.

 

(v) Purchaser may make and may cause its Affiliates (including the Company) to
make (and nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Purchaser from so
making or causing to be made) an election under Section 338(g) of the Code
with respect to the acquisition or deemed acquisition by Purchaser pursuant to
this Agreement of any Business Subsidiary that is treated as a foreign
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that is not listed on
_Section 4.16(b)(v)_ of the Disclosure Schedules (an " _Eligible Foreign
Business Subsidiary_ "). Except for (x) the Company Section
338(h)(10) Elections, (y) the Reorganization 338(h)(10) Elections and (z) the
elections under Section 338(g) of the Code described in the immediately
preceding sentence, Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not
to, make any election under Section 338 of the Code, or any comparable
provision of state, local or foreign Law, with respect to any of the Business
Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of Seller (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(c) _Adjustments for Tax Purposes_. Each of Purchaser and Seller agree to
treat, and cause their respective Affiliates to treat, for all Tax purposes,
the receipt of any indemnification payment by Purchaser, the Company or Seller
pursuant to this Agreement or the Reorganization Agreement as an adjustment to
the purchase price, unless otherwise required by Law.

 

(d) _Prohibited Actions_. Except as otherwise required by applicable Law or as
expressly required by this Agreement or the Reorganization Agreement,
Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, (A) amend any Tax
Return related to the Business or any Business Subsidiary, make, change or
revoke any Tax election related to the Business or any Business Subsidiary or
take any other similar action outside the ordinary course of business to the
extent such amendment or action could materially increase SellerÂ’s (or any of
its AffiliatesÂ’) liability for Taxes for which Seller bears responsibility
pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement or (B) take, or cause to take, any
action that could result in, or change the character of, any material amount
of income or gain that must be reported on any Tax Return filed or to be filed
by Seller (or any of its Affiliates); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
in this

 



-55- ##### Table of Contents

  

  _Section 4.16(d)_ shall be interpreted as affecting any rights or
responsibilities of any party set forth in Section 5.5 of the Reorganization
Agreement or any other provision of this Section 4.16, and in the event of
any conflict between any of the provisions contained in Section 5.5 of the
Reorganization Agreement, Section 4.16(a)Â–(c) or Section 4.16(e)Â–(h), on the
one hand, with this Section 4.16(d), on the other hand, such provision(s)
other than Section 4.16(d) shall control.

(e) _Tax Deductions Related to Retained Employee Liabilities_. Each of
Purchaser and Seller agree that, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
any income, franchise and similar Tax deductions with respect to any payment
of Retained Employee Liabilities, regardless of whether paid in cash or stock
(any such deductions, the " _Deductions_ "), shall be taken on the Tax Return
of Seller or another Seller Entity. To the extent that Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates Actually Realizes a Tax Benefit as a result of any Deduction
reflected on any Tax Return of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates for a
taxable period beginning after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall pay the
amount of such Tax Benefit to Seller within fifteen (15) days of Actually
Realizing such Tax Benefit. To the extent any Deduction giving rise to a Tax
Benefit in respect of which Purchaser made a payment to Seller pursuant to
this _Section 4.16(d)_ is subsequently disallowed by the relevant
Governmental Authority, Seller shall repay the amount of such disallowed Tax
Benefit received by Purchaser, together with any interest and penalties
applicable with respect thereto and payable to the Governmental Authority,
within fifteen (15) days of Purchaser notifying Seller that such Tax Benefit
has been disallowed.

(f) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
to the extent relating to the Business Subsidiaries, Seller shall terminate
or cause to be terminated, on or before the Closing Date, all Tax sharing
agreements or similar arrangements (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall
not include this Agreement, the Reorganization Agreement or any other
Transaction Document), if any, to which any of the Business Subsidiaries, on
the one hand, and Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Business
Subsidiaries), on the other hand, are parties, and neither Seller nor any of
its Subsidiaries (other than the Business Subsidiaries) nor any of the
Business Subsidiaries shall have any rights or obligations thereunder after
the Closing.

 

(g) _Foreign Business Subsidiary Transfers_. No later than twenty (20)
Business Days before effectuating any Foreign Business Subsidiary Transfer,
Seller shall provide Purchaser with a draft of the relevant document(s)
pursuant to which the Foreign Business Subsidiary Transfer(s) will be effected

specific steps contemplated to be taken to achieve any such Foreign Business
Subsidiary Transfer. Seller shall thereafter consider in good faith any
mutually beneficial alternative method for effectuating such Foreign Business
Subsidiary Transfer(s) suggested by Purchaser within ten (10) Business Days

calculations, workpapers and other documentations in existence with respect
thereto) and (y) each "gain recognition agreement" within the meaning of
Section 367 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder,
if any, to which any Business Subsidiary is a party (together with a copy of

4.17 _Change of Name_.

 

(a) Seller hereby acknowledges that, as of the Closing, all right, title and
interest in and to the Marks and names set forth in _Section 2.16_ _(a)_ of
the Disclosure Schedules, together with all variations, acronyms or
derivations thereof or any names, trademarks, service marks, logos or
otherwise that are confusingly similar thereto (collectively, the " _Names
and Marks_ "), will be owned exclusively by the Business Subsidiaries, and
that, except as expressly provided below, any and all right of the Seller
Entities to use the Names and Marks shall terminate as of the Closing, along
with any and all goodwill associated therewith. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Seller and its Affiliates may at all times after the Closing use
such names and Marks (i) in internal Tax, legal, employment or similar
records, (ii) as required by Law or the rules of any applicable stock
exchange and (iii) as part of any factual statement.

(b) Seller shall as promptly as practicable after the Closing, file documents
with the appropriate Governmental Authorities changing its and any other
Seller EntitiesÂ’ corporate name (in such case, no more than five (5) Business
Days after the Closing), "doing business as" name, trade name and any other
similar corporate identifier to (in the case of such corporate identifiers, no
more than sixty (60) days after the Closing) a corporate name, "doing business
as" name, trade name or any other similar corporate identifier that does not
contain any Names and Marks; _provided_ , that Seller shall use reasonable
best efforts to ensure that all Names and Marks be replaced, removed or
covered-over on materials as soon as reasonably possible and will discontinue
use, and will, as soon as reasonably possible following discovery, destroy or
deliver up all materials in the Seller EntitiesÂ’ possession or control with
Names and Marks affixed to them that have no valid continuing use by any
Seller Entity, to the extent the use of such items could reasonably be
construed to create a legal obligation on behalf of Purchaser or its
Affiliates (including the Business Subsidiaries). Such specific items to be
destroyed, returned or altered, or for which such other steps must be taken,
include: order, purchase or material forms; requisitions; invoices;
statements; labor reports; bill inserts; stationery; personalized note pads
that are used for communications with the public; business cards; published
organization charts; bulletins/releases; sales/price literature; manuals
distributed to the public; catalogs; websites; and publicly available media
contact lists/cards.

 

4.18 _Convertible Notes_.

 

(a) The parties hereto expressly acknowledge and agree that, except as may be
required in accordance with _Section 4.18(b)_, the Convertible Notes will
not be assumed by the Company, Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof and will
constitute Retained Liabilities. Seller may, in its reasonable discretion,
take actions to amend the Indenture prior to the Closing to delete Article 11
(and, in SellerÂ’s sole discretion, to delete or modify other provisions) of
the Indenture, including conducting a tender offer and/or consent solicitation
in accordance with applicable Law to acquire the Convertible Notes
and/or effect such amendments to the Indenture on such terms and conditions
as Seller, in its reasonable discretion, determines (a " _Debt Tender Offer_
"). Seller shall keep Purchaser reasonably informed with respect to the status
of the actions taken pursuant to the foregoing. For the avoidance of doubt,
neither the commencement nor consummation of a Debt Tender Offer shall in any
event constitute a condition to Closing under _Article V_.

 



-57- ##### Table of Contents

  

(b) In the event that, at or after the Closing the Indenture has not been
amended as permitted in _Section_ _ _ _4.18(a)_ and a court of competent
jurisdiction has determined in a final, non-appealable judgment or a judgment
that Seller determines, in its reasonable discretion, not to appeal, that the
Transactions constitute a sale, conveyance, transfer or lease of all or
substantially all of SellerÂ’s properties and assets to another Person (as
defined in the Indenture) or otherwise issues a ruling with substantially the
same effect:

 

(i) Seller and the Company will execute and deliver as promptly as practicable
following such judgment a supplemental indenture and such instruments,
certificates, opinions, agreements and other documents as may be necessary to
cause Seller and the Company to satisfy the requirements of the Indenture,
including Article 11 thereof, including by causing the Company to assume all
of SellerÂ’s obligations under the Convertible Notes and the Indenture,
effective upon consummation of the Transactions;

 

(ii) the Company shall (A) notify Seller in writing not later than 10:00 a.m.
(New York City time) on the next Business Day following the CompanyÂ’s receipt
of a Notice of Conversion (as defined in the Indenture) in respect of the
conversion of any Convertible Note by a holder thereof, and (B) elect to
satisfy its Conversion Obligation (as defined in the Indenture) with respect
to such conversion by Cash Settlement (as defined in the Indenture), by
Physical Settlement (as defined in the Indenture) or by Combination Settlement
(as defined in the Indenture), in each case in accordance with the Indenture
and as directed in writing by Seller in its sole discretion; _provided_ , that
if Seller does not deliver written notice to the Company by 3:00 p.m. (New
York City time) on the date it receives the CompanyÂ’s notice specifying
the Settlement Method (as defined in the Indenture) by which the Conversion
Obligation should be satisfied, Seller will be deemed to have specified Cash
Settlement; and, _provided_ , _further_ , that if Seller specifies Combination
Settlement but does not indicate the Specified Dollar Amount (as defined in
the Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes, the Specified
Dollar Amount per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes shall be
$1,000;

 

(iii) at SellerÂ’s election, either (A) the Purchase Price shall be reduced by
the principal amount ($1,000 per Convertible Note) of the Convertible Notes
that remain outstanding immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Principal
Amount_ "), or (B) Seller shall pay to the Company at the Closing the
Principal Amount (in which case such payment shall have no impact on the
amount of the Purchase Price); _provide_ _d_ that, if the execution and
delivery by the Company of the supplemental indenture described in _Section
4.18(b)(i)_ occurs after the Closing, Seller shall pay to the Company
promptly after such execution and delivery the Principal Amount (in which case
such payment shall have no impact on the amount of the Purchase Price);

 

(iv) simultaneously with the execution and delivery by the Company of the
supplemental indenture described in _Section 4.18(b)(i)_ , Seller, the

 



-58- ##### Table of Contents

  

 Company, Purchaser and a mutually agreed escrow agent will enter into an
escrow agreement pursuant to which (A) Purchaser shall, or shall cause the
Company to, deposit the Principal Amount into an escrow account (the "
_Escrow Account_ "); (B) all or a portion of the Principal Amount not to
exceed $1,000 per Convertible Note shall be released from the Escrow Account
and applied toward payments to holders of Convertible Notes of (x) the
principal due upon maturity of the Convertible Notes, (y) the Settlement
Amount (as defined in the Indenture) due upon Cash Settlement, or (z) the
Specified Dollar Amount due upon Combination Settlement; (C) all or a portion
of the Principal Amount not to exceed $1,000 per Convertible Note shall be
released from the Escrow Account and paid to Seller (x) in respect of any
Physical Settlement, in an amount equal to the principal amount of any
Convertible Notes settled by Physical Settlement or (y) in respect of any
Combination Settlements, (I) the principal amount of any Convertible Notes
settled by Combination Settlement less (II) the Specified Dollar Amount;
and (D) any funds held in the Escrow Account that are not paid to holders of
Convertible Notes will, within five (5) Business Days following the later of
(x) the earlier of (1) the Maturity Date (as defined in the Indenture), or (2)
the date upon which all Convertible Notes have been converted or repurchased
and (y) the final satisfaction and settlement by Seller of any further excess
obligations relating to or arising out of the Convertible Notes;

 

(v) in the case of any Cash Settlement or Combination Settlement, if
application of the funds in the Escrow Account is not sufficient to pay the
Settlement Amount to the holders of Convertible Notes as required under the
Indenture, then Seller will provide the amount of any cash shortfall by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the Company not less than one (1)
Business Day prior to the date such payments are required to be made to such
holders;

(vi) in the case of any Combination Settlement or Physical Settlement, Seller
will provide the number of shares of Seller Common Stock (which shall be duly
authorized and issued) to the Company required to satisfy the Conversion
Obligation by no later than 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) at least two (2)
Business Days prior to the date such shares are required to be delivered to
such holders;

 

(vii) until the later of (A) the earlier of (1) the Maturity Date (as defined
in the Indenture), or (2) the date upon which all Convertible Notes have been
converted or repurchased and (B) the final satisfaction and settlement by
Seller of any further excess obligations relating to or arising out of the
Convertible Notes, Seller (x) shall at all times reserve and keep available,
out of its authorized but unissued Seller Common Stock, solely for the purpose
of providing for its obligations under this _Section 4.18_ and the Convertible
Notes, the aggregate number of shares of Seller Common Stock issuable
under the Convertible Notes in accordance with the terms thereof, and (y)
shall not adopt or enter into, or permit to be adopted or entered into, a plan
of complete or partial liquidation or dissolution unless Seller has made
provisions reasonably acceptable to Purchaser for the final satisfaction and
settlement of any further excess obligations relating to or arising out of the
Convertible Notes;

 

(viii) if Seller (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such

 



-59- ##### Table of Contents

  

 consolidation or merger or (ii) enters into any agreement with a Third Party
pursuant to which such Third Party acquires, directly or indirectly, in one
transaction or a series of transactions, pursuant to a merger, consolidation,
business combination, sale of shares of capital stock, tender offer, exchange
offer or similar transaction (x) beneficial ownership (as defined under
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), including if such ownership is through
the equityholders of any such Third Party, of more than fifty percent (50%) of
any class of equity securities of Seller or (y) any one or more assets or
businesses of Seller and its Subsidiaries that constitute more than fifty
percent (50%) of the consolidated assets of Seller, then, in each case, Seller
shall make proper provision so that the continuing or surviving entity or
acquiror (or, if applicable, at PurchaserÂ’s election, the ultimate
parent company of such continuing or surviving entity or acquiror), as the
case may be, assumes in writing (in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to Purchaser), on a joint and several basis, all of the obligations of Seller
set forth in this  _Section 4.18_ ; and

(ix) except as set forth in this _Section_ _ _ _4.18(b)_ , Seller will not
be required to pay any amount greater than the principal amount of any
Convertible Note to purchase any Convertible Note prior to the Maturity Date
unless Seller agrees to do so in its sole discretion (or unless the Company
would be required to do so under the terms of the Indenture).

The obligations under _Section_ _ _ _4.18(b)_ shall terminate and shall become
null and void, and there shall be no liability on the part of any party
hereto under _Section_ _ _ _4.18(b)_ , and all rights and obligations of any
party hereto under _Section_ _ _ _4.18(b)_ shall cease, if prior to the
Closing, (i) pursuant to the Debt Tender Offer or otherwise, the Indenture is
amended to permit the Transactions without assumption of the Convertible Notes
by the Company, Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof or (ii) a court of
competent jurisdiction determines in a final, non-appealable judgment, that
the Transactions do not constitute a sale, conveyance, transfer or lease of
all or substantially all of SellerÂ’s properties and assets to another Person
(as defined in the Indenture) or otherwise issues a ruling with substantially
the same effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any and all actions by the
Company, Purchaser and their respective Affiliates under this _Section 4.18_
shall be taken at SellerÂ’s sole cost and expense, and Seller shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates (including, from and
after the Closing, the Company) from and against any and all Losses (including
for the avoidance of doubt any Losses relating to any securities laws)
relating to, arising out of or resulting from the Convertible Notes (including
in connection with the Transactions or in connection with the conversion of
any such Convertible Notes), but excluding any Losses to the extent fully
satisfied by recourse to funds in the Escrow Account in accordance with
_Section 4.18(b)_ , excluding any Losses to the extent directly resulting from
any action or inaction by the Company in material breach (subject to
applicable cure rights and periods) of the Indenture or by Purchaser in
material breach of the provisions of this _Section 4.18_ , and excluding, for
the avoidance of doubt, any premium that may be payable in connection with a
tender offer that is voluntarily commenced by Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates following the Closing without SellerÂ’s prior written consent.

4.19 _Yahoo Japan_.

 

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement, Seller and its Subsidiaries
(for the avoidance of doubt throughout this _Section 4.19_ , not including
the Company after the Closing) shall not, without the prior written consent of
Purchaser, to the extent within its control, (i) amend or waive any provision
of, or grant any Consent with respect to any matter under, the Yahoo
Japan License Agreement or any other agreement between Seller (or its
Subsidiaries) and Yahoo Japan Corporation (or its Subsidiaries) that
constitutes a Transferred Asset; provided, that this clause (i) shall not
apply following the Closing, (ii) amend or waive any provision of, or grant
any Consent with respect to any matter under, the Yahoo Japan Joint Venture
Agreement or any other agreement between Seller (or its Subsidiaries), on the
one hand, and either Yahoo Japan Corporation (or its Subsidiaries) or
SoftBank Group Corp. (or its Subsidiaries), on the other hand, relating
directly to Yahoo Japan Corporation that constitutes an Excluded Asset if such
action would reasonably be expected to cause the termination of, or permit
Yahoo Japan Corporation to terminate, the Yahoo Japan License Agreement
pursuant to clause (iii) or clause (iv) of Section 9.1 (Terms) thereof, or
(iii) sell its shares in Yahoo Japan Corporation or consent to an Acquisition
(as such term is defined in the Yahoo Japan License Agreement) if such action
would reasonably be expected to cause the termination of, or permit Yahoo
Japan Corporation to terminate, the Yahoo Japan License Agreement pursuant to
clause (iii) or clause (iv) of Section 9.1 (Terms) thereof. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, (x) neither Seller nor any director, officer or employee of
Seller shall be obligated to take any action in its or their capacity as a
shareholder or director of Yahoo Japan Corporation that would violate
applicable Law (including with respect to a directorÂ’s fiduciary duties), and
(y) Seller shall have no liability with respect to the restrictions set forth
in clauses (ii) and (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence if
the applicable termination of the Yahoo License Agreement is pursuant to
clause (iv) of Section 9.1 (Terms) thereof and would not have occurred but for
the failure by the Company to have consented (following reasonable notice and
an opportunity to so consent) to the applicable Acquisition in accordance
with the terms of such clause (iv) of Section 9.1 (Terms) thereof (it being
understood that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
subject to this clause (y), Seller shall remain liable to Purchaser following
the Closing with respect to any breaches by Seller of this _Section 4.19(a)_ ,
whether such breaches occur prior to or following the Closing).

 

(b) Seller and its Subsidiaries will not implement or effect the Transfers
under the Reorganization Agreement in a manner that constitutes a breach or
default under the terms of the Yahoo Japan License Agreement or that would
cause the termination of, or permit Yahoo Japan Corporation to terminate, the
Yahoo Japan License Agreement (it being understood that, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, for twelve (12) months following
the Closing, Seller shall remain liable to Purchaser with respect to a breach
by Seller of this Section 4.19(b) prior to the Closing).

 

4.20 _Designated Matters_. From and after the date hereof (and until the
Closing), Seller shall, in good faith, seek to address in a commercially
reasonable manner as promptly as reasonably practicable the matters and issues
described in _Section 4.20 of the Disclosure Schedules_ (the " _Designated
Matters_ "). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller shall
keep Purchaser reasonably informed, to the extent practicable, on a reasonably
current basis, of any material developments arising in connection with the
Designated Matters (including by providing copies of any material
correspondence sent or received by Seller or its Representatives in connection
with the Designated Matters), and otherwise consult with

 Purchaser in good faith on a reasonably current basis with respect to the
Designated Matters and the resolution thereof, including by providing
Purchaser with the opportunity to attend any material teleconferences or in-
person meetings with the applicable counterparties regarding the resolution of
the Designated Matters. In connection with such discussions and consultation,
Seller shall consider in good faith PurchaserÂ’s reasonable comments and
suggestions with respect to the Designated Matters and the resolution thereof,
including any good faith offers of assistance by Purchaser in connection
therewith. The cooperation and information sharing obligations of a
party under this _Section 4.20_ shall be limited to the extent any such
cooperation or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of
such party or contravene any Laws or obligation of confidentiality to a
third party; _provided_ , that the parties shall endeavor in good faith to
make appropriate substitute arrangements, if practicable, in a manner that
does not give rise to any of the foregoing consequences. Nothing in this
_Section 4.20_ shall be deemed to permit or require Seller to take any action
that is prohibited pursuant to _Section 4.01_ hereof without PurchaserÂ’s
consent.

MISCELLANEOUS

 8.01 _Non-Survival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements_. The
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement and
any certificate delivered pursuant hereto by any person shall terminate at the
Closing or, except as provided in _Section_ _ _ _6.02_ , upon the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _6.01_ , as the case may be,
except that this _Section_ _ _ _8.01_ shall not limit any covenant or
agreement of the parties hereto which by its terms contemplates performance
after the Closing or after termination of this Agreement.

 

8.02 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.
Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or
otherwise, by Seller or Purchaser without the prior written consent of the
other party hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser may assign, at any
time prior to the Closing, in its sole discretion, any of or all its rights,
interests and obligations under this Agreement to any wholly owned U.S.
Subsidiary of Purchaser (or a Purchaser Designee in order to implement the
Foreign Sale as contemplated hereby); and _provided_ , _further_ , that any
such assignment shall not relieve Purchaser of its obligations hereunder. Any
purported assignment in contravention of this _Section_ _  _ _8.02_ shall be
null and void.

8.03 _Amendment; Waiver_. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Seller and Purchaser. At any
time prior to the Closing, subject to applicable Law, any party hereto may (a)
extend the time for the performance of any obligation or other act of
the other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the representations and
warranties of the other party contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any agreement or condition
contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall only be valid if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party to be bound thereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by Seller or Purchaser in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall
any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
of any other right hereunder.

 

8.04 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to the
execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be reasonably
agreed upon by Seller and Purchaser. Thereafter, except as otherwise
contemplated by _Section_ _ _ _4.06_ (and, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing
herein shall limit the rights of Seller or its board of directors (or any
duly authorized committee thereof) under _Section_ _ _ _4.06_ ) and except to
the extent disclosed in or consistent with the Proxy Statement, no party
hereto shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other
public announcement or disclosure regarding this Agreement or its subject
matter without the other partyÂ’s prior written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except for any such disclosure that
is required by applicable Law or the rules of any applicable stock exchange or
for press releases or other public statements that are substantially
consistent with prior press releases or other public statements made by
the parties in compliance with this _Section_ _ _ _8.04_.

Seller shall be responsible for the timely payment of all Transfer Taxes
arising out of or incurred in connection with the Sale. The party responsible
under applicable Law for filing the Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer
Taxes shall prepare and timely file such Tax Returns and promptly provide a
copy of such Tax Return to the other party. Seller and Purchaser shall, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to, cooperate to timely prepare and
file any Tax Returns or other filings relating to such Transfer Taxes. For the
avoidance of doubt, the allocation of responsibility for Transfer Taxes
arising out of or incurred in connection with the Reorganization Transactions
are governed by the Reorganization Agreement.

 

8.06 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal,
invalid or unenforceable under present or future Laws effective during the
term hereof, such provision shall be fully severable and this Agreement shall
be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision never comprised a part hereof, and the remaining provisions hereof
shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by the
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by its severance herefrom.
Furthermore, in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision, there shall be added automatically as part of this Agreement a
provision as similar in its terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision as may be possible and be legal, valid and enforceable.

 

8.07 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as set forth in _Section_ _ _
_4.08_ and  _Section_ _ _ _8.15_ , this Agreement is for the sole benefit of
the parties hereto and their permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or
implied, shall give or be construed to give to any Person, other than the
parties hereto and such permitted assigns, any legal or equitable rights
hereunder.

8.08 _Governing Law and Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed by,
and construed and enforced in accordance with, the Laws of the State of
Delaware, without regard to any choice or conflict of Law provision or rule
(whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware. In addition, each of the parties (a) submits to the exclusive
personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery, any other court of
the State of Delaware or any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware in
the event that any dispute (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) arises out
of this Agreement or the Sale or the other Transactions; (b) agrees that
it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or
other request for leave from any such court; (c) agrees that it will not bring
any Action relating to this Agreement or the Sale or the other Transactions in
any court other than the Delaware Court of Chancery, any other court of the
State of Delaware or any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware; and

otherwise, (i) that any such Action is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii)
that any such Action should be transferred or removed to any court other than
one of the above-named courts, (iii) that any such Action should be stayed by
reason of the pendency of some other Action in any court other than one of
the above-named courts, or (iv) that this Agreement or the subject matter
hereof may not be

 



-88- ##### Table of Contents

  

 enforced in or by the above-named courts. Each party hereto agrees that
service of process upon such party in any such Action shall be effective if
notice is given in accordance with  _Section_ _ _ _8.13_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing in this _Section_ _ _ _8.08_ , a party may commence any Action in
any court other than the above-named courts solely for the purpose of
enforcing an order or judgment issued by one of the above-named courts
relating to any dispute (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) arising out
of this Agreement or the Transactions.

 

8.09 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF PURCHASER AND SELLER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER
BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS.

 

8.10 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable harm for which
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy would
occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of
this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of such
party hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at Law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief on
the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at Law or that any award
of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or
in equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction.

8.11 _Headings_. The headings of the sections and subsections of this
Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to
constitute a part hereof.

8.12  _Counterparts_. The parties hereto may execute this Agreement in one or
more counterparts, and each fully executed counterpart shall be deemed an
original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement.

be deemed to include the plural and vice versa and words of one gender shall

have been engaged by Seller and/or its directors to represent them and the
Business Subsidiaries, including the Company, in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. Purchaser (on its behalf and on behalf of
its Affiliates) hereby (a) agrees that, in the event that a dispute arises
after the Closing between Purchaser and/or any of its Affiliates, on the one
hand, and Seller and/or any of its Affiliates, on

 



-91- ##### Table of Contents

  

 the other hand, Counsel may represent Seller and/or any of its Affiliates in
such dispute even though the interests of Seller and/or any of its Affiliates
may be directly adverse to Purchaser, the Business Subsidiaries or any of
their Affiliates and even though Counsel may have represented the Business
Subsidiaries (prior to Closing) in a matter substantially related to such
dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters for Purchaser or the Business
Subsidiaries and (b) waives any conflict in connection therewith. Purchaser
(on its behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates) further agrees that,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, as to all
communications among Counsel, Seller and the Business Subsidiaries (including
any of their respective directors, officers, employees or other
Representatives) (the " _Designated Persons_ ") to the extent relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby are subject to the
attorney-client privilege, and the expectation of client confidence belongs to
Seller and shall be controlled by Seller and shall not pass to or be claimed
by Purchaser, the Business Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates;
_provided_ , that the foregoing shall not extend to any communication not
involving this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or to
communications with any Person other than the Designated Persons and
their advisors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute
arises between Purchaser, the Business Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Affiliates and a third party other than a party to this Agreement after the
Closing, Purchaser may assert (or cause to be asserted) the attorney-client
privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications by Counsel to
such third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent such dispute
relates to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, Purchaser
may not waive (or permit the waiver of) such privilege without the prior
written consent of Seller (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

 

8.16 _Disclosure Schedules_. The Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to be a
part of this Agreement and are fully incorporated into this Agreement by
reference. Any capitalized terms used in any Disclosure Schedule but not
otherwise defined therein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in
this Agreement. The inclusion of any item referenced in one section or
subsection of the Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to refer to (a) the
corresponding section of this Agreement and (b) any other section or
subsection of the Disclosure Schedules (and accordingly to the applicable
sections or subsections of this Agreement), whether or not an explicit cross-
reference appears, if the applicability of such item to the other section or
subsection is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure. The
inclusion of any information in the Disclosure Schedules shall not be deemed
to be an admission or evidence of the materiality of such item, nor shall it
establish a standard of materiality for any purpose whatsoever.

 

8.17 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Disclosure Schedules),
the other Transaction Documents and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute
the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes any prior
understanding, agreements or representations by or between the parties,
written or oral, to the extent they relate in any way to the subject matter
hereof.
