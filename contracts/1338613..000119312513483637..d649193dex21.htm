<TD VALIGN="top"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Upon the occurrence of a change of control event, which occurrence (other than one involving the adoption of a plan relating to liquidation or dissolution) is followed by a ratings
decline within 90 days of the consummation of the transaction, Regency must offer to repurchase the Private Exchange Notes at 101% of the principal amount of the notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase.
A ratings decline is defined as a decrease in the rating of the Private Exchange Notes by both Moody&#146;s Investors Service, Inc. (&#147;Moody&#146;s&#148;) and Standard &amp; Poor&#146;s Ratings Services (&#147;Standard &amp; Poor&#146;s&#148;)
by one or more gradations of the Private Exchange Notes. If holders of not less than 90% of the principal amount of the outstanding Private Exchange Notes accept the change of control offer and Regency purchases all Private Exchange Notes held by
such tendering holders, Regency will have the right to redeem the remaining outstanding Private Exchange Notes at 101% of the principal amount of the Private Exchange Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of
repurchase.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
