2 Section 2.2 _Closing_. The closing of the transactions contemplated hereunder
(the " _Closing"_ ) shall take place at the offices of Vinson and Elkins L.L.P.,
1001 Fannin Street, Suite 2500, Houston, Texas 77002, commencing at 9:00 a.m.,

such conditions at Closing), or at such other place and on such other date or
time as the Parties may mutually agree (the date on which the Closing takes
place, the " _Closing Date"_ ). The Closing shall be deemed to be effective
between the Parties as of 12:01 a.m. (Central Time) on the Closing Date.

Section 2.3  _Contribution Consideration, Closing Adjustment and Closing

(a) The aggregate consideration for the Subject Interests shall be (i)

this Agreement, consisting of cash and common units representing limited
partner interests of Acquirer (" _Acquirer Common Units"_ ), (ii) the
assumption by Acquirer, pursuant to the Debt Assumption Agreement, and
exchange of up to $550,000,000 face amount of Exchange Notes in accordance
with _Section 2.1(b)_ for up to $550,000,000 face amount of Everest Notes
that immediately after the transactions specified in clauses (a) and (b) of
_Section 2.1 _are validly tendered for exchange and not withdrawn as of the
Closing and the retirement and cancellation of up to $550,000,000 face value

exchange and not withdrawn as of the Closing, payment of the Exchange Offer
Adjustment in accordance with _Section 2.3(c)(iv)_ (collectively, the "
_Contribution Consideration_ "). As a result of the effect of clause (iii) of
the preceding sentence, if no Everest Notes are exchanged in the Exchange
Offer, the Contribution Consideration shall be $1,325,000,000.

(b) No later than three Business Days before the Closing Date, Contributor
shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Acquirer, an estimated balance sheet
of the Midstream Business as of 11:59 p.m. (Central Time) on the date
immediately prior to the Closing Date (except as otherwise contemplated by
this Agreement), which estimated balance sheet shall give effect to the Pre-
Closing Transfers even if it has not yet been effected, (the " _Closing
Balance Sheet"_ ), which sets forth a calculation of Working Capital Surplus
or Working Capital Deficiency as of such time and date (" _Estimated Working
Capital Surplus"_ or " _Estimated Working Capital Deficiency,_ "
respectively). The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared by Contributor in
accordance with this Agreement in a manner consistent with, and using the same
principles, policies, methods and practices used in, the preparation of the
Financial Statements, except that it shall give effect to the Pre-Closing
Transfers.

(c) On the Closing Date, Acquirer shall pay to Contributor an amount equal to
the Base Closing Payment adjusted as follows:

(i) increased by the amount of any Estimated Working Capital Surplus;

 

(ii) decreased by the amount of any Estimated Working Capital Deficiency;

 



3 (iii) decreased by the amount of any Closing Contributor Representation Breach
Adjustment, if any; and

(iv) increased by the Exchange Offer Adjustment, if any (the Base Closing
Payment, as so adjusted pursuant to clauses (i) through (iv) being the "
_Closing Contribution Consideration"_ ).

(d) The Closing Contribution Consideration shall be paid on the Closing Date
as follows:

(i) Cash in an amount equal to the Closing Contribution Consideration minus
$200,000,000 (the " _Closing Cash Consideration"_ ), payable by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to such account as shall be designated by
Contributor at least one Business Day prior to Closing; and

(ii) 8,245,859 Acquirer Common Units (such Acquirer Common Units, together
with any additional Acquirer Common Units issued to Contributor in accordance
with _Section 2.4(d),_ being the " _Equity Consideration"_ ) issued to
Contributor and recorded on the books and records of Acquirers transfer
agent, together with an executed certificate of Acquirers transfer agent, in
a form acceptable to Contributor, certifying as to the book entry issuance of
the Acquirer Common Units comprising the Equity Consideration.

 

(e) On the Closing Date, Contributor shall deliver to the Escrow Agent for
deposit into the Escrow Account an amount in cash or immediately available
funds equal to any disputed claims of Contributor Representation Breaches in
accordance with _Section 9.3(d)._

Section 2.4 _Final Adjustment Amount_.

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Closing Date (but in no event later
than 75 days after the Closing Date), Acquirer shall prepare and deliver to
Contributor a balance sheet of the Midstream Business as of 11:59 p.m. on the
date immediately prior to the Closing Date, together with a written report of
Grant Thornton LLP stating that such firm has examined such balance sheet and
that such balance sheet has been prepared in accordance with this Agreement
and in a manner consistent with, and using the same principles, policies and
methods and practices used in, the preparation of the Financial Statements,
except that it shall give effect to the Pre-Closing Transfer (the " _Final
Balance Sheet"_ ), which shall set forth the components of Working Capital to
enable Contributor and Acquirer to calculate the amount of Working Capital ("
_Closing Working Capital"_ ) and the amount of Working Capital Surplus or
Working Capital Deficiency, in each case, as of such time and date ("
_Closing Working Capital Surplus"_ or " _Closing Working Capital Deficiency"_
, as the case may be). The Final Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance
with this Agreement in a manner consistent with, and using the same
principles, policies, methods and practices used in, the preparation of the
Financial Statements, except that it shall give effect to the Pre-Closing
Transfer. Following the delivery of the Final Balance Sheet to Contributor,
Acquirer shall afford Contributor and its Representatives the opportunity to
examine the Final Balance Sheet, and such supporting schedules, analyses,
workpapers, including any audit workpapers, and other underlying records or
documentation as are reasonably necessary and appropriate. Acquirer shall
cooperate fully and promptly with

 



4  Contributor and its Representatives in such examination, including providing
answers to questions asked by Contributor and its Representatives, and
Acquirer shall promptly make available to Contributor and its Representatives
any records under the reasonable control of Acquirer that are requested by
Contributor and its Representatives.

(b) If within 45 days following delivery of the Final Balance Sheet to
Contributor, Contributor has not delivered to Acquirer written notice (the "
_Objection Notice_ ") of its objections to the Final Balance Sheet, then
Closing Working Capital and Closing Working Capital Surplus or Closing Working
Capital Deficiency, as applicable, as set forth in or derived from such Final
Balance Sheet shall be deemed final and conclusive and shall be " _Final
Working Capital"_ and " _Final Working Capital Surplus"_ or " _Final Working
Capital Deficiency,_ " respectively. If Contributor delivers the Objection
Notice within such 45 day period, then Acquirer and Contributor shall
endeavor in good faith to resolve the objections for a period not to exceed 15
days from the date of delivery of the Objection Notice and the " _Final
Working Capital"_ and " _Final Working Capital Surplus"_ or " _Final Working
Capital Deficiency"_ shall be determined pursuant to _Section 2.4(c)._

 

(c) If at the end of the 15 day period referenced in the last sentence of
_Section 2.4(b),_ there are any objections that remain in dispute, then the
remaining objections in dispute shall be submitted for resolution to an
accounting firm to be selected jointly by Contributor and Acquirer within the
following five days or, if the Contributor and Acquirer are unable
to mutually agree within such five day period, such accounting firm shall be
Ernst and Young LLP (such jointly selected accounting firm or Ernst and Young LLP,
the " _Referee"_ ). Acquirer and Contributor shall concurrently submit
written statements to the Referee (with a copy to the other party) setting
forth their respective positions regarding the calculation of Final Working
Capital and Final Working Capital Surplus or Final Working Capital Deficiency
(each such written statement a " _Position Statement"_ ). The Referee shall
determine any unresolved items of Final Working Capital and Final Working
Capital Surplus or Final Working Capital Deficiency as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the objections that remain in dispute are submitted to it,
but in any event within 30 days after the objections that remain in dispute
are submitted to it. If any objections are submitted to the Referee for
resolution, (i) each of Acquirer and Contributor shall furnish to the Referee
such workpapers and other documents and information relating to such
objections as the Referee may request and are available to that party or its
Subsidiaries (or its independent public accountants) and will be afforded the
opportunity to present to the Referee any material relating to the
determination of the matters in dispute and to discuss such determination with
the Referee; (ii) the Referee shall only be authorized to choose
between Contributors calculation of Final Working Capital and Acquirers
calculation of Final Working Capital (as each position had been disclosed to
the other in its respective Position Statement); and (iii) the determination
by the Referee of the Final Working Capital, as set forth in a written notice
delivered to both Acquirer and Contributor by the Referee, shall be made in
accordance with this Agreement and shall be binding and conclusive on the
parties and, absent manifest error, shall constitute an arbitral award that
is final, binding and unappealable and upon which a judgment may be entered by
a court having jurisdiction thereof. Acquirer and Contributor shall each bear
their own legal fees and other costs in connection with any such objection;
provided that Acquirer, on one hand, and Contributor, on the other hand, shall
bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Referee. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Referee and procedures set
forth herein shall be the sole method for resolving any disputes regarding the
Final Working Capital or the provisions of this _Section 2.4._

 



5 (d) To the extent that the Final Adjustment Amount _minus_ the Closing
Adjustment Amount is a positive number greater than $1,000,000, such
aggregate amount of the excess (the " _Final Adjustment Surplus"_ ) shall be
paid by Acquirer within two Business Days of the determination of the Final
Adjustment Amount to Contributor. To the extent that the Final Adjustment
Amount _minus_ the Closing Adjustment Amount is a negative number with an
absolute value greater than $1,000,000, such aggregate amount of the
deficiency (the " _Final Adjustment Deficiency"_ ) shall be paid by
Contributor within two Business Days of the determination of the Final
Adjustment Amount provided to Acquirer; _provided,_ _however,_ that if the
Acquirer fails to deliver to Contributor the Final Balance Sheet within 75
days after the Closing Date, any Final Working Capital Deficiency shall be
deemed to be zero and no amounts shall be paid to Acquirer pursuant to this
_Section 2.4(d)._ All payments required to be made pursuant to the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 2.4(d)_ shall be made, at Contributors election,
(i) in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds; (ii) in Acquirer
Common Units equal to (A) the value of such payment divided by (B) the
Adjustment Consideration Price; or (iii) in cash and Acquirer Common Units in
a ratio designated by Contributor, with the number of such Acquirer Common
Units to be equal to (A) the value of such payment designated by Contributor
to be paid in Acquirer Common Units divided by (B) the Adjustment
Consideration Price. For purposes of this Agreement, (i) " _Final Adjustment
Amount_ " means an amount equal to any Final Working Capital Surplus _minus_
any Final Working Capital Deficiency, subject to adjustment as set forth in
_Section 9.3(e)_ and (ii) " _Closing Adjustment Amount"_ means an amount
equal to any Estimated Working Capital Surplus _minus_ any Estimated Working
Capital Deficiency.

Section 2.5 _Registration Rights Agreement_. At Closing, Acquirer and
Contributor shall execute a Registration Rights Agreement in substantially the
same form attached as _Exhibit C_ (the " _Registration Rights Agreement"_ )
hereto pursuant to which, among other things, Acquirer will file a
registration statement with the Commission as promptly as practicable, but in
any event by the close of business on the business day following the Closing
(except as otherwise provided in the Registration Rights Agreement),
to register for resale the Equity Consideration issued to Contributor
(including any Equity Consideration received by Contributor in accordance with

6 ARTICLE III

_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF CONTRIBUTOR_

Except as set forth in (a) the Contributor SEC Documents (but only to the
extent reasonably apparent as relating to the Midstream Business, and
excluding any disclosure contained in any such Contributor SEC Documents under
the heading "Risk Factors" or "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements" or similar heading) or (b) in Contributors Disclosure Schedules,
Contributor represents and warrants to Acquirer as follows:

 

Section 3.1 _Existence and Good Standing_. Contributor is a limited
partnership validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State
of Delaware. _Section 3.1_ of Contributors Disclosure Schedules sets forth a
complete list of the Midstream Entities. Each of the Midstream Entities is (i)
a limited partnership or limited liability company, as the case may be,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of
organization with the requisite limited partnership or limited liability
company, as the case may be, power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and assets, to carry on its business as presently conducted,
after giving effect to the Pre-Closing Transfers, and (ii) duly licensed or
qualified to do business and in good standing to do business as a foreign
limited partnership or limited liability company, as the case may be, in each
jurisdiction in which the conduct or nature of its business or the ownership,
leasing, holding or operating of its properties makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except such jurisdictions where the failure to be so
licensed, qualified or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate,
would not have a Midstream Material Adverse Effect. Contributor has made
available to Acquirer copies of the Organizational Documents of each
Midstream Entity, and such Organizational Documents are in full force and
effect.

 

Section 3.2 _Validity of Agreement; Authorization_. Contributor has the
limited partnership power and authority to enter into the Transaction
Documents to which it is or will be party and, subject to receipt of the
Unitholder Approval, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby. The execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents and
the performance of Contributors obligations thereunder have been duly
authorized by the board of directors (the " _Contributor Board"_ ) of the
general partner of Contributors general partner (" _Contributor GP"_ ) and
no other authorizations on the part of Contributor or any Midstream Entity are
necessary to authorize such execution and delivery and, subject to receipt of
the Unitholder Approval, Contributors performance hereunder. Each of
the Transaction Documents to which Contributor is or will be a party has been
(in the case of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents executed on the
date hereof), or will be at the Closing (in the case of any other Transaction
Documents), duly executed and delivered by Contributor and, assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery of such Transaction Document by the
other parties thereto, constitutes, or will constitute at the Closing, as
applicable, Contributors valid and binding obligation, enforceable against
Contributor in accordance with its terms (except to the extent that its
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or other similar Law affecting the enforcement of creditors
rights generally or by general equitable principles).

Section 3.3 _Consents and Approvals_. Except for (a) filings required under,
and compliance with, applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the
Securities Act, including the filing of a proxy statement with the Commission
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Proxy
Statement"_ ) or (b) filings required under, and compliance with, applicable
requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _HSR
Act"_ ), no consent, approval, waiver or authorization of, or filing,
registration or qualification with, any Governmental Authority is required on
the part of Contributor for Contributor to execute and deliver the
Transaction Documents to which it is or will be party or to perform its
respective obligations thereunder, other than any consent, approval, waiver or
authorization, the failure of which to be obtained or made would not
materially impair or delay the ability of Contributor to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents.

 



7 Section 3.4 _No Breach_. The execution, delivery and performance
by Contributor of the Transaction Documents to which it is or will be a
party, and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
do not and will not (a) result in any breach or violation of any provision of
any Organizational Document of any Midstream Entity, (b) assuming that the
authorizations, consents and approvals referred to in _Section 3.3_ and the
Unitholder Approval are obtained and the filings referred to in _Section 3.3_
are made, (i) violate any provision of any Law applicable to any Midstream
Entity, (ii) result in any material violation or breach of or constitute (with
or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a material default under any
Midstream Material Agreement to which any Midstream Entity is a party or by
which any Midstream Entity may be bound or receives any material right or
benefit, or (iii) except as expressly provided in the Transaction Documents,
result in the loss of benefit of, or acceleration of any obligation of, any
Midstream Entity, of any right, remedy or benefit, including any right of
offer, refusal, termination, cancellation or acceleration, under any Contract
to which any Midstream Entity is a party or by which any Midstream Entity or
any of their respective properties may be bound or receives any material right
or benefit, except, with respect to each of clauses (b)(i) and (b)(iii), such
violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults, losses or accelerations
that, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Midstream Material
Adverse Effect.

Section 3.5 _Ownership, Due Authorization and Transfer of Subject Interests_.

(a) Contributor is the record and beneficial owner, free and clear of any and
all Encumbrances (other than Encumbrances existing under Contributors Second
Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership (the " _Partnership
Agreement"_ ) or those arising under applicable securities Laws, and other
than Encumbrances under the Contributor Credit Agreement that will be released
in full at Closing), of (a) 100% of the equity interests in (i) Marketing LLC,
(ii) Pipeline LLC and (iii) ERGS and (b) 100% of the limited partner
interests in (i) Pipeline LP and (ii) Midstream LP. Pipeline LLC is the
beneficial owner of 100% of the general partner interests in Pipeline LP and
Midstream LP, free and clear of any and all Encumbrances (other than
Encumbrances existing under the Partnership Agreement or those arising under
applicable securities Laws, and other than Encumbrances under the Contributor
Credit Agreement that will be released in full at Closing). Subject to receipt
of the Unitholder Approval, Contributor has the power, authority and legal
capacity to contribute, transfer, assign and deliver such Subject Interests as
provided in this Agreement, and such delivery will convey to Acquirer good
title to such Subject Interests, free and clear of any and all Encumbrances
(other than Encumbrances existing under the Partnership Agreement and those
arising under applicable securities Laws). The Subject Interests constitute
all of Contributors ownership interests in the Midstream Entities.

(b) There are no outstanding options, warrants or similar rights to purchase
or acquire from Contributor any of the Subject Interests.

(c) The ownership as of the date of this Agreement of all issued and
outstanding limited liability company interests or partnership interests, as
applicable, in each Midstream Entity is set forth on _Section 3.5(c)_ of the
Contributors Disclosure Schedules. Except as contemplated by this Agreement,
there is no security, option, warrant, right, call, subscription agreement,
commitment or understanding of any nature whatsoever to which Contributor or a
Midstream Entity is a party, that directly or indirectly (i) calls for the
issuance, sale, pledge or 

 



8  other disposition of limited liability company interests or partnership
interests, as applicable, of a Midstream Entity or any securities convertible
into, or other rights to acquire, any limited liability company interests or
partnership interests, as applicable, of a Midstream Entity, (ii) obligates a
Midstream Entity to grant, offer or enter into any of the foregoing or (iii)
relates to the voting or control of such limited liability company interests
or partnership interests, as applicable, except the Voting Agreement. No
Midstream Entity is a party to, or otherwise bound by, any voting trust, proxy
or other agreement, restricting or otherwise relating to the
voting, distribution rights or disposition of any limited liability company
interests or partnership interests, as applicable. None of the Midstream
Entities own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock, membership interest,
partnership interest, joint venture interest or other equity interests in any
Person, other than a Midstream Entity or a Joint Venture Entity.

 

Section 3.6 _Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities_.

 

(a) Except (i) as reflected or otherwise reserved against on the balance sheet
of Contributor and its Subsidiaries as of September 30, 2013 (the " _Balance
Sheet Date"_ ) (including the notes thereto) included in the Contributor SEC
Documents filed by Contributor and publicly available prior to the date of
this Agreement, (ii) for liabilities and obligations incurred since the
Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice (and not arising out of a breach of or default under any Contract to
which any Midstream Entity is a party or any violation of Law), (iii)
liabilities arising under Midstream Permits and (iv) for liabilities and
obligations incurred under or in accordance with this Agreement or in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, none of the
Midstream Entities, as of the date of this Agreement, has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether or not accrued or contingent), that would
be required to be reflected or reserved against on a consolidated balance
sheet of Contributor prepared in accordance with GAAP or the notes thereto.

(b) As of the Closing Date and after giving effect to the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents, except as shown
in _Section 3.6(b)_ of Contributors Disclosure Schedules, no Midstream
Entity will have any outstanding Indebtedness.

 

(c) None of the Midstream Entities is a party to, or has any commitment to
become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any
similar contract (including any contract or arrangement relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among any of the Midstream Entities, on
the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any
structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on
the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K of the Commission)), where the purpose of such
contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or
material liabilities of, the Midstream Entities in Contributors published
financial statements or any Contributor SEC Documents.

 

Section 3.7 _Contributor Financial Statements_.

 

(a) Since January 1, 2012, Contributor has filed and furnished with the
Commission the forms, registration statements, reports, schedules and

Agreement, together with all documents filed on a voluntary basis on Form 8-K,
and in each case including all exhibits and schedules thereto and documents
incorporated by reference therein, the " _Contributor SEC Documents"_ ;
provided, however, Contributor makes no representation or warranty with
respect to any exhibits and schedules included in the Contributor SEC
Documents). At the time filed (except to the extent corrected by a
subsequently filed Contributor SEC Document prior to the date hereof), each
Contributor SEC Document, with respect to the Midstream Business only,
complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act
and did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state
a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. In the case of
registration statements, on the dates of effectiveness of such registration

SEC Document prior to the date hereof), each Contributor SEC Document, with
respect to the Midstream Business only, complied in all materials respects
with the requirements of the Securities Act and did not contain any untrue

extent permitted by applicable Commission regulations), and (iii) fairly

real property) or the third-party owner or lessee under the applicable lease
(with respect to the leased real properties)). Except as would not be material
to the Acquirer Entities, taken as a whole, all leases under which any of the
Acquirer Entities lease any real property (other than hydrocarbon interests)
are valid and effective against such Acquirer Entities and, to Acquirers
Knowledge, the counterparties thereto, in accordance with their respective
terms and there is not, under any of such leases, any existing material
default by any of the Acquirer Entities or, to Acquirers Knowledge, the
counterparties thereto, or, to Acquirers Knowledge, any event which, with
notice or lapse of time or both, would become a material default by any of
the Acquirer Entities, or, to Acquirers Knowledge, the counterparties
thereto.

(b) All tangible personal property owned, leased or licensed by the
applicable Acquirer Entity that is material to the operations of the Acquirer
Entity is, in all material respects, in good repair, working order and
operating condition and adequate for its present uses by the Acquirer Entity,
ordinary wear and tear excepted.

(c) Each of the Acquirer Entities owns or has the right to use such rights-
of-way as are sufficient to conduct its business in the manner currently
conducted, except for (i) Permitted Encumbrances and (ii) such rights-of-way
the absence of which would not materially affect the operation of
the business of the Acquirer Entities, taken as a whole.

 



27 Section 4.12 _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there are
no material Proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of Acquirer, threatened,
against any Acquirer Entity or to which any Acquirer Entity is otherwise a
party or, to the Knowledge of Acquirer, a threatened party.

 

Section 4.13 _Tax Matters_.

(a) All material Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect to any of
the Acquirer Entities have been timely filed (taking into account extensions
of time for filing), and such Tax Returns are true, complete and accurate in
all material respects;

(b) All material Taxes owed by or with respect to any of the
Acquirer Entities have been duly and timely paid in full;

(c) For the most recent four complete calendar quarters, at least 90% of
the combined gross income of the Acquirer has been income which is
"qualifying income" within the meaning of Section 7704(d) of the Code; and

(d) For U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) Acquirer is properly treated as
a partnership and (ii) Acquirer Sub is properly disregarded as an entity
separate from Acquirer.

 

This _Section 4.13_ constitutes the sole and exclusive representations and
warranties of the Acquirer Entities with respect to Tax matters.

Section 4.14 _Intellectual Property_. Each of the Acquirer Entities owns or
has the right to use all Intellectual Property necessary for the operation of
the businesses of each of the Acquirer Entities as presently conducted
(collectively, the " _Acquirer Intellectual Property"_ ) free and clear of all
Encumbrances except for Permitted Encumbrances, except where the failure to
own or have the right to use such Intellectual Property would not be material
to the Acquirer Entities, taken as a whole. To the Knowledge of the Acquirer
Parties, the use of the Acquirer Intellectual Property by the Acquirer
Entities in the operation of the business of each of the Acquirer Entities as
presently conducted does not infringe upon or misappropriate any Intellectual
Property of any other Person, except for such matters that would not be
material to the Acquirer Entities, taken as a whole.

Section 4.15 _Books and Records_. The books, records and files of the
Acquirer Entities are, in all material respects, (a) complete and correct and
represent actual, bona fide transactions, (b) maintained in accordance with
sound business practices and GAAP where applicable, include the maintenance
of an adequate system of internal controls, (c) kept with reasonable detail so
that such books, records and files accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions, acquisitions and dispositions of the Acquirer Entities, and (d)
maintained to provide accountability for assets recorded in such books and
records compared with existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate
action has been taken with respect to any differences.

 



28 Section 4.16 _Insurance_. All material assets of Acquirer Entities
are covered by valid insurance policies, such policies are in full force and
effect and all premiums due and payable on such insurance policies have been
paid in accordance with the payment terms of each insurance policy. Such
insurance policies in such types and amounts and covering such risks as are
consistent with customary practices and standards of companies engaged in
businesses and operations and with an ownership structure similar to that of
the Acquirer Business, taken as a whole. As of the date hereof, no written
notice has been received by any Acquirer Entity that would reasonably be
expected to be followed by a written notice of cancellation, alteration of
coverage or non-renewal of any such insurance policy.

 

Section 4.17 _Exchange Offer Documents_. The Exchange Offer Documents will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Acquirer makes no representation or warranty
with respect to any portion of the Exchange Offer Documents relating to the
Consent Solicitation or any information supplied in writing by the Contributor
specifically for inclusion in the Exchange Offer Documents. As of the date on
which the Exchange Offer is consummated, the indenture relating to the
Exchange Notes Indenture will comply in all material respects with the Trust
Indenture Act. The Exchange Notes Indenture, the Exchange Notes, the
Registered Exchange Notes and the Exchange Offer Registration Rights Agreement
will conform in all material respects to the descriptions thereof to be
included in the Exchange Offer Documents.

Section 4.18  _Available Funds_. Acquirer has, or shall have on the Closing
Date, available (through cash on hand or existing credit arrangements,
arrangements with its Affiliates or otherwise) the necessary Closing Cash
Consideration for the acquisition of the Subject Interests pursuant to this
Agreement and to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

Section 4.19  _Financial Advisors_. Neither of the Acquirer Parties has
incurred any liability for fees of any broker, finder or financial advisor in
respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for which
Contributor will have any responsibility or liability whatsoever.

 _COVENANTS_

Section 5.1 _Consummation of the Transaction_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Acquirer
Parties and Contributor shall cooperate with the other and use (and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) its commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to
be done, all things, necessary, proper or advisable to cause the conditions to
the Closing to be satisfied as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any
event no later than the Outside Date) and to consummate and make effective
the Midstream Contribution, including preparing and filing all documentation
to effect all necessary filings, notifications, notices, petitions,
statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications and other
documents (including any required or recommended filings under applicable
Antitrust Laws), (ii) obtain all approvals, consents, clearances, expirations
or terminations of waiting periods, registrations, 

 



29  permits, authorizations and other confirmations from any Governmental
Authority or third party necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
Midstream Contribution, (iii) defend any lawsuits or other legal proceedings,
whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the Midstream Contribution and (iv) obtain all necessary
consents, approvals or waivers from third parties. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Antitrust Laws"_ means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton
Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended,
and all other applicable Laws issued by a Governmental Authority that
are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the
purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of
competition.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Party hereto
agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Midstream Contribution as
promptly as practicable and in any event within 20 Business Days after the
date of this Agreement and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested by any
Governmental Authority pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law and
use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken
(including by their respective Subsidiaries), all other actions consistent
with this _Section 5.1_ necessary to cause the expiration or termination of
the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable (and
in any event no later than the Outside Date). Acquirer shall pay any filing
fees for the filings made pursuant to the HSR Act.

(c) Each of the Parties hereto shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any
filing or submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and in connection with any investigation or
other inquiry by or before a Governmental Authority relating to the Midstream
Contribution, including any proceeding initiated by a private Person, (ii)
promptly inform the other party of (and supply to the other party) copies of
(or, in the case of oral communications, advise the other party orally of)
any communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the
Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice,
or any other Governmental Authority and any communication received or given
in connection with any proceeding by a private Person, in each case regarding
the Midstream Contribution, (iii) permit the other party to review in advance
and incorporate the other Partys reasonable comments in any communication to
be given by it to any Governmental Authority with respect to obtaining any
clearances required under any Antitrust Law in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and (iv) consult with the other party in
advance of any meeting or teleconference with any Governmental Authority or,
in connection with any proceeding by a private Person, with any other Person,
and, to the extent not prohibited by the Governmental Authority, give the
other party a reasonable opportunity to attend and participate in such
meetings and teleconferences. Subject to _Section 5.5,_ the Parties shall
take reasonable efforts to share information protected from disclosure under
the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense privilege
or any other privilege pursuant to this _Section 5.1_ in a manner so as to
preserve the applicable privilege.

(d) The Acquirer Parties each agree to take, or cause to be taken (including
by its Subsidiaries), any and all steps and to make, or cause to be made
(including by its Subsidiaries), any and all undertakings necessary to
resolve such objections, if any, that a Governmental

 



30  Authority may assert under any Antitrust Law with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, and to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any Governmental
Authority with respect to the Midstream Contribution, in each case, so as to
enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable and in any event no
later than the Outside Date, including, without limitation, (x) proposing,
negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any businesses,
assets, equity interests, product lines or properties of Acquirer (or any
of its Subsidiaries) or the Midstream Entities or any equity interest in any
joint venture held by Acquirer (or any of its Subsidiaries) or the Midstream
Entities, (y) creating, terminating or divesting relationships, ventures,
contractual rights or obligations of the Acquirer (or any of its
Subsidiaries) or the Midstream Entities and (z) otherwise taking or committing
to take any action that would limit Acquirers freedom of action with respect
to, or its ability to retain or hold, directly or indirectly, any businesses,
assets, equity interests, product lines or properties of Acquirer (including
any of its Subsidiaries) or the Midstream Entities or any equity interest in
any joint venture held by Acquirer (or any of its Subsidiaries) or the
Midstream Entities, in each case as may be required in order to obtain all
approvals, consents, clearances, expirations or terminations of waiting
periods, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations
required directly or indirectly under any Antitrust Law or to avoid the
commencement of any action to prohibit the transactions contemplated hereby
under any Antitrust Law, or, in the alternative, to avoid the entry of, or to
effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or
other order in any action or proceeding seeking to prohibit the Midstream
Contribution or delay the Closing beyond the Outside Date. To assist the
Acquirer Parties in complying with its obligations set forth in this _Section
5.1,_ Contributor shall, and shall cause the Midstream Entities to, enter into
one or more agreements requested by Acquirer to be entered into by any of them
prior to the Closing with respect to any transaction to divest, hold separate
or otherwise take any action that limits the Midstream Entities freedom of
action, ownership or control with respect to, or their ability to retain or
hold, directly or indirectly, any of the businesses, assets,
equity interests, product lines or properties of the Midstream Entities or
any equity interest in any joint venture held by the Midstream Entities (each,
a " _Divestiture Action"_ ); provided, however, that (i) the consummation of
the transactions provided for in any such agreement for a Divestiture Action
(a " _Divestiture Agreement"_ ) shall be conditioned upon the Closing or
satisfaction of all of the conditions to the Closing in a case where the
Closing will occur immediately following such Divestiture Action (and where
Acquirer has irrevocably committed to effect the Closing immediately following
such Divestiture Action) and (ii) the Acquirer Parties shall indemnify for and
hold Contributor and the Midstream Entities harmless from all costs, expenses
and liabilities incurred by Contributor or any Midstream Entity arising from
or relating to such Divestiture Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the
Acquirer Parties be required to take any Divestiture Action that requires the
divestiture of any assets of Acquirer, its Affiliates or related to the
Midstream Business that either individually or in the aggregate exceed
$100,000,000.

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties
contained in this  _Section 5.1,_ if any administrative or judicial action
or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private Person, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging the Midstream Contribution as
violative of any Antitrust Law, (i) each of Acquirer and Contributor shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist any such action or
proceeding and to have

 



31  vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Midstream
Contribution, and (ii) Acquirer shall indemnify for and hold Contributor and
the Midstream Entities harmless from all costs, expenses and liabilities
incurred by Contributor or any Midstream Entity arising from or relating to
contesting and resisting such proceeding or seeking to vacate, lift, reverse
or overturn any such decree, judgment, injunction or other order.

Section 5.2 _Conduct Pending the Closing_.

(a) Except as specifically identified on Section 5.2 of Contributors
Disclosure Schedules or as otherwise expressly provided by this Agreement or
with the prior written consent of Acquirer (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), from the date hereof until
the Closing or termination of this Agreement as provided in _Article VIII_ ,
Contributor shall, and shall cause each Midstream Entity to:

Benefit Plan or as specifically agreed to in writing between Acquirer and
Contributor as part of the transactions contemplated hereby, (A) not enter
into any new or amend any existing compensatory plan, agreement or arrangement
for the benefit of any Midstream Business Employee or in which any Midstream
Business Employee participates (including any Contributor Employee Benefit
Plan) or with respect to which any Midstream Entity could have any material
liability or (B) increase the salary, wages, bonuses or other compensation or
benefits of any Midstream Business Employee by more than 10% as compared to
the level as of the date of this Agreement;

(ix) not terminate the employment of any Midstream Business Employee other
than for "cause";

(x) not, with respect to the Midstream Entities or the Midstream Business,
make or change any election in respect of Taxes, amend any Tax Return, adopt
or change any accounting method in respect of Taxes (other than changes
required by Law), or settle or compromise any Tax Liability, in each case,
other than those adoptions, changes, elections, settlements, or compromises
which would reasonably be expected to not materially increase the
Tax liability of the Midstream Entities or any direct or indirect owner of
the Midstream Entities for any taxable period beginning after the Closing
Date;

(xi) not agree to take any affirmative action to, with respect to the Joint
Venture Entities, cause such Joint Venture Entity to make or change any
election in respect of Taxes, amend any Tax Return, adopt or change any
accounting method in respect of Taxes (other than changes required by Law), or
settle or compromise any Tax Liability, in each case, other than those
adoptions, changes, elections, settlements, or compromises which
would reasonably be expected to not materially increase the Tax liability of
the Midstream Entities or any direct or indirect owner of the Midstream
Entities for any taxable period beginning after the Closing Date;

 

(xii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the insurance
policies in respect of the Midstream Entities consistent with past practice;

expected to have an adverse impact on the Midstream Business in excess of
$5,000,000, (A) not enter into any Contract that could constitute a Midstream
Material Agreement, (B) not grant any waiver of any material term under, or

(xv) not agree to take any action prohibited by this _Section 5.2(a)._

 

Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, the Midstream Entities may

the foregoing, and at or prior to the Closing, Contributor may continue to
manage the Midstream Entities cash through intercompany accounts and cash
management arrangements consistent with past practices.

 



33 (b) Except as otherwise expressly provided by this Agreement, actions required
to be taken in connection with the transactions contemplated in the Merger
Agreement or with the prior written consent of Contributor (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) from the date
hereof until the Closing or termination of this Agreement as provided in
_Article VIII,_ Acquirer shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to:

(i) operate in all material respects in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practices and use its commercially reasonable efforts to
preserve its present business operations and organization (including key
employees);

 

(ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to preserve intact its current

Section 5.3 _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Unitholder Meeting_.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable and, in any event, by January 31, 2014,
Contributor shall prepare and file with the Commission the Proxy Statement in
connection with the Unitholder Meeting. Contributor shall (i) use its
commercially reasonable efforts to respond to any comments on the Proxy
Statement or requests for additional information from the Commission as soon
as reasonably practicable after receipt of any such comments or requests and
(ii) cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the holders of Contributors
common units of limited partner interests (each a " _Common Unitholder,_ "
and collectively, the " _Common Unitholders"_ ) as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the date of this Agreement.

 

(b) Contributor shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of
this Agreement (taking into account any review by the Commission of the Proxy
Statement), establish a record date for, and as soon as reasonably practicable
following the Proxy Statement being declared effective by the Commission, duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of its Common
Unitholders (the " _Unitholder Meeting"_ ) for the purpose of obtaining the
Unitholder Approval. Subject to _Section 5.4,_ Contributor shall, through the
Contributor Board, 

 



34  recommend to the Common Unitholders approval of this Agreement and the
Midstream Contribution (the " _Contributor Board Recommendation"_ ).
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Contributor may
postpone or adjourn the Unitholder Meeting (i) to solicit additional proxies
for the purpose of obtaining Unitholder Approval, (ii) for the absence of
quorum, (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and/or
mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that Contributor has
determined after consultation with outside legal counsel is necessary under
applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to
be disseminated and reviewed by the Common Unitholders prior to Unitholder
Meeting, and (iv) if Contributor has delivered any notice contemplated by
_Section 5.4(d)_ or _Section 5.4(e)_ and the time periods contemplated by 
_Section 5.4(d)_ or _Section 5.4(e)_ have not expired. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if there occurs a Contributor
Change in Recommendation in accordance with this Agreement, Contributor shall
not be required to call, hold or convene the Unitholder Meeting.

Section 5.4 _Alternative Proposals; Change in Recommendation_.

(a) Contributor shall, and it shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with
respect to an Alternative Proposal, and request the return or destruction of
all confidential information previously provided to such parties by or on
behalf of the Contributor or its Subsidiaries. Except as permitted by this
_Section 5.4,_ Contributor shall not, and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause its Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
initiate or solicit any inquiries or the making or submission of any
Alternative Proposal, or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any Person any non-public information with respect
to, any Alternative Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this _Section 5.4,_ if at any time following the date of this
Agreement and prior to obtaining the Unitholder Approval, (i) Contributor has
received a written Alternative Proposal that the Contributor Board believes is
bona fide and (ii) the Contributor Board, after consultation with its
financial advisors and its outside legal counsel, determines in good faith
that such Alternative Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to
lead to or result in a Superior Proposal, then Contributor may, subject to
clauses (x) and (y) below, (A) furnish information, including
confidential information, with respect to Contributor and its Subsidiaries
(including the Midstream Entities) to the Person making such Alternative
Proposal and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such
Alternative Proposal; provided that (x) Contributor will not, and will use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives not to, disclose
any non-public information to such Person unless Contributor has, or first
enters into, a confidentiality agreement with such Person with
confidentiality provisions that are not materially less restrictive to such
Person than the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement are to Acquirer
(including, without limitation, the inclusion of "standstill" provisions or
similar restrictions) and (y) Contributor will provide to Acquirer any non-
public information about the Midstream Entities that was not previously
provided or available to Acquirer prior to or substantially concurrently
with providing or making available such non-public information to such other
Person.

(b) In addition to the obligations of Contributor set forth in this _Section
5.4,_ Contributor shall promptly (and in no event later than seventy-two (72)
hours after receipt) advise Acquirer in writing of any Alternative Proposal
(and any changes thereto) and the 

 



35  material terms and conditions of any such Alternative Proposal but need not
provide the identity of the Person making any such Alternative Proposal.
Contributor shall keep Acquirer reasonably informed of material developments
with respect to any such Alternative Proposal.

(c) Except as otherwise provided in this  _Section 5.4,_ the Contributor
Board shall not: (i) (A) withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to
Acquirer the Contributor Board Recommendation or (B) publicly approve or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Alternative
Proposal (any action described in this _Section 5.4(c)(i)_ being referred to
as a " _Contributor Change in Recommendation"_ ); or (ii) approve, adopt or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend, or allow
Contributor or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement, or other similar contract or any tender or exchange offer providing
for, with respect to, or in connection with, any Alternative Proposal.

 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Contributor receives (i) a written
Alternative Proposal or (ii) another proposal or offer that, in either case,
the Contributor Board believes is bona fide and the Contributor Board, after
consultation with its financial advisors and its outside legal counsel,
concludes that such Alternative Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal,
then the Contributor Board may at any time prior to obtaining the Unitholder
Approval, terminate this Agreement and pay Acquirer a Termination Fee and/or
effect a Contributor Change in Recommendation; provided, however, that the
Contributor Board may not take such action pursuant to the foregoing unless:

(i) Contributor has provided prior written notice to Acquirer specifying in
reasonable detail the reasons for such action (including a description of the
material terms of such Superior Proposal and delivering to Acquirer a copy of
the proposed definitive agreement providing for such Superior Proposal, in the
form to be entered into and any other relevant proposed transaction
agreements, at least three calendar days in advance of taking any action with
respect to a Contributor Change in Recommendation, unless at the time such
notice is otherwise required to be given there are less than three calendar
days prior to the Unitholder Meeting, in which case Contributor shall provide
as much notice as is reasonably practicable (the period inclusive of all such
days, the " _Notice Period"_ ); and 

(ii) during the Notice Period Contributor has negotiated, and has used
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its financial advisors and outside
legal counsel to negotiate, with Acquirer in good faith (to the extent
Acquirer desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that such Superior Proposal ceases to
constitute (in the judgment of the Contributor Board) a Superior Proposal.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Contributor Board shall be permitted, at any time prior to obtaining the
Unitholder Approval, other than in connection with an Alternative Proposal, to
make a Contributor Change in Recommendation but only if prior to taking any
such action, the Contributor Board determines in good faith, in consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law and Contributor has given 48
hours advance notice to Acquirer that Contributor intends to take such
action.

 



36 (f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Contributor or the
Contributor Board from taking and disclosing to the Common Unitholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the Common Unitholders) or from
making any legally required disclosure to Common Unitholders. Any "stop-look-
and-listen" communication by Contributor or the Contributor Board to the
Common Unitholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange
Act (or any similar communication to the Common Unitholders) shall not be
considered a failure to make, or a withdrawal, modification or change in any
manner adverse to Acquirer and its Affiliates of, all or a portion of the
Contributor Recommendation.

 

(g) For purposes of this Agreement:

(i) " _Alternative Proposal"_ means any proposal or offer from any Person or
"group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), other than Acquirer
and its Subsidiaries, relating to any direct or indirect acquisition (whether
in a single transaction or a series of related transactions), outside of the
ordinary course of business, of assets of the Midstream Entities equal to 20%
or more of the consolidated assets of the Midstream Business or to which 20%
or more of Contributors revenues or earnings with respect to the Midstream
Business on a consolidated basis are attributable, other than the transactions
contemplated hereby. 

(ii) " _Superior Proposal"_ means a bona fide written offer, obtained after
the date of this Agreement and not in breach of this _Section 5.4_ (other
than an immaterial breach), to acquire, directly or indirectly, more than 50%
of the outstanding equity securities of Contributor or more than 50% of the
combined assets of Contributor, made by a third party, which is on terms and
conditions which Contributor Board determines in good faith to be more
favorable to the Common Unitholders than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, taking into account at the time of determination any changes to
the terms of this Agreement that as of that time had been committed to by
Acquirer in writing and the ability of the Person making such proposal to
consummate the transactions contemplated by such proposal (based upon, among
other things, the availability of financing and the expectation of obtaining
required approvals).

Section 5.5 _Access to Information_.

(a) At all times from the date hereof until the Closing Date, Contributor
will, and will cause the Midstream Entities to, and the Acquirer Parties will
(as applicable, the " _Disclosing Party"_ ), during normal business hours and
upon reasonable request (i) provide the Acquirer Parties and their
Representatives or Contributor and its Representatives (as applicable, the "
_Accessing Party"_ ) reasonable access to the offices, properties, books and
records of the Midstream Entities and (ii) furnish or make available to the
Accessing Party such financial and operating data and other information
relating to the Disclosing Party, subject to the Accessing Partys compliance
with applicable Law and contractual restrictions governing the disclosure and
use of such information. Prior to the Closing, Contributor will provide, and
will cause the Midstream Entities to provide reasonable cooperation in
connection with Acquirers arrangement of financing in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as may be reasonably requested by
Acquirer and that is customary in connection with Acquirers efforts to obtain
such financing, including using commercially reasonable efforts to provide
information to

 



37  an accounting firm that is customary and reasonably requested by such
accounting firm for use in its preparation and delivery of a customary comfort
letter with respect to financial information of the Midstream Entities.
Contributor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (y) promptly provide
the Acquirer Parties with such information about the Midstream Entities and
(z) provide, and shall cause its respective Affiliates, officers and
employees to provide, reasonable cooperation in connection with any financing
arrangements sought by the Acquirer Parties, including by permitting
reasonable access to the auditors, auditor work papers, employees books and
records and any financial data reasonably requested by an Acquirer Party in
connection therewith.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 5.5,_ the
Disclosing Party shall not be required to grant access or furnish information
to the Accessing Party or any of its Representatives to the extent that such
information is subject to an attorney/client or attorney work product
privilege that would be violated or lost by such access or furnishing, or that
such access or the furnishing of such information is prohibited by law or an
existing contract or agreement. To the extent practicable, the Disclosing
Party shall make reasonable and appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements
under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.
Any investigation pursuant to this _Section 5.5_ shall be conducted in such
manner as not to interfere with the conduct of the business of the Disclosing
Party, its Affiliates or, in the case of Contributor as Disclosing Party, the
Midstream Entities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Accessing Party shall
not (i) be entitled to perform any intrusive or subsurface investigation or
other sampling of, on or under any of the properties of the Disclosing Party
or, in the case of Contributor as Disclosing Party, any Midstream Entity nor
(ii) without prior written consent of the Disclosing Party, communicate with
the Disclosing Partys contractual counterparties outside the ordinary course
of the Disclosing Partys business, and in no event, with respect to the
Disclosing Party or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Accessing Party agrees that it will not, and will cause its Representatives
not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this _Section 5.5_ in
violation of _Section 5.7._  

(c) Contributor has engaged KPMG LLP, Contributors auditor (" _KPMG"_ ), to
provide Acquirer with audited historical financial statements for the
Midstream Business for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2011 and 2012 and
for the nine month period ended September 30, 2013 and unaudited historical
financial statements for the Midstream Business for the nine month period
ended September 30, 2012 (collectively, the " _Carve-out Financial
Statements"_ ). Contributor shall also engage KPMG to provide Acquirer with
audited historical financial statements for the Midstream Business for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 to be delivered reasonably promptly after
KPMG delivers its audit opinion, whether before or after the Closing (the "
_2013 Financial Statements"_ ). Contributor shall also provide such direction
and assistance as is required to support its auditors reasonable needs under
the above referenced engagements and following the date hereof including (i)
executing and delivering customary management representation letters as
reasonably agreed upon by Contributor and Contributors auditor, (ii)
providing prepared relevant financial statements to be the subject of the
audit, (iii) providing all reasonably required supporting accounting records,
(iv) providing reasonable access to relevant systems, files and persons, and
(v) reasonably cooperating with Acquirer in connection with the preparation by
Acquirer of any pro forma financial statements of Acquirer or any of its
Affiliates required to be included or incorporated by reference in any
registration statement, report or other filing of Acquirer or its Affiliates
to satisfy any relevant disclosure 

 



38  obligations under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder. The costs and expenses of Contributors
auditor related to the foregoing (the " _Auditor Expenses"_ ) shall be paid
50% by Acquirer and 50% by Contributor; _provided_ that Acquirers 50% of the
Auditor Expenses with respect to the Carve-Out Financial Statements and the
2013 Financial Statements shall not exceed $450,000 without the prior written
consent of Acquirer, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. Acquirer
agrees to reimburse Contributor for Acquirers portion of the Auditors
Expenses at least 10 Business Days prior to the payment due date as set forth
in the invoice delivered by KPMG. If Acquirer shall fail to pay its 50% of
such invoice (an " _Acquirer Portion"_ ) when due, Contributor shall have the
right, but not the obligation to pay any Acquirers Portion. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Contributors obligations with
respect to the preparation and delivery of the Carve-out Financial Statements
shall be governed solely by this  _Section 5.5(c)._ The provisions of this
_Section 5.5(c)_ shall supersede the provisions of that certain letter
agreement dated November 26, 2013 between Contributor and an Affiliate of
Acquirer from and after the date hereof. 

(d) Contributor hereby consents to the inclusion or incorporation by reference
of the Carve-out Financial Statements in any registration statement, offering
memorandum, report or other filing of Acquirer or any of its Affiliates as to
which Acquirer or any of its Affiliates reasonably determines that such
financial statements are required to be included or incorporated by reference
to satisfy any relevant disclosure obligations under the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

(e) In the event and for so long as any Party actively is contesting or
defending against any Third Party Proceeding (other than any Proceedings in
which Acquirer or any of its Affiliates and Contributor or any of its
Affiliates are adverse parties) in connection with (i) the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction Documents or (ii) any fact,
situation, circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice,
plan, occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act, or transaction on
or prior to the Closing Date involving the Midstream Entities, each other
Party will cooperate with it and its counsel in the contest or defense, make
available their personnel, and provide such testimony and access to its books
and records as shall be reasonably requested and necessary in connection with
the contest or defense, all at the sole cost and expense of the contesting or
defending Party; provided, however, that nothing in this _Section 5.5(e)_
shall limit in any respect any rights a Party may have with respect to
discovery or the production of documents or other information in connection
with any such litigation.

 

Section 5.6 _Public Statements_. Acquirer and Contributor shall not, and each
of the foregoing shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives not to, issue
any public announcements or make other public disclosures regarding this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, without the prior written
approval of the Parties; provided, however, that a Party or its
Representatives may issue a public announcement or other public disclosures
required by Law or the rules of any stock exchange upon which such Partys
common units are traded, provided such Party uses commercially
reasonable efforts to afford the other Party an opportunity to first review
the content of the proposed disclosure and provide reasonable comment
regarding same; provided, further, that nothing herein shall restrict the
Parties from disclosing information regarding this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby to its Representatives to the extent
permitted by _Section 5.7._

 



39 Section 5.7 _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) The obligations of Acquirer under the Confidentiality Agreement remain in
full force and effect. All information provided to Acquirer or its
Representatives furnished pursuant to and in connection with this Agreement
shall be deemed to be Evaluation Material under the Confidentiality Agreement;
provided, that, from and after the Closing, any restrictions contained herein
or in the Confidentiality Agreement relating to Acquirers use or disclosure
of Evaluation Material (other than with respect to Contributor and its
Affiliates other than the Midstream Entities) shall be null and void.

 

(b) For two years following the Closing, Contributor shall keep confidential,
and shall cause its controlled Affiliates to keep confidential, all material
non-public information relating to the Midstream Business and the Midstream
Entities (" _Confidential Information"_ ), except (i) with the prior written
consent of Acquirer; (ii) to the extent necessary to comply with applicable
Law, including federal securities laws, the valid Order of a court of
competent jurisdiction or any legal proceeding, in which event, to the extent
permitted by such Law, Order or proceeding, Contributor shall notify Acquirer
as promptly as practicable (and, if possible, prior to the making of such
disclosure); (iii) to the extent such Confidential Information is available to
the public through no fault of Contributor or any of its
controlled Affiliates; (iv) to the extent such Confidential Information
becomes available after the Closing Date to Contributor or any of its
controlled Affiliates from a third Person who is not a Midstream Business
Employee and/or who is under no confidential or fiduciary obligation to
Acquirer or its Affiliates with respect to such Confidential Information; (v)
to the extent such Confidential Information was independently developed by
Contributor or its controlled Affiliates after the Closing Date without
violating this _Section 5.7(b)_; or (vi) to the extent such Confidential
Information is used in the enforcement of any of the rights of Contributor or
any of its controlled Affiliates under this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents or in the defense of any proceeding brought against
Contributor or one of its controlled Affiliates. The obligations of
Contributor pursuant to this _Section 5.7(b)_ shall cease two years following
the Closing, except that such obligations shall survive indefinitely in
respect of Confidential Information that are trade secrets or know-how of the
Midstream Business or the Midstream Entities.

 

Section 5.8 _Employees and Employee Benefits_.

(a) No later than January 15, 2014, Contributor shall promptly provide the
Midstream Business Employee Information in writing to Acquirer with respect to
each Midstream Business Employee. Thereafter as requested by Acquirer, and 15
days prior to the Closing Date whether or not requested by Acquirer,
Contributor shall provide Midstream Business Employee Information that is
accurate, complete and up-to-date as of the time such information is provided
with respect to each Midstream Business Employee. At least 10 days prior to
the Closing Date, Acquirer shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to,
make offers of employment to the Midstream Business Employees of Acquirers
choosing who pass Acquirers drug and other employment screening procedures,
and each such offer shall be on terms consistent with the requirements set
forth in this _Section 5.8._ From and after the Closing Date, the Midstream
Business Employees that timely accept offers of employment as described in
the preceding sentence and report to work with Acquirer or one of its
Affiliates on or after the Closing Date in accordance with such offers are
referred to herein as " _Transferred Employees"_ (which such term

 



40  shall include Transition Employees to the extent applicable). To the extent
that any Midstream Business Employee does not receive an offer of employment
from Acquirer or does not accept the one-time offer of employment from
Acquirer or one of its Affiliates, Acquirer and its Affiliates are precluded
from making any subsequent offers of employment to such Midstream Business
Employee for a period of six months following the Closing Date unless
Acquirer or one of its Affiliates pays or reimburses Contributor for the cost
of any severance pay and benefits paid or provided by Contributor under the
COC Severance Program or Executive Change of Control Agreement with respect to
such Midstream Business Employee. In addition, if Acquirer and its Affiliates
shall terminate any Transition Employee during the 90-day period beginning on
the Closing Date and Acquirer or one of its Affiliates is required to provide
severance benefits to such terminated Transition Employee under _Section
5.8(f),_ then Acquirer and its Affiliates shall be precluded from making any
subsequent offers of employment to such Transition Employee for a period of
six months following the date of such Transition Employees termination of
employment with Acquirer and its Affiliates unless Acquirer or one of its
Affiliates pays or reimburses Contributor for the cost of any severance pay
and benefits under the COC Severance Program that are paid or provided by
Contributor, including any amount paid or reimbursed to Acquirer or its
Affiliates under _Section 5.8(f)._

(b) Except as otherwise specifically provided for in this _Section 5.8,_ for
the 12 month period immediately following the Closing (the " _Continuation
Period"_ ), Acquirer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, provide (i)
each Transferred Employee with (A) a base pay or salary rate at least equal to
the base pay or salary rate as in effect with respect to such Transferred
Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, but only if the information
regarding such base pay or salary rate is (I) timely provided to Acquirer
pursuant to _Section 5.8(a)_ above and (II) accurate, and (B) bonus
opportunities and employee benefits, including vacation and paid time off, no
less favorable, in the aggregate, than the bonus opportunities and employee
benefits offered or provided to similarly situated employees of Acquirer and
its Affiliates, and (ii) each Transferred Employee who is terminated without
"cause" or resigns for "good reason" (each as defined in the COC Severance
Program) during the Continuation Period with severance benefits in accordance
with _Section 5.8(f),_ below. 

(c) Effective as of the Closing, Acquirer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates
to, take commercially reasonable steps to cause each compensation or employee
benefit plan maintained by Acquirer or any of its Affiliates and in which any
Transferred Employee becomes eligible to participate in, to treat the prior
service of such Transferred Employee with any of Contributor and its
Affiliates as service rendered to Acquirer or its Affiliates, as the case may
be, for vesting and eligibility purposes only, but only to the extent that (i)
such service crediting is permitted pursuant to the terms of such plans, does
not violate any applicable Law and does not result in duplication of benefits
for the same period of service and (ii) information regarding such service is
(A) timely provided to Acquirer pursuant to _Section 5.8(a)_ above and (B)
accurate.

(d) Acquirer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, take commercially
reasonable steps to (i) waive any limitation on health and welfare coverage
of any Transferred Employee and his or her eligible dependents due to pre-
existing conditions and/or waiting periods, active employment requirements,
and requirements to show evidence of good health under the applicable health
and welfare plan of Acquirer or any Affiliate of Acquirer to the extent such
Transferred Employee and his or her eligible dependents are covered under a
health and welfare 

 



41  benefit plan of Contributor or any of its Affiliates (as the case may be),
and such conditions, periods or requirements are satisfied or waived under
such plan of Contributor or any of its Affiliates, immediately prior to the
Closing Date and (ii) credit each Transferred Employee and his or her eligible
dependents with all deductible payments, co-payments and co-insurance paid by
such employee and covered dependents under the medical employee benefit plan
of Contributor or any of its Affiliates (as the case may be) prior to the
Closing Date during the year in which the Closing Date occurs for the purpose
of determining the extent to which any such employee and his or
her dependents have satisfied their deductible and whether they have reached
the out-of-pocket maximum under any medical employee benefit plan of Acquirer
or any Affiliate of Acquirer for the calendar year in which the Closing Date
occurs, but, with respect to any actions pursuant to subsection (i) or (ii),
above, only (A) to the extent permitted by the terms of such plans, applicable
Law and third party insurers and administrators, and (B) if the information
necessary to accomplish the actions contemplated by subsections (i) and (ii),
above, is accurate and is timely received by Acquirer.

 

(e) In the event that a Transferred Employee makes a voluntary election
pursuant to Section 401(a)(31) of the Code to roll over his or her account
balance in the Contributor 401(k) Plan to a tax-qualified defined contribution
plan sponsored by Acquirer or one of its Affiliates in which such Transferred
Employee is eligible to participate, Acquirer agrees to take
commercially reasonable steps to cause such tax-qualified defined
contribution plan to accept such rollover in cash, but only to the extent
permitted by applicable Law and the terms of such Acquirer plan. Contributor
covenants that, as of the date of each such rollover by a Transferred
Employee, the Contributor 401(k) Plan shall be qualified pursuant to Section
401(a) of the Code.

 

(f) Acquirer shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, provide severance
benefits to each non-executive Transferred Employee who is a full-time
employee of Acquirer that is terminated involuntarily without "cause", or
resigns for "good reason" (each as defined in the COC Severance Program,
provided that in the case of "good reason", it is expressly understood that
the term is evaluated by appropriate comparison to such non-executive
Transferred Employees prior employment with Eagle Rock Energy GandP, LLC), from
Acquirer and its Affiliates during the Continuation Period equal to
the amount of the severance benefits to which such Transferred Employee would
have been entitled under the COC Severance Program, as set forth in _Section
5.8(f) _of Contributors Disclosure Schedules, as a result of such a
termination following a "Change of Control" within the meaning of the COC
Severance Program; provided, however, that, if the cost of the severance
benefits to be paid by Acquirer or its Affiliates to any Transferred Employee
under this Section 5.8(f) exceeds the Severance Cap for that Transferred
Employee, then Contributor shall pay Acquirer the amount of such excess within
10 days of Acquirers written demand.

 

(g) If any Executive becomes a Transferred Employee and is terminated
involuntarily without "cause", or resigns for "good reason" (each as defined
in such Executives Executive Change of Control Agreement, provided that in
the case of "good reason", it is expressly understood that the term is
evaluated by appropriate comparison to such Executives prior employment with
Eagle Rock Energy GandP, LLC), from Acquirer and its Affiliates during the
Protection Period (as defined in such Executives Executive Change of Control
Agreement), Acquirer shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, provide
severance benefits to each such Executive equal to the amount of the severance
benefits to which such Executive would have

 



42  been entitled under (i) the Executive Change of Control Agreement and (ii)
that certain letter agreement between the Executive and Eagle Rock Energy GandP,
LLC dated as of December 23, 2013 (but only with respect to those comparable
awards (as determined by Acquirer) granted to Executive under Acquirers long-
term incentive plan pursuant to Section 5.8(m)), each as applicable to such
Executive and as set forth in Section 5.8(g) of Contributors Disclosure
Schedules, as a result of such a termination following a "Change of Control"
within the meaning of such Executives Executive Change of Control Agreement.

 

(h) Acquirer shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, provide
compensation to Transferred Employees that is comparable to that which each
Transferred Employee would have been entitled to under the awards granted to
each such Transferred Employee under the Cash Plan in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice at least five business days prior to
the Closing Date, as set forth in _Section 5.8(h)_ of Contributors
Disclosure Schedules, and outstanding as of the Closing Date; provided,
however, that Acquirer shall be required by the foregoing to provide
compensation that is comparable with respect to any award granted to a
Transferred Employee under the Cash Plan after December 1, 2013, only if
Acquirer preapproves in writing the grant of such award.

 

(i) Except as otherwise specifically provided for in _Section 5.8(j),_
Contributor shall be solely responsible for and shall timely discharge all
liabilities and obligations arising from Contributors employment of all its
employees, including those who subsequently become Transferred Employees,
including salaries, wages, bonuses, payroll Taxes, retirement, and any other
claims, obligations and expenses of any kind arising out of the employment by,
or termination from the employment of, Contributor.

(j) Acquirer and its Affiliates shall be responsible for any accrued but
unpaid bonuses as correctly listed in _Section 5.8(j)_ of Contributors
Disclosure Schedules (which shall be provided at least 10 days prior to the
Closing Date) payable to any Transferred Employee on or after the Closing
Date, subject to the Transferred Employees continued employment by Acquirer
and its Affiliates through the date such amount would otherwise be paid;
provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Contributor shall have the
ability to pay any such accrued but unpaid bonuses through the Closing Date
and, for the avoidance of doubt, neither Acquirer nor its Affiliates shall
be responsible hereunder for any such bonuses paid by Contributor.

(k) For purposes of determining the number of vacation days to which each
Transferred Employee shall be entitled during the calendar year in which the
Closing Date occurs, Acquirer shall honor all accrued or earned vacation days
and unused paid time off of such Transferred Employee as of the Closing Date,
as correctly set forth in _Section 5.8(k)_ of Contributors Disclosure
Schedules; provided that, Contributor shall be permitted to update the
information on _Section 5.8(k)_ of Contributors Disclosure Schedules on
or prior to the Closing Date to account for any additional accrued or earned
vacation days and unused paid time off as a result of the period between the
date hereof and the Closing Date, determined in accordance with the paid-time-
off policy of Contributor in effect and provided to Acquirer prior to the
date of this Agreement.

(l) Contributor shall be solely responsible for all obligations and
liabilities with respect to the continuation coverage requirements of Section
601 et. seq. of ERISA and Section

 



43  4980B of the Code and similar state Law for all employees of Contributor and
its Affiliates (and their dependents and beneficiaries) who are not
Transferred Employees for whom a "qualifying event" or similar event under
such Laws occurs or has occurred.

(m) Effective as of the Closing, Acquirer shall, or shall cause one of its
Affiliates to, replace, for each Transferred Employee, all unvested restricted
unit awards granted under Contributors Long Term Incentive Plan in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice at least five
business days prior to the Closing Date, as set forth in Section 5.8(m _)_ of
Contributors Disclosure Schedules and outstanding as of the Closing Date,
with a comparable award (as determined by Acquirer) under Acquirers long-
term incentive plan (with the value of such replacement award determined by
reference to the fair market value of Contributors and Acquirers common
units on the Closing Date); provided, however, that Acquirer shall be required
by the foregoing to replace any unvested restricted unit award granted under
Contributors Long Term Incentive Plan after December 1, 2013 only if Acquirer
preapproves in writing the grant of such unvested restricted unit award.

 

(n) The provisions of this _Section 5.8_ are for the sole benefit of the
parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is
intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any person
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Transferred Employee or other
current or former employee of Contributor or any of their respective
Affiliates, other than the parties hereto and their respective permitted
successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies
(including with respect to the matters provided for in this _Section 5.8)_
under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement. Nothing in this
_Section 5.8_ shall create, amend, or terminate or be deemed to create, amend
or terminate (or prevent the amendment or termination of) any Employee Benefit
Plan or any compensation or benefit plan of Contributor or Acquirer or any of
their respective Affiliates. Acquirer shall have no obligation to continue to
employ or retain the services of any Transferred Employee for any period of
time following the Closing. Nothing contained in this Agreement or resulting
from the transactions contemplated hereunder shall or shall be deemed to
create a contract of employment between Acquirer and its Affiliates, on the
one hand, and any Midstream Business Employee, on the other hand, and
all Transferred Employees shall be regarded as "at will" employees of
Acquirer and its Affiliates for all purposes.

 

Section 5.9 _Use of Name_.

(a) Each of the Acquirer Parties agrees that (except as expressly set forth in
this _Section 5.9(a))_, after the Closing neither Acquirer nor its Affiliates
(including Acquirer Sub and the Midstream Entities) shall have any rights in
and to the mark "Eagle Rock" or any trademarks, trade names, service marks,
trade dress, logos, corporate names, domain names and other source
identifiers, emblems, signs or insignia related thereto or containing or
comprising the foregoing, including any mark or term confusingly similar
thereto or derivative thereof (collectively, the " _Contributor Marks"_ ),
will not at any time after the Closing market, promote, advertise or offer
for sale any products, goods or services utilizing any of the Contributor
Marks or otherwise hold itself out as having any affiliation with Contributor
or any of its Affiliates. The Acquirer Parties agree that if any of
the assets, including any promotional materials or printed forms, signage and
pipelines, bear any of the Contributor Marks, the Acquirer Parties shall,
prior to distributing, selling or otherwise making use of such assets, remove,
delete or render illegible the Contributor

 



44  Mark(s) as they may appear on such assets. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
for a period of 180 days after the Closing Date, the Acquirer Parties may
distribute and display marketing, promotional and advertising materials
including business cards, stationery, packaging materials, displays, signs,
promotional materials and other similar materials that include one or more of
the Contributor Marks (collectively, " _Supplies"_ ), provided such Supplies
(i) were included within the inventory of Midstream Entities as of the
Closing, (ii) are used solely in connection with the promotion, marketing,
advertising and sale of the Midstream Business products of the type sold,
and in a manner consistent with that used, prior to the Closing and (iii)
clearly indicate that (x) the Midstream Entities are not affiliated with
Contributor or any of Contributors Affiliates and (y) the inclusion of the
Contributor Mark(s) in the Supplies shall not be construed as an endorsement
of any of the Midstream Business services by Contributor or any of
Contributors Affiliates. The Acquirer Parties shall indemnify and hold
harmless Contributor and its Affiliates against all Losses asserted against
or imposed upon them as a consequence of the use of the Contributor Marks by
Acquirer and its Affiliates (including Acquirer Sub and the Midstream
Entities) following the Closing. 

(b) Each of the Acquirer Parties agrees to cause each Midstream Entity whose
name includes the name "Eagle Rock" to, promptly following the Closing, and
in any event within ten Business Days after the Closing Date, change its name
such that its name does not include the name "Eagle Rock."

 

Section 5.10 _Retention of Books and Records_. Contributor will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to retain, or to cause its Affiliates
(including the Midstream Entities) to retain, and to deliver to Acquirer on
the Closing Date all books, records and other documents pertaining to the
Midstream Business in existence on the Closing Date and to make the
same available after the Closing Date for examination and copying by Acquirer
or its Representatives, at Acquirers expense, upon reasonable notice.
Acquirer agrees that no such books, records or documents will be destroyed by
Acquirer or its Affiliates (including Acquirer Sub and the Midstream
Entities) until the later of (a) seven years following the Closing or (b) the
expiration of the statute of limitations for the assessment of Taxes in the
jurisdiction to which such books, records and documents relate, and that
thereafter no such books, records or documents will be destroyed without first
advising Contributor in writing and providing to Contributor a reasonable
opportunity to obtain possession or make copies thereof at Contributors
expense.

Section 5.11 _Midstream Permits_. The Acquirer Parties shall be responsible
for effecting all updates and amendments and reissuances of Midstream Permits
required in connection with or as a result of the transactions contemplated
hereby. Contributor will, and will cause its Affiliates to, reasonably
cooperate with the Acquirer Parties in effecting such updates, amendments and
reissuances.

Section 5.12 _Guarantees_. Acquirer shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain, on or before the Closing Date (to the extent Contributor so
requests), the release of each of the obligations of Contributor (or any
Affiliate thereof, other than the Midstream Entities) to guaranty any
liability of any Midstream Entity, including the liabilities listed on
_Section 5.12_ of the Contributors Disclosure Schedules and, to that end,
shall provide such guarantees or other credit support as shall be required to
obtain such release. If Acquirer fails to obtain any such release, Acquirer
shall indemnify and hold harmless Contributor in respect of any liability or

 



45  expense incurred by Contributor (or any Affiliate thereof, other than the
Midstream Entities) in respect of any claim made in respect of any such
liability or expense arising or incurred after the Closing Date.

Section 5.13 _Restrictive Covenants_.

 

(a) Contributor agrees, to the maximum extent not violative of applicable
Laws, that for a period of 18 months following the Closing Date, Contributor
will not, nor will it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly, solicit for employment any Transferred Employee who is or has been
employed by any of the Midstream Entities, at, or at any time within one year
prior to, the time of the act of solicitation; provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not apply to (i) general solicitations, such as through
newspaper advertisements not directed at Transferred Employees; (ii) any
Transferred Employee whose employment with Acquirer or any of its Affiliates,
including the Midstream Entities, is terminated by Acquirer or any of its
Affiliates; or (iii) any Transferred Employee who independently contacts
Contributor or its Affiliates for purposes of locating employment or
engagement separate from that with the Acquirer or any of its Affiliates,
including the Midstream Entities.

(b) Contributor agrees, to the maximum extent not violative of applicable
Laws, that for a period of 18 months following the Closing Date, Contributor
will not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, engage in the
Midstream Business in the counties or parishes (the " _Restricted Territory"_
) in which the Midstream Business conducts operations as of the date of this
Agreement (the " _Restricted Business"_ ); provided, however, that nothing
herein shall be construed to prevent Contributor or its Affiliates from (w)
acquiring or owning, directly or indirectly, equity securities of Acquirer or
up to 10% of a class of equity securities issued by any Person that engages,
directly or indirectly, in the Restricted Business in the Restricted Territory
that is publicly traded or listed on any stock exchange or automated quotation
system, (x) conducting any midstream operations (including, without
limitation, gathering, compressing, treating, processing and transporting
natural gas; fractionating and transporting natural gas liquids; crude oil and
condensate logistics and marketing; and natural gas marketing and trading) to
the extent any of the same is conducted as an ancillary activity to, and
substantially in support of, the Upstream Business as and where the Upstream
Business is located, notwithstanding that such operations are of the same
nature as operations included in the Midstream Business, (y) acquiring or
owning any Entity or business that, directly or indirectly, engages in the
Restricted Business in the Restricted Territory to the extent that the
aggregate net revenue derived from such business represents less than 20% of
Contributors aggregate consolidated net revenue, or (z) performing its
obligations under this Agreement or any Transaction Document.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the restrictions set
forth in _Sections 5.13(a)_ and _5.13(b)_ will apply only to Contributor and
entities "controlled by" (as such term is defined in the definition of the
term Affiliate) Contributor, and Contributors successors and assigns.

(d) Contributor acknowledges and agrees that the covenants set forth in this
_Section 5.13_ are reasonable in geographical and temporal scope and in all
other respects, and any violation of these restrictions would cause
substantial injury to the Acquirer Parties and that the Acquirer Parties
would not have entered into this Agreement without receiving the additional

 



46  consideration offered by Contributor in binding itself and its Affiliates to
these restrictions. In the event of a breach or a threatened breach by
Contributor or any of its Affiliates of these restrictions, the Acquirer
Parties will be entitled to seek an injunction restraining Contributor or such
Affiliate from such breach or threatened breach without the necessity of
proving the inadequacy as a remedy of money damages; provided, however, that
the right to injunctive relief will not be construed as prohibiting the
Acquirer Parties from pursuing any other available remedies, whether at law or
in equity, for such breach or threatened breach.

 

(e) If any court determines that any provision included in this _Section
5.13_ is unenforceable, such court will have the power to reduce the duration
or scope of such provision, as the case may be, or terminate such provision
and, in reduced form, such provision shall be enforceable; it is the intention
of the parties hereto that the foregoing restrictions shall not
be terminated, unless so terminated by a court, but shall be deemed amended
to the extent required to render them valid and enforceable, such amendment to
apply only with respect to the operation of this Agreement in the jurisdiction
of the court that has made the adjudication.

Section 5.14 _Cooperation in Litigation_. Upon reasonable request, the
Acquirer Parties and Contributor shall (and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to) reasonably cooperate with each other at the requesting partys
expense in the prosecution or defense of any claim, litigation or other
proceeding arising from or related to the conduct of the Business prior to
the Closing and involving one or more third Persons. The party requesting such
cooperation shall pay the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
providing such cooperation (including reasonable legal fees and
disbursements) by the party providing such cooperation and by its Affiliates
and its and their officers, directors, employees and agents, but shall not be
responsible for reimbursing such party or its Affiliates or its and
their officers, directors, employees and agents for their time spent in such
cooperation.

Section 5.15 _Assistance Obligations of Acquirer_. After the Closing,
Acquirer will (and will cause the Midstream Entities and its other Affiliates
to) reasonably assist Contributor and its Affiliates in preparing information
for various Governmental Authorities or other third Persons after the Closing
to the extent that such information relates to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, the Midstream Business and/or the liabilities of the
Midstream Business. Such information includes, but is not limited to,
information required by Contributor and its Affiliates to (a) comply with
their financial reporting requirements and (b) submit any claims that would
reasonably be expected to be covered under the insurance policies
of Contributor or its Affiliates or their respective self-insurance programs,
as applicable, in respect of events, circumstances and occurrences prior to
Closing. Contributor shall reimburse Acquirer for all reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses (excluding internal costs) actually incurred by Acquirer and its
Affiliates in connection with the compliance by Acquirer with its obligations
under this _Section 5.15._

Section 5.16 _Further Assurances_. From time to time after Closing, Acquirer
and Contributor shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things,
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws, regulations
and agreements (including executing, acknowledging or delivering written
instruments) as may be reasonably requested by the other party in order to
accomplish more effectively the purposes of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement,

 



47  including (a) if requested by Contributor or its Affiliates, the (x)
conveyance or assignment (including partial assignment, if appropriate) to
Contributor (or one of its Affiliates) of any asset (including any contract)
of the Retained Business that was erroneously conveyed to Acquirer (including
by way of inclusion in the Midstream Entities) by Contributor at the Closing
or (y) assumption by Acquirer (or one of its Affiliates) of any liability of
the Midstream Business that was erroneously retained by Contributor or any of
its Affiliates at the Closing and (b) if requested by Acquirer or its
Affiliates (including, from and after the Closing, the Midstream Entities),
the (x) conveyance or assignment (including partial assignment, if
appropriate) to Acquirer (or one of its Affiliates) of any asset (including
any contract) of the Midstream Business that was erroneously not conveyed to
Acquirer (including by way of conveyance to the Midstream Entities) at the
Closing or (y) assumption by Contributor (or one of its Affiliates) of any
liability of the Retained Business that was erroneously assumed by Acquirer
(including by way of assumption or inclusion in the Midstream Entities) at
the Closing.

Section 5.17 _Insurance_. From and after the Closing, if Contributor receives
insurance proceeds with respect to Losses incurred after the Closing Date
payable to any Midstream Entity as an insured under the insurance policies
currently maintained by Contributor and its Affiliates on behalf of the
Midstream Entities, Contributor shall pay such proceeds to Acquirer. From and
after the Closing, if the Acquirer Parties or the Midstream Entities receive
insurance proceeds with respect to Losses incurred prior to the Closing
Date payable to any Midstream Entity as an insured under the insurance
policies currently maintained by Contributor and its Affiliates on behalf of
the Midstream Entities, Acquirer shall, or shall cause Acquirer Sub or the
applicable Midstream Entity to, pay such proceeds to Contributor. From and
after the Closing Date, the Midstream Entities shall cease to be insured by
Contributors or Contributors Affiliates (other than the Midstream Entities)
insurance policies or by any of Contributors or Contributors Affiliates
(other than the Midstream Entities) self-insured programs. For the avoidance
of doubt, following the Closing, Contributor and its Affiliates shall retain
all rights to control its insurance policies and programs, including the
right to exhaust, settle, release, commute, buy back or otherwise resolve
disputes with respect to any of its insurance policies and programs. Prior to
and after the Closing, Contributor and its Affiliates (including, prior to
the Closing Date, the Midstream Entities) shall reasonably cooperate with
Acquirer to assist Acquirer in obtaining, at Acquirers sole cost and expense,
replacement insurance policies for the Midstream Entities and the Midstream
Business, including any extensions of reporting periods under existing
policies (for the benefit of the Midstream Entities) or procurement of tail
insurance policies (for the benefit of the Midstream Entities).

 

Section 5.18 _Exchange Offer_.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the execution of this
Agreement, Acquirer shall prepare a written offer to purchase any and all
issued and outstanding Everest Notes in exchange for an equal principal
amount of Exchange Notes pursuant to the Exchange Offer (such written offer,
including any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Offer to Exchange"_ )
and, subject to compliance with applicable requirements of the Securities Act
and Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, as
promptly as reasonably practicable following receipt of (i) the Carve-Out
Financial Statements and (ii) a written request from the
Contributor, commence the Exchange Offer; provided, however, failure of
Acquirer to commence the Offer to Exchange because Contributor fails to make
the written request referred

 



48  to in this sentence shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement so long
as Acquirer is otherwise in compliance with this _Section 5.18._ Without
Acquirers approval in its sole discretion, the duration of such Exchange
Offer shall not exceed 20 Business Days and will not be extended, except to
accommodate the Closing Date. Acquirer shall also take any action required to
be taken under any applicable state securities Laws in connection with the
Exchange Offer, and Contributor shall furnish all information concerning
Contributor and the holders of Everest Notes as may be reasonably requested in
connection with any such action. No amendment or supplement to the Offer to
Exchange will be made by Acquirer without Contributors prior consent (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) and without
providing Contributor a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon.
The Exchange Offer will comply in all material respects with all applicable
requirements of the federal securities laws, and the Offer to Exchange will
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. If at
any time prior to the completion of the Exchange Offer, any information
relating to Acquirer or Contributor, or any of their respective Affiliates,
officers or directors, is discovered by Acquirer or Contributor that should be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Offer to Exchange, so that any
of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
Party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties
and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall
be promptly circulated to the holders of Everest Notes. Acquirer shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to complete the Exchange Offer (which
completion for purposes of this _Section 5.18(a)_ shall consist of the
commencement of the Exchange Offer as contemplated herein and keeping such
Exchange Offer open for a minimum of 20 Business Days after its commencement,
and if the Closing occurs, accepting for exchange all Everest Notes validly
tendered for exchange and not withdrawn).

(b) The Parties acknowledge and agree that, upon Contributors request
submitted in writing to Acquirer within 10 calendar days prior to the
commencement of the Exchange Offer as provided for in _Section 5.18(a)_, the
terms of the Exchange Offer may include a solicitation of consents (the "
_Consent Solicitation"_ ) from the holders of the Everest Notes to a
supplemental indenture amending and supplementing the Everest Indenture in
order to amend or delete those restrictive covenants and events of default in
the Everest Indenture identified in Everests written request and in the
manner specified by Everest in such written request, and further acknowledge
and agree that any consent fee or similar payment offered to holders of the
Everest Notes in consideration of their consents to such supplemental
indenture shall be paid by Contributor, and that Acquirer and its Affiliates
shall not have any responsibility for the payment thereof.

 

(c) Acquirer and Contributor shall each bear their own expenses with respect
to the Exchange Offer.

 

(d) Acquirer shall keep Contributor informed with respect to all material
activity concerning the status of the Exchange Offer and, without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, will promptly provide to Contributor all
reports issued by the exchange agent for the Exchange Offer as to the
principal amounts of Everest Notes tendered pursuant to the Exchange Offer.

 



49 (e) Acquirer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, indemnify and hold
harmless Contributor and its Affiliates and Representatives from and against
any and all Losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the
arrangement of the Exchange Offer, but not the Consent Solicitation, but
solely to the extent that such losses arise out of any written information
that is (i) included in the Offer to Exchange and (ii) provided by Acquirer or
its Representatives for use therein; provided, however, that Acquirer shall be
permitted to use all material information regarding the Midstream Business
that is determined by Acquirer, in its sole discretion, to be necessary to
include in the Exchange Offer. Contributor shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, indemnify and hold harmless Acquirer and its Affiliates and
Representatives from and against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by
them in connection with the Consent Solicitation or arrangement thereof but
not the Exchange Offer. All non-public or otherwise confidential information
regarding the Midstream Business obtained by Acquirer, its Affiliates or
their respective Representatives pursuant to this _Section 5.18_ shall be
kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except
that Acquirer shall be permitted to disclose such information to rating
agencies to the extent necessary in connection with the Exchange Offer.

(f) Promptly after the Settlement Date, Contributor shall take such action as
the trustee for the Everest Notes and The Depository Trust Company may require
in order to cancel all Everest Notes exchanged in the Exchange Offer, and upon
the request of Contributor the Acquirer shall take such reasonable actions
(which shall not include the payment of any cost or expense) to cooperate with
Contributor to accomplish such cancellation.

 

(g) As soon as practicable after the Closing, Contributor shall deliver to
Acquirer written confirmation from the trustee under the Everest Indenture
that all of the Everest Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn and accepted
for exchange pursuant to the Exchange Offer in accordance with _Section
2.1(b)_ have been cancelled, and accordingly have ceased to be outstanding.

Section 5.19 _Privileged Matters; Waiver of Conflicts_. The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that the information relating to or arising out of the
legal advice or services that have been or will be provided prior to the
Closing Date for the benefit of both Contributor or its Affiliates (other than
the Midstream Entities) and the Midstream Entities shall be subject to a
shared privilege between Contributor, on the one hand, and the Midstream
Entities, on the other hand, and Contributor and the Midstream Entities shall
have equal right to assert all such shared privileges in connection with
privileged information under any applicable Laws and no such shared privilege
may be waived by (a) Contributor without the prior written consent of Acquirer
or (b) by Acquirer, Acquirer Sub or any Midstream Entity without the prior
written consent of Contributor; provided, however, that any information
relating to or arising out of any legal advice or services provided, whether
before or after the Closing Date, with respect to any matter for which an
Indemnifying Party has an indemnification obligation hereunder, shall be
subject to the sole and separate privilege of such Indemnifying Party, and
such Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to control the assertion or waiver
of all such separate privileges under any applicable Law in connection with
any privileged information, whether or not such information is in the
possession of or under the control of any Indemnified Party. Acquirer, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates, including, following the Closing, the
Midstream Entities, hereby agrees that, notwithstanding any representation of
the Midstream Entities by Contributors internal legal

 



50  counsel, Vinson and Elkins L.L.P., Richards Layton and Finger, P.A. or Potter
Anderson Corroon LLP prior to the Closing, such internal counsel and law firms
may, following the Closing, represent Contributor and its Affiliates in any
matter (including with respect to claims and legal proceedings arising under
or with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby),
and on behalf of itself, its Affiliates and, following the Closing, the
Midstream Entities, Acquirer hereby irrevocably waives any conflicts arising
out of such representation.

Section 5.20 _Pre-Closing Transfers_.

(a) Following the date hereof, Contributor shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Pre-Closing Transfers to occur on or prior to the Closing
pursuant to the Assignment and Assumption Agreement in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit B._

 

(b) Following the date hereof, Contributor shall cause the Administrative
Services Agreement to be amended to remove the Midstream Entities as members
of the " _Partnership Group"_ (as defined in the Administrative Services
Agreement) as of the Closing.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign, novate or transfer
any asset, Contract or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder
or resulting therefrom if an attempted assignment, novation or transfer
thereof, without the consent of a third party, would constitute a breach or
other contravention thereof or would in any way adversely affect the rights
of the Midstream Entities, the Acquirer Parties or Contributor (as applicable)
thereto or thereunder. Contributor will prior to or after the Closing, use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any consent necessary for the
assignment, novation or transfer of any such asset, Contract or any claim or
right or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom to an Acquirer
Party. If prior to the Closing Date any such consent has not been obtained, or
if an attempted assignment, novation or transfer thereof would be ineffective
or would adversely affect the rights of the Midstream Entities or the Acquirer
Parties so that the Midstream Entities or the Acquirer Parties would not in
fact receive all such rights, Contributor and Acquirer will cooperate in a
mutually agreeable arrangement for a period not to exceed one year under which
Acquirer would obtain the benefits and assume the obligations and bear the
economic burdens associated with, such asset, Contract or any claim or right
or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom in accordance with
this Agreement, including subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing to
Acquirer, or under which Contributor would enforce for the benefit of Acquirer
any and all of their rights against a third party associated with such asset,
Contract or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting
therefrom (collectively, " _Third Party Rights"_ ), and Contributor would
promptly pay to Acquirer when received all monies received by them under any
such Third Party Rights.

(d) On or prior to January 15, 2014, Contributor shall deliver to Acquirer a
schedule setting forth the assets and liabilities to be transferred in
connection with the Pre-Closing Transfers (the " _Pre-Closing Transfer
Schedule"_ ), which Pre-Closing Transfer Schedule may be updated by
Contributor prior to Closing with the prior written consent of Acquirer, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld (it being understood that no such
consent shall be required for assets and liabilities acquired or incurred
after the date hereof in compliance with _Section 5.2)_.

 



51 Section 5.21 _NYSE Listing_. Acquirer will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to list, prior to the Closing, on the NYSE, upon official
notice of issuance, the Acquirer Common Units comprising the Equity
Consideration.

ARTICLE VII

 

 _TAX MATTERS_

Section 7.1 _Pre-Closing Taxes_. Contributor will prepare or cause to be
prepared Tax Returns required to be filed by the Midstream Entities for any
taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Tax
Period"_ ) relating, in whole or in part, to Contributor Taxes. Acquirer will
prepare all other Tax Returns required to be filed after the Closing Date by
the Midstream Entities for any Pre-Closing Tax Period. Acquirer will cause
such Tax Return to be filed timely with the appropriate Governmental Authority
and will provide a copy to Contributor. Acquirer will timely pay or cause to
be paid all Taxes shown as due on such Tax Return. Not later than five days
prior to the due date for payment of Taxes with respect to any Tax Return for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period, Contributor will pay to (or at the direction of)
Acquirer the amount of any Taxes shown as due on such Tax Return that
are Contributor Taxes, to the extent such amount exceeds the amount taken
into account as a Current Liability in the calculation of Final Working
Capital.

 



55 Section 7.2 _Post-Closing Taxes_.

 

(a) Straddle Period Tax Returns. Acquirer will prepare or cause to be prepared
Tax Returns required to be filed by the Midstream Entities for any taxable
period beginning before and ending after the Closing Date (" _Straddle
Period"_ ). Not later than 30 days prior to the due date for filing any such
Tax Return relating, in whole or in part, to Contributor Taxes, Acquirer will
deliver a copy of each such Tax Return to Contributor for its review and
reasonable comment, and such reasonable comments shall be taken into account.
Acquirer will cause such Tax Return to be filed timely with the appropriate
Governmental Authority and will provide a copy to Contributor. Acquirer will
timely pay or cause to be paid all Taxes shown as due on Straddle-Period Tax
Returns. Not later than five days prior to the due date for payment of Taxes
with respect to any Straddle Period Tax Return, Contributor will pay to (or
at the direction of) Acquirer the amount of any Taxes shown as due on such Tax
Return that are Contributor Taxes, as determined in accordance with _Section
7.2(b)_, to the extent such amount exceeds the amount taken into account as a
Current Liability in the calculation of Final Working Capital.

(b) Allocation of Taxes. Taxes for a Straddle Period that are allocable to
the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date are determined
in the following manner: (i) in the case of Taxes that are imposed on a
periodic basis with respect to the assets or capital of the Midstream
Entities, such amount will be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the
entire Straddle Period, multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the
number of calendar days in the portion of the period ending on and including
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days
in the entire period; provided that, in each case, any franchise Tax or other
Tax providing the right to do business will be allocated to the period
during which the income, operations, assets or capital comprising the base of
such Tax is measured, regardless of whether the right to do business for
another period is obtained by the payment of such Tax; and (ii) in the case of
all other Taxes, deemed equal to the amount which would be payable as
computed on a "closing-of-the-books" basis if the relevant Straddle Period
ended on and included the Closing Date, provided, however, that exemptions,
allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including
depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the
portion of the Straddle Period up to and including the Closing Date and the
remainder of such Straddle Period in proportion to the number of days in each
period.

Section 7.3 _Transfer Taxes_. Any transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and similar taxes (" _Transfer Taxes"_ ) and fees arising
out of or in connection with the transactions effected pursuant to this
Agreement shall be borne entirely by Acquirer.

 

Section 7.4 _Tax Treatment and Contribution Consideration Allocation_.

 

(a) The Parties intend, for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, that: (i) the
Midstream Contribution shall be treated consistent with (A) a contribution by
Contributor to Acquirer of a portion of the Midstream Assets in exchange for
the Equity Consideration, the reimbursement of Preformation Capital
Expenditures (as defined below) and the assumption by Acquirer of
any qualified liabilities within the meaning of Section 1.707-5(a)(6) of the
Treasury Regulations (any such liability, a " _Qualified Liability_ ") in a
transaction consistent with the requirements of Section 721(a) of the
Code and (B) a sale by Contributor to Acquirer of a portion of the Midstream

 



56  Assets in exchange for the Closing Cash Consideration (other than Closing
Cash Consideration equal to the amount of any Preformation Capital
Expenditures), plus the excess of the liabilities (other than Qualified
Liabilities) assumed by Acquirer over Contributors share of such liabilities
immediately after such assumption, as determined for the purposes of U.S.
Treasury Regulations Section 1.707-5(a)(1), in each case subject to the
provisions of Treasury Regulations Section 1.707-5(a)(5); (ii) the Acquirer
shall be treated as having assumed or taken the Midstream Assets subject to
the Everest Notes Indebtedness; (iii) the portion of the Everest
Notes Indebtedness shown as "Qualified Liabilities" in Schedule 7.4(a), which
shall be provided by Contributor to Acquirer at Closing, shall be treated as
Qualified Liabilities; and (iv) the amount shown as "Preformation
Capital Expenditures" in Schedule 7.4(a), which shall be provided by
Contributor to Acquirer at Closing, shall be treated as capital expenditures
satisfying the requirements of U.S. Treasury Regulations Section 1.707-4(d)(1)
and (2) (any such expenditures, " _Preformation Capital Expenditures"_ ). The
tax treatment described in the preceding sentence is referred to as the
"Intended Tax Treatment." The Parties agree to file all Tax Returns and
otherwise act at all times in a manner consistent with the Intended Tax
Treatment, except to the extent that: (1) such Party is bound by a final
determination (as defined in Section 1313 of the Code) that is inconsistent
with such treatment, or (2) Acquirer determines that there is not a
"reasonable basis" (as defined for the purposes of Section 6662 of the Code)
under applicable Law for one or more aspects of the Intended Tax Treatment and
Contributor is unable to provide a legal opinion from Vinson and Elkins LLP (or
a law firm of similar reputation) that there is a "reasonable basis" (as
defined for the purposes of Section 6662 of the Code) for such aspects of the
Intended Tax Treatment. The costs of any legal opinion shall be borne by
Contributor.

(b) No later than 15 Business Days prior to Closing, Acquirer shall deliver
to Contributor a proposed allocation of the Contribution Consideration and any
other items constituting consideration for applicable income Tax purposes (to
the extent known at such time) among the assets owned by the Midstream
Entities that complies with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Allocation"_ ). Contributor shall
review the proposed Allocation and provide reasonable comments, if any,
to Acquirer no later than 10 Business after receiving the proposed Allocation
from Acquirer. Contributor and Acquirer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to agree upon the Allocation by Closing. If the Parties agree upon the
Allocation, the Parties (a) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
update the Allocation in a manner consistent with Section 1060 of the Code
following any adjustment to the Contribution Consideration pursuant to this
Agreement, (b) shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, report
consistently with the Allocation in all Tax Returns (including IRS Form 8594,
as appropriate), which Acquirer and Contributor shall timely file with the
IRS, (c) shall not, and cause their Affiliates not to, take any position in
any Tax return that is inconsistent with the Allocation, as adjusted, in each
case, unless required to do so by a final determination as defined in Section
1313 of the Code, and (d) shall promptly advise each other regarding the
existence of any Tax audit, controversy or litigation related to the
Allocation.

Section 7.5  _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Acquirer and Contributor shall
cooperate fully as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party
in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any audit or contest with
respect to Taxes imposed on or with respect to the assets, operations or
activities of the Midstream Entities. Such cooperation will include the
retention and (upon the other Partys request) the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or audit or
contest. The Parties agree to use

 



57  commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document
from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to
mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed on the Parties
(including with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

Section 7.6  _Amended Tax Returns and Settlements_. Unless required by
applicable Law or except as set forth below, no amended Tax Return with
respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period shall be filed and no
settlement with regard to Taxes shall be agreed by or on behalf of a
Midstream Entity or with respect to the Midstream Business without consent of
the Contributor if such amended Tax Return or settlement would materially
increase the amount of Contributor Taxes. Notwithstanding the above, the
Acquirer may file or cause to be filed such an amended Tax Return or agree to
or cause to be agreed to such a settlement with regard to Taxes even if not
required by applicable Law without the consent of the Contributor, provided
that any additional Taxes resulting therefrom will not be deemed to
constitute Contributor Taxes and will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as an amount described in _Section 9.2(b)(v)._

 

Section 7.7 _Tax Refunds_. The amount of any refunds of Taxes described in
Contributor Taxes (in respect of a Straddle Period, determined in accordance
with the principles of _Section 7.2(b))_ shall be for the account of the
Contributor. The amount of any refund of any other Taxes of the Midstream
Entities or with respect to the Midstream Business shall be for the account
of the Acquirer. Each party shall forward, and shall cause its Affiliates to
forward, to the party entitled to receive a refund of Tax pursuant to this
_Section 7.7_ the amount of such refund within 30 days after such refund is
received, net any reasonable costs or expenses incurred by such party or its
Affiliates in procuring such refund.

 

ARTICLE VIII

Section 8.1 _Termination of Agreement_. This Agreement may be terminated
prior to the Closing as follows:

(a) by the mutual written consent of Contributor and the Acquirer Parties;

(b) by Contributor or Acquirer if there shall be in effect a final
nonappealable order of a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby; provided, that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this  _Section 8.1(b)_ shall not be available to
Contributor, on the one hand, or Acquirer, on the other hand, if such order
was primarily due to the failure of Contributor, on the one hand, or the
Acquirer Parties, on the other hand, to perform any of its obligations under
this Agreement;

(c) by Acquirer if (i) Contributor shall have breached or failed to
perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set

Contributor shall have become untrue, and, with respect to either (i) or (ii)
above, the conditions set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_ or _Section 6.2(d)_
would not be satisfied and such breach, failure to perform or untruth is
incapable of being cured (or becoming true) or, 

 



58  if capable of being cured (or becoming true), shall not have been cured (or
become true) within 30 days following receipt by Contributor of notice of such
breach, failure or untruth from Acquirer;

(d) by Contributor if (i) an Acquirer Party shall have breached or failed to
perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set

Acquirer Party shall have become untrue, and, with respect to either _(i)_ or
_(ii)_ above, the conditions set forth in _Section 6.3(a)_ or _Section
6.3(c)_ would not be satisfied and such breach, failure to perform or untruth
is incapable of being cured (or becoming true) or, if capable of being cured
(or becoming true), shall not have been cured (or become true) within 30 days
following receipt by Acquirer of notice of such breach, failure or untruth
from Contributor;

(e) by Contributor or Acquirer if the Closing does not occur on or before July
31, 2014 (the " _Outside Date"_ ); provided, that such failure of the Closing
to occur is not primarily due to the failure of such Party to perform and
comply with the covenants and agreements to be performed or complied with by
such Party prior to the Closing;

(f) by Contributor or Acquirer if the Unitholder Meeting shall have concluded
and the Unitholder Approval shall not have been obtained;

Statements on or prior to January 21, 2014; _provided,_ _however,_ that
Acquirer may only terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(i)_
(i) beginning on the later of (A) January 21, 2014 and (B) the date on which
the Commission notifies Acquirer that it has no further comments to Acquirers

(ii) for only so long as Acquirer has not received the Carve-out Financial
Statements prior to delivery of the notice of termination as described in
_Section 8.2;_ and _provided_ _further,_ _however,_ that if Acquirer elects
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(i),_ Contributor
shall have no liability for any failure to comply with any covenants or
agreements contained herein or for any breaches of any representations or
warranties of Contributor contained herein.

Section 8.2 _Procedure Upon Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by Acquirer or Contributor, or both, pursuant to _Section 8.1_,
written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other Party or
Parties, and this Agreement shall terminate, and the purchase of the Subject
Interests hereunder shall be abandoned, without further action by Acquirer or
Contributor.

 

Section 8.3 _Effect of Termination_. In the event that this Agreement is
validly terminated as provided in  _Section 8.1,_ then each of the Parties
shall be relieved of its duties and

 



59  obligations arising under this Agreement after the date of such termination
and such termination shall be without liability to the Acquirer Parties or
Contributor; provided, that the agreements and obligations of the Parties set
forth in this _Section 8.3,_ _Section 8.4,_ _Article IX_ and _Article X_
hereof shall survive any such termination and shall be enforceable hereunder;
provided further, that, subject to _Section 8.1(i)_ and _Section 8.4(e),_
nothing in this _Section 8.3_ shall relieve any of the Acquirer Parties or
Contributor of any liability for any failure to comply with any covenant or
agreements contained herein or any knowing or intentional breach by the
Acquirer Parties of _Section 4.4,_ except that the parties agree that the
Acquirer Parties sole and exclusive remedy for Contributors breach of
_Section 5.5(c)_ or for the failure of the condition set forth in _Section
6.2(g)_ shall be the termination right set forth in _Section 8.1(i)._

Section 8.4 _Fees and Expenses_.

(a) In the event that (i) an Alternative Proposal shall have been publicly
proposed or publicly disclosed prior to, and not withdrawn at the time of, the
date of the Unitholder Meeting (or, if the Unitholder Meeting shall not have
occurred, prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(e))_ and (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Contributor or Acquirer
pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_ or _Section 8.1(f)_ and (iii) Contributor enters
into a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, such Alternative
Proposal within nine months after the date this Agreement is terminated, then
Contributor shall pay to Acquirer the Termination Fee, upon the earlier of the
public announcement that Contributor has entered into such definitive
agreement or the consummation of any such transaction. For purposes of this
_Section 8.4(a),_ the term " _Alternative Proposal"_ shall have the meaning
assigned to such term in  _Section 5.4(g)(i),_ except that the references to
"20% or more" shall be deemed to be references to "more than 50%."

(b) In the event this Agreement is terminated by Acquirer pursuant to _Section
8.1(g),_ then Contributor shall pay to Acquirer, within two Business Days
after the date of termination, the Termination Fee.

(c) In the event this Agreement is terminated by Contributor pursuant to
_Section 8.1(h),_ then Contributor shall immediately prior to or
simultaneously with such termination pay to Acquirer the Termination Fee.

(d) Any payment of the Termination Fee (or applicable portion thereof) shall
be made in cash by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated in
writing by the recipient of such payment.

 

(e) Contributor acknowledges that the provisions of this _Section 8.4_ are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby and that, without these
agreements, Acquirer would not enter into this Agreement. The parties agree
that in the event that Contributor pays the Termination Fee to Acquirer,
Contributor shall have no further liability to Acquirer of any kind in
respect of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and that
in no event shall Contributor be required to pay the Termination Fee on more
than one occasion.

(f) As used herein, " _Termination Fee"_ shall mean a cash amount equal to
$42,168,750.

 



60 ARTICLE IX

_INDEMNIFICATION_

Section 9.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties and Covenants_. None
of the (a) representations and warranties in _Article III_ or _Article IV_ of
this Agreement or (b) covenants, obligations and agreements set forth in
_Article V_ (to the extent required to be performed or complied with on or
prior to the Closing Date) shall survive the Closing; _provided,_ _however,_
the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.1,_ _Section
3.2,_  _Section 3.5,_ _Section 3.6(b),_ _Section 3.17,_ _Section 4.1,_

4.13(d)_ and  _Section 4.19_ (the " _Fundamental Representations"_ ) shall

expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. The covenants contained
in  _Section 5.5(d) _and _(e)_ and _Section 5.6_ through _Section 5.20_
shall survive the Closing until fully performed. For the avoidance of doubt,
the covenants and other agreements of Acquirer set forth in  _Article II_
shall survive the Closing until fully performed.

Section 9.2 _Indemnification_. 

(a) If the Closing shall occur, Contributor, subject to the limitations set
forth in this _Article IX,_ will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Acquirer
and its Affiliates (including Acquirer Sub and the Midstream Entities) and
each of their respective officers and directors (collectively, the " _Acquirer
Indemnitees"_ ) against and in respect of any and all Losses actually
incurred by Acquirer Indemnitees based upon, resulting from or arising out of:

(i) the Retained Business (including the Upstream Business) and the assets
and contracts transferred or assigned to Contributor in connection with the
Pre-Closing Transfer;

(ii) the Proxy Statement, except for Losses based upon an untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from the Proxy
Statement in reliance upon or related to information furnished to Contributor
by Acquirer;

(iii) Contributors breach of its Fundamental Representations; 

(iv) Contributors breach after the Closing Date of any covenant or agreement
of Contributor contained in  _Section 5.7(b),_ _Section 5.13,_ _Section
5.16,_ _Section 5.17_ or _Section 5.19_ any other Transaction Document, or
any certificates delivered in connection herewith or therewith;

 

(v) Contributor Taxes; and

(vi) Contributor Employee Benefit Plans and compliance with applicable Law
relating to the employment of labor, including all applicable Laws relating to
wages, hours, collective bargaining, discrimination, civil rights, worker
safety and health and workers compensation, in each case for the period prior
to Closing.

(b) If the Closing shall occur, Acquirer, subject to the limitations set forth
in this _Article IX,_ will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Contributor and
its Affiliates and each of their respective officers, employees, directors
and equity holders (collectively, the " _Contributor Indemnitees"_ ) against
and in respect of any and all Losses actually incurred by Contributor
Indemnitees based upon, resulting from or arising out of:

(i) the Midstream Business, including any assets or contracts transferred or
assigned to an Acquirer Party in connection with the Pre-Closing Transfer;

_Section 5.8,_ _Section 5.9,_ _Section 5.10,_ _Section 5.12,_ _Section
5.15,_  _Section 5.16,_ _Section 5.17,_ _Section 5.19_ or _Section 5.21_
any other Transaction Document or any certificates delivered in connection
herewith or therewith;

 

(v) any and all Taxes (A) that Acquirer is obligated to pay as set forth in
_Article VII,_ or (B) of or with respect to the Acquirer Parties, Midstream
Entities, Joint Venture Entities or the Midstream Business attributable to any
tax period beginning after the Closing Date or the portion of any Straddle
Period beginning immediately after the Closing Date (determined in accordance
with _Section 7.2(b))_; and

(vi) Acquirers use of the Carve-Out Financial Statements (except to the
extent and only to the extent that such Carve-Out Financial Statements do not
fairly present in all material respects the financial position of the
Midstream Business as of the dates thereof and the results of operations and
cash flows for the periods then-ended (subject, in the case of unaudited
quarterly statements, to normal year-end adjustments)).

 

Section 9.3 _Contributor Representation Breach Adjustment_.

 

(a) No later than five Business Days before the Closing Date, Acquirer shall
deliver to Contributor a notice (a " _Contributor Representation Breach
Notice"_ ) setting forth in reasonable detail (including any documentary
evidence in support thereof) any Losses that Acquirer alleges would be
actually incurred as of such date (as though the Closing were to occur
on such date) by the Acquirer Indemnitees based upon or arising out of a
breach of any representation or warranty of Contributor set forth in _Article
III_ of this Agreement other than the Fundamental Representations (any such
breach being a " _Contributor Representation Breach"_ and any such Loss, a "
_Contributor Representation Breach Loss"_ ). Notwithstanding the foregoing:

(i) No Loss shall be deemed to be a Contributor Representation Breach Loss or
constitute the basis for a reduction in the Contribution Consideration in
accordance with _Section 2.3(c)(iii)_ if such Loss relating to any single
event or series of related events does not exceed $1,000,000.

(ii) The Acquirer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to a reduction in the
Contribution Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.3(c)(iii)_ unless and
until the aggregate

 



62  amount of all such Contributor Representation Breach Losses exceeds
$13,250,000 (the " _Minimum Loss"_ ) and otherwise satisfy all other
requirements under this  _Section 9.3._ After the Minimum Loss is exceeded,
Acquirer Indemnitees shall be entitled to a reduction in the Contribution
Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.3(c)(iii)_ only for such
Contributor Representation Breach Losses in excess of (but not including) the
Minimum Loss, subject to the limitations on recovery and recourse set forth in
this Agreement.

(iii) The maximum amount of any Contributor Representation Breach Losses shall
not exceed and the maximum Contributor Representation Breach Adjustment shall
not exceed $132,500,000 (the " _Cap"_ ).

(iv) No Current Liabilities used in the calculation of Working Capital shall
also be deemed to be a Contributor Representation Breach Loss.

(v) To the extent any amounts or savings described in _Section 9.4(a)_
are recovered or realized, Acquirer shall reimburse Contributor for such
amounts in cash or immediately available funds within 30 Business Days after
such recovery or realization.

(b) If Acquirer fails to deliver a Contributor Representation Breach Notice in
respect of any Contributor Representation Breach Loss on or prior to 5:00 pm
(Central Time) on the fifth Business Day prior to the Closing Date, then
there shall be no Contributor Representation Breach Adjustment in respect of
such Contributor Representation Breach Loss and Acquirer waives any remedies
with respect to any Contributor Representation Breach Loss other than its
rights under _Section 6.2(a),_ _Section 6.2(b),_ _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ and
_Section 8.1(e)_. Acquirer further waives any remedies with respect to such
Contributor Representation Breach or any Contributor Representation Breach
Loss (i) not included on any Contributor Representation Breach Notice timely
delivered in accordance with _Section 9.3(a)_ or (ii) not made in compliance
with, or arising out of a breach of, Acquirers covenants and agreements set
forth in this Agreement.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Contributor Representation Breach
Adjustment"_ means the amount of Contributor Breach Losses agreed to between
Acquirer and Contributor at Closing (the " _Closing Contributor Representation
Breach Adjustment"_ ), plus the amount (if any) of any Contributor
Representation Breach or any Contributor Representation Breach Losses not
agreed by the Parties as of the Closing Date (such items, the " _Disputed
Items"_ ).

 

(d) If any Disputed Items cannot be resolved by the parties by the Closing
Date, the amount of such unresolved Disputed Items (the " _Escrow Amount"_ )
shall be deposited by Acquirer into the Escrow Account pending resolution of
such unresolved Disputed Items, and the Parties shall refer such unresolved
Disputed Items, to resolution by a binding arbitration, to be held following
the Closing in Houston, Texas in accordance with _Section 9.3(e)_ (the "
_Arbitration_ ").

(e) Any Arbitration shall be conducted pursuant to the United States
Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, and in accordance with the then-prevailing
Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures (Including Procedures
for Large, Complex Commercial Disputes) (the " _Commercial Rules"_ ) of the
American Arbitration Association (the " _AAA"_ ). The Parties shall 

 



63  select a single arbitrator pursuant to R-12 of the Commercial Rules, except
that the reference to 14 calendar days in Commercial Rules R-12(b) shall be
replaced with 5 calendar days. Each party shall bear its own expenses
incurred in connection with the Arbitration and the fees and expenses of the
arbitrator shall be shared equally by the parties involved in the dispute and
advanced by them from time to time as required. It is the mutual intention
and desire of the parties that the arbitrator be appointed as expeditiously as
possible following the submission of the Disputed Items to Arbitration. Once
such arbitrator is appointed and except as may otherwise be agreed in writing
by the parties involved in such dispute or as ordered by the arbitrator upon
substantial justification shown, the hearing on the Disputed Items will be
held within 45 days of submission of the dispute to Arbitration. The
arbitrator shall render his or her final award within 30 days of such
hearing, subject to extension by the arbitrator upon substantial justification
shown of extraordinary circumstances, following conclusion of the hearing and
any required post-hearing briefing or other proceedings ordered by the
arbitrator. Any discovery in connection with the Arbitration hereunder shall
be limited to information directly relevant to the controversy or claim in
arbitration. The decision of the arbitrator in any such proceeding will be
final and binding and not subject to judicial review and final judgment may be
entered upon such an award in any court of competent jurisdiction, but entry
of such judgment will not be required to make such award effective. Each party
shall submit to the arbitrator and exchange with each other in advance of the
hearing their last, best offers with respect to each alleged Contributor
Representation Breach comprising the Disputed Items. The arbitrator shall be
limited to awarding only one or the other of the two figures submitted. The
Arbitrator will deliver to the parties a statement containing the resolution
of all outstanding Disputed Items, together with an aggregate total amount of
Losses payable to the Acquirer (if any). Such aggregate amount (if greater
than zero) will be added to any Final Adjustment Deficiency or will reduce any
Final Adjustment Surplus payable pursuant to _Section 2.4(d)._ Promptly
following delivery by the arbitrator of his or her final decision (and in any
event, no less than two Business Days thereafter), the parties shall deliver
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent in the form attached to the
Escrow Agreement specifying the amounts to be paid to each party
in accordance with the preceding sentence.

(f) In the event that there is a Contributor Representation Breach Adjustment
or a Contributor Representation Breach Loss awarded pursuant to _Section
9.3(e),_ Contributor will be subrogated to all rights of Acquirer with respect
to claims to which such Contributor Representation Breach Adjustment or
Contributor Representation Breach Loss award relates. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any Loss that has been finally
settled or arbitrated in accordance with this _Section 9.3_ shall not
subsequently form the basis of any claim under _Section 9.2._

Section 9.4 _Recovery from Third Persons; Mitigation_.

 

(a) The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided by
Contributor or Acquirer, as applicable (the " _Indemnifying Party"_ ) under
this _Article IX_ (before giving effect to the other limitations on
indemnification set forth in this _Article IX_) shall be (i) net of any
amounts actually recovered by any Acquirer Indemnitee or Contributor
Indemnitee, including under insurance policies pursuant to indemnification
rights or otherwise, as applicable (the " _Indemnified Party"_ ) (or any
Affiliate thereof) from other Persons not affiliated with such
Indemnified Party (or any Affiliate thereof) (net of any costs or expenses
incurred for the

 



64  recovery of such amounts), with respect to such Loss and (ii) shall be
calculated in a manner taking into account any savings in Taxes realized by
the Indemnified Party as a result of such Loss.

(b) In connection with any Losses for which an Indemnified Party may seek
indemnification under this _Article IX,_  such Indemnified Party shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to seek and pursue any available insurance
coverage, Tax reduction or benefit, or other claims against third parties that
such Indemnified Person may have in respect of such Losses. Each Indemnified
Party shall take all commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any of its
Losses (including incurring costs necessary to remedy the breach which gives
rise to the Losses) upon becoming aware of any event which would reasonably
be expected to give rise thereto; provided, that such Indemnified Party shall
not be required to take such efforts if they would be detrimental in any
material respect to such party. Acquirer and Contributor shall cooperate with
each other with respect to resolving any claim or liability with respect to
which one party is obligated to indemnify the other party hereunder. In the
event that Acquirer or Contributor shall fail to take commercially reasonably
efforts to mitigate or resolve any claim or liability, then (unless the
proviso to the second sentence of this _Section 9.4(b)_ shall be applicable)
notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained herein, the other
party shall not be required to indemnify any Person for any Loss that could
reasonably be expected to have been avoided if Acquirer or Contributor, as the
case may be, had made such efforts.

Section 9.5 _Indemnification Procedures_.

(a) Any claim for indemnification under _Section 9.2_ will be made in
accordance with this _Section 9.5._ In the case of any claim for
indemnification arising from a claim or demand of a Third-Party (a " _Third-
Party Claim"_ ), the Indemnified Party will give prompt written notice to the
Indemnifying Party describing with reasonable specificity to the extent known
the basis of such Third-Party Claim as to which it may request indemnification
hereunder and must be made in accordance with _Section 9.6(c);_ provided,
however, that the failure to notify or delay in notifying an Indemnifying
Party as provided in this sentence or the next sentence will not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations pursuant to _Section 9.2,_ except to
the extent that such failure causes material harm to the Indemnifying Party.
Any claim for indemnification that does not result from a Third-Party Claim
will be made by written notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party as promptly
as practicable after the time the Indemnified Party becomes aware of the facts
forming the basis of such claim, which notice will describe the facts or
events giving rise to such claim with reasonable specificity to the extent
known. The Indemnifying Party will have the right, at its sole expense, to
defend and to direct the defense against, and to manage and settle, any Third-
Party Claim, in its name or in the name of the Indemnified Party, with counsel
or other Representatives selected by the Indemnifying Party (such counsel to
be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party); provided, however, that
the Indemnifying Party may not assume the defense if (i) the claim seeks
injunctive or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party; or (ii)
the claim would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the
Indemnified Partys ongoing or future business. If the Indemnifying Party
elects to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third-
Party Claim, it shall within 15 Business Days (or sooner, if the nature of the
Third-Party Claim so requires) notify the Indemnified Party of its intent to
do so. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to defend against, negotiate or
settle any Third-Party Claim, or fails to notify the Indemnified Party of its
election as herein provided, the Indemnified

 



65  Party may defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such
Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party defends, negotiates or settles any
Third-Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the
Indemnified Party from time to time for the costs and expenses in connection
therewith upon submission of invoices. The Indemnifying Party may not settle
or compromise any such Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned) if as a result thereof injunctive or other equitable
relief would be imposed against the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party
will cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and make available its officers
and employees and relevant files and records (and those of its Affiliates),
and the Indemnifying Party agrees to promptly provide the Indemnified Party
with such information as to the defense of any such Third-Party Claim as the
Indemnified Party shall reasonably request. If the Indemnifying Party elects
to defend, the Indemnified Party will have the right to participate in (but
not control) the defense of any Third-Party Claim with counsel of its choice
employed by it at its expense and will have the right, but not the obligation,
to assert any and all cross-claims and counterclaims it may have; _provided,_
_however,_ that such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in
any such defense with separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying
Party if (A) so requested by the Indemnifying Party to participate or (B) in
the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, a conflict exists
between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that would make such
separate representation advisable. In the event the Indemnifying Party shall
fail to defend, contest or otherwise protect against the imposition of
any such damages as to any such claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right, but not the obligation, to defend, contest or assert any cross-claim or
counterclaim or otherwise protect against such claim and may make any
compromise or settlement thereof and recover from and be indemnified by the
Indemnifying Party for the entire reasonable cost thereof, including
reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel; _provided,_ _however,_ that (1)
the Indemnifying Party will have no indemnification obligations with respect
to any such claim or demand which is settled by the Indemnified Party without
the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); and (2) the Indemnifying
Party shall not be required to pay for more than one such counsel in each
affected jurisdiction for all Indemnified Parties in connection with any
Third-Party Claim.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 9.5_ to the contrary, neither
the Indemnifying Party nor the Indemnified Party shall, without the prior
written consent of the other party, settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim
or permit a default or consent to entry of any Order unless the claimant
provides to such other party an unqualified release from all liability
in respect of the subject matter to the Third-Party Claim.

Section 9.6 _Further Limitations on Indemnification_.

(a) Following the Closing, except with respect to matters covered by _Article
II,_ the rights of the parties under _Article VII,_ this _Article IX_ and
_Section 10.6_ will be the exclusive remedy of the parties with respect to
any claims a party may have against the other party or such other partys
Affiliates or Representatives under, relating to or in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Nothing in this _Section
9.6_ shall limit or modify any rights of either party to seek or obtain
specific performance or specific enforcement of, or other injunctive or
equitable relief in respect of, any provision of this Agreement.

 



66 (b) In no event shall Contributors or the Acquirer Parties aggregate
liability arising under this _Article IX_ exceed the amount equal to the
aggregate proceeds received by Contributor pursuant to this Agreement.

(c) Acquirer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including Acquirer Sub
and, from and after the Closing, the Midstream Entities) and its and their
respective Representatives, effective upon Closing, to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable law, hereby waives and releases Contributor and its
Affiliates (other than the Midstream Entities) and its and their respective
Representatives from any statutory or other rights of contribution
or indemnity (except as set forth in this _Article IX_ and _Section 10.6_
and claims or causes of action with respect to any breach of any covenant or
agreement to be performed after the Closing) with respect to
Contributors ownership of the Midstream Entities or control or operation of,
or otherwise relating to, the Midstream Business; provided, however, that
Acquirer is not releasing any claims related to the enforcement of this
Agreement. Acquirer consents to the execution by the Midstream Entities prior
to or at the Closing of an instrument by which they agree to be bound by the
provisions of (and in any event waive and release those matters specified in)
this _Section 9.6(c)_ to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law.
Acquirer will take (and will cause the Midstream Entities to take) such
actions following the Closing as Contributor shall reasonably require
(including the taking of corporate action and the execution of instruments
and confirmatory documentation) in order to implement and give effect to the
provisions of this _Section 9.6(c)._

(d) No Indemnified Party will be entitled to recover indirect, special,
consequential, incidental, punitive or business interruption damages, or lost
revenues, profits, cost savings or synergies pursuant to this _Article IX,_
whether based on contract, tort, strict liability, other law or otherwise and
whether or not arising from the other Partys sole, joint or concurrent
negligence, strict liability or other fault, except to the extent such
damages are actually paid by the Indemnified Party to a third Person pursuant
to a final, non-appealable Order or settlement in any Third-Party Claim for
which the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder.

 

(e) In the event that an Indemnifying Party is obligated to indemnify an
Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Article IX,_ the Indemnifying Party will,
upon payment of such indemnity, be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified
Party with respect to claims to which such indemnification relates.

(f) Upon notice by Contributor to Acquirer, Contributor shall have the right
to offset all or any portion of any amounts owed by Acquirer to Contributor
pursuant to _Section 2.4(d)_ or any other provision of this Agreement that
is not paid by Acquirer in accordance with the terms of this Agreement against
any amounts to which any Acquirer Indemnitee becomes entitled to payment in
accordance with this _Article IX._ The foregoing right of offset shall not be
the sole or exclusive right or remedy of Contributor to enforce the rights of
Contributor under this Agreement.

Section 9.7 _Characterization of Payments_. For all Tax purposes, the parties
agree to treat (and shall cause each of their respective Affiliates to treat)
any indemnity payment under this Agreement as an adjustment to the
consideration payable to Contributor pursuant to _Article II_ unless a final
and nonappealable determination by an appropriate Governmental Authority 

 



67  (which shall include the execution of an IRS Form 870 AD or successor form)
provides otherwise; provided, that the Indemnifying Partys prior written
consent (which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
will be obtained by the Indemnified Party who seeks to accept, via a
settlement or compromise with any such Governmental Authority, a position that
is contrary to treatment of an indemnity payment as an adjustment to the
consideration payable to Contributor pursuant to _Article II_.

Section 9.8 _Release_. 

(a) Immediately upon the Closing, Acquirer and its Affiliates (including the
Midstream Entities) hereby fully and irrevocably releases, acquits and
forever discharges each past and current officer, director, partner, general
partner, limited partner, managing director, member, stockholder, trustee,
representative, employee, principal and agent of Contributor GP and each
of the Midstream Entities (solely in their capacity as such, collectively,
the " _Released Parties"_ ) from any and all Losses, claims, demands, rights,
encumbrances, covenants or proceedings, of whatever kind or nature in law,
equity or otherwise, whether known or unknown, and whether or not concealed
or hidden, all of which any Midstream Entity now owns or holds or has at any
time owned or held or may hereafter own or hold against any Released Party at
any time, which arise out actions taken or omission made, prior to the
Closing Date, in respect of the business, affairs and governance and
management of any Midstream Entity; _provided_ that the parties acknowledge
and agree that this _Section 9.8(a)_ does not constitute a release of any
claim resulting from the willful misconduct or fraudulent act by a Released
Party.

(b) Acquirer hereby irrevocably covenants to refrain from, and to cause its
Affiliates to refrain from, directly or indirectly, asserting any claim or
demand, or commencing, instituting or causing to be commenced, any proceeding
of any kind against the Released Parties, based upon any matter purported to
be released hereby.

(c) Without in any way limiting any of the rights and remedies otherwise
available to the Released Parties, Acquirer shall indemnify and hold harmless
each Released Party from and against all Losses and claims, whether or not
involving Third Party Claims, arising directly or indirectly from or
in connection with (i) the assertion by or on behalf of Acquirer or any of
its Affiliates of any claim or other matter purported to be released pursuant
to this _Section 9.8_ and (ii) the assertion by any Third Party of any claim
or demand against any Released Party, which claim or demand arises directly
or indirectly from, or in connection with, any assertion by or on behalf of
the Acquirer or any of its Affiliates against such Third Party of any claims
or other matters purported to be released pursuant to this _Section 9.8._

Section 10.4 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the Parties and their successors and permitted assigns;
provided, however, that neither 

 



69  this Agreement nor any right, interest, or obligation hereunder may be
assigned by any party hereto without the prior written consent of the other
party, except that (a) Acquirer may assign any right hereunder, in whole or
in part, to any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Acquirer that agrees (without
limitation or release of Acquirers liabilities hereunder) to be bound by and
responsible for Acquirers liabilities hereunder and (b) Contributor may
assign any right hereunder, in whole or in part, to any Affiliate of
Contributor that agrees (without limitation or release of Contributors
liabilities hereunder) to be bound by and responsible for
Contributors liabilities hereunder; and provided, further that no party
hereto or successor or assignee has the ability to subrogate any other Person
to any right or obligation under this Agreement. Any purported assignment or
delegation in violation of this Agreement shall be null and void ab initio.

Section 10.5 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
Contributor and the Acquirer Parties shall each bear its own costs and
expenses.

Section 10.6 _Specific Performance_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that a
breach of this Agreement would cause irreparable damage to the Acquirer
Parties and Contributor and the Acquirer Parties and Contributor will not have
an adequate remedy at Law. Therefore, the obligations of the Acquirer Parties
and Contributor under this Agreement, including the Contributors obligation
to contribute the Subject Interests to the Acquirer Sub and Acquirers
obligation to purchase the Subject Interests from Contributor, shall be
enforceable by a decree of specific performance issued by any court of
competent jurisdiction, and appropriate injunctive relief may be applied for
and granted in connection therewith. Such remedies shall, however, be
cumulative and not exclusive and shall be in addition to any other remedies
which any Party may have under this Agreement or otherwise. Each of the
Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief as provided herein on the
basis that (x) either Party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity. Each Party further agrees that no Party shall be required to obtain,
furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a
condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section 10.6,_ and
each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

 

Section 10.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the schedules and
exhibits hereto), together with each of the other Transaction Documents,
constitute the entire understanding and agreement between the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any and all prior or
contemporaneous discussions, agreements and understandings, whether written
or oral, excluding for the avoidance of doubt the Confidentiality Agreement.
Without limiting the foregoing, each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees
that (a) this Agreement, together with each of the other Transaction
Documents, were at the time of execution, and continue to be, executed and
delivered in connection with each of the other Transaction Documents and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, (b) the performance of this
Agreement and each of the other Transaction Documents and expected benefits
herefrom and therefrom are a material inducement to the willingness of the
Parties to enter into and perform this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents and the transactions described herein and therein, (c) the Parties
would not have been willing to enter into this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents in the absence of the entrance into, performance of, and
the economic interdependence of, the Transaction Documents, (d) the

 



70  execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents and
the rights and obligations of the Parties hereto and thereto are interrelated
and part of an integrated transaction being effected pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement and the Transaction Documents, (e) irrespective of the form
such documents have taken, or otherwise, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents are necessary elements of one and the
same overall and integrated transaction, (f) the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and by the Transaction Documents are economically
interdependent, and (g) such Party will cause any of its successors or
permitted assigns to expressly acknowledge and agree to this _Section 10.7_
prior to any assignment or transfer of any Transaction Document, by operation
of law or otherwise.

 

Section 10.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware,
without giving effect to any conflicts of law principles that would result in
the applicable of any Law other than the Law of the State of Delaware.

Section 10.9 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. To the extent not prohibited by
applicable Law that cannot be waived, each Party hereby irrevocably waives and
covenants that it will not assert (whether as plaintiff, defendant or
otherwise) any right to trial by jury in any forum in respect of any issue,
claim, demand, action or cause of action arising in whole or in part under,
related to, based on, or in connection with, this agreement or the subject
matter hereof, whether now existing or hereafter arising and whether sounding
in tort or contract or otherwise. Any Party may file an original counterpart
or a copy of this _Section 10.9_ with any court as written evidence of the
consent of each such Party to the waiver of its right to trial by jury.

Section 10.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Venue_. Except as set forth in
_Section 2.4_ and _Section 9.3:_

(a) The parties hereto submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts of
the State of Delaware and the Federal courts of the United States sitting in
the State of Delaware, and any appellate court from any such state or Federal
court, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agree that all claims with
respect to any such claim may be heard and determined in such Delaware court
or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. The parties hereto
agree that a final judgment in any such claim shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in any other jurisdiction by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that
any party may otherwise have to bring any claim relating to this Agreement or
any related matter against any other party or its assets or properties in the
courts of any jurisdiction.

(b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any related matter
in any Delaware state or Federal court located in the State of Delaware and
the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such claim in any
such court.

 

Section 10.11 _No Reliance_. Except for the representations and warranties
made in this Agreement, none of the Parties or any other Person, including
any Affiliate of any Party, makes

 



71  any other representation or warranty, express or implied, with respect to
such Parties or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and each
Party disclaims any such other representations or warranties, whether made by
such Parties or any of their Affiliates, officers, directors, employees,
agents or representatives (including with respect to the distribution of, or
any such Persons reliance on, any information, disclosure or other document
or other material available in any data room, management presentation or in
any other form in expectation of, or in connection with, the transactions
contemplated hereby). Except for the express representations and warranties
and indemnities set forth in this Agreement, each Party hereby disclaims all
liability and responsibility for any representation, warranty, projection,
forecast, statement, or information made, communicated, or furnished (orally
or in writing) to any other Party or its Affiliates, officers, directors,
employees, agents or representatives (including opinion, information,
projection, or advice that may have been or may be provided to any party or
any director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or representative of such
party or any of its Affiliates) with respect to such party or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 10.12 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this
Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of this Agreement is
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any
applicable Law in any jurisdiction by any applicable Governmental Authority,
(a) such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect the
validity, legality or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement
in such jurisdiction or affect the validity, legality or enforceability of any
provision in any other jurisdiction, (b) such provision shall be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable only to the extent strictly required by such
Governmental Authority, (c) to the extent any such provision is deemed to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, each of the Contributor and Acquirer agree
that it shall use its best efforts to cause such Governmental Authority to
modify such provision so that such provision shall be valid, legal and
enforceable as originally intended to the greatest extent possible, and (d) to
the extent that the Governmental Authority does not modify such provision,
each of the Contributor and Acquirer agree that they shall endeavor in good
faith to exercise or modify such provision so that such provision shall be
valid, legal and enforceable as originally intended to the greatest extent
possible.

Section 10.13 _Disclosure Schedules_. The inclusion of any information
(including dollar amounts) in any section of any schedule required by this
Agreement (the " _Disclosure Schedules"_ ) shall not be deemed to be an
admission or acknowledgment by the disclosing party or any other Party
that such information is required to be listed on such section of the
relevant Disclosure Schedule or is material to or outside the ordinary course
of the business of the applicable Person to which such disclosure relates.
Disclosure in any section of the Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to be
disclosed with respect to any other section of this Agreement to the extent
that it is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that such
disclosure is applicable notwithstanding the omission of a reference or cross
reference thereto. The information contained in this Agreement, the Exhibits
hereto and the Disclosure Schedules is disclosed solely for purposes of this
Agreement, and no information contained herein or therein shall be deemed to
be an admission by any Party hereto to any Third Party of any matter
whatsoever (including any violation of a legal requirement or breach of
contract).

 



72 Section 10.14 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Except as provided in _Section
9.8_ (which will be to the benefit of the Released Parties), (a) none of the
provisions of this Agreement shall be for the benefit of or enforceable by
any Person other than the Parties, including any creditor of any Party or any
of their Affiliates and (b) no such Person shall obtain any right under any
provision of this Agreement or shall by reason of any such provision make any
claim in respect of any liability (or otherwise) against any other Party
hereto.

Section 10.15 _Facsimiles; Electronic Transmission; Counterparts_. This
Agreement may be executed by facsimile or other electronic transmission
(including scanned documents delivered by email) signatures by any Party and
such signature shall be deemed binding for all purposes hereof, without
delivery of an original signature being thereafter required. This Agreement
may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which, when executed,

ARTICLE II

 

 _REGISTRATION RIGHTS_

Section 2.01 _Shelf Registration._

(a) _Shelf Registration._ Regency shall prepare and file by fifteen Business
Days after the Closing Date (the " _File Date"_ ) a registration statement
under the Securities Act to permit the public resale of the Registrable
Securities from time to time, including as permitted by Rule 415 under the
Securities Act (or any similar provision then in force) of the Securities Act
with respect to all of the Registrable Securities (the " _Shelf Registration
Statement"_ ). The Shelf Registration Statement filed pursuant to this
_Section 2.01(a)_ shall be on Form S-3 of the Commission if Regency is
eligible to use Form S-3 or Form S-1 of the Commission if Regency is not
eligible to use Form S-3; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if a prospectus
supplement will be used in connection with the marketing of an Underwritten
Offering from the Shelf Registration Statement and the Managing Underwriter at
any time shall notify Contributor in writing that, in the sole judgment of
such Managing Underwriter, inclusion of detailed information to be used in
such prospectus supplement is of material importance to the success of the
Underwritten Offering of such Registrable Securities, Regency shall use
its reasonable best efforts to include such information in such a prospectus
supplement. Subject to _Section 2.01(b)_, Regency will cause the Shelf
Registration Statement filed pursuant to this _Section 2.01(a)_ to be
continuously effective under the Securities Act from and after the date it is
first

 



C-5   declared or becomes effective until all Registrable Securities covered by
the Shelf Registration Statement have been distributed in the manner set forth
and as contemplated in the Shelf Registration Statement or there are no
longer any Registrable Securities outstanding (the " _Effectiveness Period_
"). The Shelf Registration Statement when declared effective (including the
documents incorporated therein by reference) will comply as to form with all
applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and will
not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading.

(b) _Delay Rights._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, Regency may, upon written notice to (x) all Holders, delay
the filing of the Shelf Registration Statement or (y) any Selling Holder whose
Registrable Securities are included in the Shelf Registration Statement,
suspend such Selling Holders use of any prospectus which is a part of the
Shelf Registration Statement (in which event the Selling Holder shall
discontinue sales of the Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf
Registration Statement but such Selling Holder may settle any contracted
sales of Registrable Securities) if Regency (i) is pursuing an acquisition,
merger, reorganization, disposition or other similar transaction and Regency
determines in good faith that its ability to pursue or consummate such a
transaction would be materially adversely affected by any required disclosure
of such transaction in the Shelf Registration Statement or (ii) has
experienced some other material non-public event the disclosure of which at
such time, in the good faith judgment of Regency would materially adversely
affect Regency; _provided_ , _however_ , in no event shall (A) such filing of
the Shelf Registration Statement be delayed under clauses (i) or (ii) of
this  _Section 2.01(b)_ for a period that exceeds 90 days or (B) such
Selling Holders be suspended under clauses (i) or (ii) of this _Section
2.01(b)_ from selling Registrable Securities pursuant to the
Shelf Registration Statement for a period that exceeds an aggregate of 45
days in any 90-day period or 90 days in any 365-day period. Upon disclosure of
such information or the termination of the condition described above, Regency
shall provide prompt notice to the Selling Holders whose Registrable
Securities are included in the Shelf Registration Statement, and shall
promptly terminate any suspension of sales it has put into effect and shall
take such other actions to permit registered sales of Registrable Securities
as contemplated in this Agreement. Regency will only exercise its suspension
rights under this _Section 2.01(b)_ if it exercises similar suspension rights
under the Prior Registration Rights Agreements that then remain in effect and
with respect to any Parity Holders.

Section 2.02 _Piggyback Rights._

 

(a) _Participation._ If at any time during the Effectiveness Period, Regency
proposes to file (i) a shelf registration statement other than the Shelf
Registration Statement (in which event Regency covenants and agrees to include
thereon a description of the transaction under which Contributor acquired the
Registrable Securities), (ii) a prospectus s pplement to an effective shelf
registration statement, other than the Shelf Registration Statement
contemplated by _Section 2.01(a)_ of this Agreement, and Holders could be
included without the filing of a post-effective amendment thereto (other than
a post-effective amendment that is immediately effective), or (iii) a
registration statement,

 



C-6   other than a shelf registration statement, in the case of each of clause
(i), (ii) or (iii), for the sale of Common Units in an Underwritten Offering
for its own account and/or another Person, then as soon as practicable but
not less than five Business Days prior to the filing of (A) any preliminary
prospectus supplement relating to such Underwritten Offering pursuant to Rule
424(b) under the Securities Act, (B) the prospectus supplement relating to
such Underwritten Offering pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act
(if no preliminary prospectus supplement is used) or (C) such registration
statement, as the case may be, then Regency shall give notice (including, but
not limited to, notification by electronic mail) of such proposed Underwritten
Offering to Contributor and such notice shall offer the Holders the
opportunity to include in such Underwritten Offering such number of
Common Units (the " _Included Registrable Securities"_ ) as each such Holder
may request in writing; _provided,_ _however,_ that if Regency has been
advised by the Managing Underwriter that the inclusion of Registrable
Securities for sale for the benefit of the Holders will have a material
adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the Common Units in the
Underwritten Offering, then the amount of Registrable Securities to be offered
for the accounts of Holders shall be determined based on the provisions of
_Section 2.02(b)_ of this Agreement. The notice required to be provided in
this _Section 2.02(a)_ to Contributor (the " _Piggyback Notice"_ ) shall be
provided on a Business Day pursuant to _Section 3.01_ hereof. Promptly upon
receipt of the Piggyback Notice, Contributor shall notify the other Holders
(if any) of the opportunity to include in the Underwritten Offering such
number of Common Units as each such Holder may request in writing. Each
Holder shall then have three Business Days after the date on which Contributor
received the Piggyback Notice to request inclusion of Registrable Securities
in the Underwritten Offering. If no request for inclusion from a Holder is
received within the specified time, such Holder shall have no further right to
participate in such Underwritten Offering. If, at any time after giving
written notice of its intention to undertake an Underwritten Offering and
prior to the closing of such Underwritten Offering, Regency shall determine
for any reason not to undertake or to delay such Underwritten Offering,
Regency may, at its election, give written notice of such determination to the
Selling Holders and, (x) in the case of a determination not to undertake such
Underwritten Offering, shall be relieved of its obligation to sell any
Included Registrable Securities in connection with such terminated
Underwritten Offering, and (y) in the case of a determination to delay such
Underwritten Offering, shall be permitted to delay offering any Included
Registrable Securities for the same period as the delay in the Underwritten
Offering. Any Selling Holder shall have the right to withdraw such Selling
Holders request for inclusion of such Selling Holders Registrable Securities
in such offering by giving written notice to Regency of such withdrawal up to
and including the time of pricing of such offering. Each Holders rights
under this _Section 2.02(a)_ shall terminate when such Holder (together with
any Affiliates of such Holder) holds, directly or indirectly, less than $25
million in the aggregate of Registrable Securities, based on the Common
Unit Price.

(b) _Priority of Rights._ If the Managing Underwriter or Underwriters of any
proposed Underwritten Offering of Common Units included in an Underwritten
Offering involving Included Registrable Securities advises Regency that the
total amount of Registrable Securities that the Selling Holders and any other
Persons intend to include in such offering exceeds the number that can be
sold in such offering without being likely to have

 



C-7   a material adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the Common
Units offered or the market for the Common Units, then the Registrable
Securities to be included in such Underwritten Offering shall include the
number of Registrable Securities that such Managing Underwriter or
Underwriters advises Regency can be sold without having such adverse effect,
with such number to be allocated (i) first, to Regency, and (ii) second, pro
rata among all Selling Holders, Prior Selling Holders and holders of any other
securities of Regency having rights of registration on parity with the
Registrable Securities (" _Parity Holders"_ ) who have
requested participation in such Underwritten Offering. The pro rata
allocations for each such Selling Holder shall be the product of (A) the
aggregate number of Registrable Securities proposed to be sold by all Selling
Holders, Prior Selling Holders and Parity Holders participating in the
Underwritten Offering (for the avoidance of doubt, after giving effect to the
allocation to Regency pursuant to clause (i) of the preceding sentence)
multiplied by (B) the fraction derived by dividing (x) the number of
Registrable Securities owned at such time by such Selling Holder by (y) the
aggregate number of Registrable Securities owned at such time by all Selling
Holders, Prior Selling Holders and Parity Holders participating in the
Underwritten Offering. All participating Selling Holders, Prior Selling
Holders and Parity Holders shall have the opportunity to share pro rata that
portion of such priority allocable to any Selling Holder(s), Prior Selling
Holder(s) or Parity Holders to the extent not so participating.

Section 2.03 _Underwritten Offering_. In the event that the Selling Holders
holding a majority of the Registrable Securities elect to dispose of
Registrable Securities under the Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to an
Underwritten Offering, Regency will retain Underwriters (which Underwriters
shall be reasonably acceptable to Contributor) subject to such sale through
an Underwritten Offering, including entering into an underwriting agreement in
customary form with the Managing Underwriter or Underwriters, which shall
include, among other provisions, indemnities to the effect and to the extent
provided in _Section 2.08_, and will take all reasonable actions as are
requested by the Managing Underwriter in order to expedite or facilitate the
registration and disposition of the Registrable Securities. No Selling Holder
may participate in such Underwritten Offering unless such Selling Holder
agrees to sell its Registrable Securities on the basis provided in such
underwriting agreement and completes and executes all questionnaires, powers
of attorney, indemnities and other documents reasonably required under the
terms of such underwriting agreement. Each Selling Holder may, at its option,
require that any or all of the representations and warranties by, and
the other agreements on the part of, Regency to and for the benefit of such
underwriters also be made to and for such Selling Holders benefit and that
any or all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of such underwriters
under such underwriting agreement also be conditions precedent to its
obligations. No Selling Holder shall be required to make any representations
or warranties to or agreements with Regency or the Underwriters other than
representations, warranties or agreements regarding such Selling Holder and
its ownership of the securities being registered on its behalf and its
intended method of distribution and any other representations required by law.
If any Selling Holder disapproves of the terms of an underwriting, such
Selling Holder may elect to withdraw therefrom by notice to Regency and the
Managing Underwriter; _provided_ , _however_ , that such notice of withdrawal
must be made at a time before the time of pricing of such offering (which
shall be deemed to occur upon the execution of the purchase or underwriting
agreement) in order to be effective. No such withdrawal or abandonment shall
affect Regencys obligation to pay Registration Expenses.

 



C-8  Section 2.04 _Registration Procedures_. In connection with its obligations
under this Article II, Regency will, as expeditiously as possible:

(a) prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and supplements t
the Shelf Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection
therewith as may be necessary to cause the Shelf Registration Statement to be

Effectiveness Period and as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of
the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered
by the Shelf Registration Statement;

 

(b) furnish to each Selling Holder (i) as far in advance as reasonably

registration statement contemplated by this Agreement or any supplement or
amendment thereto, upon request, copies of reasonably complete drafts of all

exhibits and each document incorporated by reference therein to the extent
then required by the rules and regulations of the Commission), and provide
each such Selling Holder the opportunity to object to any information
pertaining to such Selling Holder and its plan of distribution that is
contained t erein and make the corrections reasonably requested by such
Selling Holder with respect to such information prior to filing the Shelf
Registration Statement or such other registration statement or supplement or
amendment thereto, and (ii) such number of copies of the Shelf Registration
Statement or such other registration statement and the prospectus included
therein and any supplements and amendments thereto as such Persons may
reasonably request in order to facilitate the public sale or other disposition

such other registration statement;

 

(c) if applicable, use its reasonable best efforts to register or qualify the
Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement or any
other registration statement contemplated by this Agreement under the
securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Selling Holders or,
in the case of an Underwritten Offering, the Managing Underwriter,
shall reasonably request, provided that neither Regency nor its general
partner will be required to qualify generally to transact business i any
jurisdiction where it is not then required to so qualify or to take any action
which would subject it to general service of process in any such jurisdiction
where it is not then so subject;

(d) promptly notify each Selling Holder and each underwriter of Registrable
Securities, at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be
delivered under the Securities Act, of (i) the filing of the Shelf
Registration Statement or any other registration statement contemplated by
this Agreement or any prospectus or prospectus supplement to be used in
connection therewith, or any amendment or supplement thereto, and, with
respect to such Shelf Registration Statement or any other
registration statement contemplated by this Agreement, when the same has
become effective; and (ii) any written comments from the Commission with
respect to any filing referred to in clause (i) and any written request by the
Commission for amendments or supplements to the Shelf Registration Statement
or any other registration statement contemplated by this Agreement or any
prospectus or prospectus supplement thereto;

 



C-9  (e) immediately notify each Selling Holder and each underwriter
of Registrable Securities, at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is
required to be delivered under the Securities Act, of (i) the happening of any
event as a result of which the prospectus or prospectus supplement contained
in the Shelf Registration Statement or any other registration statement
contemplated by this Agreement, as then in effect, includes an untrue
statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
in the light of the circumstances then existing; (ii) the issuance or threat
of issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness
of the Shelf Registration Statement or any other registration statement
contemplated by this Agreement, or the initiation of any proceedings for that
purpose; or (iii) the receipt by Regency of any notification with respect to
the suspension of the qualification of any Registrable Securities for sale
under the applicable securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction.
Following the provision of such notice, Regency agrees to as promptly as
practicable amend or supplement the prospectus or prospectus supplement or
take other appropriate action so that the prospectus or prospectus supplement
does not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, in the light of the circumstances then
existing, and to take such other action as is necessary to remove a stop
order, suspension, threat thereof or proceedings related thereto;

registration statement or the date of any amendment or supplement thereto and

agreement, in each case, signed by the independent public accountants who have
certified Regencys financial statements included or incorporated by reference
into the applicable registration statement, and each of the opinion and the
"comfort letter" shall be in customary form and cover substantially the same
matters with respect to such registration statement (and the prospectus and
any prospectus supplement included therein) as are customarily covered in
opinions of issuers counsel and in accountants letters delivered to the
underwriters in Underwritten Offerings of securities, and such other matters
as such underwriters or Selling Holders may reasonably request;

order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable
Securities.

 

Each Selling Holder, upon receipt of notice from Regency of the happening of
any event of the kind described in subsection (e) of this _Section 2.04_ ,
shall forthwith discontinue disposition of the Registrable Securities until
such Selling Holders receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended
prospectus contemplated by subsection (e) of this  _Section 2.04_ or until
it is advised in writing by Regency that the use of the prospectus may be
resumed, and has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings
incorporated by reference in the prospectus, and, if so directed by Regency,
such Selling Holder will, or will request the managing underwriter or
underwriters, if any, to deliver to Regency (at Regencys expense) all copies
in their possession or control, other than permanent file copies then in
such Selling Holders possession, of the prospectus covering such Registrable
Securities current at the time of receipt of such notice.

Section 2.05 _Cooperation by Holders._ Regency shall have no obligation to
include in the Shelf Registration Statement Common Units of a Holder who has
failed to timely furnish such information which, in the opinion of counsel to
Regency, is reasonably required in order for the registration statement or
prospectus supplement thereto, as applicable, to comply with the Securities
Act.

 



C-11  Section 2.06 _Restrictions on Public Sale by Holders of Registrable
Securities._  Each Holder of Registrable Securities who is included in the
Shelf Registration Statement agrees not to effect any public sale or
distribution of the Registrable Securities for a period of up to 45 days
following completion of an Underwritten Offering of equity securities by
Regency, provided that (i) Regency gives written notice to such Holder of the
date of the commencement and termination of such period with respect to any
such Underwritten Offering and (ii) the duration of the foregoing
restrictions shall be no longer than the duration of the shortest restriction
generally imposed by the underwriters of such public sale or distribution on
Regency or on the officers or directors or any other unitholder of Regency
on whom a restriction is imposed.

Section 2.07 _Expenses._

 

(a) _Certain Definitions._ " _Registration Expenses_ " means all expenses
incident to Regencys performance under or compliance with this Agreement to
effect the registration of Registrable Securities on the Shelf Registration
Statement, an Underwritten Offering covered under this Agreement, and/or the
disposition of such securities, including, without limitation, all
registration, filing, securities exchange listing fees, all registration,
filing, qualification and other fees and expenses of complying with securities
or blue sky laws, fees of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority,
transfer taxes and fees of transfer agents and registrars, all word
processing, duplicating and printing expenses, the fees and disbursements of
one counsel to the Holders and counsel and independent public accountants for
Regency including the expenses of any special audits or "comfort letters"
required by or incident to such performance and compliance. Except as
otherwise provided herein, Regency shall not be responsible for legal fees
incurred by Holders in connection with the exercise of such Holders rights
hereunder. In addition, Regency shall not be responsible for any " _Selling
Expenses,_ " which means all underwriting fees, discounts and selling
commissions and (to the extent not paid by the applicable underwriters) fees
of underwriters counsel allocable to the sale of the Registrable Securities.

(b) _Expenses._ Regency will pay all Registration Expenses as determined in
good faith, including, in the case of an Underwritten Offering, whether or not
any sale is made pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement. Each Selling
Holder shall pay all Selling Expenses in connection with any sale of its
Registrable Securities hereunder, and the legal fees incurred by such Holders
in connection with the exercise by such Selling Holders of its rights
hereunder.

Section 2.08 _Indemnification._

 

(a) _By Regency._ In the event of a registration of any Registrable Securities
under the Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement, Regency will indemnify
and hold harmless each Selling Holder thereunder, its Affiliates that own
Registrable Securities and their respective directors and officers and each
underwriter pursuant to the applicable underwriting agreement with such
underwriter and each Person, if any, who controls such

 



C-12   Selling Holder or underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act and its directors and officers (collectively, the " _Selling
Holder Indemnified Persons"_ ), against any losses, claims, damages, expenses
or liabilities (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses)
(collectively, " _Losses"_ ), joint or several, to which such Selling Holder
or underwriter or controlling Person may become subject under the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such Losses (or actions or
proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arise out of
or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any
material fact contained in the Shelf Registration Statement or any other
registration statement contemplated by this Agreement, any preliminary
prospectus, free writing prospectus or final prospectus contained therein, or
any amendment or supplement thereof, or arise out of or are based upon the
omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of a
prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not
misleading or arise out of or are based upon a Selling Holder being deemed to
be an "underwriter," as defined in Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act,
in connection with the registration statement in respect of any registration
of Regencys securities, and will reimburse each such Selling Holder
Indemnified Person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them
in connection with investigating or defending any such Loss or actions or
proceedings; _provided,_ _however,_ that Regency will not be liable in any
such case if and to the extent that any such Loss arises out of or is based
upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission so made in strict conformity with information furnished by such
Selling Holder Indemnified Person in writing specifically for use in the Shelf
Registration Statement or such other registration statement or any prospectus
contained therein or any amendment or supplement thereof. Such indemnity shall
remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on
behalf of such Selling Holder or any such director, officer or controlling
Person, and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such Selling
Holder.

(b) _By Each Selling Holder._ Each Selling Holder agrees severally and not
jointly to indemnify and hold harmless Regency, its directors and officers,
and each Person, if any, who controls Regency within the meaning of the
Securities Act or of the Exchange Act against any Losses to the same extent
as the foregoing indemnity from Regency to the Selling Holders, but only with
respect to information regarding such Selling Holder furnished in writing by
or on behalf of such Selling Holder expressly for inclusion in the Shelf
Registration Statement or any prospectus contained therein or any amendment or
supplement thereof relating to the Registrable Securities; _provided,_
_however,_ that the liability of each Selling Holder shall not be greater in
amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds (net of any Selling Expenses)
received by such Selling Holder from the sale of the Registrable Securities
giving rise to such indemnification.

 

(c) _Notice._ Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party hereunder of
notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a
claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party
hereunder, notify the indemnifying party in writing thereof, but such
indemnified partys failure to so notify the indemnifying party shall not
relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may have to any
indemnified party other than under this _Section 2.08._ The indemnifying

 



C-13   party shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it shall wish,
to assume and undertake the defense thereof with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to such indemnified party and, after notice from the
indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume and
undertake the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to
such indemnified party under this _Section 2.08_ for any legal expenses
subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense
thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation and of liaison with
counsel so selected; _provided,_ _however,_ that, (i) if the
indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel
reasonably acceptable to the indemnified party or (ii) if the defendants in
any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party
and counsel to the indemnified party shall have concluded that there may be
reasonable defenses available to the indemnified party that are different from
or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, or if the
interests of the indemnified party reasonably may be deemed to conflict with
the interests of the indemnifying party, then the indemnified party shall have
the right to select a separate counsel and to assume such legal defense and
otherwise to participate in the defense of such action, with the reasonable
expenses and fees of one such separate counsel (firm) and other reasonable
expenses related to such participation to be reimbursed by the indemnifying
party as incurred. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
no indemnified party shall settle any action brought against it with respect
to which it is entitled to indemnification hereunder without the consent of
the indemnifying party, unless the settlement thereof imposes no liability or
obligation on, and includes a complete and unconditional release from all
liability of, the indemnifying party.

(d)  _Contribution._ If the indemnification provided for in this _Section
2.08_ is held by a court or government agency of competent jurisdiction to be
unavailable to Regency or any Selling Holder or is insufficient to hold it
harmless in respect of any Losses, then each such indemnifying party, in lieu
of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by such indemnified party as a result of such Losses as between
Regency, on the one hand, and such Selling Holder, on the other hand, in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of Regency, on the
one hand, and of such Selling Holder, on the other, in connection with the
statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses, as well as any other
relevant equitable considerations; _provided_ , _however,_ that in no event
shall such Selling Holder be required to contribute an aggregate amount in
excess of the dollar amount of proceeds (net of Selling Expenses) received by
such Selling Holder from the sale of Registrable Securities giving rise to
such indemnification. The relative fault of Regency, on the one hand, and each
Selling Holder, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among
other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact has been
made by, or relates to, information supplied by such party, and the parties
relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct
or prevent such statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that it would
not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this paragraph were to
be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation
which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the
first sentence of this paragraph. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a
result of the Losses referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph
shall be deemed to include any legal and

 



C-14   other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection
with investigating or defending any Loss which is the subject of this
paragraph. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any Person who is not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

 

(e) _Other Indemnification_. The provisions of this _Section 2.08_ shall be
in addition to any other rights to indemnification or contribution which an
indemnified party may have pursuant to law, equity, contract or otherwise.

 

Section 2.09 _Rule 144 Reporting._ With a view to making available the
benefits of certain rules and regulations of the Commission that may permit
the sale of the Registrable Securities to the public without registration,
Regency agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to:

(a) Make and keep public information regarding Regency available, as those
terms are understood and defined in Rule 144 of the Securities Act, at all
times from and after the date hereof;

 

(b) File with the Commission in a timely manner all reports and other
documents required of Regency under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act
at all times from and after the date hereof;

(c) So long as a Holder owns any Registrable Securities, furnish to such
Holder forthwith upon request a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly
report of Regency, and such other reports and documents so filed as such
Holder may reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of
the Commission allowing such Holder to sell any such securities without
registration; and

(d) At Holders expense, take such further action as any Holder may
reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable the
Holders to sell Registrable Securities without registration under the
Securities Act within the limitations of the exemption provided by Rule 144.

Section 2.10 _Transfer or Assignment of Registration Rights._  The rights to
cause Regency to include Registrable Securities in a Shelf Registration
Statement may be transferred or assigned by Contributor to one or more
transferee(s) or assignee(s) of such Registrable Securities, provided that (a)
such transferee or assignee is an Affiliate of Contributor or receives at
least 20% of the Common Units covered by this Agreement, (b) Regency is given
written notice prior to any said transfer or assignment, stating the name and
address of each such transferee and identifying the securities with respect
to which such registration rights are being transferred or assigned, and (c)
each such transferee or assignee assumes in writing responsibility for its
portion of the obligations of Contributor under this Agreement.

Section 2.11 _Information by Holder_. Any Holder or Holders of
Registrable Securities included in any registration statement shall promptly
furnish to Regency such information regarding such Holder or Holders and the
distribution proposed by such Holder or Holders as Regency may reasonably
request and as shall be required in connection with any registration,
qualification or compliance referred to herein.

but not otherwise defined shall have the respective meanings ascribed to such
terms in the Contribution Agreement (as defined below).

_W I T N E S S E T H:_

WHEREAS, Acquirer, Acquirer Sub and Contributor have entered into that certain

interests referred to in clauses (a) and (b) collectively, the " _Subject
Interests"_ ) in exchange for consideration comprised of cash and Acquirer
Common Units, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein;

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, Acquirer and Contributor have
agreed to execute and deliver this Agreement and for Contributor to deposit
with the Escrow Agent $[ ] (the " _Escrow Deposit"_ ), to be subject to
the terms and conditions set forth herein. 

WHEREAS, Acquirer, Acquirer Sub and Contributor desire that Escrow Agent act
as escrow agent in accordance with the terms hereof, and Escrow Agent is
willing to act in such capacity.

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and covenants and agreements
stated herein the Parties intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as
follows:

1\. _Escrow Agent Appointment._ Acquirer, Acquirer Sub and Contributor hereby
appoint and designate the Escrow Agent, as the escrow agent to receive, hold,
sell (if required hereunder) and distribute the Escrow Amount in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement. Escrow Agent hereby accepts its appointment
as escrow agent and agrees to receive, hold, administer, sell (if required
hereunder), invest and disburse the Escrow Amount in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, " _Escrow Amount"_ shall mean,
as of any time, the amount of the Escrow Deposit and any proceeds thereon,
including any investment income earned, held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to
this Agreement.

 



F-2  2\. _Establishment of Escrow_. Following the execution of this Agreement, the
Escrow Deposit will be delivered by Contributor to Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent
hereby agrees, upon receipt of the Escrow Deposit, to act as escrow agent and
to hold, safeguard and disburse the Escrow Amount pursuant to the terms and
conditions hereof. 

3\. _Investment of Funds; Tax Treatment._ Escrow Agent shall invest any cash
portion of the Escrow Amount, without distinction between principal and
income, in (i) United States Treasury Bills (or an investment portfolio or

rated in the highest grade by a nationally recognized credit rating agency,
(iii) money market funds (so long as such money market fund is rated AAA by a
nationally recognized credit rating agency) or (iv) any combination thereof,
with the income from such investments being held by Escrow Agent as part of
the Escrow Amount. Escrow Amount investments shall remain so invested until
receipt by Escrow Agent of a written instruction signed by each of Acquirer
and Contributor directing Escrow Agent to change such investment or
an instruction in accordance with _Section 4_ below.

Except to the extent required by applicable law, the Parties agree that
Acquirer shall be treated as the owner of the Escrow Amount for federal and
state income and withholding tax purposes and that Acquirer shall include in
taxable income the earnings on the Escrow Amount.

 

Escrow Agent shall have no obligation to invest or reinvest any cash portion
of the Escrow Amount on the day of deposit if deposited with Escrow Agent

investments whenever Escrow Agent shall be required to release the Escrow
Amount pursuant to the terms hereof. Requests (or instructions) received
after 11:00 a.m. (E.S.T.) by Escrow Agent to liquidate the Escrow Amount will
be treated as if received on the Next Business Day. Escrow Agent shall have no
responsibility for any investment losses resulting from the investment,
reinvestment or liquidation of the Escrow Amount, which shall be considered to
reduce the Escrow Amount. Any distributions, interest, income or other amounts
received on such investment and reinvestment of the Escrow Amount shall
become part of the Escrow Amount. It is agreed and understood that Escrow
Agent may earn fees associated with the investments outlined above.

4\. _Disbursements of Escrow Amount._

(a) The Escrow Agent shall disburse the Escrow Amount, or any portion
thereof, only upon (i) delivery to the Escrow Agent of joint written

F-3   paid (" _Joint Instructions_ "), (ii) delivery of a final decision of the
arbitrators in accordance with Section 9.4(e) of the Contribution Agreement or
(ii) delivery to the Escrow Agent from either an authorized representative of
Acquirer and Contributor (with a copy sent concurrently to the other Party) of
a final order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction directing
delivery of the Escrow Amount, or a portion thereof (a " _Final
Determination"_ ), and accompanied by a written certification from counsel for
the instructing Party attesting that such Final Determination is final and not
subject to further proceedings or appeal along with a written instruction
from an authorized representative of the instructing Party given to effectuate
such Final Determination and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
conclusively rely upon any such certification and instruction and shall
have no responsibility to review the Final Determination to which such
certification and instruction refers or to make any determination as to
whether such Final Determination is final.

instructions set forth on _Exhibit C_ hereto.

 

5\. _Termination of Escrow_. The escrow provided for hereunder shall terminate
upon the earlier to occur of the following: 

(a) Upon the mutual written consent of Acquirer and Contributor (written
notice of which shall be given to Escrow Agent); or 

(b) Upon the disbursement of all of the Escrow Amount pursuant to _Section 4_
of this Agreement.

 

6\. _Escrow Agent._ In performing its duties under this Agreement or upon the
claimed failure to perform its duties hereunder, Escrow Agent shall have no
liability except for its acts of recklessness, fraud, willful misconduct or
gross negligence. Escrow Agents sole responsibility shall be for the
safekeeping and disbursement of the Escrow Amount in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. Escrow Agent shall have no implied duties or
obligations and shall not be charged with knowledge or notice of any fact or
circumstance not specifically set forth herein or in any notice given to it
under this Agreement in accordance with _Section 11_ hereof. Escrow Agent
shall be entitled to rely upon and shall be protected in acting upon any
request, instructions, statement or other instrument, not only as to its due
execution, validity and effectiveness, but also as to the truth and accuracy
of any information contained therein, which Escrow Agent shall in good faith
believe to be genuine, to have been signed or presented by the person or
Parties purporting to sign the same and to conform to the provisions of this
Agreement. In no event shall Escrow Agent be liable for incidental, indirect,
special, consequential or punitive damages. Escrow Agent shall not be
obligated to take any legal action or to commence any proceeding in
connection with the Escrow Amount or any account in which the Escrow Amount
is deposited or this Agreement, or to appear in, prosecute or defend any such
legal action or proceedings. Escrow Agent may consult legal counsel selected
by it in the event of any dispute or question as to the construction of any
of the provisions hereof or of any other agreement or of its duties hereunder,
and shall incur no liability and shall be fully protected from any liability
whatsoever in acting in accordance with the opinion or instruction of such
counsel.

 



F-4   Acquirer and Contributor, jointly and severally, shall promptly pay upon
demand the reasonable fees and expenses of any such counsel; _provided,_
_however_ , Acquirer and Contributor agree that such fees and expenses shall
be borne equally between Acquirer and Contributor. Escrow Agent shall have no
obligations or responsibilities in connection with the Contribution Agreement,
or any other agreement between the Parties, other than this Agreement.

7\. _Indemnification._ From and at all times after the date of this Agreement,
Acquirer, Acquirer Sub and Contributor, jointly and severally, shall, to the
fullest extent permitted by law and to the extent provided herein, indemnify
and hold harmless Escrow Agent and each director, officer, employee, attorney,
agent and affiliate of Escrow Agent (collectively, the " _Indemnified
Parties"_ ) against any and all actions, claims (whether or not valid),
losses, damages, liabilities, costs, penalties, fines, judgments and expenses
of any kind or nature whatsoever (including reasonable attorneys fees, costs
and expenses) incurred by or asserted against any of the Indemnified Parties
from and after the date hereof, whether direct, indirect or consequential, as
a result of or arising from or in any way relating to any claim, demand,
suit, action or proceeding (including any inquiry or investigation) by any
Person, whether threatened or initiated, asserting a claim for any legal or
equitable remedy against any person under any statute or regulation,
including any federal or state securities laws, or under any common law or
equitable cause or otherwise, arising from or in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution, performance or failure of performance of
this Agreement or any transactions contemplated herein, whether or not any
such Indemnified Party is a party to any such action, proceeding, suit or the
target of any such inquiry or investigation; _provided,_ _however_ , that no
Indemnified Party shall have the right to be indemnified hereunder for any
liability finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, subject to
no further appeal, to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such Indemnified Party. If any such action or claim shall be
brought or asserted against any Indemnified Party, such Indemnified Party
shall promptly notify Acquirer and Contributor in writing, and such
Indemnified Party shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment
of counsel;  _provided,_ _however_ , that such counsel shall be reasonably
acceptable to Acquirer and Contributor, and Acquirer and Contributor shall be
responsible for the fees and expenses of such counsel referred to in the
foregoing sentence. All such fees and expenses payable by Acquirer and
Contributor pursuant to the foregoing sentence shall be paid from time to time
as incurred, both in advance of and after the final disposition of such action
or claim. All of the foregoing losses, damages, costs and expenses of the
Indemnified Parties shall be payable by Acquirer and Contributor, jointly and
severally, upon demand by such Indemnified Party. As between Acquirer and
Contributor, such losses, damages, costs and expenses shall be borne equally
between Acquirer and Contributor. The obligations of Acquirer and Contributor
under this _Section 7_ shall survive any termination of this Agreement and
the resignation or removal of Escrow Agent.

 

The Parties agree that neither the payment by Acquirer or Contributor of any
claim by Escrow Agent for indemnification hereunder nor the disbursement of
any amounts to Escrow Agent from the Escrow Amount in respect of a claim by
Escrow Agent for indemnification shall impair, limit, modify or affect, as
between Acquirer and Contributor, the respective rights and obligations
of Acquirer and Contributor under this Agreement. Acquirer and Contributor
agree among themselves that any obligation for indemnification under this
_Section 7_ shall be borne by Acquirer and Contributor in proportion to
Acquirers and Contributors respective responsibility, if any, of such loss,
damage, liability, cost or expense for which Escrow Agent is entitled to

 



F-5   indemnification, the causation to be determined by mutual agreement,
arbitration (if Acquirer and Contributor agree in writing to submit the
dispute to arbitration) or litigation;  _provided,_ _however_ , that if no
such Party is determined to be responsible for such loss, damage, liability,
cost or expense, any obligation for indemnification under this _Section 7_
shall be borne equally between Acquirer and Contributor.

8\. _Disputes._ If, at any time, there shall exist any dispute between
Acquirer and Contributor with respect to the holding or disposition of any
portion of the Escrow Amount or any other obligations of Escrow Agent
hereunder, or if at any time Escrow Agent is unable to determine, to Escrow
Agents sole satisfaction, the proper disposition of any portion of the
Escrow Amount or Escrow Agents proper actions with respect to its obligations
hereunder, or if Acquirer and Contributor have not, within thirty (30)
calendar days of the furnishing by Escrow Agent of a notice of
resignation pursuant to _Section 9_ below, appointed a successor escrow
agent to act hereunder, then Escrow Agent may, in its sole discretion, take
either or both of the following actions:

 

(a) suspend the performance of any of its obligations under this Agreement
until such dispute or uncertainty shall be resolved to the sole satisfaction
of Escrow Agent or until a successor escrow agent shall have been appointed
(as the case may be) as evidenced by written instructions executed by Acquirer
and Contributor; and

 

(b) petition (by means of an interpleader action or any other appropriate
method) any court of competent jurisdiction in Delaware for instructions with
respect to such dispute or uncertainty, and pay into or deposit with such
court all disputed escrow amounts held by it in the Escrow Amount for holding
and disposition in accordance with the instructions of such court.

 

Escrow Agent shall have no liability to Acquirer, Acquirer Sub, Contributor or
any other person with respect to any such suspension of performance or
disbursement into court, specifically including any liability that may arise,
or be alleged to have arisen, out of or as a result of any delay in the
disbursement of funds held in the Escrow Amount or any delay in or with
respect to any other action required or requested of Escrow Agent.

9\. _Resignation or Removal of Escrow Agent._ Escrow Agent may resign from
the performance of its duties hereunder at any time by giving ten (10)
Business Days prior written notice to Acquirer and Contributor or may be
removed, with or without cause, by Acquirer and Contributor, acting jointly,
at any time by the giving of ten (10) Business Days prior written notice to
Escrow Agent. Such resignation or removal shall take effect upon the
appointment of a successor escrow agent as provided herein. Upon any such
notice of resignation or removal, Acquirer and Contributor, acting jointly,
shall appoint a successor escrow agent hereunder, which shall be a commercial
bank, trust Contributor or other financial institution with a combined capital
and surplus in excess of $100,000,000, unless otherwise agreed by Acquirer
and Contributor as evidenced by written instructions executed by Acquirer and
Contributor. Upon the acceptance in writing of any appointment as Escrow Agent
hereunder by a successor escrow agent, such successor escrow agent shall
thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges
and duties of the retiring Escrow Agent, and the retiring Escrow Agent shall
be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement, but shall
not be discharged from any liability for actions taken as Escrow Agent
hereunder prior to such

 



F-6   succession. After any retiring Escrow Agents resignation or removal, the
provisions of this Agreement shall inure to its benefit as to any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Escrow Agent under this
Agreement.

10\. _Fees._ Acquirer and Contributor shall compensate Escrow Agent for
its services hereunder in accordance with _Exhibit B_ attached hereto and, in
addition, shall reimburse Escrow Agent for all of its reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses, including attorneys fees, travel expenses, telephone and
facsimile transmission costs, postage, copying charges and the like
(collectively, the " _Fees_ "). All of the compensation and reimbursement
obligations set forth in this _Section 10_ shall be payable upon demand by
Escrow Agent and, with respect to Escrow Agent, shall be a joint and several
obligation of Acquirer and Contributor. Acquirer and Contributor agree that
the Fees shall be borne equally between Acquirer and Contributor, and the Fees
payable by Acquirer may be deducted from the Escrow Amount otherwise required
to be distributed to Acquirer. The obligations of Acquirer and Contributor
under this _Section 10_ shall survive any termination of this Agreement and
the resignation or removal of Escrow Agent. 

11\. _Notices._ Any notice, request, instruction, correspondence or other
document to be given hereunder by any party to the other parties (herein
collectively called " _Notice"_ ) shall be in writing and delivered in person
or by courier service requiring acknowledgment of receipt of delivery or
mailed by certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested, or by
electronic mail, as follows:

Party of such Partys rights and obligations under this Agreement will be made

_provided_ that Acquirer shall, without the obligation to obtain the prior

the benefit of the Parties and their successors and permitted assigns, and any
reference to a Party will also be a reference to a successor or permitted
assign.

will include the plural and the plural will include the singular, and the
gender of any pronoun will include the other genders.

15\. _Captions; Construction._ The titles, captions and table of contents
contained in this Agreement are inserted in this Agreement only as a matter
of convenience and for reference and in no way define, limit, extend or
describe the scope of this Agreement or the intent of any provision of this
Agreement. Unless otherwise specified to the contrary, all references to
Articles and Sections are references to Articles and Sections of this
Agreement and all references to Exhibits are references to Exhibits to this
Agreement. Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise clearly requires,
the words "include," "includes" and "including" do not limit the preceding
terms or words and shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without

16\. _Controlling Law; Amendment._ This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware,
without giving effect to any conflicts of law principles that would result in
the applicable of any Law other than the Law of the State of Delaware. This
Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented except by
written agreement of the Parties.

 



F-8  17\. _Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Venue._

 

(a) The Parties submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts of the State
of Delaware and the Federal courts of the United States sitting in the State
of Delaware, and any appellate court from any such state or Federal court, and
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agree that all claims with respect to
any such claim may be heard and determined in such Delaware court or, to the
extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. The Parties agree that a final
judgment in any such claim shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any
other jurisdiction by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that any party may
otherwise have to bring any claim relating to this Agreement or any related
matter against any other party or its assets or properties in the courts of
any jurisdiction.

 

(b) Each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest
extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now
or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any related matter in any
Delaware state or Federal court located in the State of Delaware and the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such claim in any such
court.

18\. _Severability_. Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction will, as to such jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement, and any
such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction will not invalidate
or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. To the
extent permitted by law, the Parties waive any provision of law which renders
any such provision prohibited or unenforceable in any respect.

19\. _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or
more counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, and it will not
be necessary in making proof of this Agreement or the terms of this Agreement
to produce or account for more than one (1) of such counterparts.

 

20\. _Waiver_. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any extension or waiver
of any provision of this Agreement will be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. A waiver by a Party of
the performance of any covenant, agreement, obligation, condition,
representation or warranty will not be construed as a waiver of any other
covenant, agreement, obligation, condition, representation or warranty. A
waiver by any Party of the performance of any act will not constitute a waiver
of the performance of any other act or an identical act required to be
performed at a later time. 

21\. _Integration._ This Agreement and the documents executed pursuant to this
Agreement supersede all negotiations, agreements and understandings among the
Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.

22.  _Miscellaneous._ Escrow Agent does not have any interest in the Escrow
Amount deposited hereunder but is serving as escrow holder only and having
only possession thereof. Acquirer and Contributor shall pay or reimburse
Escrow Agent upon request for any transfer

 



F-9   taxes or other taxes relating to the Escrow Amount (other than taxes related
to fees paid to Escrow Agent hereunder) incurred in connection herewith and
shall indemnify and hold harmless Escrow Agent from any amounts that it is
obligated to pay in the way of such taxes. Acquirer, on the one hand, and
Contributor, on the other hand, agree that such expense shall be borne equally
between Acquirer and Contributor, provided that Contributor shall be solely
responsible for any transfer or other taxes relating to or arising from any
sale or other liquidation of any Escrow Amount by Escrow Agent pursuant to the
terms hereof. Any such taxes shall not be treated as out-of-pocket
expenses for the purposes of _Section 10_ of this Agreement and shall not
reduce the Escrow Amount. The Escrow Agent shall withhold or deduct from
payments made under this Agreement any taxes that are required to be withheld
or deducted under applicable law. For the purposes of this Agreement and the
Contribution Agreement, any amounts withheld or deducted by the Escrow Agent
pursuant to the prior sentence shall be treated as having been paid to the
recipient of the payment with respect to which such withholding or deduction
was required and shall reduce, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, amounts otherwise
payable to such recipient. Acquirer will provide Escrow Agent with appropriate
W-9 forms for tax I.D. in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit D,_ number
certifications, or W-8 forms for non-resident alien certifications. This
paragraph shall survive notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement or
the resignation or removal of Escrow Agent. Each Party hereby represents and
warrants (a) that this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered on its behalf and constitutes its legal, valid and binding
obligation and (b) that the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by the Parties does not and will not violate any applicable law or
regulation.

 



F-10  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have executed and delivered this Agreement as
of the date first written above.

investor" as defined in Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) under the Securities
Act; or [ _Explanatory Note: Although private exchange offers are
customarily directed to QIBs, that standard is directly relevant to resales
under Rule 144A, and not to the target investors in a private placement
conducted under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act (such as this Private
Exchange Offer). The more relevant standard for the Private_

_Exchange Offer would be "accredited investors" (borrowed from Regulation D)
since Regulation D is a safe harbor under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities
Act. However, since the target holders of Everest Notes are QIBs (and identify
themselves as such), and all QIBs are almost certainly IAIs, the suggestion
here is that we apply the more relevant Regulation D standard, together
with the QIB standard that the investors are accustomed to seeing._ ] __

 an institution that is an "accredited investor" as defined in Rule
501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) under the Securities Act; or [ _Explanatory Note:
This category is included because In the unlikely event that a holder of
Everest Notes is an IAI, but not a QIB, that holder should nevertheless be
allowed to participate in the Private Exchange Offer. On the other hand,
extending the exchange offer to investors who are not "accredited investors"
would require registration of the offer under the Securities Act_.]

 outside the United States and is a non-U.S. person eligible to

Regulation S under the Securities Act. 

   | 
   |  | Only persons who have completed and returned the eligibility
certification certifying that they are Eligible Holders shall be authorized to
receive and review the Confidential Offering Memorandum. Only Eligible
Holders that hold Everest Notes may participate in the Private Exchange Offer,
and the Confidential Offering Memorandum will provide that holders who tender
Everest Notes pursuant to the Private Exchange Offer will be deemed to
represent that they are Eligible Holders.

  Interest |  | 8 3/8% per annum. Interest on the Private Exchange Notes
will accrue from the Settlement Date and be payable semi-annually on June 1
and December 1 of each year, beginning on June 1, 2014.

  Ranking |  | The Private Exchange Notes will be unsecured and will
rank equally with all Regencys existing and future unsubordinated
obligations, including Regencys outstanding 4 1/2% Senior Notes due 2023, 6
7/8% Senior Notes due 2018, 6 1/2% Senior Notes due 2021, 5 1/2% Senior Notes
due 2023 and 5.75% Senior Notes due 2020 (collectively, the "Existing Senior
Notes"). The Private Exchange Notes will be senior in right of payment to any
of Regencys future obligations that are, by their terms, expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Private Exchange Notes. The Private
Exchange 
  



H-2  ---|---|--- 
    |  | Notes will be effectively subordinated to Regencys existing
and future secured indebtedness, including indebtedness under Regencys
revolving credit facility, to the extent of the value of the collateral
securing such obligations. 
   | 
   |  | The guarantees of the Private Exchange Notes will be unsecured
and will rank equally with all of the guarantors existing and future
unsubordinated obligations, including their guarantees of the Existing Senior
Notes. The guarantees of the Private Exchange Notes will be senior in right of
payment to any of the guarantors future obligations that are, by their terms,
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the guarantees of the Private
Exchange Notes. The guarantees of the Private Exchange Notes will be
effectively subordinated to the guarantors existing and future secured
indebtedness, including their guarantees of indebtedness under
Regencys revolving credit facility, to the extent of the value of the
collateral securing such indebtedness. 
   | 
   |  | The Private Exchange Notes and the guarantees thereof will be
structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and obligations of Regencys
subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Private Exchange Notes. 
   | 
  Guarantees |  | The Private Exchange Notes will be guaranteed on a
senior basis by the same subsidiaries that guarantee Regencys 5.75% Senior
Notes due 2020, pursuant to guarantee provisions consistent with the
guarantee provisions in the indenture governing such notes. 
   | 
  Optional Redemption |  | At any time prior to June 1, 2015, the
Issuers may redeem some or all of the Private Exchange Notes at a redemption
price equal to 100% of the principal amount of notes redeemed plus the
Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding,
the date of redemption, subject to the rights of holders of Private Exchange
Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest
payment date that is on or prior to the redemption date. "Applicable Premium"
will be defined to mean, with respect to any Private Exchange Note on any
redemption date, the excess of: (a) the present value at such redemption date
of (i) the redemption price of the Private Exchange Note at June 1, 2015 plus
(ii) all required interest payments due on the note through June 1, 2015
(excluding accrued but unpaid interest to the redemption date), computed using
a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate as of such redemption date plus 50
basis points; over (b) the principal amount of the note. "Treasury Rate" will
be defined in a manner consistent with the definitions of such term in the
indenture governing Regencys 5.75% Senior Notes due 2020, with the date
referred to in such definition being changed to June 1, 2015. 
  



H-3  ---|---|--- 
     |  | On or after June 1, 2015, Regency may on any one or more
occasions redeem some or all of the Private Exchange Notes at the redemption
prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) described below, plus
accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the redemption date, if
redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on June 1 of the years
indicated below.

      |  | 
---|---|--- 
    |  | In addition, on any one or more occasions prior to June 1,
2014, Regency may redeem up to 35% of the Private Exchange Notes in an
aggregate principal amount not to exceed the proceeds of certain sales of
Regencys equity securities or contributions to Regencys equity capital at
108.375% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to
the date of redemption, if at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of
the Private Exchange Notes issued pursuant to the Private Exchange Offer
remains outstanding after such redemption and the redemption occurs within 180
days after the date of the closing of such equity sale or contribution.
Notice of any redemption of Private Exchange Notes must be given at least 30
days and no more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, and any such
redemption may, at Regencys discretion, be subject to one or more
conditions precedent. 
   | 
  Change of Control |  | Upon the occurrence of a change of control
event, which occurrence (other than one involving the adoption of a plan
relating to liquidation or dissolution) is followed by a ratings decline
within 90 days of the consummation of the transaction, Regency must offer to
repurchase the Private Exchange Notes at 101% of the principal amount of the
notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of
repurchase. A ratings decline is defined as a decrease in the rating of the
Private Exchange Notes by both Moodys Investors Service, Inc. ("Moodys") and
Standard and Poors Ratings Services ("Standard and Poors") by one or more
gradations of the Private Exchange Notes. If holders of not less than 90% of
the principal amount of the outstanding Private Exchange Notes accept the
change of control offer and Regency purchases all Private Exchange Notes held
by such tendering holders, Regency will have the right to redeem the
remaining outstanding Private Exchange Notes at 101% of the principal amount
of the Private Exchange Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest,
if any, to the date of repurchase.

   Certain Covenants |  | The indenture governing the Private Exchange
Notes will contain covenants (which will be consistent with corresponding
covenants and related definitions included in the indenture for Regencys
5.75% Senior Notes due 2020) limiting, among other things, Regencys ability
and the ability of certain of Regencys subsidiaries to: 
   | 
   |  |

 incur additional indebtedness; 

   | 
   |  |

 pay distributions on, or repurchase or redeem Regencys
equity interests; 

   | 
   |  |

 make certain investments; 

   | 
   |  |

 incur liens; 

   | 
   |  |

 enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates of Regency; and 

    | 
   |  |

 sell assets or consolidate or merge with or into other companies. 

   | 
   |  | These and other covenants that are contained in the indenture
will be subject to exceptions and qualifications. 
   | 
   |  | If the Private Exchange Notes achieve investment grade ratings
by both Moodys and Standard and Poors and no default or event of default has
occurred and is continuing under the indenture, Regency and its restricted
subsidiaries will no longer be subject to many of the foregoing covenants. 
   | 
  Events of Default; Amendments, etc. |  | To be consistent with the
Events of Default and the amendment, defeasance and satisfaction and discharge
provisions in the indenture governing 5.75% Senior Notes due 2020.

registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws, and will be
subject to restrictions on transfer until registered. 
   | 
  Registration Rights |  | In connection with the issuance of the
Private Exchange Notes, Regency and Regency Energy Finance Corp. and the
guarantors will enter into an agreement obligating them to: 
   | 
   |  |

 (a) use their commercially reasonable efforts to file a
registration statement, which is referred to as the "exchange offer
registration statement," with the SEC so that the Private Exchange Notes (and
the guarantees thereof) can be exchanged for freely-tradable notes (with
substantially the same terms and in the same form as the Private Exchange
Notes);" (b) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the exchange offer
registration statement to be declared effective within 365 days 

 



H-5  ---|---|--- 
    |  |

after the first issue date of the Private Exchange Notes; and (c) use
commercially reasonable efforts to complete the registered exchange offer
within 30 business days of the effective date of such exchange offer
registration statement; or 

   | 
   |  |

 in lieu of such a registered exchange offer, file a shelf
registration statement so the Private Exchange Notes, and the guarantees
thereof, can be freely resold in the United States.
