**AGREEMENT  AND PLAN OF MERGER**

 

 

**THIS  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**   is made  and entered into as of
this the 23rd day of January, 2007, by and between  **COMMERCIAL

respectively, in and to every type of property (real, personal and mixed)
and  choses in action shall be transferred to and vested in the Resulting
Corporation  by virtue of the Merger without any deed or other transfer. The
Resulting  Corporation as of the Effective Time, and without any order or

all rights of property,  franchises and interests, including appointments,
designations and nominations  and all other rights and interests as trustee,
executor, administrator, transfer  agent and registrar of stocks and bonds,
guardian of estates, assignee, and  receiver and in every other fiduciary
capacity and in every agency, and  capacity, in the same manner and to the
same extent as such rights, franchises  and interests were held or enjoyed by
Acquired Corporation and BancGroup,  respectively, immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

 

 

 

**2.3 _Articles  of Incorporation and Bylaws_** **.**   At the Effective
Time, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the  Resulting
Corporation shall be the restated certificate of incorporation  and  bylaws

**2.4 _Resulting  Corporation\'s Officers and Board_** **.**   The board of
directors and the officers of the Resulting Corporation as of  the 
Effective Time shall consist of those persons serving in such capacities 
of  BancGroup as of the Effective Time. 

 


 

**2.5 _Shareholder  Approval_** **.**   This Agreement shall be submitted to
the shareholders of Acquired Corporation  at  the Shareholders' Meeting to
be held as promptly as practicable consistent with  the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in this Agreement. Upon approval  by  the requisite
vote of the shareholders of Acquired Corporation as required  by  applicable
Law, and the satisfaction of such other conditions as set forth  herein, the
Merger shall become effective as soon as practicable thereafter  in  the
manner provided in section 2.7. 

 


 

**2.6 _Further  Acts_** **.**   If, at any time after the Effective Time,
the Resulting Corporation shall  consider or be advised that any further
assignments or assurances in  law or any  other acts are necessary or
desirable (i) to vest, perfect, confirm or  record,  in the Resulting
Corporation, title to and possession of any property  or right  of Acquired
Corporation or BancGroup, acquired as a result of the Merger,  or  (ii)
otherwise to carry out the purposes of the Merger and this Agreement, 
BancGroup and its officers and directors shall execute and deliver all 
such  proper instruments, deeds, assignments and assurances in law and do
all  acts  necessary or proper to vest, perfect or confirm title to, and
possession  of,  such property or rights in the Resulting Corporation and
otherwise to  carry out  the purposes of this Agreement; and the proper
officers and directors  of the  Resulting Corporation are fully authorized

and all such action as may be  necessary  to effect the terms of this
Agreement and Plan of Merger.

for filing by the Secretary of State of the State  of Delaware  (such time
being herein called the "Effective Time"). Assuming all other  conditions
stated in this Agreement have been or will be satisfied or  waived as  of
the Closing, the Closing shall take place at the offices of Akerman 
Senterfitt and Eidson, P.A., One Southeast Third Avenue, Miami, Florida on a 
date specified by BancGroup and agreeable to Acquired Corporation that  shall
be  as soon as reasonably practicable after the later to occur of the

have not been finalized at this time, and BancGroup  in its  discretion will
determine if such Bank Merger shall proceed and will  finalize  such timing
and structure at a later date. Acquired Corporation will  reasonably 
cooperate with BancGroup in consummating the Bank Merger, including the 
calling  of any special meetings of the board of directors of the Bank and
the filing of  any regulatory applications, at BancGroup's sole cost and
expense.  

 

 

 

**ARTICLE  3**

 

 

 

 

**CONVERSION  OF ACQUIRED CORPORATION STOCK**

(a) (i)  At  the Effective Time, and subject to sections 3.1(a)(ii),
3.1(a)(iii), 3.1(a)(iv),  and 3.3, each share of common stock of Acquired
Corporation outstanding and  held  by Acquired Corporation's shareholders
("Acquired Corporation Stock"), shall be  converted into the right to receive
shares of BancGroup Common Stock and/or  cash  (the "Merger Consideration")
as specified below. Each outstanding share of  Acquired Corporation Stock at
the Effective Time shall be converted into the  right to receive either (A)
2.0214 shares (subject to section 3.3 hereof) of  BancGroup Common Stock or
(B) $49.00 in cash in accordance with sections  3.1(a)(ii), (iii) and (iv) of
this Agreement.

 



 

(ii)  A  holder of Acquired Corporation Stock may, prior to the Shareholders
Meeting,  file a written election form (an "Election Form") with the Acquired
Corporation  specifying whether such holder prefers to have the Merger
Consideration paid  to  such holder in shares of BancGroup Common Stock
only, cash only, or any  proportion of cash and whole shares of BancGroup
Common Stock that such holder  desires to receive, subject to the limitation
on cash and share consideration  in  sections 3.1(a)(iii) and (iv) of this
Agreement.

 



 

(iii)  Notwithstanding section 3.1(a)(ii) of this Agreement and
notwithstanding any  elections made pursuant to the Election Forms, the
aggregate amount of cash  to  be distributed in the Merger for Acquired
Corporation Stock shall be the amount  of 50% of the number of shares of
outstanding Acquired Corporation Stock at  the  time of the Closing times
$49.00 (the "Cash Consideration") (approximately  $148,480,658 assuming
6,060,435 shares of Acquired Corporation Stock are  outstanding at the time
of the Closing) even if the aggregate amount of cash  elected by stockholders
(the "Aggregate Cash Amount") is less than or exceeds  the Cash
Consideration. Notwithstanding section 3.1(a)(ii) of this Agreement  and 
notwithstanding any elections made pursuant to the Election Forms, the
aggregate  number of shares of BancGroup Common Stock to be distributed in
the Merger  shall  be 50% of the number of shares of the outstanding
Acquired Corporation Stock  at  the time of the Closing times 2.0214 (the
"Stock Consideration") (approximately  6,125,281 shares of BancGroup Common
Stock assuming 6,060,435 shares of Acquired  Corporation Stock are
outstanding at the time of the Closing), even if the  aggregate number of
shares of BancGroup Common Stock elected by stockholders  (the "Aggregate
Stock Amount") is less than or exceeds the Stock Consideration.  If  the 
aggregate of all Acquired Corporation shareholders' Cash Elections (or Stock 
Elections) exceeds the Cash Consideration (or the Stock Consideration), the 
Merger Consideration distributable to each holder of Acquired Corporation
Stock  shall be adjusted by taking the following steps: (1) determine the
amount by  which the Aggregate Cash Amount (or Aggregate Stock Amount)
exceeds the Cash  Consideration (or Stock Consideration); (2) reduce the
amount of cash (or  BancGroup Common Stock) that each such Shareholder who
elects, or is deemed  to  elect, cash (or BancGroup Common Stock) will
receive on a pro rata basis until  the Aggregate Cash Amount (or the
Aggregate Stock Amount) is equal to the Cash  Consideration (or the Stock
Consideration) (the aggregate amount of this  reduction shall be referred to
as the "Excess Election"); (3) determine the  number of shares of Acquired
Corporation Stock that each Acquired Corporation  Shareholder's pro rata
portion of the Excess Election represents (which will be  the pro rata
portion of the Excess Election divided by $49.00 in the case of  a  Cash
Excess Election (or the pro-rata portion of the Excess Election divided  by 
2.0214 in the case of a BancGroup Common Stock Excess Election)); (4)
increase  such Shareholder's stock (or cash) component of such Shareholder's
Merger  Consideration by 2.0214 shares of BancGroup Common Stock (or $49.00)
for each  share of Acquired Corporation Stock determined in step (3) above.

(iv)  Elections  made shall apply to all shares of record of Acquired
Corporation Stock held  immediately prior to the Effective Time by a record
holder making the election.  If an Acquired Corporation shareholder does not
submit an Election Form, then  such holder shall be deemed to have elected to
receive $24.50 in cash and 1.0107  shares of BancGroup Common Stock for each
share of Acquired Corporation  Stock **** as  his or  her portion of the
Merger Consideration. Interest will not be paid on any cash  to be paid as
part of the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(b) Promptly  after the execution of this Agreement, the Acquired Corporation
shall inform  all  holders of employee stock options to purchase Acquired
Corporation Stock  ("Employee Plan Options") (whether or not such options are
vested or  exercisable) of their ability to exercise their options within
(30) days of  such  notice, and after such thirty (30) day period, of their
ability to exercise  their Employee Plan Options for cash as described in
subparagraph (c) of this  Section 3.1; provided that the election or non-
election by the option holders  to  so exchange their Employee Plan options
for cash as described in this section  shall not be a condition to the
Closing.

 



 

(c) Each  holder of Employee Plan Options and each holder of Acquired
Corporation Options  granted under the outside director stock option plans of
Acquired Corporation  ("Outside Director Options"), in each case may, no
later than five days prior to  the Effective Date, may exercise his or her
Acquired Corporation Options (in  each case whether then or not vested or
exercisable) through a cashless exercise  with such exercised stock being
exchanged for cash payable on or within five  (5)  business days after the
Effective Time. As a result of this cashless exercise,  the amount of cash to
be received shall be determined by calculating the  difference between (i)
the number obtained by multiplying the number of shares  of Acquired
Corporation Stock issuable pursuant to his or her Acquired  Corporation
Options times $49.00 less (ii) the number obtained by multiplying  the number
of shares of Acquired Corporation Stock issuable pursuant to his  or  her
Acquired Corporation Options times the exercise price per share (as 
determined pursuant to the applicable stock option plan and stock option 
agreement of the Acquired Corporation). In the event that the exercise
prices  of  all Acquired Corporation Options are not the same, the above
calculation shall  be made for each series of options. The amount of cash
paid to option holders  shall not be considered as part of the Cash
Consideration.

 



 

**3.2** **_Fractional  Shares_**.  No  fractional shares of BancGroup
Common Stock shall be issued, and each holder  of  shares of Acquired
Corporation Stock having a fractional interest arising upon  the conversion
of such shares into shares of BancGroup Common Stock shall,  at  the time of
surrender of the certificates previously representing Acquired  Corporation
Stock, be paid by BancGroup an amount in cash equal to $49.00 per  share.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4  

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

**3.3** **_Adjustments_**.  In the  event that prior to the Effective Time
BancGroup Common Stock shall be changed  into a different number of shares or
a different class of shares by reason  of  any recapitalization or
reclassification, stock dividend, combination, stock  split, or reverse stock
split of the BancGroup Common Stock, an appropriate  and  proportionate
adjustment shall be made in the number of shares of BancGroup  Common Stock
into which the Acquired Corporation Stock shall be  converted.

 



 

**3.4** **_BancGroup  Stock_**.  The  shares of Common Stock of BancGroup
issued and outstanding immediately before  the Effective Time shall continue
to be issued and outstanding shares of the  Resulting Corporation.

 



 

**3.5** **[Reserved].**

 



 



 

**3.6** **_Election  and Exchange Procedures_** **.**   Each  holder of
record of shares of the Acquired Corporation Stock ("Holder") shall  have the
right, subject to the limitations set forth in this Article 3, to  submit an
election and exchange his or her Acquired Corporation stock  certificates
(the "Acquired Corporation Stock Certificates") in accordance with  the
following procedures:

 



 

(a) _The  Election_.  Each  Holder may specify in a request made in
accordance with the provisions of this  Section 3.6 (herein called an
"Election") (x) the number of shares of Acquired  Corporation Stock owned by
such Holder with respect to which such Holder desires  to receive a portion
of the Stock Consideration (a "Stock Election") and (y) the  number of shares
of Acquired Corporation Stock owned by such Holder with respect  to which
such Holder desires to receive a portion of the Cash Consideration  (a "Cash
Election").

 



 

(b) _Form  of Election_.  BancGroup shall prepare a form reasonably
acceptable to the Acquired Corporation  (the "Form of Election") which shall
be mailed to the Acquired Corporation's  stockholders entitled to vote at the
meeting of the stockholders of the Acquired  Corporation at which the
stockholders of the Acquired Corporation consider  and  vote on this
Agreement (the "Acquired Corporation Stockholders Meeting") so as  to permit
the Acquired Corporation's stockholders to exercise their right to  make an
Election prior to the Election Deadline (as defined in Section  3.6(d)).

 

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) _Distribution  of Forms of Election_.  BancGroup shall make the Form of
Election initially available at the time that  the Proxy Statement (as
defined herein) is made available to the stockholders  of  the Acquired
Corporation, to such stockholders, and shall use all reasonable  efforts to
make available as promptly as possible a Form of Election to any  stockholder
of the Acquired Corporation who requests such Form of Election  following the
initial mailing of the Forms of Election and prior to the Election  Deadline.
In no event shall the Form of Election be made available for the  first 
time less than twenty (20) calendar days prior to the Election  Deadline.

 



 

(d) _Proper  Election and Exchange Agent_.  Any  Election shall have been
made properly only if the Person authorized to receive  the Elections and to
act as Exchange Agent under this Agreement, which Person  shall be designated
by BancGroup and not reasonably objected to by the Acquired  Corporation (the
"Exchange Agent"), pursuant to an agreement entered into as  soon as
reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement and not 
reasonably objected to by the Acquired Corporation, shall have received, by 
5:00  p.m. local time in the city in which the principal office of such
Exchange  Agent  is located, on the date of the Election Deadline, a Form of
Election properly  completed and signed and accompanied by Acquired
Corporation Stock Certificates  to which such Form of Election relates or by
an appropriate customary guarantee  of delivery of such certificates, as set
forth in such Form of Election from  a  member of any registered national
securities exchange or a commercial bank  or  trust company in the United
States; provided, that such certificates are in  fact  delivered to the
Exchange Agent by the time required in such guarantee of  delivery. Failure
to deliver shares of Acquired Corporation Stock covered by  such a guarantee
of delivery within the time set forth on such guarantee shall  be deemed to
invalidate any otherwise properly made Election, unless otherwise  determined
by BancGroup, in its sole discretion. As used herein, "Election  Deadline"
means 5:00 p.m. on the date that is the day prior to the date of the 
Acquired Corporation Stockholder Meeting. The Acquired Corporation and
BancGroup  shall cooperate to issue a press release reasonably satisfactory
to each of  them  announcing the date of the Election Deadline not more than
thirty (30) business  days before and at least five (5) Business Days prior
to, the Election Deadline.  If BancGroup shall determine in its reasonable
discretion that any Election  is  not properly made with respect to any
shares of Acquired Corporation Stock,  such  Election shall be deemed to be
not in effect, and the shares of Acquired  Corporation Stock covered by such
Election shall, for purposes hereof, be  treated as if no Election had been
made, unless a proper Election is thereafter  timely made.

 



 

(e) _Modification  and Revocation of Form of Election_.  Any  Acquired
Corporation stockholder may, at any time prior to the Election  Deadline,
change or revoke his or her Election by written notice received by  the 
Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a properly 
completed and signed, revised Form of Election or by withdrawal prior to the 
Election Deadline of his or her Acquired Corporation Stock Certificate, or 
of  the guarantee of delivery of such certificates, previously deposited with
the  Exchange Agent. All Elections shall be revoked automatically if the
Exchange  Agent is notified in writing by BancGroup or the Acquired
Corporation that  this  Agreement has been terminated in accordance with
Article 13.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6  

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

(f) _Proper  Designation and Taxes_.  If any  portion of the Merger
Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the  Person in whose name
an Acquired Corporation Stock Certificate so surrendered  is  registered, it
shall be a condition to such payment that such Acquired  Corporation Stock
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in  proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay to  the  Exchange
Agent any transfer or other similar Taxes required as a result of  such 
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Acquired 
Corporation Stock Certificate, or establish to the reasonable satisfaction 
of  the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. The
Exchange  Agent (or, subsequent to the six month anniversary of the Effective
Time,  BancGroup) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger 
Consideration (including cash in lieu of fractional shares of BancGroup
Common  Stock) and from payments made to holders of Acquired Corporation
Employee Plan  Options and Outside Directors Plan Options ("Acquired
Corporation Options")  otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of Acquired  Corporation Stock or of Acquired Corporation Options such
amounts as the  Exchange Agent or BancGroup, as the case may be, is required
to deduct and  withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law,  with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent
the amounts are so  withheld by the Exchange Agent or BancGroup, as the case
may be, such withheld  amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been  paid  to the holder of shares of Acquired
Corporation Stock or of Acquired Corporation  Options in respect of whom such
deduction and withholding was made by the  Exchange Agent or BancGroup, as
the case may be.

 



 

(g) _Power  of Determination_.  BancGroup, in the exercise of its reasonable
discretion, shall have the right  to  make all determinations, not
inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement,  governing (A) the issuance
and delivery of BancGroup Stock Certificates into  which shares of Acquired
Corporation Stock are converted in the Merger and  (B)  the method of
payment for shares of Acquired Corporation Stock converted into  the right to
receive the Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional  shares of
BancGroup Common Stock where the holder of the applicable Acquired 
Corporation Stock Certificate has no right to receive whole shares of
BancGroup  Common Stock.

 



 

(h) _Exchange  Fund_.  BancGroup agrees to make available to the Exchange
Agent from time to time  as  needed, certificates representing the BancGroup
Common Stock, and agrees to  deliver in escrow to the Exchange Agent, at
least one (1) Business Day prior  to  the Closing, for the benefit of the
holders of the shares of Acquired  Corporation Stock and Acquired Corporation
Options, and cash sufficient to  pay  the cash component of the Merger
Consideration, the cash payable hereunder  to  the holders of Acquired
Corporation Options, cash in lieu of fractional shares  and any dividends and
other distributions. Any cash and certificates of  BancGroup Common Stock
deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter  be  referred to as the
"Exchange Fund." For six months following the Effective Time,  the Exchange
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(i) _Exchange  Procedures_.  Within  five (5) Business Days after the
Effective Time, the Resulting Corporation  shall  cause the Exchange Agent
to mail to each holder of an Acquired Corporation  Certificate: (i) a letter
of transmittal ("Letter of Transmittal") which shall  specify that delivery
shall be effected and risk of loss and title to the  Acquired Corporation
Certificates shall pass only upon delivery of the Acquired  Corporation
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and which Letter of Transmittal  shall be
in customary form and have such other provisions as BancGroup or the 
Resulting Corporation, as the case may be, may reasonably specify and (ii) 
instructions for effecting the surrender of such Acquired Corporation 
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of an 
Acquired Corporation Certificate to the Exchange Agent together with such
Letter  of Transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the
instructions  thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by the Exchange  Agent, the holder of such Acquired Corporation Certificate
shall be entitled  to  receive in exchange therefor, and Resulting
Corporation shall instruct Exchange  Agent to transmit as promptly as
commercially practicable, (i) one or more  shares of BancGroup Common Stock
(which may be in uncertificated book-entry  form  unless a physical
certificate is requested) representing, in the aggregate,  the  whole number
of shares that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to  this
Agreement and (ii) a check for any cash portion of the Merger Consideration 
and for the cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this 
Agreement, including cash in lieu of any fractional shares of BancGroup
Common  Stock and dividends and other distributions required or permitted by
this  Agreement. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable
for  the  cash portion of the Merger Consideration. In the event of a
transfer of  ownership of Acquired Corporation Stock which is not registered
in the transfer  records of Acquired Corporation, one or more shares of
BancGroup Common Stock  evidencing, in the aggregate, the proper number of
shares of BancGroup Common  Stock and a check for the cash portion of the
Merger Consideration, the cash  in  lieu of any fractional shares of
BancGroup Common Stock and any dividends or  other distributions to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement,  may be issued with
respect to such Acquired Corporation Stock to such a  transferee if the
Acquired Corporation Certificate representing such shares  of  Acquired
Corporation Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied  by  all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence 
that  any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.

 



 

(j) _No  Further Ownership Rights in Acquired Corporation Stock_.  All 
shares of BancGroup Common Stock issued and cash paid upon conversion of
shares  of Acquired Corporation Stock in accordance with the terms of this
Article  3  (including any cash paid pursuant to this Agreement) shall be
deemed to have  been issued or paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares  of Acquired Corporation Stock. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section  3.6, each Acquired Corporation Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after  the  Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the  Merger Consideration and any
dividends or distributions to which a holder of  Acquired Corporation Stock
on or prior to the Effective Time is entitled to  receive under this
Agreement.

 



 

(k) _Termination  of Exchange Fund_.  Any  portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of  the  Acquired Corporation
Certificate six months after the Effective Time shall  be  delivered to the
Resulting Corporation and any holders of the Acquired  Corporation
Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Section  3.6  shall
thereafter look only to the Resulting Corporation for the Merger 
Consideration with respect to the shares of Acquired Corporation Stock
formerly  represented thereby to which such holders are entitled pursuant to
this  Agreement, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of BancGroup Common
Stock  to  which such holders are entitled pursuant to this Agreement and
any dividends  or  distributions with respect to shares of BancGroup Common
Stock to which such  holders are entitled pursuant to this Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8  

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

(l) _No  Liability_.  None of  BancGroup, the Acquired Corporation, the
Resulting Corporation or the Exchange  Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any Merger Consideration  from  the Exchange Fund delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable  abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.

 



 

(m) _Lost  Certificates_.  If any  Acquired Corporation Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen, destroyed, upon  the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Acquired  Corporation Certificate to be
lost, stolen, or destroyed and, if required by  the  Resulting Corporation
that posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable  amount as the
Resulting Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim  that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange  Agent  will
deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Acquired Corporation 
Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the shares 
of  Acquired Corporation Stock formerly represented thereby, any cash in lieu
of  fractional shares of BancGroup Common Stock, and unpaid dividends and 
distributions on shares of BancGroup Common Stock deliverable in respect 
thereof, in each case, pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(n) _Stock  Transfer Books_.  The  stock transfer books of the Acquired
Corporation shall be closed immediately  at  the Effective Time and there
shall be no further registration of transfers  of  shares of Acquired
Corporation Stock thereafter on the records of Acquired  Corporation. On or
after the Effective Time, any Acquired Corporation  Certificates presented to
the Exchange Agent or the Resulting Corporation for  any reason shall be
converted into the Merger Consideration with respect to  the  shares of
Acquired Corporation Stock formerly represented thereby, any cash  in  lieu
of fractional shares of BancGroup Common Stock to which the holders thereof 
are entitled pursuant to this Agreement and any dividends or other
distributions  to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to this 
Agreement.

 



 

(o) _Investment  of Exchange Fund_.  The  Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed  by the Resulting
Corporation, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income  resulting from
such investments shall be paid to Resulting Corporation. To  the  extent
that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange  Fund
diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt 
payments of the Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, Resulting 
Corporation shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the Exchange
Fund  lost through investments or other events so as to ensure that the
Exchange  Fund  is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make
such  payments.

**ARTICLE  4**

 

**REPRESENTATIONS,  WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS OF BANCGROUP**

 



 

No  representation or warranty contained in this Article 4 shall be deemed
untrue  or  incorrect, and BancGroup shall not be deemed to have breached a
representation  or warranty as a consequence of the existence or absence of
any fact, event  or  circumstance, unless such fact, event or circumstance
is not set forth in  BancGroup's disclosure schedules to this Agreement and,
whether individually or  in the aggregate with all other facts, events or
circumstances that have not  been set forth in BancGroup disclosure schedules
to this Agreement, has had  or  is reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect. Except  as  disclosed in any BancGroup disclosure schedule
to this Agreement, BancGroup  represents, warrants and covenants to and with
Acquired Corporation as  follows:

 



 

**4.1** **_Organization_**.  BancGroup is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing  under the Laws of the State of
Delaware. BancGroup has the necessary corporate  powers to carry on its
business as presently conducted and is qualified to  do  business in every
jurisdiction in which the character and location of the Assets  owned by it
or the nature of the business transacted by it requires  qualification or in
which the failure to qualify could, individually or in  the  aggregate, have
a Material Adverse Effect. BancGroup is duly registered as  a  financial
holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as  amended.

 



 

**4.2** **_Capital  Stock_**.

 



 

(a) The  authorized capital stock of BancGroup consists of (i) 400,000,000
shares of  Common Stock, $2.50 par value per share, of which as of September
30, 2006,  156,196,005 shares were validly issued and 153,244,378 were
outstanding, fully  paid and nonassessable and are not subject to preemptive
rights (not counting  additional shares subject to issue pursuant to stock
option and other plans),  (ii) 50,000,000 shares of Preferred stock, $2.50
par value per share, none  of  which are issued and outstanding, and (iii)
1,000,000 shares of Preference  Stock, $2.50 par value per share, none of
which are issued and outstanding.  The  shares of BancGroup Common Stock to
be issued in the Merger are duly authorized  and, when so issued, will be
validly issued and outstanding, fully paid and  nonassessable, will have been
registered under the 1933 Act, and will have  been  registered or qualified
under the securities laws of all jurisdictions in which  such registration or
qualification is required, based upon information provided  by Acquired
Corporation.

 



 

(b) The  authorized capital stock of each Subsidiary of BancGroup is validly
issued  and  outstanding, fully paid and nonassessable, and each Significant
Subsidiary  (as  defined in Section 1-02 of Regulation S-X under the
Securities Act of 1933,  as  amended) is wholly owned, directly or
indirectly, by BancGroup.

 



 

**4.3** **_Financial  Statements; Taxes_**.  (a)  BancGroup has delivered
to Acquired Corporation copies of the following  financial statements of
BancGroup:

 



 

(i)  Consolidated statements of condition as of December 31, 2004, December
31,  2005,  and September 30, 2006;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10  

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

(ii)  Consolidated statements of income for each of the three years ended
December  31,  2005, and for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2006;

 



 

(iii)  Consolidated statements of cash flows for each of the three years
ended December  31, 2005, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2006;
and

 



 

(iv)  Consolidated statements of changes in shareholders\' equity for each of
the  three  years ended December 31, 2005, and for the nine months ended
September 30,  2006.

 



 

All  such  financial statements are in all material respects in accordance
with the books  and records of BancGroup and have been prepared in accordance
with GAAP applied  on a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated
unless otherwise stated,  all as more particularly set forth in the notes to
such statements. Each of  the  consolidated statements of condition presents
fairly as of its date the  consolidated financial condition of BancGroup and
its Subsidiaries. Except  as  and to the extent reflected or reserved
against in such balance sheets  (including the notes thereto), BancGroup and
its Subsidiaries did not have,  as  of the dates of such balance sheets, any
material Liabilities or obligations  (absolute or contingent) of a nature
customarily reflected in a balance sheet  or  the notes thereto. The
consolidated statements of income, cash flows and changes  in shareholders'
equity present fairly the results of operations and changes in  financial
position of BancGroup and its Subsidiaries for the periods indicated.  The
foregoing representations, insofar as they relate to the unaudited interim 
financial statements of BancGroup for the three and nine months ended
September  30, 2006, are subject in all cases to normal recurring year-end
adjustments  and  the omission of footnote disclosure.

 



 

(b) All  Tax  returns required to be filed by or on behalf of BancGroup and
its Subsidiaries  have been timely filed (or requests for extensions
therefore have been timely  filed and granted and have not expired), and all
returns filed are complete  and  accurate in all material respects. All
Taxes shown on these returns to be due  and all additional assessments
received have been paid. The amounts recorded  for  Taxes on the balance
sheets provided under section 4.3(a) are, to the Knowledge  of BancGroup,
sufficient in all material respects for the payment of all unpaid  federal,
state, county, local, foreign or other Taxes (including any interest  or 
penalties) of BancGroup and its Subsidiaries accrued for or applicable to
the  period ended on the dates thereof, and all years and periods prior
thereto  and  for which BancGroup and its Subsidiaries may at such dates
have been liable  in  its own right or as transferee of the Assets of, or as
successor to, any other  corporation or other party. No audit, examination or
investigation is presently  being conducted or, to the Knowledge of
BancGroup, threatened by any taxing  authority which is likely to result in a
material Tax Liability, no material  unpaid Tax deficiencies or additional
liabilities of any sort have been proposed  by any governmental
representative and no agreements for extension of time  for  the assessment
of any material amount of Tax have been entered into by or on  behalf of
BancGroup or any of its Subsidiaries. BancGroup and its Subsidiaries  have
withheld from its employees (and timely paid to the appropriate  governmental
entity) proper and accurate amounts for all periods in material  compliance
with all Tax withholding provisions of applicable federal, state,  foreign
and local Laws (including without limitation, income, social security  and
employment Tax withholding for all types of compensation).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11  

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

**4.4** **_No  Conflict with Other Instrument_**.  The  consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not result  in a breach of
or constitute a Default (without regard to the giving of notice  or the
passage of time) under any material Contract, indenture, mortgage, deed  of
trust or other material agreement or instrument to which BancGroup or any 
of  its Subsidiaries is a party or by which they or their Assets may be
bound;  will  not conflict with any provision of the restated certificate of
incorporation  or  bylaws of BancGroup or the articles of incorporation or
bylaws of any of its  Subsidiaries; and will not violate any provision of any
Law, regulation,  judgment or decree binding on them or any of their Assets.

 



 

**4.5** **_Absence  of Material Adverse Change_**.  Since  the date of the
most recent statement of condition provided under section  4.3(a)(i) above,
there have been no events, changes or occurrences which have  had or are
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a  Material
Adverse Effect on BancGroup.

 



 

**4.6** **_Approval  of Agreement_**.  The  board of directors of
BancGroup, or its Executive Committee, has approved this  Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by it and has authorized the  execution and
delivery by BancGroup of this Agreement. This Agreement  constitutes the
legal, valid and binding obligation of BancGroup, enforceable  against it in
accordance with its terms. Approval of this Agreement by the  stockholders of
BancGroup is not required by applicable Law. Subject to the  matters referred
to in section 8.2, BancGroup has full power, authority and  legal right to
enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions  contemplated by
this Agreement. BancGroup has no Knowledge of any fact or  circumstance under
which the appropriate regulatory approvals required by  section 8.2 will not
be granted without the imposition of material conditions  or  material
delays on BancGroup or Colonial Bank, N.A.

 



 

**4.7** **_Tax  Treatment_**.  BancGroup has no present plan to sell or
otherwise dispose of any of the Assets  of Acquired Corporation, subsequent
to the Merger, and BancGroup intends to  continue the historic business of
Acquired Corporation.

 



 

**4.8** **_Title  and Related Matters_**.  BancGroup or its Subsidiaries
have good and marketable title to all the  properties, interests in
properties and Assets, real and personal, that are  material to the business
of BancGroup, reflected in the most recent statement  of  condition referred
to in section 4.3(a), or acquired after the date of such  balance sheet
(except properties, interests and Assets sold or otherwise  disposed of since
such date, in the ordinary course of business), free and  clear  of all
mortgages, Liens, pledges, charges or encumbrances except (i) mortgages  and
other encumbrances referred to in the notes of such balance sheet, (ii) 
liens for current Taxes not yet due and payable and (iii) such imperfections 
of  title and easements as do not materially detract from or interfere with
the  present use of the properties subject thereto or affected thereby, or
otherwise  materially impair present business operations at such properties.
To the  Knowledge of BancGroup, the material structures and equipment of
BancGroup  and  its Subsidiaries comply in all material respects with the
requirements of all  applicable Laws.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12  

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

**4.9** **_Subsidiaries_**.  Each  Subsidiary of BancGroup has been duly
incorporated and is validly existing  as a  corporation in good standing
under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its  incorporation and each Subsidiary
has been duly qualified as a foreign  corporation to transact business and is
in good standing under the Laws of  each  other jurisdiction in which it
owns or leases properties, or conducts any  business so as to require such
qualification and in which the failure to be  duly  qualified could have a
Material Adverse Effect upon BancGroup and its  Subsidiaries considered as
one enterprise; BancGroup's banking subsidiary has  its deposits fully
insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to  the  extent
permitted by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act; and the businesses of  the 
non-bank Subsidiaries of BancGroup are permitted businesses of registered
bank  holding companies that are financial holding companies.

Default in the performance or  observance of any material obligation,
agreement, covenant or condition  contained in any Contract, indenture,

Subsidiaries (nor is BancGroup aware of any facts which could give  rise to
any such Litigation) which is required to be disclosed in the  Registration
Statement (other than as disclosed therein), or which is likely  to  have
any Material Adverse Effect or prospective Material Adverse Effect, or  which
is likely to materially and adversely affect the properties or Assets 
thereof or which is likely to materially affect or delay the consummation of 
the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement; all pending legal or
governmental  proceedings to which BancGroup or any Subsidiary is a party or
of which any  of  their properties is the subject which are not described in
the Registration  Statement, including ordinary routine litigation incidental
to the business,  are, considered in the aggregate, not material; and neither
BancGroup nor any  of  its Subsidiaries have any contingent obligations
which could be considered  material to BancGroup and its Subsidiaries
considered as one enterprise which  are not disclosed in the Registration
Statement as it may be amended or  supplemented.

 



 

**4.12** **_Compliance_**.  BancGroup and its Subsidiaries, in the conduct of
their businesses, are to  the  Knowledge of BancGroup, in compliance with

Statement becomes effective and at the time of the  Shareholders' Meeting,
the Registration Statement, including the Proxy Statement  which shall
constitute a part thereof, will comply in all material respects  with  the
requirements of the 1933 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder,

furnished in writing to BancGroup by Acquired  Corporation or any of its
representatives expressly for use in the Proxy  Statement or information
included in the Proxy Statement regarding the business  of Acquired
Corporation, its operations, Assets and capital.

**ARTICLE  5**

 

**REPRESENTATIONS,  WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS OF ACQUIRED CORPORATION**

 



 

Except  as  set forth in a disclosure schedule delivered by the Acquired
Corporation to  BancGroup (the "Acquired Corporation Disclosure Schedule")
prior to the date  hereof (which sets forth, among other things, items the
disclosure of which  is  necessary or appropriate either in response to an
express provision of this  Agreement or as an exception to one or more of its
representations and  warranties set forth below or its covenants in Articles
6 and 7, provided,  that  (i) no such item is required to be set forth in
the Acquired Corporation  Disclosure Schedule as an exception to any
representation or warranty of the  Acquired Corporation if its absence (in
combination with any other undisclosed  information) would not be reasonably
likely to result in the related  representation or warranty being deemed
untrue or incorrect under the standard  set forth in Section 9.1 and (ii) the
mere inclusion of an item in the Acquired  Corporation Disclosure Schedule as
an exception to a representation or warranty  shall not be deemed an
admission by the Acquired Corporation that such item  represents a material
exception or fact, event or circumstance or that such  item  is or would be
reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect with  respect to the
Acquired Corporation.

 



 

Acquired  Corporation represents, warrants and covenants to and with
BancGroup, as  follows:

 



 

**5.1** **_Organization_**.  Acquired Corporation is a Florida corporation,
and Bank is a state chartered  bank. Each Acquired Corporation Company is
duly organized, validly existing  and  in active status under the respective
Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation  or association and has all
requisite power and authority to carry on its  business as it is now being
conducted and is qualified to do business in every  jurisdiction in which the
character and location of the Assets owned by it  or  the nature of the
business transacted by it requires qualification and in which  the failure to
qualify could, individually, or in the aggregate, have a Material  Adverse
Effect.

 

 

**5.2** **_Capital  Stock_**.  As of  the date of this Agreement, the
authorized capital stock of Acquired Corporation  consisted of 15,000,000
shares of common stock, $0.08 par value per share,  6,615,210 shares of which
are issued, and 6,060,435 were outstanding, and  5,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, par value $3.75 per share, none of which  are outstanding.
All of such shares which are outstanding are validly issued,  fully paid and
nonassessable and not subject to preemptive rights. Acquired  Corporation has
587,106 shares of its common stock subject to issuance pursuant  to the
exercise of stock options under its stock option plans of which 587,106  are
exercisable (or which shall become exercisable prior to the Effective Time). 
Except for the foregoing, Acquired Corporation does not have any other 
arrangements or commitments obligating it to issue shares of its capital
stock  or any securities convertible into or having the right to purchase
shares of  its  capital stock, including the grant, issuance or vesting of
additional Acquired  Corporation Options.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15  

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

**5.3** **_Subsidiaries_**.  Acquired Corporation does not have any
Subsidiaries other than the Bank. 

 



 

Acquired  Corporation owns all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of
the Bank  free and clear of any liens, claims or encumbrances of any kind.
All of the  issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of each Acquired
Corporation  Company have been validly issued and are fully paid and non-
assessable. As  of  the date of this Agreement, there were (i) with respect
to the Bank, 2,000,000  shares of common stock, par value $5.00 per share,
authorized and 1,164,712  shares outstanding and no shares of preferred
stock. Other than as listed above,  no Acquired Corporation Company has any
other form of stock authorized or  outstanding. The Bank has no arrangements
or commitments obligating it to issue  shares of any of its capital stock or
any securities convertible into or having  the right to purchase shares of
any of its capital stock.

 



 

**5.4** **_Financial  Statements; Taxes._**   (a)  Acquired Corporation has
delivered to BancGroup copies of the following  financial statements of
Acquired Corporation:

 



 

(i)  Consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2004, December 31, 2005,
and  September 30, 2006;

 



 

(ii)  Consolidated statements of income for each of the three years ended
December  31,  2005, and for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2006;

 



 

(iii)  Consolidated statements of cash flows for each of the three years
ended December  31, 2005, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2006;
and

 



 

(iv)  Consolidated statements of changes in shareholders' equity for the
three years  ended December 31, 2005, and for the nine months ended September
30,  2006.

 



 

All  of  the foregoing financial statements are in all material respects in
accordance  with the books and records of Acquired Corporation and have been
prepared in  accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout
the periods  indicated, except for changes required by GAAP, all as more
particularly set  forth in the notes to such statements. Each of such balance
sheets presents  fairly as of its date the financial condition of Acquired
Corporation. Except  as  and to the extent reflected or reserved against in
such balance sheets  (including the notes thereto), Acquired Corporation did
not have, as of the  date  of such balance sheets, any material Liabilities
or obligations (absolute or  contingent) of a nature customarily reflected in
a balance sheet or the notes  thereto. The statements of income,
shareholders' equity and cash flows present  fairly the results of operation,
changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows  of Acquired Corporation for
the periods indicated. The foregoing  representations, insofar as they relate
to the unaudited interim financial  statements of Acquired Corporation for
the three and nine months ended September  30, 2006, are subject in all cases
to normal recurring year-end adjustments  and  the omission of footnote
disclosure.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16  

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

(b) All  Tax  returns required to be filed by or on behalf of Acquired
Corporation have been  timely filed (or requests for extensions therefore
have been timely filed and  granted and have not expired), and all returns
filed are complete and accurate  in all material respects. All Taxes shown on
these returns to be due and all  additional assessments received have been
paid. The amounts recorded for Taxes  on the balance sheets provided under
section 5.4(a) are, to the Knowledge of  Acquired Corporation, sufficient in
all material respects for the payment of  all  unpaid federal, state,
county, local, foreign and other Taxes (including any  interest or penalties)
of Acquired Corporation accrued for or applicable to  the  period ended on
the dates thereof, and all years and periods prior thereto  and  for which
Acquired Corporation may at such dates have been liable in its own  right or
as a transferee of the Assets of, or as successor to, any other  corporation
or other party. No audit, examination or investigation is presently  being
conducted or, to the Knowledge of Acquired Corporation, threatened by  any 
taxing authority which is likely to result in a material Tax Liability, no 
material unpaid Tax deficiencies or additional liability of any sort has
been  proposed by any governmental representative and no agreements for
extension  of  time for the assessment of any material amount of Tax have
been entered into  by  or on behalf of Acquired Corporation. Acquired
Corporation has not executed  an  extension or waiver of any statute of
limitations on the assessment or  collection of any Tax due that is currently
in effect.

 



 

(c) Each  Acquired Corporation Company has withheld from its employees (and
timely paid  to  the appropriate governmental entity) proper and accurate
amounts for all periods  in material compliance with all Tax withholding
provisions of applicable  federal, state, foreign and local Laws (including
without limitation, income,  social security and employment Tax withholding
for all types of compensation).  Each Acquired Corporation Company is in
compliance with, and its records contain  all information and documents
(including properly completed IRS Forms W-9)  necessary to comply with, all
applicable information reporting and Tax  withholding requirements under
federal, state and local Tax Laws, and such  records identify with
specificity all accounts subject to backup withholding  under section 3406 of
the Code.

 



 

**5.5** **_Absence  of Certain Changes or Events_**.  Except  as set forth
on Schedule 5.5, since the date of the most recent balance sheet  provided
under section 5.4(a)(i) above, no Acquired Corporation Company  has

 



 

(a) issued,  delivered or agreed to issue or deliver any stock, bonds or

treasury) except  shares of common stock issued upon the exercise of existing
Acquired Corporation  Options and shares issued as director\'s qualifying

with past practice;

_provided_ ,  however, that Acquired Corporation may (i) continue to make
quarterly cash  dividends of no more than $0.2100 per share and at times
consistent with past  practices and as set forth on Schedule 5.5(d) to this
Agreement and (ii)  accelerate the vesting of any existing options to

(f) except  in  the ordinary course of business, entered or agreed to enter
into any agreement  or arrangement granting any preferential rights to
purchase any of its Assets,  or requiring the consent of any party to the
transfer and assignment of any  of  its Assets;

 



 

(g) waived  any rights of value which in either event in the aggregate are
material  considering its business as a whole;

18  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(m) agreed  in  writing, or otherwise, to take any action described in
clauses (a) through  (l)  above.

Company, without  the express written approval of BancGroup, will do any of
the things listed  in  clauses (a) through (m) of this section 5.5 except as
permitted therein or  as  contemplated in this Agreement, and no Acquired
Corporation Company will enter  into or amend any material Contract, other

business, without the express written  consent of BancGroup.

equipment of each Acquired Corporation Company comply in all material 
respects with the requirements of all applicable Laws.

 



 

(b) _Leases_.  Schedule 5.6(b) sets forth a list and description of all real
property owned  or  leased by any Acquired Corporation Company, either as
lessor or lessee. Complete  and accurate copies of all such leases have been

and hardware now being used in the business  operations of any Acquired
Corporation Company and providing for annual payments  in excess of $50,000

Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19

been  attached to a Schedule to this Agreement.

 



 

**5.8** **_Charter  and Bylaws_**.  Schedule 5.8 contains true and correct
copies of the articles of incorporation  and bylaws of each Acquired
Corporation Company, including all amendments  thereto, as currently in
effect. Except as may be required by any regulatory  agency (and Acquired
Corporation has no Knowledge of any regulatory action  that  might require
such a change), there will be no changes in such articles of  incorporation
or bylaws prior to the Effective Time, without the prior written  consent of
BancGroup.

 



 

**5.9** **_Litigation_**.  Except  as set forth in the Acquired
Corporation's SEC filings made prior to the date of  this Agreement or except
as set forth on Schedule 5.9, there is no Litigation  (whether or not
purportedly on behalf of Acquired Corporation) pending or,  to  the
Knowledge of Acquired Corporation, threatened against or to which any 
Acquired Corporation Company is a party (nor does Acquired Corporation have 
Knowledge of any facts which are likely to give rise to any such Litigation) 
at  law or in equity, or before or by any governmental department,
commission,  board, bureau, agency or instrumentality, domestic or foreign,
or before any  arbitrator of any kind, which involves the possibility of any
judgment or  Liability not fully covered by insurance in excess of a
reasonable deductible  amount or which is reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on  Acquired Corporation, and no Acquired Corporation
Company is in Default with  respect to any judgment, order, writ, injunction,
decree, award, rule or  regulation of any court, arbitrator or governmental
department, commission,  board, bureau, agency or instrumentality, which
Default would be reasonably  likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Acquired Corporation. To the  Knowledge of Acquired Corporation, each
Acquired Corporation Company has  complied in all material respects with all
material applicable Laws and  Regulations including those imposing Taxes, of
any applicable jurisdiction  and  of all states, municipalities, other
political subdivisions and Agencies, in  respect of the ownership of its
properties and the conduct of its business,  which, if not complied with,
would be reasonably likely to have a Material  Adverse Effect on Acquired
Corporation.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20  

 

 

 

**5.10** **_Material  Contract Defaults_**.  No  Acquired Corporation
Company is in Default in any material respect under the  terms of any
material Contract and, to the Knowledge of Acquired Corporation,  there is no
event which, with notice or lapse of time, or both, may be or become  an
event of Default on the part of an Acquired Corporation Company under any 
such material Contract in respect of which adequate steps have not been
taken  to  prevent such a Default from occurring, which in each case or in
the aggregate,  could be reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse
Effect on the  Acquired Corporation. Acquired Corporation will use
commercially reasonable  efforts to obtain consents to the Merger under any
the agreements listed on  Schedule 5.11 hereto, provided that Acquired
Corporation's failure to obtain  such consents as of the closing shall not be
deemed a breach of this Section  5.10.

 



 

**5.11** **_No  Conflict with Other Instrument_**.  The  consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not result  in the
breach of any term or provision of or constitute a Default under any 
material Contract which Default could be reasonably likely to result in a 
Material Adverse Effect on the Acquired Corporation, to which any Acquired 
Corporation Company is a party and will not conflict with any provision of 
the  charter or bylaws of any Acquired Corporation Company. Acquired
Corporation  will  use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain consents to
the Merger under  the  agreements listed on Schedule 5.11 hereto, provided
that Acquired Corporation's  failure to obtain such consents as of the
Closing shall not be deemed a breach  of this Section 5.11 representation.

 



 

**5.12** **_Governmental  Authorization_**.  Each  Acquired Corporation
Company has all Permits that, to the Knowledge of Acquired  Corporation, are
or will be legally required to enable any Acquired Corporation  Company to
conduct its business in all material respects as now conducted by  each
Acquired Corporation Company.

 



 

**5.13** **_Absence  of Regulatory Communications_**.  No  Acquired
Corporation Company is subject to, nor has any Acquired Corporation  Company
received during the past three years, any written communication directed 
specifically to it from any Agency to which it is subject or pursuant to
which  such Agency has imposed or has indicated it may impose any material
restrictions  on the operations of it or the business conducted by it or in
which such Agency  has raised any material question concerning the condition,
financial or  otherwise, of such company. The Acquired Corporation represents
that it is  not  the subject of any regulatory investigation or the subject
of any regulatory  sanction as of the date of this Agreement.

 



 

**5.14** **_Absence  of Material Adverse Change_**.  To the  Knowledge of
Acquired Corporation, since the date of the most recent balance  sheet
provided under section 5.4(a)(i), there have been no adverse events,  changes
or occurrences which have had, or are reasonably likely to have, 
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Acquired 
Corporation.

 



 

**5.15** **_Insurance_**.  Each  Acquired Corporation Company has in effect
insurance coverage and bonds with  reputable insurers which, in respect to
amounts, types and risks insured,  management of Acquired Corporation
reasonably believes to be adequate for the  type of business conducted by
such company. No Acquired Corporation Company  is  liable for any material
retroactive premium adjustment. To the Knowledge of  Acquired Corporation,
all insurance policies and bonds are valid, enforceable  and in full force
and effect, and no Acquired Corporation Company has received  any notice of
any material premium increase or cancellation with respect to  any  of its
insurance policies or bonds. Within the last three years, no Acquired 
Corporation Company has been refused any insurance coverage which it has
sought  or applied for, and nothing has come to its attention which would
lead it to  believe that existing insurance coverage cannot be renewed as and
when the  same  shall expire, upon terms and conditions as favorable as
those presently in  effect, other than possible increases in premiums that do
not result from any  extraordinary loss experience. To the Knowledge of
Acquired Corporation, all  policies of insurance presently held or policies
containing substantially  equivalent coverage will be outstanding and in full
force with respect to each  Acquired Corporation Company at all times from

**5.16** **_Pension  and Employee Benefit Plans_**. 

 



 

(a) To  the  Knowledge of Acquired Corporation, all employee benefit plans
of each Acquired  Corporation Company have been established in compliance
with, and such plans  have been operated in material compliance with, all
applicable Laws, except  in  each case or in the aggregate, to the extent
the same could not reasonably  be  expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Acquired Corporation. No Acquired  Corporation Company sponsors or
otherwise maintains a "pension plan" within the  meaning of section 3(2) of
ERISA or any other retirement plan other than the  Section 401K plan of
Acquired Corporation that is intended to qualify under  section 401 of the
Code, nor do any unfunded (or improperly accrued for)  Liabilities exist with
respect to any employee benefit plan, past or present.  To  the Knowledge of
Acquired Corporation, no employee benefit plan, any trust  created thereunder
or any trustee or administrator thereof has engaged in a  "prohibited
transaction," as defined in section 4975 of the Code, which may have  a
Material Adverse Effect on the condition, financial or otherwise, of any 
Acquired Corporation Company. Any pension plan reflected on Schedule 5.16
will  be fully funded (or properly accrued for) by Acquired Corporation prior
to  the  Effective Time.

 



 

(b) To  the  Knowledge of Acquired Corporation, no amounts payable to any
employee of any  Acquired Corporation Company as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby  will fail to be deductible for federal income tax
purposes by virtue of Section  280G of the Code and regulations thereunder;
provided however, no representation  is made under this Section 5.16(b) with
respect to payments made under the  Contracts otherwise disclosed in any
Schedule hereto. Notwithstanding the  introductory language to this Article
5, the representation contained in Section  5.16(b) shall not be deemed to be
true even if such amounts payable would not  be  reasonably likely to cause
a Material Adverse Effect to Acquired  Corporation.

 



 

**5.17** **_Buy-Sell  Agreements_**.  To the  Knowledge of Acquired
Corporation, there are no agreements among any of its  shareholders granting
to any person or persons a right of first refusal in  respect of the sale,
transfer, or other disposition of any shares of outstanding  securities by
any shareholder of Acquired Corporation, any similar agreement  or  any
voting agreement or voting trust in respect of any such shares.

 



 

**5.18** **_Brokers_**.  Except  for services provided to Acquired
Corporation by Hovde, negotiations relative  to  this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been  carried on by Acquired
Corporation directly with BancGroup, or its advisors,  and  without the
intervention of any other person, either as a result of any act  of 
Acquired Corporation, or otherwise, in such manner as to give rise to any
valid  claim against Acquired Corporation for a finder\'s fee, brokerage
commission  or  other like payment. The general terms and the exact fee
which will be paid  to  Hovde by Acquired Corporation at or prior to the
Effective Time is described  in  Schedule 5.18.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22  

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

**5.19** **_Approval  of Agreements_**.  The  board of directors of
Acquired Corporation has approved this Agreement and  the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and has authorized the execution  and 
delivery by Acquired Corporation of this Agreement. Subject to the matters 
referred to in Section 8.2(a), Acquired Corporation has full power,
authority  and legal right to enter into this Agreement, and, upon
appropriate vote of  the  shareholders of Acquired Corporation in accordance
with this Agreement, Acquired  Corporation shall have full power, authority
and legal right to consummate  the  transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

**5.20** **_Disclosure_**.  No  representation or warranty, nor any
statement or certificate furnished or to  be  furnished to BancGroup by
Acquired Corporation, contains or will contain any  untrue statement of a
material fact, or omits or will omit to state a material  fact necessary to
make the statements contained in this Agreement or in any  such  statement
or certificate not misleading. Except for the representations and  warranties
made by the Acquired Corporation in this Agreement, its Schedules  and  its
public filings with the SEC, the Acquired Corporation makes no 
representations or warranties, and the Acquired Corporation hereby disclaims 
any  other representations or warranties, with respect to the Acquired
Corporation  Companies, or its or their businesses, operations, assets,
liabilities,  condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects or the
negotiation, execution,  delivery or performance of this Agreement by the
Acquired  Corporation.

 



 

**5.21** **_Registration  Statement_**.  At the  time the Registration
Statement becomes effective and at the time of the  Shareholders Meeting, the
Registration Statement, including the proxy statement  which shall constitute
part thereof (the "Proxy Statement"), will not contain an  untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary  in order to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances  under  which
they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that the  representations
and warranties in this section shall only apply to statements  in  or
omissions from the Proxy Statement relating to descriptions of the business 
of Acquired Corporation, its Assets, properties, operations, and capital
stock  or to information furnished in writing by Acquired Corporation or
its  representatives expressly for inclusion in the Proxy Statement.

 



 

**5.22** **_Loans;  Adequacy of Allowance for Loan Losses_**.  All 
reserves for loan losses shown on the most recent financial statements
furnished  by Acquired Corporation have been calculated in accordance with
prudent and  customary banking practices and are reasonably adequate in all
material respects  to reflect the inherent and actual risks in the loans of
the Acquired  Corporation. Acquired Corporation has no Knowledge of any fact
which is likely  to require a future material increase in the provision for
loan losses or a  material decrease in the loan loss reserve reflected in
such financial  statements, to the extent such increase or decrease would be
reasonably likely  to have a Material Adverse Effect on Acquired Corporation.
To the Knowledge  of  Acquired Corporation, each loan reflected as an Asset
on the financial  statements of Acquired Corporation is the legal, valid and
binding obligation  of  the obligor of each loan, enforceable in accordance
with its terms subject  to  the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, or other  similar laws relating to creditors\'
rights generally and to general equitable  principles and complies in all
material respects with all Laws to which it  is  subject, except to the
extent such unenforceability could not be reasonably  likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Acquired Corporation. Acquired  Corporation does
not have in its portfolio any loan exceeding its legal lending  limit. Except
as disclosed on Schedule 5.22, as of the date of this Agreement  (and to be
updated at the Closing) Acquired Corporation, has no known  significant
delinquent, substandard, doubtful, loss, nonperforming or problem  loans.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23  

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

**5.23** **_Environmental  Matters_**.  Except  for such matters that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a  Material Adverse Effect
on the Acquired Corporation, to the Knowledge of  Acquired Corporation, each
Acquired Corporation Company is in material  compliance with all Laws and
other governmental requirements relating to the  generation, management,
handling, transportation, treatment, disposal, storage,  delivery, discharge,
release or emission of any waste, pollution, or toxic,  hazardous or other
substance (the "Environmental Laws"), and Acquired  Corporation has no
Knowledge that any Acquired Corporation Company has not  complied with all
regulations and requirements promulgated by the Occupational  Safety and
Health Administration that are applicable to any Acquired Corporation 
Company. To the Knowledge of Acquired Corporation, there is no Litigation 
pending or threatened with respect to any violation or alleged violation by 
any  Acquired Corporation Company of the Environmental Laws, except to the
extent  such litigation is not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect  on  any Acquired Corporation Company. Except as disclosed on
Schedule 5.23 (and  such  schedule to be updated at the Closing), to the
Knowledge of Acquired Corporation  (a) there has been no spillage, leakage,
contamination or release of any  hazardous substances or waste on any owned
or leased property of any Acquired  Corporation Company for which the
appropriate remedial action has not been  completed; (b) there are no
underground storage tanks on any premises owned  or  leased by any Acquired
Corporation Company; and (c) the Bank's loan committee  has not identified
any currently outstanding loan or extension of credit on  an "policy
exception" or "watch" basis as a result of any violation of, or required 
remediation under, any Environmental Laws.

 



 

**5.24** **_Collective  Bargaining_**.  There  are no labor contracts,
collective bargaining agreements, letters of  undertakings or other
arrangements, formal or informal, between any Acquired  Corporation Company
and any union or labor organization covering any Acquired  Corporation
Company\'s employees and none of said employees are represented  by  any
union or labor organization.

 



 

**5.25** **_Labor  Disputes_**.  To the  Knowledge of Acquired Corporation,
each Acquired Corporation Company is in  material compliance with all federal
and state laws respecting employment and  employment practices, terms and
conditions of employment, wages and hours.  No  Acquired Corporation Company
is or has been engaged in any unfair labor  practice, and, to the Knowledge
of Acquired Corporation, no unfair labor  practice complaint against any
Acquired Corporation Company is pending before  the National Labor Relations
Board. There have not been, nor to the Knowledge  of  Acquired Corporation,
are there presently, any attempts to organize employees,  nor to the
Knowledge of Acquired Corporation, are there plans for any such  attempts.

 



 

**5.26** **_Derivative  Contracts_**.  No  Acquired Corporation Company is
a party to or has agreed to enter into a swap,  forward, future, option, cap,
floor or collar financial contract, or any other  interest rate or foreign
currency protection contract or derivative security  not  included in
Acquired Corporation\'s financial statements delivered under Section  5.4
hereof which is a financial derivative contract (including various 
combinations thereof).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24  

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

**5.27** **_SEC  Filings_**.  (a)  Acquired Corporation has heretofore
delivered to BancGroup copies of Acquired  Corporation\'s: (i) Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December  31, 2005; (ii) 2005 Annual
Report to Shareholders; (iii) Quarterly Reports  on  Form 10-Q for the
quarters ended March 31, 2006, June 30, 2006, and September  30, 2006; and
(iv) any reports on Form 8-K, filed by Acquired Corporation with  the SEC
since December 31, 2005. Since December 31, 2003, Acquired Corporation  has
timely filed all reports and registration statements and the documents 
required to be filed with the SEC under the rules and regulations of the SEC 
and  all such reports and registration statements or other documents have
complied  in  all material respects, as of their respective filing dates and
effective dates,  as the case may be, with all the applicable requirements of
the 1933 Act, the  1934 Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. As of the
respective filing and  effective dates, none of such reports or registration
statements or other  documents contained any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state  a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make  the  statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made,  not misleading.

 



 

(b)  The  documents to be incorporated by reference into the Registration
Statement,  at  the time they were filed with the SEC, complied in all
material respects with  the requirements of the 1934 Act and Regulations
thereunder and when read  together and with the other information in the
Registration Statement will  not  contain an untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material  fact  required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not  misleading at the time the
Registration Statement becomes effective or at the  time of the Shareholders'
Meeting.

**6.1** **_Additional  Covenants of BancGroup_**.  BancGroup covenants to
and with Acquired Corporation as follows:

 



 

(a) _Registration  Statement and Other Filings_.  As soon  as reasonably
practicable after the execution of this Agreement, BancGroup  shall  prepare
and file with the SEC the Registration Statement on Form S-4 (or such  other
form as may be appropriate) and all amendments and supplements thereto,  in 
form reasonably satisfactory to Acquired Corporation and its counsel, with 
respect to the Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this Agreement.
BancGroup  shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prepare all necessary
filings  with  any Agencies which may be necessary for approval to
consummate the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement and shall use its
reasonable efforts to cause  the  Registration Statement to become effective
under the 1933 Act as soon as  reasonably practicable after the filing
thereof and take any action required  to  be taken under other applicable
securities Laws in connection with the issuance  of the shares of BancGroup
Common Stock upon consummation of the Merger. Copies  of all such filings
shall be furnished to Acquired Corporation and its counsel,  sufficiently in
advance to permit Acquired Corporation and its counsel to  provide
substantive review and comment. BancGroup will advise Acquired  Corporation
and its counsel promptly after it receives notice and/or knowledge  thereof,
of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or  any 
supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the 
suspension of the qualification of the BancGroup Common Stock issuable in 
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any 
request by the SEC for amendment of the Registration Statement (or Proxy 
Statement) and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional 
information.

 

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) _Blue  Sky Permits_.  BancGroup shall use its best efforts to obtain,

directors.

 



 

(d) _Listing_.  Prior  to the Effective Time, BancGroup shall use
commercially reasonable efforts  to  cause the shares of BancGroup Common
Stock to be issued in the Merger to be  listed on the NYSE or other
quotations system on which such shares are primarily  traded.

 



 

(e) _Employee  Benefit Matters_.  (i) At  the Effective Time, all employees
of any Acquired Corporation Company shall,  at  BancGroup\'s option, either
become employees of the Resulting Corporation or  its  Subsidiaries or be
entitled to severance benefits in accordance with Colonial  Bank, N.A.\'s
severance policy as of the date of this Agreement, which is  attached hereto
as Schedule 6.1(e). All employees of any Acquired Corporation  Company who
become employees of the Resulting Corporation or its Subsidiaries  at  the
Effective Time shall be entitled, to the extent permitted by applicable 
Law,  to participate in all benefit plans of Colonial Bank, N.A., including
retirement  plans, to the same extent as Colonial Bank, N.A. employees,
except as stated  otherwise in this section. Employees of any Acquired
Corporation Company who  become employees of the Resulting Corporation or its
Subsidiaries at the  Effective Time shall be allowed to participate as of the
Effective Time in  the  medical and dental benefits plan of Colonial Bank,
N.A. as new employees of  Colonial Bank, N.A., and the time of employment of
such employees who are  employed at least 30 hours per week with any Acquired
Corporation Company as  of  the Effective Time shall be counted as
employment under such dental and medical  plans of Colonial Bank, N.A. for
purposes of calculating any 30 day waiting  period and pre-existing condition
limitations. To the extent permitted by  applicable Law and for all active
plans and benefits, the period of service  with  the appropriate Acquired
Corporation Company of all employees who become  employees of the Resulting
Corporation or its Subsidiaries at the Effective  Time  shall be recognized
for vesting, eligibility and period of service requirements.  In addition, if
the Effective Time falls within an annual period of coverage  under the
medical plan of the Resulting Corporation and its Subsidiaries, each  such
Acquired Corporation Company employee shall be given credit for covered 
expenses paid by that employee under comparable employee benefit plans of
the  Acquired Corporation Company during the applicable coverage period
through  the  Effective Time towards satisfaction of any annual deductible
limitation and  out-of-pocket maximum that may apply under that group health
plan of the  Resulting Corporation and its Subsidiaries; (ii) for a period of
six months  following the Effective Time, BancGroup shall provide all
employees of the  Company and its Subsidiaries whose employment was
terminated other than for  cause, disability or retirement at or following
the Effective Time, and who  so  desires, job counseling and outplacement
assistance services in accordance  with  BancGroup's employment policies and
practices, shall assist each employee in  locating new employment and shall
notify all such employees who want to be  so  notified of opportunities for
positions with BancGroup or any of its  Subsidiaries for which BancGroup
reasonably believes such persons are qualified  and shall consider any
application for such positions submitted by such persons,  provided, however,
that any decisions to offer employment to any such person  shall be made in
the sole discretion of BancGroup.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

26  

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

(f) BancGroup  will take no action that would prevent or impede the merger
from qualifying  as a  tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section
368 of the Code, and  BancGroup will treat the merger consistently with such
qualification for all  income Tax purposes. BancGroup will comply with all
reporting requirements  applicable to reorganizations within the meaning of
Section 368 of the  Code.

 



 

(g) _Indemnification_.  (i)  Subject to the conditions set forth in the
succeeding paragraphs, for a period  of six years after the Effective Time
BancGroup shall, and shall cause Colonial  Bank, N.A. to, indemnify, defend
and hold harmless each director and officer  of  each Acquired Corporation
Company (each being an "Indemnified Party") against  all Liabilities arising
out of actions or omissions occurring upon or prior  to  the Effective Time
(including without limitation the transactions contemplated  by this
Agreement) to the extent required under the bylaws and any existing 
indemnification agreements, each as in effect on the date hereof, of the of 
Acquired Corporation and to the extent permitted or required under the DGCL 
and  other applicable Laws, and subject to the limitations contained in 12
U.S.C.  §1828(K) and 12 CFR Part 359 of the FDIC regulations.

 



 

(ii) BancGroup  shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
individuals serving as  directors and officers of any Acquired Corporation
Company on the Closing Date  to be covered for at least two years from the
Closing Date by either (i) the  directors' and officers' liability insurance
policy maintained by the Acquired  Corporation immediately prior to the
Closing Date with respect to acts or  omissions occurring on or prior to the
Effective Time that were committed by  such officers and directors as such;
or (ii) "tail" insurance policies with a  claims period of at least two years
from the Effective Time with respect to  directors and officers' liability
insurance in an amount and scope at least as  favorable as the Acquired
Corporation\'s existing policies for claims arising  from facts or events
that occurred on or prior to the Effective  Time.

 



 

(iii) Any  Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this
subsection (h),  upon learning of any such Liability or Litigation, shall
promptly notify  BancGroup thereof. In the event of any such Litigation
(whether arising before  or after the Effective Time) (A) BancGroup or
Colonial Bank, N.A. shall have  the  right to assume the defense thereof
with counsel reasonably acceptable to such  Indemnified Party and, upon
assumption of such defense, BancGroup shall not  be  liable to such
Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel  or  any other
expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in  connection
with the defense thereof, except that if BancGroup or Colonial Bank,  N.A.
elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties 
advises that there are substantive issues which raise conflicts of interest 
between BancGroup and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may 
retain counsel satisfactory to them, and BancGroup or Colonial Bank, N.A.
shall  pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the
Indemnified Parties  promptly as statements therefor are received; provided,
that BancGroup shall  be  obligated pursuant to this subsection to pay for
only one firm of counsel for  all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction,
(B) the Indemnified Parties will  cooperate in the defense of any such
Litigation; and (C) BancGroup shall not  be  liable for any settlement
effected without its prior consent (which consent  shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed); and provided further that  BancGroup and Colonial Bank,
N.A. shall not have any obligation hereunder to  any  Indemnified Party (i)
when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall  determine, and such
determination shall have become final, that the  indemnification of such
Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby  is  prohibited by
applicable Law, or (ii) it is determined that indemnification  is 
prohibited under 12 USC §1828(K) or 12 CFR Part 359.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

27  

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

(iv)  In  consideration of and as a condition precedent to the
effectiveness of the  indemnification obligations provided by BancGroup in
this section to a director  or officer of the Acquired Corporation, such
director or officer of the Acquired  Corporation shall have delivered to
BancGroup on or prior to the Effective  Time  a letter in form reasonably
satisfactory to BancGroup concerning claims such  directors or officers may
have against Acquired Corporation. In the letter,  the  directors or
officers shall: (A) acknowledge the assumption by BancGroup as  of  the
Effective Time of all Liability (to the extent Acquired Corporation is  so 
liable) for claims for indemnification arising under section 6.1(h) hereof; 
(B)  affirm that they are unaware of any claims they have or might have
(other than  those referred to in the following clause (C)) against Acquired
Corporation;  (C)  identify any claims or any facts or circumstances of
which they are aware that  could give rise to a claim for indemnification
under section 6.1(h)(i) hereof;  and (D) release as of the Effective Time any
and all claims that they may have  against any Acquired Corporation Company
other than (W) those referred to in  the  foregoing clause (C) and disclosed
in the letter of the director or officer,  (X)  claims by third parties
which have not yet been asserted against such director  or officer (other
than claims arising from facts and circumstances of which  such  director or
officer is aware but which are not disclosed in such director or  executive
officer\'s letter), (Y) claims by third parties arising from any  transaction
contemplated by this Agreement or disclosed in any schedule to  this 
Agreement, and (Z) claims by third parties arising in the ordinary course of 
business of any Acquired Corporation Company after the date of the  letter.

 



 

(v)  Acquired  Corporation hereby represents and warrants to BancGroup that
it has no Knowledge  of any claim, pending or threatened, or of any facts or
circumstances that  could  give rise to any obligation by BancGroup to
provide the indemnification required  by this section 6.1(g) other than as
disclosed in the letters of the directors  and executive officers referred to
in section 6.1(g)(iii) hereof or described  in  any schedule to this
Agreement and claims arising from any transaction  contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

(vi) In  the  event the Resulting Corporation or Colonial Bank, N.A., or any
of their  respective successors or assigns transfers all or substantially all
of its  respective properties and assets to any person, then, and in each
such case,  proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of the  Resulting Corporation or Colonial Bank, N.A., as the case may be,
shall succeed  to or otherwise be bound by the obligations set forth in this
Section  6.1(g).

Corporation covenants to and with BancGroup as follows:

 



 

(a) _Operations_.  Acquired Corporation will conduct its business and the
business of each Acquired  Corporation Company in a proper and prudent manner
and will use its commercially  reasonable efforts to maintain its
relationships with its depositors, customers  and employees. Without the
prior written consent of BancGroup, no Acquired  Corporation Company will
engage in any material transaction outside the ordinary  course of business
or make any material change in its accounting policies or  methods of
operation, nor will Acquired Corporation willingly permit the  occurrence of
any change or event which would render any of the representations  and
warranties in Article 5 hereof untrue in any material respect at and as  of 
the Effective Time with the same effect as though such representations and 
warranties had been made at and as of such Effective Time, unless such 
representation or warranty is made as of a specific date. Except as set 
described in detail on Schedule 6.2(a), Acquired Corporation shall cause the 
Bank to postpone all branch relocation and/or expansion plans prior to the 
Effective Time or the date of termination pursuant to this Agreement.

of the Code,  and Acquired Corporation will treat the merger consistently
with such  qualification for all income Tax purposes. Acquired Corporation
will comply  with  all reporting requirements applicable to reorganizations
within the meaning  of  Section 368 of the Code.

 



 

(b) _  Shareholders ' Meeting; Commercially Reasonable Efforts_.  Acquired
Corporation will cooperate with BancGroup in the preparation of the 
Registration Statement and any regulatory filings and will use commercially 
reasonable efforts (including with reference to the anticipated timing of
any  regulatory approvals) to cause the Shareholders' Meeting to be held for
the  purpose of approving the Merger as soon as practicable after the latter
of  the  effective date of the Registration Statement or clearance by the
SEC of the  Proxy Statement for mailing, and will use commercially reasonable
efforts to  bring about the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including  shareholder approval of this Agreement, as soon as practicable
unless this  Agreement is terminated as provided herein.

 



 

(c) _Prohibited  Negotiations_.  (i)  Except with respect to this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby,  no Acquired Corporation Company
nor any affiliate thereof nor any investment  banker, attorney, accountant,
or other representative (collectively, "Representatives") retained by an
Acquired Corporation Company shall directly or  indirectly solicit any
Acquisition Proposal by any Person. Except to the extent  the Acquired
Corporation's Board of Directors, after consultation with counsel, 
determines in good faith it necessary to comply with its fiduciary duties, 
no  Acquired Corporation Company or any Representative thereof shall furnish
any  non-public information that it is not legally obligated to furnish,
negotiate  with respect to, or enter into any Contract with respect to, any
Acquisition  Proposal, and each Acquired Corporation Company shall direct and
use its  reasonable efforts to cause all of its Representatives not to engage
in any  of  the foregoing, but Acquired Corporation may communicate
information about such  an Acquisition Proposal to its shareholders if and to
the extent, after  consultation with counsel, that it determines in good
faith that it is required  to do so in order to comply with its legal
obligations. Acquired Corporation  shall promptly notify BancGroup orally and
in writing in the event that any  Acquired Corporation Company receives after
the date hereof any written inquiry  or proposal relating to any such
Acquisition Proposal. Acquired Corporation  shall immediately cease and cause
to be terminated any existing activities,  discussions, or negotiations with
any Persons other than BancGroup conducted  heretofore with respect to any of
the foregoing.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

29  

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

(ii) If  Acquired Corporation (A) willfully breaches this Agreement and the
Merger is  not  consummated, (B) enters into a letter of intent or
definitive agreement  regarding an Acquisition Proposal with any third party
(other than BancGroup  or  any of its Subsidiaries) prior to the earlier of
(i) the Effective Time or  (ii)  the termination of this Agreement pursuant
to Article 13 hereof (other than  a  termination pursuant to paragraph (a)
of section 13.2 hereof or by Acquired  Corporation pursuant to paragraphs
(b), (c) or (d) of section 13.2 hereof),  or  (C) if Acquired Corporation
receives or is the subject of an Acquisition  Proposal from a third party
(other than BancGroup or its Subsidiaries) prior  to  the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Article 13 hereof (other than  a  termination
pursuant to paragraph (a) of section 13.2 hereof or by Acquired  Corporation
pursuant to paragraphs (b), (c) or (d) of section 13.2 hereof),  and  within
twelve (12) months after termination of this Agreement pursuant to  Article
13 hereof (other than a termination pursuant to paragraph (a) of section 
13.2 hereof or by Acquired Corporation pursuant to paragraphs (b), (c) or
(d)  of  section 13.2 hereof) an Acquisition Proposal is consummated with
such third  party, Acquired Corporation covenants and agrees that it shall
pay to BancGroup  upon written demand at any time (Y) after Acquired
Corporation enters into  an  agreement which is legally binding on Acquired
Corporation regarding an  Acquisition Proposal or (Z) at any time on or after
the date of consummation  of  such Acquisition Proposal, which ever is the
first to occur, the principal  sum  of $12,500,000. Such payment shall
compensate BancGroup for its direct and  indirect costs and expenses in
connection with the transactions contemplated  by  this Agreement, including
BancGroup\'s management time devoted to negotiation  and  preparation for
the Merger and BancGroup\'s loss as a result of the Merger not  being
consummated. The Parties acknowledge and agree that it would be 
impracticable or extremely difficult to fix the actual damages resulting
from  the foregoing events and, therefore, the Parties have agreed upon the
foregoing  payment as liquidated damages which shall not be deemed to be in
the nature  of a  penalty. Other than the payment provided for in this
section 6.2(c)(ii) and  any  Liability for expenses as set forth in Section
15.10 hereof, there shall be  no  other Liability or obligation on the part
of any Acquired Corporation Company  or  their respective directors or

(b) Nothing  contained in this Section 15.1 shall constitute or shall be
deemed to constitute  liquidated damages for the willful breach by a Party of
the terms of this  Agreement or otherwise limit the rights of the
nonbreaching Party.

 



 

**15.2** **_Benefit  and Assignment_**.  Except  as expressly contemplated
hereby, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,  interests, or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any Party hereto  (whether by
operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent  of  the
other Party. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be 
binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties
and  their respective successors and assigns.

 



 

**15.3** **_Governing  Law_**.  Except  to the extent the Laws of the State
of Delaware apply to the Merger, this  Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with the Laws of  the  State of Florida without
regard to any conflict of Laws.

 



 

**15.4** **_Counterparts_**.  This  Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to  constitute an original. Each
such counterpart shall become effective when one  counterpart has been signed
by each Party thereto. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48  

 

 

 

 

 

 

**15.5** **_Headings_**.  The  headings of the various articles and sections
of this Agreement are for  convenience of reference only and shall not be
deemed a part of this Agreement  or considered in construing the provisions
thereof.

 



 

**15.6** **_Severability_**.  Any  term or provision of this Agreement that
is prohibited or unenforceable in  any  jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of  such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining terms  and provisions
thereof or affecting the validity or enforceability of such  provision in any
other jurisdiction, and if any term or provision of this  Agreement is held
by any court of competent jurisdiction to be void, voidable,  invalid or
unenforceable in any given circumstance or situation, then all other  terms
and provisions, being severable, shall remain in full force and effect  in 
such circumstance or situation and the term or provision shall remain valid 
and  in effect in any other circumstances or situation, except if such

deemed to refer to the feminine and neuter  genders and the use of singular
references shall be deemed to include the plural  and vice versa, as

business.

 



 

**15.9** **_Equitable  Remedies_**.  The  parties hereto agree that, in the
event of a breach of this Agreement by either  Party, the other Party may be
without an adequate remedy at law owing to the  unique nature of the

Party, the non-breaching Party shall be entitled to obtain  equitable relief,
including the remedies of specific performance and injunction,  in the event
of a breach of this Agreement by the other Party, and no attempt  on  the
part of the non-breaching Party to obtain such equitable relief shall be 
deemed to constitute an election of remedies by the non-breaching Party that 
would preclude the non-breaching Party from obtaining any remedies at law to 
which it would otherwise be entitled.

 



 

**15.10** **_Attorneys '  Fees_**.  If any  Party hereto shall bring an
action at law or in equity to enforce its rights  under this Agreement

Party in exercising any right, power  or  remedy upon any breach or Default
of any other Party shall impair any such  rights, powers or remedies of the
Party not in breach or Default, nor shall  it  be construed to be a wavier
of any such right, power or remedy, or an  acquiescence in any similar breach
or Default; nor shall any waiver of any  single breach or Default be deemed a
waiver of any other breach or default  theretofore or thereafter occurring.
Any waiver, permit, consent or approval  of  any kind or character on the
part of any Party of any provisions of this  Agreement must be in writing and
be executed by the Parties to this Agreement  and shall be effective only to
