capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in _Exhibit A_.

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the board of directors of each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company
has approved the acquisition of the Company by Parent on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement;

WHEREAS, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein,
Purchaser has agreed to commence a tender offer (the " _Offer_ ") to purchase
all outstanding Company Shares, at a price of $85.00 per Company Share, in
cash without interest (such price, or any higher price as may be paid in the
Offer in accordance with this Agreement, the " _Offer Price_ ");

WHEREAS, following consummation of the Offer, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein Purchaser shall merge with and into the Company
(the " _Merger_ ") and each Company Share that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Company Shares held in
the treasury of the Company or owned by Parent, Purchaser or any direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time, which will be canceled with no consideration issued in
exchange therefor, and other than Appraisal Shares) will be canceled and
converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer Price
(the " _Merger Consideration_ "), all upon the terms and conditions set forth
herein;

WHEREAS, the Company Board has, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, unanimously and duly adopted resolutions (i) determining that
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are advisable and fair to, and
in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders, (ii) adopting and
approving this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Offer, the Merger and the "agreement of merger" (as such term is used in
Section 251 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ ")),
in accordance with the DGCL, (iii) directing that the "agreement of merger"
(as such term is used in Section 251 of the DGCL) contained in this Agreement
be submitted to the stockholders of the Company for adoption (unless
the Merger is consummated in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL as
contemplated herein), and (iv) recommending that the Companys stockholders
accept the Offer, tender their Company Shares to Purchaser pursuant to the
Offer, and adopt the "agreement of merger" (as such term is used in Section
251 of the DGCL) set forth in this Agreement;



 

1 WHEREAS, the board of directors of Parent and Purchaser have, on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein, unanimously approved and declared
advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Offer and the Merger, and Parent, in its capacity as the sole stockholder
of Purchaser, has adopted the "agreement of merger" set forth in this
Agreement, in each case, in accordance with the DGCL; and

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants
and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby,
Parent, Purchaser and the Company hereby agree as follows:

SECTION 1. THE OFFER

1.1 The Offer 

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have previously been validly
terminated in accordance with _Section 7_, as promptly as practicable after
the date hereof, but in any event within ten business days after the date of
this Agreement, Purchaser shall commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
under the Exchange Act) the Offer for all of the outstanding Company Shares
(including any Company Shares subject to repurchase rights in favor of the
Company) for consideration per Company Share consisting of the Offer Price.
(The date on which Purchaser commences the Offer, within the meaning of Rule
14d-2 under the Exchange Act, is referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Offer Commencement Date_ ").

(b) As promptly as practicable on the later of: (i) the earliest date as of
which Purchaser is permitted under applicable Legal Requirements to accept for
payment Company Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer; and (ii) the earliest
date as of which each of the conditions set forth in Annex I (the " _Offer
Conditions_ ") shall have been satisfied or waived, Purchaser shall (and
Parent shall cause Purchaser to) accept for payment all Company Shares
tendered pursuant to the Offer (and not validly withdrawn). The obligation of
Purchaser to accept for payment Company Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer
shall be subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of each of the Offer
Conditions (and shall not be subject to any other conditions). As promptly as
practicable after the acceptance for payment of any Company Shares tendered
pursuant to the Offer, Purchaser shall pay for such Company Shares.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
neither Parent nor Purchaser shall (without the prior written consent of the
Company):

(i) change or waive the Minimum Condition (as defined in Annex I);

(ii) decrease the number of Company Shares sought to be purchased by Purchaser
in the Offer;

(iii) reduce the Offer Price;

(iv) extend or otherwise change the expiration date of the Offer (except to
the extent required pursuant to _Section 1.1(d)_);

(v) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer; or



 

2 (vi) amend, modify or supplement any of the Offer Conditions or terms of the
Offer in a manner that adversely affects, or would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect, the holders of Company Shares.

(d) Unless extended as provided in this Agreement, the Offer shall expire on
the date (the " _Initial Expiration Date_ ") that is 20 business days
(calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) after the
Offer Commencement Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, on the Initial
Expiration Date or any subsequent date as of which the Offer is scheduled to
expire, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not been waived, then
Purchaser, without the consent of the Company, may (and, to the extent
requested by the Company from time to time, shall) extend (and re-extend) the
Offer and its expiration date for one or more periods ending no later than the
Outside Date, to permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied;  _provided,
however_ , that no individual extension shall be for a period of more than 10
business days without the prior written consent of the Company. The Offer may
be terminated prior to its expiration date (as such expiration date may
be extended and re-extended in accordance with this Agreement), but only if
this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with _Section 7_.

(e) Purchaser may, in its discretion, elect to provide for a subsequent
offering period (and one or more extensions thereof) (and, if immediately
following the Acceptance Time (as defined in  _Section 1.4(a)_), Parent,
Purchaser and their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates own more than 80%
of the Company Shares outstanding at that time (which shares beneficially
owned shall include shares tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn), to the
extent requested by the Company, Purchaser shall provide for a subsequent
offering period of at least 10 business days) in accordance with Rule 14d-11
under the Exchange Act following the Acceptance Time.

(f) The Offer Price shall be adjusted to the extent appropriate to reflect the
effect of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend,
reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction with respect to Company Shares
occurring or having a record date on or after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the payment by Purchaser for the Company Shares.

1.2 Actions of Parent and Purchaser.

(a) On the Offer Commencement Date Parent shall: (i) cause to be filed with
the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer,
which will contain Purchasers offer to purchase and related letter of
transmittal (the forms of which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company)
and the related form of summary advertisement (such Tender Offer Statement
on Schedule TO, all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto being
referred to collectively in this Agreement as the " _Offer Documents_ ") and
(ii) cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Company Shares
to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements. Parent and Purchaser
shall cause the Offer Documents to comply in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents (including any
amendment or supplement thereto) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC.
Parent and Purchaser shall promptly provide the Company and its counsel with
a copy or a description of any comments received by Parent or Purchaser (or by
counsel to Parent or Purchaser) from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Offer Documents. Each of Parent and Purchaser shall respond as promptly
as practicable to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Offer Documents or the Offer.



 

3 (b) To the extent required by the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder: (i) each of Parent, Purchaser and
the Company shall correct promptly any information provided by it for use in
the Offer Documents if such information shall have become false or misleading
in any material respect; and (ii) each of Parent and Purchaser shall take all
steps necessary to promptly cause the Offer Documents, as supplemented or
amended to correct such information, to be filed with the SEC and to be
disseminated to holders of Company Shares. The Company shall promptly furnish
to Parent all information concerning the Company that may be reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with any action contemplated by _Section
1.2(a)_ or _(b)_. No representation is made by Parent or Purchaser with
respect to information supplied by the Company for inclusion in the Offer
Documents.

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section 8.10_, Parent shall cause to
be provided to Purchaser all of the funds necessary to purchase any Company
Shares that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer, and
shall cause Purchaser to perform, on a timely basis, all of Purchasers
obligations under this Agreement.

1.3 Actions of the Company.

(a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer.

(b) On the Offer Commencement Date, the Company shall file with the SEC and
(following or contemporaneously with the initial dissemination of the Offer
Documents to holders of Company Shares to the extent required by applicable
federal securities laws) disseminate to holders of Company Shares a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any
amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") that, subject to
_Section 5.3(c)_, shall contain the Company Recommendation. Except in
connection with a Company Change in Recommendation made in accordance with
_Section 5.3(c)_, Parent and its counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 (including
any amendment or supplement thereto) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC.
The Company shall: (i) promptly provide Parent and its counsel with a copy of
any written comments and a description of any oral comments received by the
Company (or its counsel) from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9; (ii) except with respect to disclosure made relating to a
Company Change in Recommendation in accordance with _Section 5.3(c)_, give
Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any
response formulated in connection with such comments prior to the filing
thereof with the SEC; and (iii) respond promptly to any such comments. To the
extent required by the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder: (A) each of Parent, Purchaser and the
Company shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the
Schedule 14D-9 if such information shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect; and (B) the Company shall take all steps necessary to
cause the Schedule 14D-9, as supplemented or amended to correct
such information, to be filed with the SEC. Parent and Purchaser shall
promptly furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent or Purchaser
that may be reasonably requested in connection with any action contemplated by
this  _Section 1.3(b)_. To the extent requested by the Company, Parent shall
cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be mailed or otherwise disseminated to the
Companys stockholders together with the Offer Documents disseminated to the
Companys stockholders.



 

4 (c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall instruct its transfer
agent to furnish to Purchaser a list, as of the most recent practicable date,
of the record holders of Company Shares and their addresses, as well as
mailing labels containing such names and addresses. The Company will furnish
Purchaser with such additional information (including any security position
listings in the Companys possession or reasonably obtainable by the Company)
and assistance as Purchaser may reasonably request for purposes of
communicating the Offer to the record holders and beneficial holders of
Company Shares. All information furnished in accordance with this _Section
1.3(c)_ shall be held in confidence by Parent and Purchaser in accordance with
the requirements of the letter agreement, dated May 11, 2006, between Parent
and the Company, as amended on June 2, 2006 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_
"), and shall be used by Parent and Purchaser only in connection with the
communication of the Offer and the dissemination of any proxy or information
statement relating to the Merger to the holders of Company Shares.

1.4 Board of Directors.

(a) After the first time that Purchaser accepts for payment any Company Shares
tendered pursuant to the Offer (the " _Acceptance Time_ "), and at all times
thereafter, the Company will, upon Parents request and subject to compliance
with applicable Legal Requirements, take all actions necessary to cause
persons designated by Parent to become directors of the Company so that the
total number of such persons equals that number of directors, rounded up to
the next whole number, determined by multiplying: (i) the total number of
directors on the Company Board (after giving effect to the directors elected
or designated by Parent in accordance with this _Section 1.4(a)_); by (ii)
the percentage that the number of Company Shares beneficially owned by Parent,
Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates bears to the total number of
Company Shares outstanding at the Acceptance Time (determined on a fully-
diluted basis but disregarding any unvested stock options and other unvested
rights to acquire Company Shares). The Company will take all actions necessary
to permit Parents designees to be elected to the Company Board in accordance
with this _Section 1.4(a)_, including using reasonable efforts to secure the
resignation of directors, promptly filling vacancies or newly created
directorships on the Company Board, increasing the size of the Company Board,
and/or amending the bylaws of the Company; _provided, however_ , that prior to
the Effective Time, the Company Board shall always have at least two
Continuing Directors. The Company shall, upon Parents request following the
Acceptance Time, and at all times thereafter, also cause Persons designated by
Parent to constitute the same percentage (rounded up to the next whole number)
as is on the Company Board of (i) each committee of the Company Board, (ii)
each board of directors (or similar body) of each Subsidiary of the Company
and (iii) each committee (or similar body) of each such board, in each case to
the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements and the Marketplace
Rules of the NASDAQ Global Select Market. Upon the election or appointment of
all of Parents designees to the Company Board in accordance with this
_Section 1.4(a)_, the Company shall take all action necessary to elect to be
treated as a "controlled company" as defined by NASDAQ Marketplace Rule
4350(c) and make all necessary filings and disclosures associated with such
status. The provisions of this _Section 1.4(a)_ are in addition to and shall
not limit any rights that any of Purchaser, Parent or any of their respective
affiliates may have as a record holder or beneficial owner of Company Shares
as a matter of applicable Legal Requirements with respect to the election of
directors or otherwise.



 

5 (b) The Companys obligation to cause Parents designees to be elected or
appointed to the Company Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all
actions, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect
to the Company and its officers and directors, as Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder require in order to fulfill its
obligations under this _Section 1.4_, so long as Parent shall have provided
to the Company all information with respect to Parent and its designees,
officers, directors and Affiliates required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange
Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder. Parent shall promptly supply to the Company in
writing, and shall be solely responsible for, all such information.

1.5 Actions by Directors. Following the election or appointment of Parents
designees to the Company Board pursuant to _Section 1.4(a)_, and until the
Effective Time, the approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors shall
be required to authorize: (i) any amendment to or termination of this
Agreement by the Company; (ii) any amendment to the Companys certificate of
incorporation; (iii) any extension of time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of Parent or Purchaser; (iv) any waiver of
compliance with any covenant of Parent or Purchaser or any condition to any
obligation of the Company or any waiver of any right of the Company under this
Agreement; (v) any Company Change in Recommendation; and (vi) any other
consent or action by the Company Board with respect to this Agreement, the
Offer or the Merger. The authorization of any such matter by a majority of the
Continuing Directors shall constitute the authorization of such matter by the
Company Board, and no other action on the part of the Company or any other
director of the Company shall be required to authorize such matter.

1.6 Top-Up Option.

(a) The Company hereby grants to Purchaser an irrevocable option (the " _Top-
Up Option_ "), exercisable only upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein, to purchase, at a price per share equal to the Offer Price,
that number of Company Shares (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the
lesser of (x) the lowest number of Company Shares that, when added to the
number of Company Shares owned by Parent, Purchaser and their respective
Subsidiaries and Affiliates at the time of such exercise, shall constitute ten
thousand (10,000) shares more than 90% of the Company Shares then outstanding
(after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares) and (y) an
aggregate number of Company Shares that is equal to 19.9% of the Company
Shares issued and outstanding as of the date hereof; _provided, however_
, that the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable unless, (i) immediately
prior to such exercise, Parent, Purchaser and their respective Subsidiaries
and Affiliates own more than 80% of the Company Shares then outstanding
and (ii) immediately after such exercise and the issuance of Company Shares
pursuant thereto, Parent, Purchaser and their respective Subsidiaries and
Affiliates own more than 90% of the Company Shares then outstanding; and
_provided, further_ , that in no event shall the Top-Up Option be exercisable
for a number of Company Shares in excess of the Companys total authorized and
unissued Company Shares.



 

6 (b) Provided that no applicable Legal Requirement shall prohibit the exercise
of the Top-Up Option or the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares pursuant
thereto, or otherwise make such exercise or issuance illegal, Purchaser may
exercise and re-exercise the Top-Up Option multiple times, in whole but not in
part, at any time or times after the Acceptance Time and prior to the earlier

pursuant to _Section 7_.

(c) Each time that Purchaser wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Purchaser
shall send to the Company a written notice (a " _Top-Up Exercise Notice_ ")
specifying the denominations of the certificate or certificates evidencing
the Top-Up Option Shares which the Purchaser wishes to receive, and the place,
time and date for the closing of the purchase and sale pursuant to the Top-Up
Option (a " _Top-Up Closing_ "). The Company shall, promptly after receipt of
a Top-Up Exercise Notice, deliver a written notice to the Purchaser confirming
the number of Top-Up Option Shares and the aggregate purchase price therefore.
At each Top-Up Closing, Purchaser shall pay the Company the aggregate price
required to be paid for the Top-Up Option Shares issuable at such Top-Up
Closing, by delivery of, at Purchasers option, (A) immediately available
funds by wire transfer to an account designated by the Company, (B) a
promissory note, bearing simple interest at 5% per annum, and due six months
after the Top-Up Closing, or (C) any combination thereof. At each Top-Up
Closing, the Company shall cause to be issued to Purchaser a certificate

Closing. Certificates representing Company Shares in connection with the Top-
Up Option may include any legends that are required by federal or state
securities laws.

and without any further action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company
or any stockholder of the Company:

(i) any Company Shares then held by the Company or any wholly owned

Consideration, without interest; and

(iv) each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Purchaser then

and (b) the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect

Stock Certificate_ ") is presented to the Payment Agent (as defined in
_Section 2.7(a)_) or to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such Company
Stock Certificate shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in
_Section 2.7_.

2.7 Payment for Company Shares.

(a) Prior to the Acceptance Time (i) Parent shall select a bank or trust
company (reasonably acceptable to the Company) to act as payment agent with
respect to the payment of the Merger Consideration (the " _Payment Agent_ ")
and (ii) Parent shall cause to be made available to the Payment Agent cash
amounts sufficient to enable the Payment Agent to make payments pursuant to
_Section 2.5_ to holders of Company Shares outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Payment Agent to
mail to each Person who was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a
holder of record of Company Shares described in _Section 2.5(a)(iii)_ a form
of letter of transmittal (reasonably acceptable to the Company) and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificates
representing such Company Shares in exchange for payment therefor. Parent
shall ensure that, upon surrender to the Payment Agent of each such Company
Stock Certificate, together with a properly executed letter of transmittal,
the holder of such Company Stock Certificate (or, under the circumstances
described in _Section 2.7(e)_, the transferee of the Company Shares
represented by such Company Stock Certificate) shall promptly receive in
exchange therefor the consideration to which such holder (or transferee) is
entitled pursuant to _Section 2.5(a)(iii)_.

(c) On or after the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to cause the Payment Agent to deliver
to Parent or the Surviving Corporation any funds made available by Parent to
the Payment Agent which have not been disbursed to holders of Company Stock
Certificates, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to
Parent and the Surviving Corporation with respect to the consideration payable
and issuable upon surrender of their Company Stock Certificates. Neither the
Payment Agent, Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any
holder of a Company Stock Certificate for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property or escheat law. If any
Company Stock Certificates shall not have been surrendered before the third
anniversary of the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date
on which any Merger Consideration payable in respect of such Company
Stock Certificates would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration in respect thereof shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, become the property
of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.



 

9 (d) If any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, then, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Company Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed in a
form reasonably satisfactory to Parent (together with an indemnity in form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent against any claim that may be made against
the Payment Agent or Parent or otherwise with respect to such certificate and,
if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct to support such indemnity), Parent shall cause
the Payment Agent to pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Company Stock Certificate the consideration payable and issuable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

(e) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Shares which is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, the consideration may be
paid and issued with respect to such Company Shares to a transferee of such
Company Shares if the Company Stock Certificate representing such Company
Shares is presented to the Payment Agent, accompanied by all documents
reasonably required by the Payment Agent to evidence and effect such transfer
and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes relating to such
transfer have been paid.

(f) The Surviving Corporation or Parent shall bear and pay all charges and
expenses, including those of the Payment Agent, incurred in connection with
the exchange of the Company Shares.

(g) Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Payment Agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement to any holder of Company Shares or
Company Options such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Payment Agent are required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any
Legal Requirement, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Payment Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Shares or Company
Options in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent.

2.8 Appraisal Rights.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any
Company Shares that constitute Appraisal Shares shall not be converted into or
represent the right to receive payment in accordance with _Section 2.5_, and
each holder of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled only to such rights with
respect to such Appraisal Shares as may be granted to such holder pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL. From and after the Effective Time, a holder of
Appraisal Shares shall not have and shall not be entitled to exercise any of
the voting rights or other rights of a stockholder of the Surviving
Corporation.

(b) The Company: (i) shall give Parent prompt written notice of any demand by
any stockholder of the Company for appraisal of such stockholders Company
Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL; and (ii) shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
any such demand. Except with the prior written consent of Purchaser (which
consent may be withheld in the sole and absolute discretion of Purchaser) or
as may otherwise be required by applicable Legal Requirements, the Company
shall not make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
such demands.



 

10 (c) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Appraisal Shares_ " shall refer to any
Company Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are
held by stockholders who have preserved their appraisal rights under Section
262 of the DGCL with respect to such Company Shares. If any holder of
Appraisal Shares shall fail to perfect or shall otherwise lose such holders
right of appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL, then: (i) any right of such
holder with respect to such Company Shares as may be granted to such holder
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall be extinguished; and (ii) such
Appraisal Shares shall automatically be converted into and shall represent
only the right to receive (upon the surrender of the Company Stock
Certificate(s) representing such Appraisal Shares) payment for such Appraisal
Shares in accordance with _Section 2.5_.

2.9 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the officers
and directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be authorized (in
the name of Purchaser, in the name of the Company or otherwise) take such
action.

(a) Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and (where such concept is recognized under the
laws of the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated) in good standing under
the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated, and has all
requisite corporate power and authority necessary to own, lease and operate
its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The
Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to

business conducted by it makes such qualification or license necessary,
except where the failure to be so qualified does not have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

(b) Part 3.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all Company Subsidiaries
in existence as of the date of this Agreement, together with the jurisdiction
of organization of each such Subsidiary and, if the Company, together
with the Company Subsidiaries, does not own all of the outstanding equity
interests of such Company Subsidiary, the percentage of equity interests of
such Company Subsidiary owned by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries. All
the outstanding shares of capital stock and other equity interests of each
Company Subsidiary have been duly authorized and validly issued, are fully
paid and  



 

11  nonassessable are not subject to any purchase option, call option, right of
first refusal, preemptive right, subscription right or any similar
right entitling the holders thereof to acquire shares of capital stock or
other equity interests from such Company Subsidiary under any provision of the
Legal Requirements pursuant to which such Company Subsidiary is formed, such
Company Subsidiarys organizational documents or any Contract to which such
Company Subsidiary is a party or is otherwise bound, and are owned directly or
indirectly by the Company free and clear of all liens, pledges or
Encumbrances, except for Permitted Encumbrances. Except for the capital stock
of, or other equity interests in, the Company Subsidiaries, and except for
marketable securities held from time to time by the Company in connection with
its normal cash management activities, the Company does not own, directly or
indirectly, any capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, any

are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Companys stockholders; (b)
duly and validly authorized and approved the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by the Company; (c) declared that this Agreement

Agreement other than, with respect to the Merger, the adoption of this
Agreement by the holders of a majority of the then outstanding Company Shares
(if required under the DGCL) and the filing of the appropriate merger
documents as required by the DGCL. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered on behalf of the Company and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Purchaser, constitutes
the valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against
the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to (i) laws of general
application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency and the relief of debtors, and
(ii) rules of law governing specific performance, injunctive relief and other
equitable remedies.

Company Disclosure Schedule, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
the Company, the acquisition of Company Shares by Purchaser pursuant to the
Offer and the consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not: (a) cause a violation
of any of the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the
Company or any of the equivalent organizational documents of the Company
Subsidiaries; (b) cause a violation by the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries of any Legal Requirement applicable to the business of

right of termination, amendment, cancellation or acceleration) under, any of
the terms, conditions or provisions of any Contract to which the Company or
any Company Subsidiary is a party or by which its properties or assets are
otherwise bound; except in the case of clauses (b) and (c) does not result in
a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as may be required by the Exchange
Act, the DGCL, the HSR Act or the antitrust or competition laws of foreign
jurisdictions, the Company is not required to make any filing with, or to
obtain any consent from, any Person in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company or the consummation by the Company
of the Merger, except where the failure to make any such filing or obtain any

furnished to the FDA or other Governmental Entities have been timely filed,
maintained, or furnished and were true, complete and correct in all material
respects and in conformance with Legal Requirements as of the date of

26  by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for each of their products are
consistent with the scope of regulatory clearance, exemption or approval for
each product in each jurisdiction where it is marketed in all material
respects, and supported by proper research design, testing, analysis and
disclosure that conforms with Legal Requirements.

(c) The activities, products and facilities of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, as well as, to the Companys knowledge, its suppliers,

seeking to recall, reclassify, re-label, suspend, or seize any product sold or
proposed to be sold by the Company or a Company Subsidiary. To the Companys
knowledge, there are no facts which are reasonably likely to cause: (A) the
recall, suspension, field notification, field correction, reclassification,
re-labeling or safety alert of any product sold or intended to be sold by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary; (B) a change in the marketing
classification or a material change in labeling of any such products; or (C) a
termination or suspension of marketing of any such products.

(e) All products being manufactured, distributed, or developed by the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries that are subject to the jurisdiction of the FDA

pursuant to accepted professional scientific standards and all  



 

27  applicable Legal Requirements relating thereto, including the FDCA and its
applicable implementing regulations at 21 C.F.R. Parts 50, 54, 56 and 812. 

(g) Neither the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of
the Company, any of their collective officers, employees or agents has
committed any act, made any statement, or failed to make any statement, that
would be reasonably expected to provide a basis for the FDA to invoke its

Illegal Gratuities," set forth in 56 Fed. Reg. 46191 (September 10, 1991) and
any amendments thereto.

material debarment or exclusion under 21 U.S.C. Section 335a or under any
similar Legal Requirement. No claims, actions, proceedings or investigations
that could reasonably be expected to result in such a material debarment or
exclusion are pending or threatened against the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries, or, to the knowledge of the Company, any of their collective
officers, employees or agents.

(i) Except as disclosed on Part 3.18(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
there are no investigations, audits, actions or other proceedings pending with
respect to a violation by the Company or any Company Subsidiary of any Legal

notifications, field corrections and safety alerts were resolved or closed,
and (ii) to the knowledge of the Company, any material complaints with respect
to products produced by the Company or any or any Company Subsidiary, or by
any Person on behalf of the Company or any or any Company Subsidiary, that
are open as of the date of this Agreement. There are no outstanding recalls,
field notifications, field corrections, safety alerts or product complaints
with respect to the products manufactured and/or distributed by the Company
or any or any Company Subsidiary, or by any Person on behalf of the Company or
any or any Company Subsidiary, and to the Companys knowledge, there are no
facts that would be reasonably likely to result in a material product recall,

28 3.20 Tax Matters.

(a) Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries has timely filed with the
appropriate Governmental Entity all Tax Returns required to be filed. All such
Tax Returns are complete and accurate in all material respects and have been
prepared in compliance with applicable Legal Requirements. All material Taxes
due and owing by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (whether or not
shown on any Tax Return) have been paid. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary is the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file
any material Tax Return. No written claim has ever been received by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary from a Governmental Entity in a jurisdiction
where the Company or any Company Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns that it
is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

(b) The unpaid Taxes of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries did not, as
of the date of the Latest Balance Sheet, exceed the reserve for Tax liability
(excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing
differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of such
balance sheets (rather than in any notes thereto). Since the date of the
Latest Balance Sheet, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
incurred any liability for Taxes outside the ordinary course of business or
otherwise inconsistent with past custom and practice.

(c) There are no examinations, audits or Legal Proceedings with respect to
material Taxes of the Company or any Company Subsidiary currently pending or
underway (and to the knowledge of the Company no such examination, audit or
proceeding is threatened) nor has the Company or any Company Subsidiary
received any notice from a Governmental Entity relating to any issue which
could result in a material Tax liability for the Company or any Company
Subsidiary. No deficiency for material Taxes against the Company or any
Company Subsidiary has been claimed, proposed or assessed by any Governmental
Entity that has not been satisfied by payment or withdrawn. No extension or
waiver of the limitation period applicable to any material Taxes or material
Tax Return is in effect. The Company has delivered or made available to
Parent complete and accurate copies of federal, state and local Tax Returns of
the Company and each Company Subsidiary and their predecessors for all open
Tax years, and complete and accurate copies of all examination reports
and statements of deficiencies assessed against or agreed to by the Company,
any Company Subsidiary or any predecessors since its last open Tax year.

(d) There are no Encumbrances for material Taxes (other than Permitted
Encumbrances) upon any of the assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

(e) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary will be required to include
any material item of income in, or exclude any material item of deduction
from, taxable income for any period (or any portion thereof) ending after the
Acceptance Time as a result of any installment sale or other transaction on or
prior to the Acceptance Time, any accounting method change or agreement with
any Governmental Entity, any prepaid amount received on or prior to the
Acceptance Time or any intercompany transaction or excess loss account
described in Code Section 1502 (or any corresponding provision of state, local
or foreign Tax law).

(f) None of the outstanding indebtedness of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary constitutes indebtedness with respect to which any
interest deductions may be disallowed under Sections 163(i), 163(l) or 279 of
the Code or under any other provision of applicable Legal Requirements.



 

29 (g) The Company and each Company Subsidiary has withheld and paid all Taxes
required to have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or
owing to any employee, independent contractor, service provider, creditor,
stockholder or other third party and is not liable for any arrears of wages or
any taxes or any penalty for failure to withhold or pay such amounts.

(h) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary: (i) is a party to or bound
by a Tax sharing, allocation, indemnification or similar agreement; (ii) has
been a member of an affiliated group of corporations within the meaning of
Section 1504 of the Code or any group that has filed a consolidated, combined
or unitary Tax Return other than a consolidated, combined or unitary group of
which the Company is the common parent; or (iii) has any liability for
material Taxes of any Person (other than Taxes of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries) under Treasury regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of a Legal Requirement), as a transferee or successor, by Contract,
or otherwise. For the purposes of this _Section 3.20(h)_, commercially
reasonable Contracts providing for the allocation or payment of real property
Taxes attributable to real property leased or occupied by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary shall be disregarded.

(i) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary: (i) has ever been a United

of a Legal Requirement); (iii) has been a "personal holding company" as

Requirement); (iv) has had a material liability with respect to Taxes as a
result of being a stockholder of a "passive foreign investment company" within
the meaning of Section 1297 of the Code; or (v) has engaged in a trade or

Tax treaty) or has otherwise become subject to Tax jurisdiction in a country
other than the country of its formation.

(j) None of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or predecessor has within the
past three (3) years been a party to a transaction intended to qualify under
Section 355 of the Code or under so much of Section 356 of the Code as relates
to Section 355 of the Code.

(k) None of the Company Subsidiaries organized outside of the United States is

of the Code or is treated as a United States corporation under Section
7874(b) of the Code.

3.21 Employee Benefit Plans.

(a) For purposes of this Section 3.21(a), " _Company Plan_ " means each
"employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA (whether or not
subject to ERISA)  



 

30  and each other plan, policy, program, practice, agreement, understanding or
arrangement (whether written or oral) providing compensation or other benefits
to any current or former director, officer, employee or consultant (or to any
dependent or beneficiary thereof) of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate (as
defined below), which is now, or was within the past six years, maintained,
sponsored or contributed to by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, or under
which the Company or any ERISA Affiliate has or may have any obligation or
liability, whether actual or contingent, including all incentive, bonus,
deferred compensation, vacation, holiday, cafeteria, medical, disability,
stock purchase, stock option, stock appreciation, phantom stock, restricted
stock or other stock-based compensation plans, policies, programs, practices
or arrangements. Part 3.21 (a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth
a complete list of each Company Plan under which the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate has or may have any material obligation or material liability,
whether actual or contingent.

(b) Each Company Plan which is intended to qualify under Section 401(a),
Section 401(k), Section 401(m) or Section 4975(e)(7) of the Code has either
(i) received a favorable determination letter from the IRS as to its qualified
status, or (ii) may rely upon a favorable prototype opinion letter from the
IRS, and each trust established in connection with any Company Plan which is
intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the
Code is so exempt, and to Companys knowledge, no fact or event has occurred
that could adversely affect the qualified status of any such Company Plan or
the exempt status of any such trust.

(c) Each Company Plan complies in all material respects in form and
operation, and has been administered in all material respects in accordance
with, its terms and all applicable Legal Requirements, including ERISA and the
Code, and all contributions required to be made under the terms of any of the
Company Plans as of the date of this Agreement have been timely made or, if
not yet due, have been properly reflected on the most recent consolidated
balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference in the Company financial
statements prior to the date of this Agreement. With respect to each Company
Plan, all Tax, annual reporting and other filings with a Governmental Entity
required by ERISA and the Code have been timely filed with the appropriate
Governmental Entity and all notices and disclosures have been timely provided
to participants. With respect to the Company Plans, no event has occurred and,
to the knowledge of Company, there exists no condition or set of circumstances
in connection with which the Company or any Company Subsidiary could be
subject to any material liability (other than for routine benefit
liabilities) under the terms of, or with respect to, such Company Plans,
ERISA, the Code or any other applicable Legal Requirement.

(d) To the Companys knowledge, there has been no prohibited transaction
(within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code and
other than a transaction that is exempt under a statutory or administrative
exemption) with respect to any Company Plan that could result in liability to
the Company or any ERISA Affiliate. Each Company Plan can be amended,
terminated or otherwise discontinued after the Effective Time in accordance
with its terms, without liability (other than (A) liability for ordinary
administrative expenses typically incurred in a termination event or (B) if
the Company Plan is a pension benefit plan subject to Part 2 of Title I of
ERISA, liability for the accrued benefits as of the date of such termination
(if and to the extent required by ERISA) to the extent that either there are
sufficient assets set aside in a trust or insurance contract to satisfy such
liability or such liability  



 

31  is reflected on the most recent balance sheet included in the Company
financial statements prior to the date of this Agreement). Neither the
Company, nor to the knowledge of the Company, any other Person or Entity has
any express or implied commitment, whether legally enforceable or not, to
modify, change or terminate any Company Plan, other than with respect to a
modification, change or termination required by ERISA or the Code. No Legal
Proceeding has been brought, or to the knowledge of Company is threatened,
against or with respect to any such Company Plan, including any audit or
inquiry by the IRS or United States Department of Labor. Neither the Company
nor any ERISA Affiliate has any liability under ERISA Section 502\. All
contributions and payments to such Company Plan are deductible under Code
Sections 162 or 404. No excise Tax could reasonably be expected to be
imposed upon the Company under Chapter 43 of the Code.

(e) No Company Plan is a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA) (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ ") or other pension plan subject to Title IV
or Part 3 of Title I of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, and neither the
Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has sponsored, maintained, participated in,
contributed to, or has been required to participate in or contribute to a
Multiemployer Plan or other pension plan subject to Title IV or Part 3 of
Title I of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. None of the assets of Company or
any ERISA Affiliate is, or may reasonably be expected to become, the subject
of any Encumbrance arising under ERISA or Section 412(n) of the Code.

(f) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will result in any payment,
acceleration or creation of any rights of any Person to benefits under any
Company Plan. No amount that could be received (whether in cash, property, the
vesting of property or otherwise) as a result of or in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone
or in combination with any other event) or by any of the ancillary
agreements, by any employee, officer, director or other service provider of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries who is a "disqualified
individual" (as such term is defined in proposed Treasury Regulation Section
1.280G-1) could be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as defined
in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code).

(g) Except as required by applicable Legal Requirements, no Company Plan
provides any of the following retiree or post-employment benefits to
any Person: medical, disability or life insurance benefits. No Company Plan
is a voluntary employee benefit association under Section 501(a)(9) of the
Code. The Company and each ERISA Affiliate is in compliance in all material
respects with (i) the requirements of the applicable health care continuation
and notice provisions of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of
1985, as amended, and the regulations (including proposed regulations)
thereunder and any similar state law and (ii) the applicable requirements of
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended,
and the regulations (including the proposed regulations) thereunder.

(h) Except as set forth in Part 3.21(h) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no
Company Plan or payment or benefit provided pursuant to any Company Plan
between the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries and any "service
provider" (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code), including the
grant, vesting or exercise of any stock option or stock  



 

32  appreciation right, will or may provide for the deferral of compensation
subject to Section 409A of the Code, whether pursuant to the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or
subsequent events) or otherwise. Each Company Plan that is a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan subject to Section 409A of the Code has been
operated and administered in good faith compliance with Section 409A of the
Code from the period beginning January 1, 2005 and continuing through the date
hereof. All stock options granted under the Company Option Plans have been
granted in compliance with the terms of applicable Legal Requirements and the
applicable Company Option Plans and have (or with respect to such options
which have been exercised as of the date of this Agreement, had) a per share
exercise price that is (or with respect to such options which have been
exercised as of the date of this Agreement, was) at least equal to the fair
market value of a share of the underlying stock as of the date the option was
granted (determined in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements,
including, to the extent applicable, Section 409A of the Code).

(i) The Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries have properly classified
all individuals providing services to the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries as employees or non-employees for all relevant purposes.

 

(j) With respect to each employee benefit plan, program, or other arrangement
providing compensation or benefits to any employee or former employee of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (or any dependent thereof) which is
subject to the Legal Requirements of any jurisdiction outside of the United
States (the " _Foreign Plans_ "): (i) such Foreign Plan has been maintained
in all material respects in accordance with all applicable Legal Requirements,
(ii) if intended to qualify for special Tax treatment, such Foreign Plan meets
all Legal Requirements for such treatment, (iii) if intended or required to
be funded and/or book-reserved, such Foreign Plan is fully funded and/or book
reserved, as appropriate, based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions, and
(iv) no material liability exists or reasonably could be imposed upon
the assets of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries by reason of
such Foreign Plan.

(k) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Offer and the Merger: (i) will not materially increase the benefits payable by
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries under any Company Plan; and
(ii) will not result in any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of
any material benefits payable by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries under any Company Plan.

(l) The Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held or by a duly executed
action by unanimous written consent, has determined that each of the members
of the Compensation Committee of the Company Board (the "
_Compensation Committee_ ") are, and the Company represents and warrants that
each of the members of the Compensation Committee are and at the Acceptance
Time will be, "independent directors" as defined in Rule 4200(a)(15) of the
Nasdaq Marketplace Rules and eligible to serve on the Compensation Committee
under the Exchange Act and all applicable Marketplace Rules of the NASDAQ
Global Select Market. On or prior to the date hereof, the Compensation
Committee, at a meeting duly called and held or by a duly executed action by
unanimous written consent, approved each Company Compensation Arrangement as
an "employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit  



 

33  arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under the Exchange Act
(an " _Employment Compensation Arrangement_ "), and has taken all other
action necessary to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor
with respect to such Company Compensation Arrangements in accordance with Rule
14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act.

3.22 Labor Matters.

(a) There are no Legal Proceedings pending against the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries asserting that the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries has committed an unfair labor practice, nor are have any such
Legal Proceedings been threatened to the knowledge of the Company. There are
no collective bargaining agreements or other labor union agreements to which
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party, and, to the
knowledge of the Company, as of the date of this Agreement, neither the
Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is the subject of any Legal
Proceeding seeking to compel any of them to bargain with any labor
organization as to wages or conditions. To the Companys knowledge,
since January 1, 2004, neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries was the subject of any labor union organizing activity or had any
actual or threatened employee strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns or lockouts.

(b) The Company and each Company Subsidiary has materially complied and is in
material compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements with respect to
employment, immigration, occupational health and safety, and wages and hours.
There are no Legal Proceedings pending, or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened, against the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries with
respect to employment, immigration, occupational health and safety, or wages
and hours and that would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in Part 3.22(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party
to or bound by any Contract limiting the right of the Company to terminate the
employment of any of its Executives at will or requiring the payment of
severance upon termination.

(c) To the Companys knowledge, there has not been a representation question

the last three years, and no such labor strike, slow-down, or other concerted

(d) To the Companys knowledge, no employee of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries are in any material respect in violation of any term of
any employment agreement, non-disclosure agreement, noncompetition agreement,
or any restrictive covenant to a former employer relating to the right of any
such employee to be employed by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries because of (i) the nature of the business conducted or presently
proposed to be conducted by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or
(ii) the use of trade secrets or proprietary information of others. No
Executive of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries has given notice
to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries that  



 

34  any such Executive intends to terminate his or her employment with the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries. Except as set forth in Part
3.22(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no Legal Proceedings
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, between the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries and any of their respective current or
former employees, which Legal Proceedings would reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect, individually or collectively.

3.23 Environmental Matters. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries are in
material compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws. Since January 1,
2003, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries received any
written notice from a Governmental Entity or third party that alleged that
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries was materially violating any
Environmental Law. To the knowledge of the Company, no current or prior owner
of any property leased or controlled by the Company or any of the Company

the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries was materially violating any
Environmental Law. The Company has all the Environmental Permits necessary for
the conduct and operation of the business as now being conducted, and all such
permits are in good standing. Neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries has entered into or agreed to any material consent decree, order
or agreement under any Environmental Law, and neither the Company nor any of
the Company Subsidiaries is subject to any material judgment, decree or order

owned or leased by the Company or a Company Subsidiary. To the knowledge of
the Company, there are no above-ground storage tanks on, under or about any
property currently or previously owned or leased by the Company, the presence
of which would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. True and correct summaries of all environmental audits or assessments
which have been conducted by or on behalf of the Company at any Owned Real
Property or Leased Real Property, have been delivered to Parent or Purchaser.

(For purposes of this _Section 3.23_, " _Environmental Laws_ " shall mean
any and all applicable international, federal, state, or local laws, statutes,
ordinances, regulations, policies, guidance, rules, judgments, orders, court
decisions or rule of common law, permits, restrictions and licenses, which

35 3.24 Insurance. The Company maintains insurance coverage with reputable and
financially sound insurers, or maintains self-insurance practices, in such
amounts and covering such risks of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as

that are engaged in businesses similar to that of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries (taking into account the cost and availability of such
insurance). All such policies are in full force and effect, all premiums due
and payable have been paid, and since January 1, 2005, the Company has not
received any written communication notifying the Company of any: (a)

under any material insurance policy held by the Company; or (c) material

Company nor any Company Subsidiary is in material breach or default, and
neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has taken any action or failed
to take any action which, with notice or the lapse of time, would constitute
such a breach or default, or permit termination or material modification of
any of the insurance policies. The consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not, in and of itself, cause the
revocation, cancellation or termination of any such insurance policies.

3.25 Transactions with Affiliates. To the knowledge of the Company, between
the date of the Companys last proxy statement filed with the SEC and the date
of this Agreement, no event has occurred that would be required to be
reported by the Company pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by
the SEC.

3.26 Vote Required. If required under applicable Legal Requirements in order
to permit the consummation of the Merger, the affirmative vote of the holders
of a majority of the Company Shares outstanding on the record date for the
Special Meeting is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of the
Companys capital stock necessary to adopt this Agreement or consummate the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the
Merger.

3.27 Section 203 of the DGCL; Company Rights Agreement. The Company Board has
taken all action necessary to render Section 203 of the DGCL inapplicable to
the Offer, the Top-Up Option, and the Merger and all of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company has amended the Company Rights
Agreement to provide that neither Parent nor Purchaser shall be deemed to be
an Acquiring Person (as such term is defined in the Company Rights
Agreement), that neither a Distribution Date nor a Stock Acquisition Date (as
such terms are defined in the Company Rights Agreement) shall be deemed to
occur and that the Company Rights will not separate from the Company Shares
as a result of the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement, and
that the Company Rights shall terminate in accordance with the Company Rights
Agreement immediately prior to the Effective Time.



 

36 3.28 Opinion of Financial Advisor. The Company Board has received the opinion
of Goldman, Sachs and Co. to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion
and subject to various qualifications and assumptions, the Offer Price is
fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Company Shares, and
such opinion has not been modified or withdrawn prior to the date of this
Agreement.

3.29 Brokers. No broker, finder or investment banker (other than Goldman,
Sachs and Co.) is entitled to any brokerage, finders or other similar fee or
commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of the Company. The Company has
delivered to Parent complete and correct copies of all Contracts under which
any such fees or commissions are payable and all indemnification and other
Contracts related to the engagement of the Persons to whom such fees are
payable. The methodology, basis and formula for calculating fees and expenses
of any accountant, broker, financial advisor, consultant, legal counsel, proxy
solicitor or other Person retained by or on behalf of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby are set forth in Part 3.29 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.

SECTION 4. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND PURCHASER

Parent and Purchaser hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant to
the Company that:

4.1 Due Organization. Each of Parent and Purchaser is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of Delaware
and has all requisite corporate power and authority necessary to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted except where the failure to be so
organized, existing or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate,
would not be reasonably likely to prevent or materially delay the consummation
of any of the transactions contemplated herein. Since its date of
incorporation, Purchaser has not carried on any business or conducted any
operations other than the execution of this Agreement, the performance of its
obligations hereunder and matters ancillary thereto.

4.2 Authority; Binding Nature of Agreement. Parent has the requisite
corporate power and authority to enter into and to perform its obligations
under this Agreement. The board of directors of Parent, at a meeting duly
called and held, has authorized and approved the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by Parent. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Parent and the consummation by Parent of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of Parent, and no other corporate proceedings on
the part of Parent are necessary to authorize this Agreement. This Agreement
has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and, assuming the
due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company,
constitutes the valid and binding obligation of Parent, enforceable against
Parent in accordance with its terms, subject to: (i) laws of general
application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency and the relief of debtors; and
(ii) rules of law governing specific performance, injunctive relief and other
equitable remedies. Purchaser is a newly formed, wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Parent and has the requisite corporate power and authority to enter into and
to perform its obligations under this Agreement. The board of directors of
Purchaser has authorized and approved the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement by Purchaser. The execution and delivery of this  



 

37  Agreement by Purchaser and the consummation by Purchaser of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of Purchaser, and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of Purchaser are necessary to authorize this Agreement
other than, with respect to the Merger, the filing of the appropriate merger
documents as required by the DGCL. Parent, as the sole stockholder of
Purchaser, will vote to adopt this Agreement immediately after the execution
and delivery of this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Purchaser and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company, constitutes the valid and binding
obligation of Purchaser, enforceable against Purchaser in accordance with its
terms, subject to: (1) laws of general application relating to bankruptcy,
insolvency and the relief of debtors; and (2) rules of law governing specific
performance, injunctive relief and other equitable remedies.

4.3 Non-Contravention; Consents. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
by Parent and Purchaser, and the consummation by Parent or Purchaser of the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
will not: (a) cause a violation of any of the provisions of the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of Parent or Purchaser; or (b) cause a violation by
Parent or Purchaser of any Legal Requirement applicable to Parent or
Purchaser; except in the case of clause (b) as would not be reasonably likely
to prevent or materially delay the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated herein. Except as may be required by the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, the DGCL, the HSR Act or the antitrust or competition laws of
foreign jurisdictions, Parent is not required to make any filing with or to
obtain any consent from any Person in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Parent or Purchaser or the consummation by
Parent or Purchaser of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except where the failure to make any such filing or obtain any such consent
would not be reasonably likely to prevent or materially delay the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated herein. No vote of
Parents stockholders is necessary to adopt this Agreement or to approve any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

4.4 Not an Interested Stockholder. Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates is
an "interested stockholder" (as such term is defined in Section 203 of DGCL)
of the Company.

4.5 Financing. Parent has available cash resources and financing in an
amount sufficient to enable Purchaser to purchase Company Shares pursuant to
the Offer and to consummate the Merger. Without limiting the foregoing: (a)
Purchaser has delivered to the Company a true and complete copy of an executed
commitment letter dated March 24, 2007 from Morgan Stanley Senior Funding,
Inc. and CitiGroup Global Market, Inc. (the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ "),
pursuant to which the lender parties thereto have committed, subject to the
terms and conditions thereof, to lend the amounts set forth therein for the
purpose of funding the consideration payable by Parent and the Purchaser in
respect of the Company Shares and Company Options (the " _Debt Financing_ ").
As of the date of this Agreement: (i) the Debt Commitment Letter has not been
amended or modified; and (ii) none of the commitments contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter has been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. There are no
conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding by such
lenders of the full amount of the Debt Financing, other than as set forth in
or contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date of this
Agreement, and assuming the accuracy of the Companys representations set
forth in this Agreement and the Companys compliance with its  



 

38  covenants set forth in this Agreement, in each case such that the conditions
to the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter are
satisfied, neither Parent nor Purchaser has any reason to believe that it
will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition to be
satisfied by it contained in the Debt Commitment Letter. Parent or Purchaser
will fully pay any and all commitment fees that are incurred and are due and
payable in connection with the Debt Financing as and when they become payable.

4.6 Ownership of Company Shares. Neither Parent nor any of Parents
Affiliates directly or indirectly owns, and at all times since January 1, 2005
neither Parent nor any of Parents Affiliates directly or indirectly has
owned, beneficially or otherwise, any Company Shares or any securities,
contracts or obligations convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for
Company Shares.

4.7 Offer Documents. The Offer Documents will comply as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act. On the date filed
with the SEC, on the date first published, sent or given to holders of
Company Shares or at any other time at or prior to the Acceptance Time, the
Offer Documents will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, except that no representation, warranty
or covenant is made by Parent or Purchaser with respect to statements made or
incorporated therein based on any written information supplied by the Company
expressly for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents.

4.8 Information in Schedule 14D-9 and Proxy Statement. None of the written
information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of Parent expressly for
inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9 will, at the time the Schedule 14D-9 is mailed
to the stockholders of the Company, or at any other time at or prior to the
Acceptance Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading. If the Special Meeting is to be held pursuant
to _Section 5.4_, none of the written information supplied or to be supplied
by or on behalf of Parent expressly for inclusion in the Proxy Statement
will, at the time the Proxy Statement is mailed to the stockholders of the
Company or at the time of the Special Meeting (or any adjournment or
postponement thereof), contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading.

solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage, knowingly induce or knowingly
facilitate the making, submission or announcement of an Acquisition Proposal
or Acquisition Inquiry; (ii) furnish to any Person any non-public information
relating to the Company in response to or in connection with an

understood that the foregoing shall not prohibit the Company from furnishing,
in the Ordinary Course of Business, any non-public information to (A) any
actual or potential customer, supplier, distributor, licensor,  



 

44  licensee, partner or other Person to the extent necessary to facilitate any
business dealings between the Company and such actual or potential

that are unrelated to any Acquisition Proposal or any Acquisition Inquiry and
are not prohibited by the terms of _Section 5.1_, or (B) a Governmental
Entity); (iii) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with any
Person with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry (for
avoidance of doubt, it being understood that the foregoing shall not prohibit
the Company or any of its advisors or representatives from making such Person

through its Representatives, (A) engage or participate in discussions or
negotiations with any Person (and may engage or participate in discussions or
negotiations with such Persons Representatives and potential financing
sources) that has (1) made a bona fide Acquisition Proposal in writing that
the Company Board determines in good faith After Consultation constitutes or
is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (2) to the extent the
Company is prohibited from disclosing such discussions or negotiations or the
information exchanged in connection therewith, provided the Company with
written acknowledgement that such discussions or negotiations and the
information exchanged in connection therewith will be disclosed to Parent and
its Representatives, and (B) furnish to any such Person described in clause
(A) above (including to such Persons Representatives and potential financing
sources) any non-public information relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement (whether executed before
or after the date of this Agreement), the terms of which are no less favorable
in any material respect to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement ( _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt such
Confidentiality Agreement is not required to contain standstill provisions)
(it being understood that none of the actions described in this proviso,
shall, to the extent taken in accordance with this proviso, be prohibited by
the preceding terms of this _Section 5.2(a)_); and _provided further_ , that
in the case of any action taken pursuant to clause (A) or clause (B) above,
(1) the Company Board received such Acquisition Proposal other than as a
result of a breach or violation of the terms of this _Section 5.2_, (2) the
Company Board shall first have determined in good faith, After Consultation,
that the failure to take such action does or would reasonably be likely to
constitute a breach of its fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders
under applicable Legal Requirements; (3) at least 48 hours prior to initially
engaging or participating in any such discussions or negotiations with, or
initially furnishing any non-public information to, such Person, the Company
gives Parent written notice of the identity of such Person and all of the
material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and of the
Companys intention to engage or participate in discussions or negotiations
with, or furnish non-public information to, such Person, and (4)
contemporaneously with furnishing any non-public information to such Person,
the Company furnishes such non-public information to Parent (to the extent
such information has not been previously furnished by the Company to Parent).
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company acknowledges
and agrees that if any Company Subsidiary or Representative of the Company or
Company Subsidiary (whether or not such Person is purporting to act on behalf
of the Company) takes any action that, if taken by the Company,
would constitute a breach of this _Section 5.2(a)_ by the Company, then such
action shall be deemed to constitute a breach of this _Section 5.2(a)_ by the
Company.



 

45 (b) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in _Section
5.2(a)_ hereof, the Company shall promptly, and in all cases within one
business day of its receipt, advise Parent orally (to be confirmed in writing
as soon as practicable thereafter) of the receipt by the Company of any
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry, including the material terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry and the
identity of the Person or group making any such Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Inquiry. The Company shall keep Parent informed as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within 24 hours) of any material change in the
status of or material change in the proposed terms and conditions of
(including all material amendments or proposed material amendments to), any
such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry. In fulfilling its

(i) agrees not to release or permit the release of any Person from, or to
waive or permit the waiver of any provision of, any confidentiality,
standstill or similar agreement to which the Company is a party or under
which the Company has any rights and (ii) will use its best efforts to enforce
or cause to be enforced each such agreement at the request of Parent;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the expiration or termination of such agreement
or provision of such agreement by its own terms shall not be considered to be
a violation of the foregoing clause "(i)" or "(ii)" by the Company. The
Company also shall promptly (but in no event later than five business days
after the execution of this Agreement) request each Person that since January
1, 2005 has executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its
consideration of a possible Acquisition Transaction or equity investment in

third party shall have been publicly announced or shall otherwise have become
public ( _provided_ that Parent may not make such a request on more than one
occasion with respect to any particular Acquisition Proposal unless, since any
prior such request by Parent, the price or other material terms of such

order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders
in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements, (ii) prior to effecting
such Company Change in Recommendation, the Company provides to Parent a
written notice (a " _Notice of Recommendation Change_ ") at least three

available funds, any amounts due to Parent pursuant to _Section 7.3_.

(d) Without limiting any rights or remedies of Parent or Purchaser set forth

of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any

of the Company Board that stockholders of the Company vote in favor of the

responses thereto. Parent, Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review any such written responses and the Company

to and be consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made
or submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding.

(c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in _Section 5.5(a)_
or _5.4(b)_ , but subject thereto, Parent and Purchaser shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause all Offer Conditions to be satisfied
on a timely basis (to the extent the satisfaction of such Offer Conditions is
within Parents or Purchasers direct or indirect control) and to cause
Purchaser to purchase Company Shares pursuant to the Offer on the earliest
possible date.

5.6 Access. Upon reasonable notice, the Company shall, and shall cause its

during normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective
Time, to its books and records and, during such period, the Company shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Parent all readily
available information concerning its business as Parent may reasonably
request; _provided, however_ , that none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to permit any inspection or other access, or to

document filed by it or its Subsidiaries during such period pursuant to the
requirements of federal or state securities Legal Requirements to the extent
that such report, schedule, registration statement or other document is not

and make public statements consistent with such materials during the road
show, without any further consultation, approval, review or commentary from
the Company or its counsel.

5.9 Stock Options/ESPP.

(a) Pursuant to this Agreement, each Company Option outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall become fully vested and exercisable at the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that, to the extent consistent with
applicable Legal Requirements, any Company Option held by a person who,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, does not have a status that entitles
such person to accrue service towards increased vesting in such Company
Option (such as a person on a leave of absence or a part-time employee) shall
not become fully vested and exercisable unless and until such person returns
to a status that would entitle such person to accrue service towards
increased vesting in such Company Option. Except as provided in _Section
5.9(b)_ below, each Company Option outstanding as of the Effective Time shall
be assumed by Parent and converted into a fully vested and exercisable option
to acquire Parent Shares (any Company Options that are assumed pursuant to
this _Section_  



 

51   _5.9(a)_ are referred to as the " _Assumed Options_ "). Each Assumed Option
shall continue to be subject to the terms and conditions (other than vesting
and exercisability terms as modified by this _Section 5.9(a)_) set forth in
the applicable Company Option Plan and the option agreement evidencing such
Company Option, except that the exercise price and number of Parent
Shares subject to each Assumed Option shall be determined as follows: (i) the
number of Parent Shares subject to such Assumed Option shall be equal to the
product of (x) the number of Company Shares subject to the original Company
Option and (y) the Share Ratio, with fractional shares rounded down to the
nearest whole share and (ii) the per-share exercise price of such Assumed
Option shall be equal to the product of (x) the per-share exercise price of
the original Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y)
the Price Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. The Company shall,
prior to the Acceptance Time, take all action and give any notices necessary
to effect the treatment of the Assumed Options contemplated by this _Section
5.9(a)_, including ensuring that the Compensation Committee has duly approved
the accelerated vesting and assumption of the Assumed Options as an Employment
Compensation Arrangement. It is the intention of the parties that, to the
extent possible under the circumstances, each Assumed Option shall qualify
following the Effective Time as an incentive stock option as defined in
Section 422 of the Code to the extent such Assumed Option qualified as an
incentive stock option prior to the Effective Time, _provided_ that the
parties acknowledge and agree that Assumed Options will not qualify under
Section 422 of the Code if the Parent Share Price at the Effective Time
is less than the Parent Share Price on the date hereof.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 5.9(a)_ above, in
the event that the conversion of a Company Option as set forth in _Section
5.9(a)_ above would result in a per-share exercise price of the corresponding
Assumed Option of less than three percent (3%) of the Parent Share Price at
the Effective Time, then such Company Option shall be cancelled and terminated
in exchange for a cash payment (without interest) equal to the aggregate
excess, if any, of the Offer Price over the exercise price of such Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall, prior to
the Acceptance Time, take all action and give any notices necessary to effect
the treatment of the Company Options contemplated by this _Section 5.9(b)_,
including ensuring that the Compensation Committee has duly approved the
accelerated vesting and cash settlement of such Company Options as an
Employment Compensation Arrangement.

(c) The Company shall amend the Company ESPP, as necessary, (i) to provide
that prior to the Effective Time, outstanding purchase rights under the
Company ESPP shall be exercised in accordance with the terms of the Company
ESPP and each Company Share purchased pursuant to such exercise shall by
virtue of the Merger, and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
and (ii) to provide that, as and after the date hereof, no further offering
periods or purchase periods shall commence.

(d) Parent shall file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as soon as
practicable, but in no event later than 10 business days, following the
Effective Time, a registration statement on Form S-8 with respect to Parent
Shares issuable under any Assumed Options issued under this _Section 5.9_
and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of
such registration statement for as long as there are any Parent Shares
issuable thereunder.



 

52 5.10 Other Employee Benefits.

(a) Following the Effective Time, any employee who as of the Effective Time is
employed by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (referred to herein
individually as a " _Continuing Employee_ " and collectively as the "
_Continuing Employees_ ") shall continue in the employment of the Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Parent or
Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time, _provided_ , that to the
extent such employment was "at-will" immediately prior to the Effective Time,
such employment shall continue to be at-will and subject to termination at any
time for any or no reason. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to
create a right in any Continuing Employee to employment with Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective Subsidiaries. For the period
beginning on the Effective Time through the end of the calendar year in which
the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to
each Continuing Employee compensation and employee benefits under either the
Company Plans or under employee benefit plans and programs of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
(the " _Parent Plans_ "), or under any combination of the Company Plans and
the Parent Plans.

(b) With respect to any Parent Plans that provide group medical, dental,
disability or prescription drug coverage in which any Continuing Employees
become eligible to participate after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries to: (i)
waive (to the extent such Parent Plan is self-insured), or use
commercially reasonable efforts to waive (to the extent such Parent Plan is
insured), any exclusions for pre-existing conditions under such Parent Plans
that would result in a lack of coverage for any condition for which the
applicable Continuing Employee would have been entitled to coverage under the
corresponding Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee was an active
participant immediately before his or her transfer to the Parent Plan; (ii)
waive any coverage waiting periods under any such Parent Plans to the extent
that such periods exceed the corresponding waiting period under the
corresponding Company Plan in which any applicable Continuing Employee was an
active participant immediately before his or her transfer to any such
Parent Plans (after taking into account any prior service with the Company or
its Subsidiaries credited under such Company Plan for purposes of satisfying
such waiting period); (iii) provide each applicable Continuing Employee with
credit for any co-payments deductibles and premiums for voluntary coverage
paid by such Continuing Employee before his or her transfer to any such Parent
Plans (to the same extent such credit was given under the analogous Company
Plans before such transfer) in satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-
pocket requirements or coverage levels under any such Parent Plans for the
plan year that includes such transfer; _provided_ that, such Continuing
Employee shall be responsible for any applicable co-payments or premiums for
voluntary coverage required to be made under such Parent Plans, and (iv)
provide each applicable Continuing Employee with credit for any unused account
balance in each Company Plan that includes a flexible spending account before
his or her transfer to any analogous Parent Plan for the plan year that
includes such transfer.

(c) Following the Effective Time, Continuing Employees shall be eligible to
participate in a qualified cash or deferred arrangement or arrangements under
Section 401(k) of the Code sponsored by Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent for
the benefit of their eligible employees, _provided_ that Continuing Employees
shall not be entitled to receive credit for past  



 

53  service with the Company or its Subsidiaries for purposes of determining the
amount of company contributions or vesting under any qualified
defined contribution or defined benefit retirement plans sponsored or
maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or their respective
Subsidiaries. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Continuing
Employees shall not be eligible to participate in any Parent Plans under
which new Parent employees are not currently eligible to participate.

(d) Following the Effective Time, Continuing Employees shall receive credit
for past service (calculated under the method applicable to Parents
similarly-situated employees) with the Company and its Subsidiaries for
purposes of eligibility to participate in the generally applicable severance
plan currently maintained by Parent for its and its Subsidiaries employees,
_provided_ that Continuing Employees shall be required to enter into Parents
standard release as a condition to the receipt of any benefits under Parents
severance plan and shall not be entitled to receive the additional severance
benefits under such plan otherwise provided in consideration for entering into
a release. Continuing Employees covered by a Company Plan providing severance
benefits following a change of control shall be covered by such Company Plan
according to its terms, and following the period of coverage in such Company
Plan, shall participate in the generally applicable severance plan currently
maintained by Parent for its and its Subsidiaries employees according to the
preceding sentence.

(e) Following the Effective Time, Continuing Employees shall be entitled to
carryover or otherwise receive credit under any applicable Parent Plans they
may participate in for any vacation days, sick days, or other paid time off
that is accrued but unused at the Effective Time under the Company Plans.
Vacation days, sick days, or other paid time off that is accrued but unused at
the Effective Time under the Company Plans shall not be reduced as of the
Effective Time, but accruals of Continuing Employees following the Effective
Time may be limited to comply with the applicable policies and programs of
Parent and its Subsidiaries.

(f) Except as specifically provided in this _Section 5.10_, Continuing
Employees shall not receive credit for past service with the Company or its
Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility to participate in or receive benefits
under any Parent Plans.

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.10_: (i) shall be construed to
establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement, (ii) shall alter or limit Parents ability to amend, modify or
terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time
assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by Parent, (iii) is intended to
confer upon any current or former employee any right to employment or
continued employment for any period of time by reason of this Agreement, or
any right to a particular term or condition of employment, or (iv) is
intended to confer upon any individual (including employees, retirees, or
dependents or beneficiaries of employees or retirees) any right as a third-
party beneficiary of this Agreement.

5.11 Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance.

(a) From and after the Acceptance Time, Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to honor in all respects the obligations of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries pursuant to (i) each indemnification agreement in effect
on the date of this  



 

54  Agreement between the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries and any
Indemnified Party; and (ii) any indemnification provision and any
exculpation provision in favor of an Indemnified Party that is set forth in
the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company and the equivalent
organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary in effect as of the date of
this Agreement.

 

(b) Through the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent will cause
Surviving Corporation to be maintain in effect, for the benefit of the
Companys directors and officers that are insured under the Companys current
directors and officers liability insurance policy in effect as of the date
of this Agreement (the " _D andO Insurance Policy_"), the current level and
scope of directors and officers liability insurance coverage as set forth in
the DandO Insurance Policy; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall the
Surviving Corporation be required pursuant to this  _Section 5.11(b)_ to
expend an aggregate amount in excess of 200% of the annual premium currently
payable by the Company with respect to such current DandO Insurance Policy, it
being understood that if the annual premiums payable for such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost equal to such
amount. At any time prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company may purchase, and
shall purchase at the request of Parent, a "tail" prepaid policy on the DandO
Insurance Policy covering a period of six years from the Effective Time; 
_provided_ that the aggregate amount of such "tail" policy is less than 200%
of the annual premium currently payable by the Company with respect to its
current DandO Insurance Policy. In the event that the Company shall
purchase such a "tail" policy prior to the Effective Time, Parent will cause
the Surviving Corporation to maintain such "tail" policy in full force and
effect and continue to honor its respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of
all other obligations of Parent under the first sentence of this _Section
5.11(b)_ for so long as such "tail" policy shall be maintained in full force
and effect.

(c) This _Section 5.11_ shall survive the Acceptance Time and shall also
survive consummation of the Merger and the Effective Time. This  _Section
5.11_ is intended to benefit, and may be enforced by, the Indemnified Parties
and their respective heirs, representatives, successors and assigns, and shall
be binding on all successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation. In the
event of any merger, consolidation or other similar transaction involving the
Surviving Corporation, or in the event of any sale by the Surviving
Corporation of all or substantially all of its assets, the Surviving
Corporation shall ensure that an Entity no less financially viable than the
Surviving Corporation remains responsible for the obligations of the Surviving
Corporation under this _Section 5.11_.

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, each individual who is an officer or
director of the Company at the date of this Agreement or was an officer or
director of the Company within the six years prior to the date of this
Agreement shall be deemed to be an " _Indemnified Party_."

5.12 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company
shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of

its Compensation Committee) will take all such steps as may be required to

such officer, director or employee to be approved as an Employment
Compensation Arrangement and to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive
safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) of the Exchange Act. 

5.14 Cooperation Regarding Transition of Business. After the Acceptance Time,

to cooperate with Parent in the planning and preparation of the integration of
the Companys and Parents business, including with respect to the matters

to approve and effect the termination of any and all Company Plans intended
to qualify as a qualified cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of

including using commercially reasonable efforts to (a) maintain in effect the

Purchaser as the financing conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter.
In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter for any
reason, Parent and the Purchaser shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain alternative financing on terms no less favorable
to Purchaser than the Debt Financing from alternative sources (" _Alternative
Financing_ ") as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such
event. For the avoidance of doubt, Parents and the Purchasers obligation
to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement are not (and shall not be) subject to any financing
condition.

pocket expenses incurred by the Company or its Affiliates or Representatives
