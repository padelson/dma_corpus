Time, subject and pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the
holders of any shares of capital stock of the Company or Merger Sub:   (a)
Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of Merger Sub
Common Stock shall be converted into and exchanged for a one share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the
only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.  
(b) [Intentionally Omitted.]   (c) Exchange Ratio for Company Stock. Each
share of Company Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares), shall, subject to Section
3.1(d), be converted into the right to receive a number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (the
"Merger Consideration"). At the Effective Time, all such shares of Company
Stock shall no longer be outstanding, and shall automatically be cancelled
and retired and cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing
any such shares of Company Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificate in
accordance with Section 3.2, without interest. No fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock shall be issued; and, in lieu thereof, a cash payment shall be
made pursuant to Section 3.2(e).   (d) Adjustment of Exchange Ratio for
Dilution and Other Matters. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Company
Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization,
reorganization, split-up, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable
for, Parent Common Stock or Company Stock), stock combination, exchange of
shares, readjustment or otherwise, as the case may be, then the Exchange
Ratio and the Merger Consideration shall, without duplication, be
correspondingly adjusted.   (e) Right to Waive Merger Consideration. (i)
Notwithstanding any other provisions in this Agreement, any holder of shares
of Company Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time that would otherwise be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 3.1(c) may elect, by delivery of written notice to the
Company   7    prior to the Effective Time, to waive issuance of the
Merger Consideration in respect of such holder\'s shares of Company Stock, in
which case, such shares of Company Stock shall be cancelled and retired and
cease to exist as of the Effective Time and no shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued in the Merger in respect thereof.   (ii) Parent hereby
elects to waive issuance of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
3.1(c) in respect of all of the shares of Company Common Stock and Company
Class B Common Stock issued and outstanding and held by Parent immediately
prior to the Effective Time.   3.2 Exchange of Certificates.   (a)
Exchange Agent. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select the Bank of
New York or another bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Company to act as exchange agent in the Merger (the "Exchange Agent"). Prior
to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the
benefit of the holders of shares of Company Stock, for exchange in accordance
with this Article 3, certificates representing the shares of Parent Common
Stock (such shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto, the "Exchange Fund") issuable pursuant to
Section 3.1(c) at the Effective Time in exchange for outstanding shares of
Company Stock, which shall include such shares of Parent Common Stock to be
sold by the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 3.2(e).   (b) Exchange
Procedures. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record (other than the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub and any wholly owned subsidiary of the Company)
of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented issued and outstanding shares of Company Stock (collectively, the
"Certificates") whose shares were converted into the right to receive Parent
Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.1(c), (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent and the Company may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates
representing Parent Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such
other documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
a certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this
Article 3 and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock,
and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event
of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Stock which is not registered
on the transfer records of the Company, a certificate representing the proper
number of shares of Parent Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued and paid to a transferee if the
Certificate representing such Company Stock is presented to the
Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to  
8     evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 3.2, each Certificate shall be deemed, from and
after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock and cash
in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as contemplated by
this Article 3 and the WBCA. The consideration to be issued in the Merger
will be delivered by the Exchange Agent as promptly as practicable following
surrender of a Certificate and any other required documents. No interest will
be payable on such consideration, regardless of any delay in making
payments.   (c) Distributions with Respect to Unsurrendered Certificates.
No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time
with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective
Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with
respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash
payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder
pursuant to Section 3.2(e) until the holder of record of such Certificate
shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect, if any, of
applicable laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be
paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of
Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor or such holder\'s transferee
pursuant to Section 3.2(e), without interest, (i) at the time of such
surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of
Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
3.2(e) and the amount of dividends or other distributions on Parent Common
Stock with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with
respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at
the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions
on Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but prior
to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect
to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.   (d) No Further Ownership
Rights in Company Stock. All shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon the
surrender for exchange of shares of Company Stock in accordance with the
terms of this Article 3 (plus any cash paid pursuant to Section 3.2(c) or
3.2(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Stock. From and after the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with
respect to the shares of Company Capital Stock, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company or the
Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Capital Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason,
they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article 3.   (e)
No Issuance of Fractional Shares.   (i) No certificates or scrip for
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender
for exchange of Certificates, and such fractional share interests will not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of
Parent.    9     (ii) As promptly as practicable following the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of (A) the
number of full shares of Parent Common Stock delivered to the Exchange Agent
by Parent pursuant to Section 3.2(a) over (B) the aggregate number of full
shares of Parent Common Stock to be distributed to holders of Company Stock
pursuant to Section 3.2(b) (such excess, the "Excess Shares"). As soon after
the Effective Time as practicable, the Exchange Agent, as agent for the
holders of Company Stock, shall sell the Excess Shares at then prevailing
prices in the over-the-counter market, all in the manner provided in clause
(iii) of this Section 3.2(e).   (iii) The sale of the Excess Shares by the
Exchange Agent shall be executed in the over-the-counter market through one
or more member firms of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
(the "NASD") and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable.
Until the net proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to the
holders of Company Stock, the Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds in trust
for the holders of Company Stock (the "Common Shares Trust"). Parent shall
pay all commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction
costs, including the expenses and compensation of the Exchange Agent incurred
in connection with such sale of the Excess Shares. The Exchange Agent shall
determine the portion of the Common Shares Trust to which each holder of
Company Stock shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the
aggregate net proceeds comprising the Common Shares Trust by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share interest to which
such holder of Company Stock is entitled and the denominator of which is the
aggregate amount of fractional share interests to which all holders of
Company Stock are entitled.   (iv) As soon as practicable after the
determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to the holders of
Company Stock in lieu of any fractional share interests and subject to clause
(v) of this Section 3.2(e), the Exchange Agent shall make available such
amounts to such holders of Company Stock.   (v) Parent or the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of
Company Stock such amounts as Parent or the Exchange Agent is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the shares of Company Stock in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent.   (f)
Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund and Common
Shares Trust that remains undistributed to the stockholders of the Company
for 12 months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon
demand, and any former stockholders of the Company that have not theretofore
complied with this Article 3 shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment
of their claim for Parent Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to
Parent Common Stock.   10      (g) Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding
any other provision contained in this Agreement, no shares of Company Stock
that are issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and that are held by
a stockholder who has properly exercised such stockholder\'s dissenter\'s
rights (any such shares being referred to herein as "Dissenting Shares")
under the WBCA shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 3.1(c) unless and until such stockholder
shall have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost,
such stockholder\'s right to dissent from the Merger under the WBCA and to
receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to
such Dissenting Shares pursuant to and subject to the requirements of the
WBCA. If any holder of Dissenting Shares shall have so failed to perfect or
has effectively withdrawn or lost such stockholder\'s right to dissent from
the Merger as of the Effective Time, each of such holder\'s shares of Company
Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have
become, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. Payments to holders of Dissenting Shares under this Section
3.2(g) shall be made by the Company out of its own funds, no funds shall be
supplied for that purpose, directly or indirectly, by Parent, nor shall
Parent directly or indirectly reimburse the Company for any payments to
holders of Dissenting Shares.   (h) No Liability. Neither the Exchange
Agent, Parent, Merger Sub nor the Company shall be liable to any holder of
shares of Company Stock or Parent Common Stock, as the case may be, for
shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) from the Exchange
Fund or cash from the Common Shares Trust delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.  
(i) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the holder of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates shall execute an affidavit of that fact upon request.
The holder of any such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates shall also
deliver a reasonable indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Parent or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have
been lost, stolen or destroyed. The affidavit and any indemnity that may be
required hereunder shall be delivered to the Exchange Agent, who shall
be responsible for making payment for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate(s).   3.3 Company Stock Options and Other Equity-
Based Awards. (a) Each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (a
"Company Stock Option") granted under the employee and director stock plans
of the Company (the "Company Stock Plans"), whether vested or unvested, that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at the
Effective Time, cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company
Common Stock and shall be converted, at the Effective Time, into an option to
purchase shares of Parent Common Stock (a "Parent Stock Option") on the same
terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Stock Option. The
number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such Parent Stock
Option shall be the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to each
such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied
by the Exchange Ratio, rounded, if necessary, to the nearest whole share of
Parent Common Stock, and such Parent Stock Option shall have an exercise
price per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the per share exercise
price specified in such Company Stock Option divided by the  
11    Exchange Ratio; provided, however, that, in the case of any Company
Stock Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies immediately prior to
the Effective Time by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the
Code, the exercise price, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject
to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall
be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a)
of the Code.   (b) At the Effective Time, each right of any kind, contingent
or accrued, to receive shares of Company Common Stock or benefits measured by
the value of a number of shares of Company Common Stock, and each award of
any kind consisting of shares of Company Common Stock, granted under the
Company Stock Plans (including restricted stock, restricted stock units,
deferred stock units and dividend equivalents), other than Company Stock
Options (each, a "Company Stock-Based Award"), whether vested or unvested,
which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
represent a right or award with respect to shares of Company Common Stock and
shall be converted, at the Effective Time, into a right or award with respect
to Parent Common Stock (a "Parent Stock-Based Award"), on the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under the Company Stock-Based Awards. The
number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such Parent Stock-
Based Award shall be equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to the Company Stock-Based Award, multiplied by the Exchange Ratio,
rounded, if necessary, to the nearest whole share of Parent Common Stock. All
dividend equivalents credited to the account of each holder of a Company
Stock-Based Award as of the Effective Time shall remain credited to such
holder\'s account immediately following the Effective Time, subject to
adjustment in accordance with the foregoing.   (c) As soon as practicable
after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the holders of Company
Stock Options and Company Stock-Based Awards appropriate notices setting
forth such holders\' rights pursuant to the respective Company Stock Plans
and agreements evidencing the grants of such Company Stock Options and the
Company Stock-Based Awards, and stating that such Company Stock Options and
Company Stock-Based Awards and agreements have been assumed by Parent and
shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the
adjustments required by this Section 3.3 after giving effect to the Merger
and the terms of the Company Stock Plans).   (d) Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall take all necessary action for the adjustment of the
Company Stock Options and the Company Stock-Based Awards under this Section
3.3. Parent shall reserve for issuance a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock at least equal to the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that will
be subject to Parent Stock Options and Parent Stock-Based Awards as a result
of the actions contemplated by this Section 3.3. As soon as practicable
following the Effective Time (and in any event not later than two Business
Days following the Effective Time), Parent shall file a registration
statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form, or if Form S-8 is
not available, other appropriate forms) with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to such Parent Stock Options and Parent Stock-Based
Awards and shall maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or
registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses   12     contained therein) for so long as such Parent
Stock Options or Parent Stock- Based Awards remain outstanding.   3.4
Company Warrants. (a) Each warrant to purchase shares of Company Common Stock
(a "Company Compensatory Warrant") granted under the Company Stock Plans and
the Company Optionholder Warrant Agreement, whether vested or unvested, that
is outstanding and held by an employee or officer of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, cease to represent
a right to purchase shares of Company Common Stock and shall, be converted,
at the Effective Time, into a warrant to purchase shares of Parent Common
Stock (a "Parent Compensatory Warrant") on substantially the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under such Company Compensatory Warrant. The
number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such
Parent Compensatory Warrant shall be the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to each such Company Compensatory Warrant immediately prior to
the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded, if necessary,
to the nearest whole share of Parent Common Stock, and such Parent
Compensatory Warrant shall have an exercise price per share (rounded to the
nearest cent) equal to the per share exercise price specified in such Company
Compensatory Warrant divided by the Exchange Ratio.   (b) Each warrant to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock (a "Company Warrant") granted under
the Company Warrant Agreement or any other warrant agreement of the Company
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at the
Effective Time, cease to represent a right to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock and shall be converted, at the Effective Time, into a warrant to
purchase shares of Parent Common Stock (a "Parent Warrant") on substantially
the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Warrant.
The number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such Parent
Warrant shall be the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to each
such Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by
the Exchange Ratio, rounded, if necessary, to the nearest whole share of
Parent Common Stock, and such Parent Warrant shall have an exercise price per
share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the per share exercise price
specified in such Company Warrant divided by the Exchange Ratio.   3.5
Termination of Company ESPP. (a) As of the date hereof, the Company shall
have taken such action as is necessary to provide that (i) only those
employees of the Company and its subsidiaries who have completed Enrollment
Agreements (as defined in the ESPP) for the Current Offering Period (as
defined below) prior to the date hereof (and in all cases prior to
any earlier date as required by the ESPP) shall be eligible to participate in
the Current Offering Period and (ii) after the end of the Current Offering
Period, no further offerings shall commence under the ESPP and the ESPP shall
be terminated effective on the last day of the Current Offering Period. Prior
to the execution hereof, the Company shall provide Parent with all
documentation reasonably necessary to evidence the foregoing actions.   (b)
In the event the Effective Time occurs prior to July 1, 2003: (i) each option
to purchase shares of Company Common Stock under the ESPP for the "offering"
(as used in the ESPP) that commenced as of January 1, 2003 (the "Current
Offering Period") that is   13     outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (an "ESPP Option") shall, at the Effective Time, cease to
represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall be
converted, at the Effective Time, into a right to purchase shares of Parent
Common Stock (a "Parent ESPP Option") on the same terms and conditions as
were applicable under such ESPP Option; (ii) the purchase price per share
under the ESPP shall be the lesser of (A) 85% of the "fair market value" (as
defined in the ESPP) of Company Common Stock on the "offering date" (as
defined in the ESPP) divided by the Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the nearest
whole cent) or (B) 85% of the fair market value of Parent Common Stock on the
last Business Day of the offering, provided, however, that, the purchase
price and the terms and conditions of such option shall be determined in a
manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code; and
(iii) the maximum number of shares issuable under the ESPP shall be adjusted
by multiplying such amount by the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest
whole share).   3.6 Further Assurances. If, at any time after the Effective
Time, any such further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement, or to vest, perfect or confirm of record or
otherwise establish in the Surviving Corporation full right, title and
interest in, to or under any of the assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized in the name and
on behalf of each of the Company and Merger Sub or otherwise to take all such
lawful and reasonably necessary or desirable action.   ARTICLE IV

Company. The Company represents and warrants to Parent as follows:   (a)
Organization and Qualification. Each of the Company and its "Significant
Subsidiaries" (as defined in Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC and which

other entity duly incorporated or organized, validly existing and, to the
extent such concept is legally recognized, in good standing under the laws of
the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, and has the requisite
corporate or other power and authority to own, lease and operate its assets
and properties and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. Each of the Company and its Significant Subsidiaries is in
possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits,
easements, consents, certificates, approvals and orders necessary to own,
lease and operate the properties it purports to own, operate or lease and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure
to have such franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits,
easements, consents, certificates, approvals and orders would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Each of the Company and its subsidiaries is, as applicable, duly qualified or
licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing, to
the extent such concept is legally recognized, in each jurisdiction where the
character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of
its business makes   14      such qualification or licensing
necessary, except for such failures to be so duly qualified or licensed and
in good standing that would not, either individually or in the aggregate,
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. "Company Material Adverse Effect"
shall mean any change, event or effect that is materially adverse to the
business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole, in each case excluding (i) any changes or
effects resulting from any matter, which matter was expressly approved by the
Board of Directors of the Company following the date hereof unless, with
respect to such matter, a majority of the directors of the Company who are
also executive officers of Parent either voted against or abstained
from voting (such matter and related contemplated transactions, an
"Approved Matter"), (ii) changes in economic or regulatory conditions in the
industries in which the Company carries on business as of the date hereof,
and changes in general economic, regulatory or political conditions,
including, without limitation, acts of war or terrorism, and (iii) changes
resulting from the announcement of the Transactions and any other public
announcement of Parent during the term of this Agreement to the extent not
covered in any other public announcement of the Company during the term of
this Agreement or based upon information provided to Parent by the Company.
Other than wholly owned subsidiaries and except as disclosed in the Company
SEC Reports or Section 4.1(a) of the disclosure letter delivered by the
Company to Parent on or prior to the date hereof (the "Company Disclosure
Letter"), the Company does not directly or indirectly own any equity or
similar interest in, or any interest convertible or exchangeable or
exercisable for any equity or similar interest in, any corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture or other business,
association or entity.   (b) Capitalization. The authorized capital stock of
the Company consists of 600,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock,
150,000,000 shares of Company Class B Common Stock, and 20,000,000 shares of
Company Preferred Stock. At the close of business on March 10, 2003,
49,562,266 shares of Company Common Stock, 69,002,382 shares of Company Class
B Common Stock and no shares of Company Preferred Stock were issued and
outstanding. All outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are duly
authorized, validly issued and fully paid and nonassessable. Except as set
forth in this Section 4.1(b) or as disclosed in Section 4.1(b) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, as of March 10, 2003, there are no options, warrants,
rights, puts, calls, commitments, or other contracts, arrangements or
understandings issued by or binding upon the Company requiring or providing
for, and there are no outstanding debt or equity securities of the Company
which upon the conversion, exchange or exercise thereof would require
or provide for the issuance by the Company of any new or additional shares
of Company Capital Stock (or any other securities of the Company) which, with
or without notice, lapse of time and/or payment of monies, are or would
be convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of Company
Capital Stock (or any other securities of the Company). Since March 10, 2003
through the date hereof, the Company has not issued any shares of its capital
stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable for any shares of its
capital stock, other than employee stock options to purchase 129,500 shares
of Company Common Stock and 51,000 restricted stock units, in each case,
pursuant to Company Benefit Plans (as defined below), or shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options granted prior
to such date. Following the date hereof, the Company will not issue any
shares of its capital stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable
for any shares of its capital stock except to the   15    extent
permitted to be granted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. There are no
preemptive or other similar rights available to the existing holders
of Company Common Stock.   (c) Authority Relative to this Agreement; Board

of the Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of the Company and no other corporate

Merger, the approval of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the

Stock, voting together as a single class (the "Company Stockholder
Approval")). This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered
by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by

Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
subject to (A) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar laws affecting or relating to creditors rights generally and (B) the
availability of specific performance or injunctive relief and other equitable
remedies.   (ii) The Board of Directors of the Company, based on

of Directors set forth in clause (A) of this sentence) has, prior to the
execution of this Agreement, (A) approved this Agreement and the
Transactions, (B) determined that the Transactions are fair to and in the
best interests of its public stockholders, and (C) recommended that the
stockholders of the Company approve this Agreement and the Transactions. This

of the Board of Directors of the Company. Each member of the Special
Committee is a "qualified director" as defined under WBCA Section
23B.08.720(4).   (d) No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.   (i) The

rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree applicable to the Company or any
of its subsidiaries or by which any of their respective properties is bound
or affected; or (C) result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an
event   16    that with notice or lapse of time or both would become a
default) under, or alter the rights or obligations of any third party or the
Company or its subsidiaries under, or give to others any rights of
termination, amendment, acceleration, increased payments or cancellation of,
or result in the creation of a lien or other encumbrance on any of the
properties or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to,
any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license,
permit, franchise or other instrument or obligation to which the Company or
any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or any of their respective properties are bound or affected, in
each case having value or requiring payments over the term thereof equal to
or greater than $5.0 million, except, in the case of clause (B) above, for
any such conflicts or violations that would not prevent or delay consummation
of the Merger in any material respect, or otherwise prevent the Company from
performing its obligations under this Agreement in any material respect, and
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Except as set forth in Section 4.1(d)(i) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, there are no material consents, waivers and approvals under any
agreements, contracts, licenses or leases required to be obtained by the
Company or its Significant Subsidiaries in connection with entering into of
this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions.   (ii) The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and the
performance of its obligations hereunder and the consummation of the
Transactions by the Company will not, require any consent, approval,
authorization or permit of, or registration or filing with or notification
to, any Governmental Entity, except (A) the filing of documents to satisfy

notifications (1) would not prevent or delay consummation of the Merger in
any material respect or otherwise prevent or delay in any material respect
the Company from performing its obligations under this Agreement or (2) would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.   (e) Compliance with Laws. Except as set forth in Section
4.1(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor any of

permit, franchise or other instrument or obligation to which the Company or
any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or any of their respective properties is bound, except in each
case for any such conflicts, defaults or violations that do not and would not
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.   17      (f) SEC Filings; Financial Statements.   (i) The
Company has made available to Parent a correct and complete copy of each

circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, provided, however,
that no representation is made with respect to information included in the
Company SEC Reports that was provided in writing by Parent. None of the
Company\'s subsidiaries is required to file any reports or other documents
with the SEC.   (ii) Each of the consolidated financial

exist that could result in material liability to the Company under Title IV
or Section 302 of ERISA.   (iv) Except as set forth in Section 4.1(j) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the Transactions (or any termination of

each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or

would be convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Parent Common
Stock (or any other securities of Parent). Since February 28, 2003 through

the part of Parent and Merger Sub and no other corporate proceedings on their
part are necessary to authorize this Agreement, or to consummate the
Transactions (other than the approval of the NASD listing application with
respect to the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger). This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and
Merger Sub and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the
Company, constitutes the legal and binding obligations of Parent and Merger

mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise
or other instrument or obligation to which any of them is a party or by which
any of them or any of their respective properties are bound or affected,
except in the cases of clauses (B) and (C) above, for any such conflicts,
violations, breaches, defaults or other alterations or occurrences that would
not prevent or delay consummation of the Merger in any material respect, or
otherwise prevent Parent or Merger Sub from performing their respective
obligations under this Agreement in any material respect, and would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. There are
no material consents, waivers, and approvals under any agreements, contracts,
licenses or leases required to be obtained by Parent or Merger Sub
in connection with entering into of this Agreement or the consummation of
the Transactions.   (ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Parent and Merger Sub do not, and the performance of their respective
obligations hereunder and the consummation of the Transactions by them will

or permits, or to make such filings or notifications (1) would not prevent or
delay consummation of the Merger in any material respect or otherwise prevent
or delay in any material respect Parent and Merger Sub from performing their
obligations under this Agreement or (2) would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.   (e) Compliance with
Laws. Except as set forth in Section 4.2(e) of the Parent Disclosure Letter,

applicable to Parent or any of its subsidiaries or by which any of their
respective properties is bound, or (ii) whether after the giving of notice or
passage of time or both, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract,
agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or
obligation to which Parent or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which
Parent or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective properties is
bound, except for any such conflicts, defaults or violations which do not and
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.   (f) SEC Filings; Financial Statements.   (i) Parent has made
available to the Company a correct and complete copy of each report,
schedule, registration statement and definitive proxy statement filed
by    23   Parent with the SEC on or after January 1, 2002 and prior to
the date of this Agreement (the "Parent SEC Reports"), which are all the
forms, reports and documents required to be filed by Parent with the SEC
since such date; provided that, if Parent amends any of the Parent SEC
Reports, such amendment shall not mean or imply that any representation or
warranty in this Agreement was not true when made or became untrue

in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder applicable thereto, and (B) did not at the time they were filed

then on the date of such filing) contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, provided, however, that no representation is made with
respect to information included in the Parent SEC Reports that was provided
in writing by the Company.   (ii) Each of the consolidated financial
statements (including, in each case, any related notes thereto) contained in
the Parent SEC Reports complied as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, had been prepared in accordance
with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of the
unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q or the Exchange Act
regulations promulgated by the SEC) and each fairly presented the
consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries
in all material respects as at the respective dates thereof and the
consolidated results of its operations and cash flows for the periods
indicated (subject, in the case of the unaudited interim
financial statements, to normal audit adjustments which were not and are not
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to be material in amount).  
(g) Registration Statement; Proxy and Information Statement/ Prospectus. None
of the information supplied or to be supplied by Parent in writing
specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the Form S-4
in connection with the issuance of the Parent Common Stock in or as a
result of the Merger will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC and
at the time the Form S-4 becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; and (ii) the Proxy and Information Statement/Prospectus will, at
the date the Proxy and Information Statement/Prospectus is mailed to the

to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent
makes no representation or warranty with respect to any information provided
by or required to be provided by the Company and/or by its auditors, legal
counsel, financial advisors or other consultants or advisors specifically for
use in the Form S-4 or the Proxy and Information Statement/Prospectus. The

their respective affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by
the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement

Filing so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, or an event occurs which is required to be set forth in
an amendment or supplement to the Form S-4, the Proxy and
Information Statement/Prospectus or any Other Filing, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party and an
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed

stockholders (the "Company Stockholders Meeting") on August 1, 2003 or such
earlier date as is agreed to by the parties, for the purpose of obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval and shall take all lawful action to solicit the
Company Stockholder Approval. Subject to the third to last sentence in
Section 5.4, the Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend the
adoption of the plan of merger contained in this Agreement by the Company
stockholders to the effect as set forth in Section 4.1(c)(ii) (the "Company
Recommendation"), and, subject to the third to last sentence in Section 5.4,

qualify) in any manner adverse to Parent the Company Recommendation or (ii)
take any action or make any statement in connection with the Company
Stockholders Meeting inconsistent with the Company
Recommendation (collectively, a "Change in the Company Recommendation").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this Agreement shall be
submitted to the Company stockholders at the Company Stockholders Meeting for
the purpose of obtaining the    29   Company Stockholder Approval, and
nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve the Company of such
obligation.   (b) Parent agrees that at the Company Stockholders Meeting,

Company owned directly or indirectly by it are counted for the purpose of
obtaining a quorum at the Company Stockholders Meeting, and at any
adjournment or adjournments thereof, and (ii) vote, in person or by proxy,
with respect to all such shares of the Company owned directly or indirectly
by it to adopt the Agreement as approved by the Board of Directors of the
Company. If this Agreement is subsequently amended and such amendment is
approved by the Board of Directors of Parent and the Company or if a
subsequent consent is deemed necessary to consummate the Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, then Parent shall as soon thereafter as
practicable either at a meeting of the Company\'s stockholders at which any
proposal to adopt this Agreement, as amended, is proposed, cause all shares
of Company Stock owned directly or indirectly by it on the date hereof (i) to
appear, in person or by proxy, so that all such shares are counted for the
purpose of obtaining a quorum at any such meeting of stockholders of
the Company, and at any adjournment or adjournments thereof, and (ii) to
vote, in person or by proxy, with respect to such shares to adopt this
Agreement, as amended. Parent shall cause all shares of Company Stock owned
directly or indirectly by it on the date hereof to vote against any proposal
that is contrary to the adoption of this Agreement and the Transactions
contemplated hereby.   5.6 Agreements to Take Reasonable Action.   (a)
The parties shall take, and shall cause their respective subsidiaries to
take, all reasonable actions necessary to comply promptly with all legal

legal proceeding, whether judicial or administrative, challenging the

reasonable.    30    (b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of the parties shall use all reasonable efforts to take, or

individuals who at or prior to the Effective Time were directors or officers
of the Company the current provisions regarding indemnification

advancement of expenses) contained in the Articles of Incorporation and
Bylaws of the Company on the date hereof, which provisions shall not be
amended, modified or otherwise repealed for a period of six (6) years from
the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder as of the Effective Time of such individuals, unless such

six-year period, all rights to indemnification (and to advancement of
expenses) hereunder in respect of such claims shall continue,
without diminution, until disposition of all such claims.   (c) The
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) assume, honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company
pursuant to any indemnification agreements, including those contained in
employment agreements (the employee parties under such agreements being
referred to as the "Covered Persons") with the Company\'s directors, officers
and other employees (if any) existing at the Effective Time. In addition,
Parent shall provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for a
period of not less than six (6) years after the Effective Time, the
Company\'s current and former directors and officers who are
currently covered by the Company\'s existing insurance and indemnification
policy with an insurance and indemnification policy (including, without
limitation, by arranging for run-off coverage, if necessary) that provides
coverage for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (the "DandO;
Insurance") that is no less favorable than the existing policy (it being
acknowledged and understood that the Company currently indemnifies its
officers and directors for claims to the extent permitted under the WBCA and
pays its obligations thereunder out of its assets and maintains DandO;
Insurance solely for claims not so indemnifiable or for which the Company\'s
assets are insufficient to cover), or, if substantially equivalent insurance
coverage is unavailable, the most advantageous DandO; Insurance obtainable for
an annual premium equal to 200% of the annual premium currently in place for
the Company for such insurance; provided, however, that Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the
DandO; Insurance in excess of 200% of the annual premium currently in place for
the Company for such insurance, calculated on the basis of a fair allocation
of the portion of such premium if Parent arranges such coverage on a group
basis.   (d) This Section 5.10 shall survive the Effective Time, is intended
to benefit the Surviving Corporation and the Covered Persons and shall
be enforceable by the Covered Persons, their heirs, assigns and
representatives and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have
by contract or otherwise. In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person,
then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of such party, shall assume the obligations set forth
in this Section 5.10.   5.11 Notification of Certain Matters. Each of the
Company and Parent shall give prompt notice to the other such party of the
occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or failure to
occur would be likely to cause (a) any representation or warranty contained
in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any
time from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, or (b) any
material failure of the Company or    32   Parent, as the case may be,
or of any officer, director, employee or agent thereof, to comply with or
satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the delivery of
any notice pursuant to this Section 5.11 shall not limit or otherwise affect
the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.   5.12
Employee Arrangements. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to fulfill all written employment, severance,
termination, consulting and retirement agreements and severance plans, as in
effect on the date hereof, to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is
a party, pursuant to the terms thereof and applicable law.   5.13
Reorganization. From and after the date hereof, each of Parent and the
Company and each of their respective subsidiaries shall not, and shall use
reasonable efforts to cause their affiliates not to, take any action, or fail
to take any action, which action or failure to act would
jeopardize qualification of the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code or enter into any contract, agreement,
commitment or arrangement that would have such effect. Each of Parent and the
Company and each of their respective subsidiaries shall use reasonable
efforts to obtain the opinions of counsel referred to in Sections 6.2(c) and
6.3(c), including the execution of the officers\' certificates referred to
therein.   5.14 Public Announcements. The initial press release relating to
the Transactions shall be a joint press release, to be agreed upon by the
Parent and the Company. Thereafter, Parent and the Company shall use their
reasonable best efforts to consult with each other before issuing any press
release with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions.   5.15
Stockholder Litigation. Each of the Company and the Parent shall give the
other the reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense of
any stockholder litigation against the Company or the Parent and their
respective directors and officers, as applicable, relating to the
Transactions or this Agreement.   5.16 Section 16b-3. Parent and the
Company shall take all reasonable steps to cause the transactions
contemplated by Article III and any other disposition of equity securities of
the Company or Parent (including derivative securities) or acquisitions of
equity securities of Parent by each individual who (a) is a director or
officer of the Company or Parent, or (b) at the Effective Time will become a
director or officer of Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated

restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other order issued

36    ARTICLE VIII   GENERAL PROVISIONS   8.1 Amendment. This Agreement
(including the Exhibits and Disclosure Letters hereto) may be amended prior
to the Effective Time by Parent and the Company at any time before or after
approval of the Merger by the stockholders of the Company and Parent,

Arrangements) and 5.13 (Reorganization), each of which shall survive the
Merger.   8.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Exhibits

Severability. It is the desire and intent of the parties that the provisions
of this Agreement be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the law

for any reason, such provision, as to such jurisdiction, shall be
ineffective, without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement
or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other
jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such provision could be more
narrowly drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable in such
jurisdiction, it shall, as to such jurisdiction, be so narrowly drawn,
without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement or affecting
the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other
jurisdiction.    37     8.6 Notices. All notices and other
