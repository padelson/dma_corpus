Business achieves an EBITDA Margin (defined below) of thirty-one percent
(31%).

  

The EBITDA Earnout Amount is independent of the Revenue Earnout Amount. If an

Dollars ($12,500,000.00) less the total EBITDA Earnout Amount payments
previously paid to the Sellers.

  

### **(B) **" **EBITDA Margin** " means EBITDA for a period divided by
revenue for the same period. " **EBITDA** " means, for any period, an

matters set forth on Schedule 1.5(B),

  

#### **2. **interest charges (interest expense net of interest income),

Amount owing in respect of the immediately preceding year ending September

and would generally provide a set amount of Four Million Two Hundred Thousand
and No/100 Dollars ($4,200,000.00) (" **Retention Compensation** "), to be
paid by Purchaser. While the final terms of the plan are subject to

plan terms.

  

#### **5. **Any forfeited amounts of the Retention Compensation shall be
allocated to and distributed after the third anniversary of the Closing Date
to those Moncla Employees who are then employed by Purchaser as stated under
plan terms.

  

### In the event that Sellers and Purchasers are able to establish a mutually
acceptable plan the Initial Purchase Price otherwise payable to Sellers of
MWS shall be reduced by the portion of the Retention Compensation paid as
soon as administratively feasible after the Closing Date and by the present
value of future payments of the balance of the Retention Compensation, based
on a discount rate of 5%, in order to provide funding for such plan.

        

### **(G) **Purchaser shall make available Ten Million and No/100 Dollars
($10,000,000.00) of annual capital investment to the Earnout Business,
subject to investment return and other requirements that the Purchaser uses

or the EBITDA Earnout Amount or the amount of interest thereon to be paid for
a particular year, Sellers shall notify Purchaser within twenty (20) days

## **12.12 _Payment Agent_.**
