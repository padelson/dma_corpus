Acquisition Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation (the surviving corporation in the Merger is sometimes referred to
herein as the "Surviving Corporation") and shall continue to be governed by the
laws of the State of Delaware and shall continue under the name "News Publishing
Australia Limited." Whether the Forward Merger or the Reverse Merger is to be
effected shall be determined in accordance with Section 6.19 hereof.

                             (b) Concurrently with the Closing (as defined in
Section 1.9 hereof), the Company, Buyer and Acquisition Sub shall cause a
certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with respect to the Merger
to be executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
(the "Secretary of State") as provided under Delaware Law. The Merger shall
become effective on the date and time at which the Certificate of Merger has
been duly filed with the Secretary of State or at such other date and time as
are agreed between the parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger, and
such date and time is hereinafter referred to as the "Effective Time."

                             (c) From and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall possess all rights, privileges, immunities, powers
and franchises and be subject to all of the obligations, restrictions,
disabilities, liabilities, debts and duties of the Company and Acquisition Sub.

                  SECTION 1.2   Effect on Securities.  At the Effective Time:

                             (a) Cancellation of Securities. In the case of the
Forward Merger, each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company as
treasury stock or held by Buyer or its subsidiaries or by Chris-Craft (unless
the Chris-Craft Merger shall not have occurred prior to the Effective Time)
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and
revert to the status of authorized but unissued shares, and no consideration or
payment shall be delivered therefor or in respect thereto. In the case of the
Reverse Merger, each share of Company Common Stock held by Chris-Craft (unless
the Chris-Craft Merger shall not have occurred prior to the Effective Time)
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding and continue to
represent one share of common stock of the Company.

                             (b) Conversion of Securities. Except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement and subject to Section 1.4 hereof, each share of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than shares cancelled pursuant to Section 1.2(a) hereof and
Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 1.8 hereof)) shall be converted into
the following (the "Merger Consideration"):

                  Either (X) in the case of the Forward Merger:

                                    (i) for each share of Company Common Stock
with respect to which an election to receive only cash (to the extent available)
has been effectively made and not revoked or lost, pursuant to Section 1.3
hereof, the right to receive in cash from Buyer the Per Share Amount (as defined
below), subject to Sections 1.2(f) and 1.4(f) and to the allocation and
proration procedures set forth in Section 1.4 hereof; and

                                    (ii) for each share of Company Common Stock
with respect to which an election to receive forty percent (40%) of the Cash
Merger Price in cash and the remainder of the Merger Consideration in American
Depositary Shares of Buyer ("Buyer Shares"), each of which represents four (4)
fully paid and nonassessable Preferred Limited Voting Ordinary Shares of Buyer
("Buyer Preferred Stock"), has been effectively made and not revoked or lost,
pursuant to Section 1.3 hereof (a "Partial Cash Election"), (A) the right to
receive from Buyer an amount in cash equal to $66 and (B) 2.2278 (the "Partial
Exchange Ratio") Buyer Shares (such shares of Company Common Stock being,
collectively, "Partial Cash Election Shares" and, together with the All Cash
Election Shares (as defined herein), "Cash Election Shares"); provided, however,
that the foregoing shall be subject to Sections 1.2(f) and 1.4(f) hereof. The
Buyer Preferred Stock allotted and issued in accordance with this Agreement
shall on and from its date of allotment rank pari passu with all existing Buyer
Preferred Stock on issue at that date,


                                        3
<PAGE>   12
         including as to all dividend entitlements (in respect of which they
         shall receive the same entitlement as any previously issued Buyer
         Preferred Stock); and

                                    (iii) for each other share of Company Common
         Stock, the right to receive from Buyer, the number of Buyer Shares
         equal to the Exchange Ratio (as defined below), subject to Sections
         1.2(f) and 1.4(f) and to the allocation and proration procedures set
         forth in Section 1.4 hereof; or,

                  (Y) in the case of the Reverse Merger, subject to Section
         1.2(f), for each share of Company Common Stock, (A) the right to
         receive from Buyer an amount in cash equal to $69.30 and (B) 2.3392
         Buyer Shares (the "Reverse Merger Exchange Ratio").

                             (c) Cancellation of Company Common Stock.  All
shares of Company Common Stock to be converted into the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this Section 1.2 shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holders thereof, cease to be outstanding, be cancelled
and retired and cease to exist; and each holder of a certificate representing
prior to the Effective Time any such shares of Company Common Stock shall
thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such securities, except the
right to receive (i) the Merger Consideration, (ii) any dividends and other
distributions in accordance with Section 1.5(c) hereof and (iii) any cash to be
paid in lieu of any fractional Buyer Share in accordance with Section 1.5(d)
hereof.

                             (d)    [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]

                             (e)    Capital Stock of Acquisition Sub. In the
Forward Merger, no shares of Acquisition Sub stock will be issued directly or
indirectly and each share of common stock of Acquisition Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding
following the Effective Time. In the case of the Reverse Merger, each share of
common stock of Acquisition Sub shall be converted into one fully paid and
nonassessable share of the Surviving Corporation.

                             (f)    Adjustments to Exchange Ratio.

                                    (i) Subject to clause (ii) below, in the
         event that Buyer declares or effects a stock split, stock or cash
         dividend (other than ordinary course cash dividends declared and paid
         consistent with past practice) or other reclassification, acquisition,
         exchange or distribution with respect to the Buyer Shares or Buyer
         Preferred Stock, in each case with a record or ex-dividend date or
         effective date occurring after the date hereof and on or prior to the
         date of the Effective Time, there will be an appropriate adjustment
         made to the Merger Consideration so as to provide for the inclusion
         therein of the cash, property, securities or combination thereof that
         each holder of Company Common Stock who has the right to receive the
         Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.2 hereof would have received
         had such Company Common Stock been converted into Buyer Shares or Buyer
         Preferred Stock as of the date hereof.

                                    (ii) If either (A) in the case of the
         Forward Merger, the tax opinion to the Company referred to in Section
         7.3(c) hereof as to the Merger qualifying as a reorganization cannot be
         rendered (as reasonably determined by Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays &
         Handler, LLP), (B) in the case of the Forward Merger, the tax opinion
         to Buyer referred to in Section 7.2(f) as to the Merger qualifying as a
         reorganization cannot be rendered (as reasonably determined by
         Squadron, Ellenoff, Plesent & Sheinfeld LLP), (C) in the case of the
         Forward Merger, in the reasonable judgment of the Company or Buyer,
         based on the advice of their respective counsel, there is a meaningful
         risk that the receipt of the cash, property, securities or combination
         thereof referred to in clause (i) above would be taxable or have an
         adverse tax consequence to the holders of Company Common Stock or (D)
         in the case of either the Forward Merger or the Reverse Merger, the
         adjustment referred to in clause (i) above is not possible or not
         possible without materially changing the tax treatment of the
         transaction referred to in clause (i) in question, then, in each case,
         Buyer (but only if requested by the Company in the case of clause (C)
         above) shall make an appropriate adjustment to the Merger Consideration
         that (x) conveys an equivalent value (taking into account, among other
         things, the impact of the transaction referred to in clause (i) above
         on the trading price of Company Common Stock, Buyer Shares, Buyer
         Preferred Stock and any newly issued securities) to the holders of
         Company Common Stock as the adjustments contemplated in paragraph (i)
         above, (y) in the case of the Forward Merger, allows such tax opinions
         to be delivered and (z) in the case of the Forward Merger, avoids the
         consequences referred to in clause (C) above; it being understood that,
         by way of illustration and not limitation, the Company's written
         agreement that clause (x) is satisfied shall constitute conclusive
         evidence as to such fact.

                             (g) Certain Definitions. For purposes of this
Agreement, or, in the case of clause (xii) below, solely for purposes of

                  Effective Time, less the number of outstanding shares of
                  Company Common Stock cancelled pursuant to Section 1.2(a)
                  hereof, and (y) 3.7131, less (B) the number of Buyer Shares to
                  be paid in respect of Partial Cash Election Shares, in each
                  case subject to adjustment as described in Section 1.4(f)
                  hereof.

                                    (ii) "Aggregate Cash Amount" means (A) 40%
                  of the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common

                  hereof.

                  that number of shares of Company Common Stock as shall be
                  equal to the quotient obtained by dividing

         reported on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") for each of the

         Date (the "Valuation Period"); provided, however, if necessary to
         comply with any requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission
         (the "SEC"), the term Closing Date in this clause (iv) shall be deemed
         to mean the date which is the closest in time but prior to the Closing
         Date which complies with such rules and regulations. Buyer agrees that
         during the Valuation Period neither Buyer nor its affiliates shall (x)

         intention to purchase or acquire, any Buyer Shares or Buyer Preferred
         Stock or other outstanding securities of Buyer or its affiliates

         purchases at market value of Buyer Shares (in accordance with all

         and timing of such purchases pursuant to a pre-existing stock buyback

         aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and
         outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time less the number of

                                    (xii) "Dissenting Shares" means shares of
         Company Common Stock that are Dissenting Shares within the meaning of
         Section 1.9 hereof in respect of which the holder thereof shall have

         demand for appraisal under Section 262 of the Delaware Law to the
         extent that such steps are required to have been taken by the
         applicable date of determination.

                  SECTION 1.3 Share Election. In the case of the Forward Merger
(and, with respect to clauses (b) and, unless a Restructuring Trigger has
theretofore occurred, (c) and (e) below, in the case of the Reverse Merger to
the extent applicable):

                             (a)    Each Person (as defined in Section 1.3(b)
hereof) who, on or prior to the Election Deadline referred to in subsection (c)
below is a record holder of shares of Company Common Stock (collectively,
"Holders") shall have the right, with respect to the Merger Consideration, (i)
to elect to receive only cash for such shares pursuant to Section 1.2(b)(X)(i)
hereof (an "All Cash Election"), (ii) to make a Partial Cash Election, (iii) to
elect to receive Buyer Shares for such shares pursuant to Section 1.2(b)(X)(iii)
hereof (a "Stock Election"), (iv) to indicate that such record holder has no
preference as to the receipt of cash or Buyer Shares for such shares (a
"Non-Election") or (v) to make a mixed election, specifying the number of shares
of Company Common Stock corresponding with each such Election (the All Cash
Election, the Partial Cash Election, the Stock Election, and the Non-Election
are collectively referred to as the "Elections"). Holders who hold such shares
as nominees, trustees or in other representative capacities may submit multiple
Forms of Election (as defined below).

                             (b) Prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement (as
defined in Section 6.1 hereof), The Bank of New York or such other bank, trust
company, Person or Persons shall be designated by Buyer and reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") for
payment of the Merger Consideration. The Exchange Agent shall act as the agent
for the Company's stockholders for the purpose of receiving and holding their
Forms of Election and Certificates (as defined below) and shall obtain no rights
or interests (beneficial or otherwise) in such shares. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Person" means any natural person, firm, individual, corporation,
limited liability company, partnership, association, joint venture, company,
business trust, trust or any other entity or organization, whether incorporated
or unincorporated, including a government or political subdivision or any agency
or instrumentality thereof.

                             (c) All Elections shall be made on a form designed
for that purpose, which shall include a letter of transmittal and election form
(together, a "Form of Election"). Elections shall be made by Holders by mailing
to the Exchange Agent a Form of Election, which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to any Certificates) shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be
in such form and have such other provisions as Buyer, in consultation with the
Company, may reasonably specify. Buyer and the Company will announce the
Exchange Ratio and the Per Share Amount when known and will announce the
anticipated Closing Date at least three


                                        7
<PAGE>   16
business days, but not more than five business days, prior thereto; provided,
however, that the Closing Date (A) shall occur immediately following the
Chris-Craft Merger or (B) in the event that the Chris-Craft Merger Agreement is
terminated and this Agreement is not also terminated, shall not be earlier than
the second business day after the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions set
forth in Article VII hereof (other than the conditions set forth in Sections
7.1(h), 7.2(a), 7.2(b) 7.2(f), 7.3(a), 7.3(b), 7.3(c) and, in so far as it
relates to the accuracy of representations and warranties and the performance of
covenants, Section 7.1(i), so long as the foregoing enumerated conditions are
anticipated by the parties hereto to be satisfied on the Closing Date);
provided, further that the Closing Date shall not be earlier than the
satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section 7.1(h) . All Certificates so
surrendered shall be subject to the exchange procedures set forth in Section 1.5
hereof. To be effective, a Form of Election must be properly completed, signed
and submitted to the Exchange Agent and accompanied by the Certificates as to
which the election is being made (or by an appropriate guarantee of delivery of
such Certificates as set forth in such Form of Election from a firm which is a
member of the NYSE or another registered national securities exchange or a
commercial bank or trust company having an office or correspondent in the United
States, provided such Certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent
within five NYSE trading days after the Election Deadline (as defined below)).
Buyer will have the discretion, which it may delegate in whole or in part to the
Exchange Agent, to determine whether Forms of Election have been properly
completed, signed and submitted or revoked and to disregard immaterial defects
in Forms of Election. The decision of Buyer (or the Exchange Agent) in such
matters, absent manifest error, shall be conclusive and binding. Neither Buyer
nor the Exchange Agent will be under any obligation to notify any person of any
defect in a Form of Election submitted to the Exchange Agent. The Exchange Agent
and Buyer shall also make all computations contemplated by this Section 1.3 and
by Section 1.4 hereof and all such computations shall be conclusive and binding
on the Holders absent manifest error. The Form of Election and the accompanying
Certificates (or appropriate guarantee of delivery in respect thereof) must be
received by the Exchange Agent prior to 10:00 a.m New York City time on the day
on which the Closing occurs (the "Election Deadline") in order to be effective.
If the Closing is delayed to a subsequent date, the Election Deadline shall be
similarly delayed and Buyer will promptly announce such rescheduled Election
Deadline and Closing. An election may be revoked, but only by written notice
received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. Upon any such
revocation, unless a duly completed Election Form, accompanied by a Certificate,
is thereafter submitted in accordance with this paragraph (c), such shares shall
be deemed to be Non-Election Shares (as defined in Section 1.4 hereof). If a
Form of Election is revoked, or in the event that this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to the provisions hereof, and any Certificates (or guarantee(s) of
delivery, as appropriate), have been transmitted to the Exchange Agent pursuant
to the provisions hereof, such Certificates (and, in the case of a revoked Form
of Election, guarantee(s) of delivery, as appropriate), shall promptly be
returned without charge to the Person submitting the same.

                             (d) For the purposes hereof, Company Common Stock
as to which the Holder has not made a valid Election prior to the Election
Deadline, including as a result of revocation, shall be deemed to be
Non-Election Shares. If Buyer or the Exchange Agent shall determine that any
purported All Cash Election, Partial Cash Election or Stock Election was not
properly made, such purported All Cash Election, Partial Cash Election or Stock
Election shall


                                        8
<PAGE>   17
be deemed to be of no force and effect and the Holder making such purported All
Cash Election, Partial Cash Election or Stock Election shall for purposes hereof
be deemed to have made a Non-Election. Shares in respect of which a Non-Election
shall have been made or deemed made shall be treated as Non-Election Shares.

                             (e) Concurrently with the mailing of the Proxy
Statement, Buyer and the Company shall mail the Form of Election to each person
who is a Holder on the record date for the Stockholders' Meeting (as defined in
Section 6.2 hereof) and shall each use its reasonable best efforts to mail the
Form of Election to all persons who become Holders during the period between (i)
such record date and (ii) the date seven calendar days prior to the anticipated
Effective Time, and to make the Form of Election available to all persons who
become Holders subsequent to the date described in clause (ii) but not later
than 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the last business day prior to the
Effective Time. The Exchange Agent may, with the mutual agreement of Buyer and
the Company, make such rules as are consistent with this Section 1.3 for the
implementation of the Elections provided for herein as shall be necessary or
desirable to effect such Elections fully.

                  SECTION 1.4 Allocation and Proration.

                             (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, the maximum number of shares of Company Common Stock which shall
be converted into the right to receive cash in the Merger (other than pursuant
to Partial Cash Elections and other than Dissenting Shares) shall be equal to
the All Cash Election Number. The maximum number of shares of Company Common
Stock to be converted into the right to receive Buyer Shares in the Merger
(other than pursuant to Partial Cash Elections) shall be equal to the Stock
Election Number.

                             (b) If the aggregate number of shares of Company
Common Stock covered by All Cash Elections (the "All Cash Election Shares")
exceeds the All Cash Election Number, all shares of Company Common Stock covered
by Stock Elections (the "Stock Election Shares") and all shares of Company
Common Stock covered by Non-Elections (the "Non-Election Shares") shall be
converted into the right to receive Buyer Shares, and the All Cash Election
Shares shall be converted into the right to receive Buyer Shares and cash in the
following manner:

                  each All Cash Election Share shall be converted into the right
                  to receive (i) an amount in cash, without interest, equal to
                  the product of (x) the Per Share Amount and (y) a fraction
                  (the "Cash Fraction"), the numerator of which shall be the All
                  Cash Election Number and the denominator of which shall be the
                  total number of All Cash Election Shares, and (ii) a number of
                  shares of Buyer Shares equal to the product of (x) the
                  Exchange Ratio and (y) a fraction equal to one minus the Cash
                  Fraction.

                             (c) If the aggregate number of Stock Election
Shares exceeds the Stock Election Number, all All Cash Election Shares and all
Non-Election Shares shall be


                                        9
<PAGE>   18
converted into the right to receive cash, and the Stock Election Shares shall be
converted into the right to receive Buyer Shares and cash in the following
manner:

                  each Stock Election Share shall be converted into the right to
                  receive (i) a number of Buyer Shares equal to the product of
                  (x) the Exchange Ratio and (y) a fraction (the "Stock
                  Fraction"), the numerator of which shall be the Stock Election
                  Number and the denominator of which shall be the total number
                  of Stock Election Shares, and (ii) an amount in cash, without
                  interest, equal to the product of (x) the Per Share Amount and
                  (y) a fraction equal to one minus the Stock Fraction.

                             (d)    In the event that neither Section 1.4(b)
nor 1.4(c) above is applicable, all All Cash Election Shares shall be converted
into the right to receive cash, all Stock Election Shares shall be converted
into the right to receive Buyer Shares and the Non-Election Shares shall be
converted into the right to receive Buyer Shares and cash in the following
manner:

                  each Non-Election Share shall be converted into the right to
                  receive (i) an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the
                  product of (x) the Per Share Amount and (y) a fraction (the
                  "Non-Election Fraction"), the numerator of which shall be the
                  excess of the All Cash Election Number over the total number
                  of All Cash Election Shares and the denominator of which shall
                  be the excess of (A) the number of Exchangeable Shares over
                  (B) the sum of the total number of All Cash Election Shares
                  and the total number of Stock Election Shares and (ii) a
                  number of Buyer Shares equal to the product of (x) the
                  Exchange Ratio and (y) a fraction equal to one minus the Non-
                  Election Fraction.

                             (e) Partial Election Shares shall not be subject to
proration and shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 1.2(b)(X)(ii) hereof, subject to Section
1.4(f) hereof.

                             (f) If the sum of (i) the Aggregate Cash Amount
(without giving effect to the reference therein to this subsection (f)) and (ii)
40% of the Cash Merger Price multiplied by the number of Partial Cash Election
Shares (such sum being the "Cash Amount") exceeds 55% of the sum of (x) the Cash
Amount and (y) the product of (A) the closing price of Buyer Shares reported on
the NYSE Composite Tape on the trading day immediately preceding the Closing
Date (the "Closing Price") multiplied by (B) 3.7131 multiplied by (C) 60% of the
excess of the number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time over the number of outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock cancelled pursuant to Section 1.2(a) hereof (such sum of (x) and
(y) being the "Total Consideration"), then the components of the Merger
Consideration shall be modified (1) first, in the case of shares of Company
Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares) as to which All Cash Elections shall
have been made, by reducing the cash portion of the Merger Consideration to the
minimum extent necessary, and in no event below 40% of the Cash Merger Price,
and issuing in lieu


                                       10
<PAGE>   19
thereof additional Buyer Shares in an amount equal to the result obtained by
dividing (x) the amount of such per share cash reduction by (y) the Closing
Price and (2) second, in the event that the foregoing reduction is not
sufficient to result in the Cash Amount not exceeding 55% of the Total
Consideration, in the case of shares of Company Common Stock as to which an All
Cash Election or a Partial Cash Election shall have been made, by further
reducing the amount of the cash portion of the Merger Consideration to the
minimum extent necessary to satisfy the 55% limitation referred to above and to
issue in lieu thereof additional Buyer Shares, in amount equal to the result
obtained by dividing (u) the amount of such per share reduction by (v) the
Closing Price. In the case of the Forward Merger, if either (i) the tax opinion
referred to in Section 7.3(c) hereof cannot be rendered (as reasonably
determined by Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays & Handler, LLP), or (ii) the tax
opinion to Buyer referred to in Section 7.2(f) cannot be rendered (as reasonably
determined by Squadron, Ellenoff, Plesent & Sheinfeld LLP), then the foregoing
adjustments shall be similarly made, in each case to the minimum extent
necessary to enable the relevant tax opinion or opinions, as the case may be, to
be rendered. For purposes of this Section 1.4(f), holders of Dissenting Shares
shall be deemed to be Persons making All Cash Elections notwithstanding, and in
lieu of, any election they have or have not made.

                  SECTION 1.5 Exchange of Certificates.

                             (a)    As of the Effective Time, Buyer shall (i)
deposit, or cause to be deposited with (A) the Exchange Agent for the benefit of
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, cash to the extent it constitutes
Merger Consideration and (B) pursuant to the terms of the Deposit Agreement (as
defined below) the Custodian (as defined in the Deposit Agreement) certificates
representing the Buyer Preferred Stock underlying the Buyer Shares to the extent
they constitute Merger Consideration and (ii) pursuant to the terms of the
Deposit Agreement, instruct the Depositary to deposit the Buyer Shares to be
issued in the Merger with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of holders of
shares of Company Common Stock for exchange in the Merger. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Depositary" shall mean Citibank, N.A., as Depositary, pursuant to
the Amended and Restated Deposit Agreement, dated as of December 3, 1996, among
Buyer, the Depositary and the holders from time to time of Buyer Shares (the
"Deposit Agreement"). In addition, Buyer shall make available to the Exchange
Agent on a daily basis sufficient cash to permit prompt payment to all Holders
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in the form of cash. The Buyer
shall pay, or cause one of its affiliates to pay, any transfer taxes and all
other charges and fees (including all fees for the depositary, registry or
custodian for the ADRs).

                             (b) As of or promptly following the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail (and to make
available for collection by hand) to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates, which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates") (other than in
the case of the Forward Merger those who had not previously properly delivered
their Certificates to the Exchange Agent along with a Form of Election), (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery
of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and which shall be in the form and
have such other provisions as Buyer and the Company may reasonably specify) and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for


                                       11
<PAGE>   20
(A) a certificate or certificates representing that number of whole Buyer
Shares, if any, into which the number of shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to
this Agreement and (B) the amount of cash, if any, into which all or a portion
of the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such
Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement (which
instructions shall provide that at the election of the surrendering holder,
Certificates may be surrendered, and the Merger Consideration in exchange
therefor collected, by hand delivery). Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a letter of transmittal duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and
such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented
by such Certificate, to be mailed (or made available for collection by hand if
so elected by the surrendering holder) within five business days following the
later to occur of (i) the Effective Time or (ii) the Exchange Agent's receipt of
such Certificates, and the Certificate so surrendered shall be forthwith
cancelled. The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates upon compliance
with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to
effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices.
No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the
Certificates on the Merger Consideration (or the cash pursuant to subsections
(c) and (d) below) payable upon the surrender of the Certificates.

                             (c) Buyer may retain any dividends or other
distributions with respect to Buyer Shares with a record date on or after the
Effective Time in respect of the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with
respect to the Buyer Shares represented thereby by reason of the conversion of
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Sections 1.2(b), 1.3 and 1.4 hereof
and no cash payment in lieu of fractional Buyer Shares shall be paid to any such
holder pursuant to Section 1.5(d) hereof until such Certificate is surrendered
in accordance with this Article 1. Subject to the effect of applicable laws,
following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be released and paid,
without interest, to the Person in whose name the Buyer Shares representing such
securities are registered (i) at the time of such surrender or as promptly as
practicable after the sale of the Excess Buyer Shares (as defined in Section
1.5(d) hereof), the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional Buyer
Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.5(d) hereof and
the proportionate amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to the Buyer Shares
issued upon conversion of Company Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date or as promptly as practicable thereafter, the proportionate amount
of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender
payable with respect to such Buyer Shares.

                             (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no fraction of a Buyer Share will be issued and no dividend or other
distribution, stock split or interest with respect to Buyer Shares shall relate
to any fractional Buyer Share, and such fractional interest shall not entitle
the owner thereof to vote or to any rights as a security holder of the Buyer
Shares. In lieu of any such fractional security, each holder of shares of
Company Common Stock otherwise entitled to a fraction of a Buyer Share will be
entitled to receive in accordance with the


                                       12
<PAGE>   21
provisions of this Section 1.5 from the Exchange Agent a cash payment
representing such holder's proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the
sale by the Exchange Agent on behalf of all such holders of the aggregate of the
fractions of Buyer Shares which would otherwise be issued (the "Excess Buyer
Shares"). The sale of the Excess Buyer Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be
executed on the NYSE through one or more member firms of the NYSE and shall be
executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Until the net proceeds of such
sale or sales have been distributed to the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock, the Exchange Agent will, subject to Section 1.5(e) hereof, hold such
proceeds in trust for the holders of such shares (the "Buyer Shares Trust").
Subject to its right to withhold for taxes as described in Section 1.6 hereof,
the Surviving Corporation shall pay all commissions, transfer taxes (other than
those transfer taxes for which the Company's former stockholders are solely
liable) and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, including the expenses and
compensation of the Exchange Agent incurred in connection with such sale of the
Excess Buyer Shares. As soon as practicable after the determination of the
amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of shares of Company Common Stock
in lieu of any fractional Buyer Share interests, the Exchange Agent shall make
available such amounts to such holders of shares of Company Common Stock without
interest.

                             (e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration
deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 1.5 (the "Exchange
Fund") which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for six
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Buyer, upon demand, and
any holders of shares of Company Common Stock prior to the Merger who have not
theretofore complied with this Article I shall thereafter look for payment of
their claim, as general creditors thereof, only to Buyer for their claim for (1)
cash, if any, without interest, (2) Buyer Shares, if any, (3) any cash without
interest, to be paid, in lieu of any fractional Buyer Shares and (4) any
dividends or other distributions with respect to Buyer Shares to which such
holders may be entitled. None of Buyer, Acquisition Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any Buyer Shares or cash held in the Exchange Fund (and any cash,
dividends and other distributions payable in respect thereof) delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.

                             (f)    None of Buyer, Acquisition Sub, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any Buyer Shares or cash held in the Exchange Fund (and any cash,
dividends and other distributions payable in respect thereof) delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to one
year after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on
which (i) any cash, (ii) any Buyer Shares, (iii) any cash in lieu of fractional
Buyer Shares or (iv) any dividends or distributions with respect to Buyer Shares
in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental Authority (as defined in Section 9.3 hereof)), any such
Buyer Shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of Buyer,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

                             (g) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Buyer on a daily basis. Any
interest and any other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Buyer. Nothing contained in this Section 1.5(g) shall relieve Buyer or the
Exchange Agent from making the payments required by this Article I to be made to
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock.

                  SECTION 1.6   Transfer Taxes; Withholding; Certain Stock.

                             (a)    If any certificate for a Buyer Share is to
be issued to, or cash is to be remitted to, a Person who holds shares of Company
Common Stock (other than the Person in whose name the Certificate surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered), it shall be a condition of such exchange that
the Company Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed and otherwise
in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange shall
(i) pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes (as defined in Section
3.14 hereof) required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered, or
(ii) establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax either
has been paid or is not applicable. Buyer or the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the Buyer Shares (or cash in lieu of
fractional Buyer Shares) otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as Buyer or the Exchange
Agent are required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld by Buyer or the Exchange Agent, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of shares of Company Common Stock in respect of whom
such deduction and withholding was made by Buyer or the Exchange Agent.

                             (b) Prior to the Effective Time, Buyer and the
Company shall take all steps reasonably necessary to cause the transactions
contemplated hereby and any other dispositions of equity securities of the
Company (including derivative securities) or acquisitions of Buyer equity
securities (including derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement
by each individual who (a) is a director or officer of the Company or (b) at the
Effective Time, will become a director or officer of Buyer, to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the "Exchange Act") to the extent Section 16 of the Exchange Act is applicable
to such person.

                  SECTION 1.7 Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in
such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate,
the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled
pursuant to this Article I.

<PAGE>   23
                  SECTION 1.8 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding Section 1.2
hereof, to the extent that holders thereof are entitled to appraisal rights
under Section 262 of Delaware Law, shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has
properly exercised and perfected his or her demand for appraisal rights under
Section 262 of Delaware Law (the "Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but the holders of
Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive such consideration as shall be
determined pursuant to Section 262 of Delaware Law; provided, however, that if
any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn
or lost his or her right to appraisal and payment under Delaware Law, such
holder's shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, and such shares shall not be deemed
to be Dissenting Shares. Any payments required to be made with respect to the
Dissenting Shares shall be made by Buyer (and not the Company or Acquisition
Sub).

                  SECTION 1.9 Merger Closing. Subject to the satisfaction or, if
permissible, waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof, the
closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at 9:00 a.m., New York
City time, on a date determined in accordance with, in the case of the Forward
Merger, the third sentence of Section 1.3(c) hereof and, in the case of the
Reverse Merger, the proviso of the third sentence of Section 1.3(c) hereof, and
in each case at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, 4 Times
Square, New York, New York, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in
writing by the parties hereto (such date being the "Closing Date").

                            THE SURVIVING CORPORATION

                  SECTION 2.1 Certificate of Incorporation. The certificate of
incorporation of Acquisition Sub in the case of the Forward Merger, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with applicable law. The certificate of incorporation of the Company
in the case of the Reverse Merger shall be the certificate of incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation, amended at the Effective Time to read in its entirety
as the certificate of incorporation of Acquisition Sub as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in accordance with
applicable law.

                  SECTION 2.2 By-laws. The By-laws of Acquisition Sub in effect
at the Effective Time shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation until

                  SECTION 2.3 Officers and Board of Directors.

                             (a) From and after the Effective Time, the officers
of Acquisition Sub at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified in accordance with applicable law.

                             (b) The Board of Directors of the Surviving
Corporation effective as of, and immediately following, the Effective Time shall
consist of the members of the Board of Directors of Acquisition Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time.


                                   ARTICLE III

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

                  Except (i) as disclosed in the report on Form 10-K dated March
30, 2000 for the year ended December 31, 1999, the reports on Form 10-Q and Form
8-K filed by the Company since December 31, 1999 or the proxy statement dated
April 5, 2000, in each case in the form filed by the Company with the SEC prior
to the date of this Agreement or in such similar forms filed by the Company's
subsidiaries for such periods or, to the extent it is readily apparent that such
disclosure would be applicable hereto, in the disclosure schedules to the
Chris-Craft Merger Agreement or the UTV Merger Agreement, and (ii) as disclosed
in a separate disclosure schedule which has been delivered by the Company to
Buyer prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure
Schedule") (each section of which qualifies the correspondingly numbered
representation and warranty or covenant to the extent specified therein and such
other representations and warranties or covenants to the extent a matter in such
section is disclosed in such a way as to make its relevance to the information
called for by such other representation and warranty or covenant readily
apparent), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Buyer:

                  SECTION 3.1 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries.

                             (a) Each of the Company and its subsidiaries is a
corporation or entity duly incorporated or formed, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or formation and
has the requisite corporate power and authority and all necessary governmental
approvals to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business
as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to have such power,
authority and governmental approvals would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). Each of
the Company and its subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign
corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction in
which the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except
for such failures to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
The term "Company Material Adverse Effect" means any change, effect or
circumstance that is or is reasonably likely to be materially adverse to the
business,


                                       16
<PAGE>   25
operations, results of operations or financial condition of Chris-Craft and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole, other than any change, effect or circumstance
relating to or resulting from (i) general changes in the television broadcasting
industry, (ii) changes in general economic conditions or securities markets in
general, or (iii) this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or the
announcement thereof.

                             (b) Other than with respect to UTV (the
capitalization of which is described in Section 3.22 hereof) and its
subsidiaries, all the outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity or
voting interests of each subsidiary of the Company are owned by the Company, by
another wholly owned subsidiary of the Company or by the Company and another
wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of all pledges, claims,
liens, charges, encumbrances and security interests of any kind or nature
whatsoever (collectively, "Liens"), and are duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable. Except as set forth above or in Section 3.1(b) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule and except for the capital stock of, or other
equity or voting interests in, its subsidiaries, the Company does not own,
directly or indirectly, any capital stock of, or other equity or voting
interests in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture, association or other
entity.

                  SECTION 3.2 Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws.
The Company has made available to Buyer a complete and correct copy of the
Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the By-laws, each as amended to date,
of the Company. The Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws (or
equivalent organizational documents) of the Company and its subsidiaries are in
full force and effect. None of the Company or its subsidiaries is in material
violation of any provision of its Restated Certificate of Incorporation or
By-laws (or equivalent organizational documents).

                  SECTION 3.3   Capitalization.

                             (a) As of the date of this Agreement, the
authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 200,000,000 shares of Class
A Common Stock, 200,000,000 shares of Class B Common Stock, and 50,000,000
shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Preferred Stock"). At the
close of business on June 30, 2000, (i) 4,510,823 shares of Class A Common Stock
were issued and outstanding, 18,000,000 shares of Class B Common Stock were
issued and outstanding, and no shares of Preferred Stock were issued and
outstanding; (ii) no shares of Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock or
Preferred Stock were held by the Company in its treasury; and (iii) no shares of
Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock were reserved for issuance upon the
exercise of outstanding options to purchase such shares. Since January 31, 2000,
no shares of capital stock of the Company have been issued. As of the date of
this Agreement, except as set forth above, no shares of capital stock or other
voting securities of the Company are issued, reserved for issuance or
outstanding. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no securities, options,

Effect" shall be read so as not to include clause (iii) thereof.

required by the FCC to be filed or made with respect to the Company Stations and

notice would cause such a violation of or default under any loan or credit
agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, permit, concession,
franchise, license or any other contract, agreement, arrangement or
understanding, to which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties or
assets is bound, except for any such violations or defaults which would not,

and operation of the DTV Stations by the relevant deadline established by the

the SEC, and have heretofore made available to Buyer true and complete copies
of, all forms, reports, schedules, statements and other documents required to be

all information incorporated therein by reference, the "Company SEC Reports").
Except for UTV, no subsidiary of the Company is required to file any form,
report, schedule, statement or other document with the SEC. As of their
respective dates, the Company SEC Reports complied in all material respects with
the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to
such Company SEC Reports, and none of the Company SEC Reports at the time they
were filed contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The financial statements (including the related notes) included
in the Company SEC Reports comply as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") (except, in the case of
unaudited statements, as permitted by forms or rules of the SEC) applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the

Except as and to the extent set forth in Section 3.7 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Company and its subsidiaries do not have any liability or
obligation of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise)
other than liabilities and obligations which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 3.8 Absence of Certain Changes or Events.

when taken individually


                                       22
<PAGE>   31

have a Company Material Adverse Effect, including, to the extent covered by the
definition of such term set forth in Section 3.1 hereof, any adverse effect on
the Company's investment in UTV, and (b) since December 31, 1999 to the date of
this Agreement, (i) each of the Company and its subsidiaries has conducted its
businesses only in the ordinary course and in a manner consistent with past

any of its subsidiaries in its material accounting policies, practices and

2000), (D) any increase in the compensation payable or to become payable to any
corporate officers or heads of divisions of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, except in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice, or (E) any action, event, occurrence or transaction that would have
been prohibited by Section 5.1 hereof if this Agreement had been in effect since
December 31, 1999.

                  SECTION 3.9 Absence of Litigation. Except as disclosed in
Section 3.9 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there is no claim, action,
proceeding or investigation pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened against the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or any property or
asset of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, before any court, arbitrator or
Governmental Authority, in each case except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. None of the Company, any of
its subsidiaries nor any property or asset of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries is subject to any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree,
determination or award imposed by any court, arbitration or Governmental
Authority, in each case except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 3.10   Employee Benefit Plans.

                             (a) Section 3.10(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule lists each employee benefit plan, program, arrangement and contract
(including, without limitation, any "employee benefit plan," as defined in
Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
("ERISA") and any "multiemployer plans" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of
ERISA ("Multiemployer Plans")), maintained, contributed or required to be
contributed to by the Company, any of its subsidiaries or any trade or business
(whether or not incorporated) under common control with the Company within the
meaning of Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code ("ERISA Affiliate"), or
with respect to which the Company, any of its subsidiaries or any ERISA
Affiliate could incur liability under Section 4069 of ERISA (the "Company
Benefit Plans"), each, with respect to which current and former employees of the
Company and any of its subsidiaries (the "Company Employees") participate. No
Company Benefit Plan has ever been or is currently subject to or governed by the
Laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States or any State or
Commonwealth of the United States. The Company


                                       23
<PAGE>   32
has provided to Buyer a true and correct copy of each of the following
documents, including any amendments thereto, with respect to each Company
Benefit Plan, other than Multiemployer Plans: (i) the most recent annual report
(Form 5500) filed with the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), (ii) all plan
documents for such Company Benefit Plan, (iii) each trust agreement, insurance
contract or other funding vehicle relating to such Company Benefit Plan, (iv)
the most recent summary plan description for each Company Benefit Plan for which
a summary plan description is required, (v) the most recent actuarial report or
valuation relating to a Company Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, if
any, and (vi) the most recent determination letter, if any, issued by the IRS
with respect to any Company Benefit Plan qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code or voluntary employees' benefit association ("VEBA") qualified under
Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. Except as specifically provided in the foregoing
documents delivered to Buyer or except as otherwise contemplated by this
Agreement or except as disclosed in Section 3.10(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, there are no amendments to any Company Benefit Plan that have been
adopted or approved nor has the Company or any of its subsidiaries undertaken to
make any such amendments or to adopt or approve any new Plan. The Company will,
promptly following the date of this Agreement, request a copy of each Company
Benefit Plan that is a multiemployer plan within the meaning of Section 3(37) of
ERISA from the trustees of such multiemployer plan and the Company shall deliver
such copy of the plan to Buyer promptly upon its receipt thereof.

                             (b) Each Company Benefit Plan has been administered
in accordance with its terms and the terms of any applicable collective
bargaining or other labor union contract or agreement, and in compliance with
applicable laws. The Company, its subsidiaries and each ERISA Affiliate have
performed all obligations required to be performed by them under, are not in any
respect in default under or in violation of, and have no knowledge of any
default or violation by any party to, any Company Benefit Plans, except for any
defaults or violations which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. With respect to the Company Benefit Plans, no
event has occurred and no condition or set of circumstances exists, in
connection with which the Company, any of its subsidiaries or any ERISA
Affiliate is subject to any liability under the terms of such Company Benefit
Plans, ERISA, the Code or any other applicable Law except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. No
Company Benefit Plan (other than a Multiemployer Plan) is under audit or
investigation by any Governmental Authority nor has the Company, any subsidiary
or any ERISA Affiliate been notified of any audit or investigation. Neither the
Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has any actual or contingent liability under
Title IV of ERISA (other than the payment of premiums to the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation), including, without limitation, any liability in
connection with (i) the termination or reorganization of any employee benefit
plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or (ii) the withdrawal from any Multiemployer
Plan or Multiple Employer Plan (within the meaning of Section 400l(a)(3) and
4063, respectively, of the Code), and no fact or event exists which is
reasonably likely to give rise to any such liability, in each case except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

                             (c) The Company has made available to Buyer:  (i)
copies of all employment agreements with executive officers of the Company and
its subsidiaries; (ii) copies


                                       24
<PAGE>   33
of all severance agreements, programs and policies of the Company, any of its
subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate with or relating to the Company Employees;
and (iii) copies of all plans, programs, agreements and other arrangements of
the Company, any of its subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate with or relating to
the Company Employees which contain change in control provisions. Except as
disclosed in Section 3.10(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, or except as
otherwise contemplated by this Agreement neither the execution and delivery of
this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will
(i) result in any payment (including, without limitation, severance,
unemployment compensation, "golden parachute" or otherwise) becoming due to any
director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries from the
Company or any of its affiliates under any Company Benefit Plan or otherwise,
(ii) materially increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Company
Benefit Plan, (iii) result in any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting
of any material benefits, (iv) result in a restriction on Buyer's ability to
amend, modify or terminate any plan, (v) trigger a requirement for funding or
the acceleration of funding of any material benefits, (vi) commence a period
during which a subsequent termination of employment by a Company Employee will
entitle such Company Employee to benefits in excess of what would otherwise have
been required in the absence of the transactions contemplated hereby or (vii)
result in a reportable event within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for
which a notice requirement has not been waived. There are no outstanding options
to purchase Company Common Stock or any other equity security of the Company and
there are no other awards or grants outstanding that relate to the Company
Common Stock or other equity securities of the Company. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, except as set forth in Section 3.10(c) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, no amount paid or payable by the Company to any
employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as a
result of such transactions in conjunction with any other event) will be an
"excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

                             (d) Each Company Benefit Plan that is intended to
be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code or Section 401(k) of the Code has
timely received a favorable determination letter from the IRS covering all of
the provisions applicable to the Plan for which determination letters are
currently available that the Company Benefit Plan is so qualified and each trust
established in connection with any Company Benefit Plan which is intended to be
exempt from Federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code has
received a determination letter from the IRS that it is so exempt, and no fact
or event has occurred since the date of such determination letter or letters
from the IRS which is reasonably likely to adversely affect the qualified status
of any such Company Benefit Plan or the exempt status of any such trust. Each
Company Benefit Plan that is a VEBA meets the requirements of Section 501(c)(9)
of the Code.

                             (e) The Company and its subsidiaries have no
liability for life, health, medical or other welfare benefits to former
officers, directors or employees or beneficiaries or dependents thereof, except
for health continuation coverage as required by Section 4980B of the Code or
Part 6 of Title I of ERISA.



                                       25
<PAGE>   34
                             (f) There are no pending or threatened claims
(other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or
arbitrations which have been asserted or instituted, or to Company's knowledge,
no set of circumstances exists which may reasonably give rise to a claim or
lawsuit, against the Company Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect
to their duties to the Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the
Company Benefit Plans which could reasonably be expected to result in any
liability of the Company or any of the ERISA Affiliates to the Pension Benefit

affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action, has failed to take any action
or knows of any fact, agreement, plan or other circumstance that is reasonably
likely to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code; provided, however, that the foregoing
representation is made only as of the date hereof in the case of the Reverse
Merger. The preceding sentence excludes all transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

                  SECTION 3.16 Title to Properties; Assets. Neither the Company
nor any of its subsidiaries owns, or has any material interest in, (i) any
material assets in Australia or (ii) any television, media or other broadcasting
assets in Australia. Except in each case as, individually or in the aggregate,
(i) as of the date of this Agreement, would not materially adversely affect the
operation of the broadcasting facilities of the Company's subsidiaries' New York
or Los Angeles television stations and (ii) would not have a Company Material
Adverse Effect:

                             (a) Each of the Company and its subsidiaries has
good, marketable fee simple title to its owned properties and assets or good and
valid leasehold interests in all of its leasehold properties and assets together
with full legal and practical access to all of its properties except for such as

disposed of in the ordinary course of business. All such properties and assets,
other than properties and assets in which the Company or any of its subsidiaries
has a leasehold interest, are free and clear of all Liens.

                             (b) Each of the Company and its subsidiaries has
complied with the terms of all leases to which it is a party and under which it
is in occupancy, and all deeds in respect of property which it owns, and all
such leases and deeds are in full force and effect. Section 3.16(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a description of (i) each lease to which
it is a party relating to its television broadcasting, (ii) all other leases to
which it is a party in which the annual rental payments exceed $250,000 or which
contemplate aggregate payments in excess of $500,000 and (iii) each deed under
which it is the owner; and a copy of each such lease or deed, as applicable, has
previously been provided to Buyer. The Company and its subsidiaries enjoy
peaceful and undisturbed possession under all such leases. There are no facts
that would prevent Buyer or any of its subsidiaries from using or occupying all
of the leased and owned property referred to in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii)
above, after the Effective Time, in the same manner such leased and owned
property is used or occupied by the Company or its subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

                             (c) The assets of the Company and each of its

has caused such assets to be maintained in accordance with good business
practice, and all of such assets are in good operating condition and repair and
are suitable for the purposes for which they are used and intended.

effect that, as of the date of such opinion, the Merger Consideration is fair to
the stockholders of the Company (other than Chris-Craft) from a financial point
of view, and the Company will deliver a copy of such opinion to Buyer promptly
after the date of this Agreement.

                  SECTION 3.19 Vote Required. At the Stockholders' Meeting, the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the
outstanding Common Stock voting together as a single class are the only votes of
the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Company necessary to
adopt this Agreement.

                  SECTION 3.20 Brokers. The Company Financial Advisor has
entered into a letter of engagement with the Special Committee in connection
with the Merger, a copy of which has previously been provided to Buyer. Except
as disclosed in Section 3.20 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no broker,
finder or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finder's or other fee

of the Company has taken all action necessary to render inapplicable to the

on any matters on which stockholders of Buyer may vote. Except as set forth
above, there are no contracts of any kind to which Buyer or any of its
subsidiaries is a party or by which Buyer or any of its subsidiaries is bound
obligating Buyer or any of its subsidiaries to issue, deliver or sell, or cause

Preferred Stock against the deposit of Buyer Preferred Stock in accordance with
the terms of the Deposit Agreement, the Buyer Shares to be issued in the Merger

and clear of all Liens, and the persons in whose names the Buyer Shares are
registered will be entitled to the rights of registered holders of Buyer Shares
specified in the Deposit Agreement, and the Buyer Shares will conform in all
material respects to the description of the Buyer Shares set forth on the proxy

been satisfied, conflict with or violate any Law or the Listing Rules (the "ASX
Listing Rules") of the Australian Stock Exchange Limited ("ASX") applicable to
Buyer or any of its subsidiaries or by which any property or asset of Buyer or
any of its subsidiaries is bound or affected or (iii) result in any breach of or

subsidiaries pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture or credit
agreement, or, to Buyer's knowledge as of the date of this Agreement, any other,
contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or

subsidiaries is bound or affected, except, in the case of clauses (i)(B), (ii)
and (iii), for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other
occurrences of the type referred to above which would not have a Buyer Material
Adverse Effect and would not prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
Merger; provided, however, that for purposes of this Section 4.5(a), the
definition of Buyer Material Adverse Effect shall be read so as not to include
clause (iii) of the definition thereof.

applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act, Blue Sky Laws,

shareholders (the "Buyer Shareholder Approval") with respect to the Listing Rule
10.1 of the ASX Listing Rules (the "ASX Waiver") and except where failure to
obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such
filings or notifications, would not have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect and
would not prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Merger; provided,
however, that for purposes of this Section 4.5(b), the definition of Buyer
Material Adverse Effect shall be read so as not to include clause (iii) of the
definition thereof.

      SECTION 4.7 Buyer SEC/ASX Reports. Buyer has filed with the SEC and ASX
all forms, reports, schedules, statements and other documents required to be
filed with the SEC and ASX by Buyer since January 1, 1997 (together with all
information incorporated therein by reference, the "Buyer Reports"). As of their
respective dates, the Buyer Reports complied in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or the ASX Listing Rules,
as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder applicable to such Buyer Reports, and none of the Buyer Reports at
the time they were filed contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. The financial statements (including the related
notes) of Buyer included in the Buyer Reports comply as to form in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC or the ASX with respect thereto, have been prepared in
accordance with Australian generally accepted accounting principles with
appropriate reconciliation to GAAP as required by SEC rules (except, in the case
of unaudited statements, as permitted by forms or rules of the SEC) applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the
notes thereto) and fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of Buyer and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates
thereof and their consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the
periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal and
recurring year-end audit adjustments). Buyer and its subsidiaries do not have
any liability or obligation of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent
or otherwise) other than liabilities and obligations which, individually or in
the aggregate, would not have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 4.8 Absence of Certain Changes or Events.

         (a) Since December 31, 1999, except as contemplated by this Agreement,
there has not been any change, event or circumstance which, when taken
individually or together with all other changes, events or circumstances, has
had or would have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect, and (b) since December 31,
1999 to the date of this Agreement, each of


                                       36
<PAGE>   45
Buyer and its subsidiaries has conducted its businesses only in the ordinary
course and in a manner consistent with past practice.

     SECTION 4.9 Tax Matters. None of Buyer or any of its affiliates has
taken or agreed to take any action, has failed to take any action or knows of
any fact, agreement, plan or other circumstance that is reasonably likely to
prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code; provided, however, that the foregoing representation
is made only as of the date hereof in the case of the Reverse Merger. The
preceding sentence excludes all transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

     SECTION 4.10 Brokers. No broker, finder or investment banker (other
than Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, Inc.) is entitled to any brokerage, finder's
or other fee or commission in connection with the Merger based upon arrangements
made by or on behalf of Buyer.

     SECTION 4.11 Interim Operations of Acquisition Sub. In the case of the
Reverse Merger, Acquisition Sub will be a newly formed indirect subsidiary of
Buyer or a newly formed subsidiary of Chris-Craft (unless the Chris-Craft Merger
has not occurred prior to the Effective Time), will be a Delaware corporation
and, when formed, will have been formed solely for the purpose of engaging in
the transactions contemplated hereby, the Chris-Craft Merger and the UTV Merger,
as applicable, and will have engaged in no business other than in connection
with such transactions and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
the case of the Forward Merger, Acquisition Sub will be News Publishing
Australia Limited, a Delaware corporation, of which Buyer directly owns and will
continue to own at least 80% of the total combined voting power of all classes
of stock entitled to vote and 80% of the total number of shares of each other
class of stock of such corporation.

         (a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement,
(i) the Company shall prepare and shall cause to be filed with the SEC a proxy

"Proxy Statement") relating to the meeting of the Company's stockholders to be
held to consider the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger
and (ii) Buyer shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on
the appropriate form (together with all amendments thereto, the "Registration
Statement") in which the Proxy Statement shall be included as a prospectus, in
connection with the registration under the Securities Act of the Buyer Shares to
be issued to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to the Merger. In addition
to the foregoing, Buyer shall make such other appropriate filings and deliveries
as may be required by applicable law (including any applicable prospectus
delivery requirements thereof). Each of Buyer and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become effective
at such time as they shall agree, and, prior to the effective date of the
Registration Statement, Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to take all or
any action required under any applicable Federal or state securities Laws in
connection with the issuance of Buyer Shares pursuant to the Merger. If
requested by the SEC, each of the Forward Merger and the Reverse Merger shall be
submitted to the Company's stockholders at the Stockholders' Meeting (as defined

         (b) The Proxy Statement shall include the recommendations of the
Special Committee and the Board of Directors of the Company to the stockholders
of the Company in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of
the Merger; provided, however, that the Special Committee and the Board of
Directors of the Company may take or disclose to the stockholders of the Company
a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or
make any disclosure required under applicable Law and may, prior to the date of

or change any such recommendation to the extent that the Special Committee or
the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith that such
withdrawal, modification or change is required in order to comply with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law after receiving advice to such effect from
independent legal counsel (who may be the Company's regularly engaged outside
legal counsel). Unless this Agreement is previously terminated in

or directors, should be discovered by the Company which, pursuant to the
Securities Act or Exchange Act, should be set forth in an amendment or a
supplement to the Registration Statement or Proxy Statement, the Company shall
promptly inform Buyer. All documents that the Company is responsible for filing
with the SEC in connection with the Merger will comply as to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the

Meeting"), for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement and
approval of the Merger, and the Company shall hold the Stockholders' Meeting as
soon as practicable after the date on which the Registration Statement becomes
effective. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Stockholders' Meeting to occur on the same day as the meetings of stockholders
are held to consider the Chris-Craft Merger and the UTV Merger. The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies
in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger, and shall
take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote of its
stockholders, required by the NYSE or Delaware Law, as applicable, to obtain
such approvals; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to
solicit proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement at its Stockholders'
Meeting (but shall nonetheless remain obligated to submit this Agreement to a
vote of its stockholders) to the extent that the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith that such failure to solicit proxies is
required in order to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law after
receiving advice to such effect from independent legal counsel (who may be such
party's regularly engaged outside legal counsel).

         (b) Without limiting the provisions of Section 4.4 hereof, Buyer shall,
as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, obtain, and
cause its subsidiaries to obtain, all stockholder and other approvals, including
the Buyer Shareholder Approval if required, necessary to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation,
entering into and performing the agreements and transactions contemplated by
Section 6.18 hereof.

     SECTION 6.3 Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings.

         (a) Each of the parties hereto shall (i) make promptly its respective
filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions under the HSR Act
with respect to the transactions contemplated herein and (ii) make promptly
filings with or applications to the FCC with respect to the transactions
contemplated herein (the "FCC Application"). The parties hereto will use their
respective reasonable best efforts to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated herein and to cause the conditions to the Forward
Merger and, if a Restructuring Trigger has occurred, the Reverse Merger, in each
case as set forth in Article VII to be satisfied (including using reasonable
best efforts to obtain all licenses, permits, consents, approvals,
authorizations, waivers, qualifications and orders of Governmental Authorities
as are necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein),
and will do so in a manner designed to obtain such regulatory clearance and the
satisfaction of such conditions as expeditiously as reasonably possible;
provided, however, that Buyer and FTH shall have the right to make all decisions
concerning any divestiture commitments necessary to comply with the FCC's
multiple ownership rules set forth at 47 C.F.R. Section 73.3555) as in effect on
the date of this Agreement (the "FCC Multiple Ownership Rules"); provided, that
Buyer and FTH shall


                                       44
<PAGE>   53
regularly consult with the Company during the processes referred to in this
Section 6.3 and consider in good faith the views of the Company with respect
thereto; and provided, further, that, in connection with the Merger, Buyer and
FTH shall not seek a waiver of Section 73.3555 of the FCC's rules except for a
temporary waiver of subsections (b), and (e) thereof for a period not to exceed
twelve months from the Closing Date for television divestitures required in
order to obtain the FCC Consent (as defined in Section 7.1(e) hereof) and, with
respect to subsection (d) thereof, in the FCC Application when it is filed,
Buyer will (1) maintain that no waiver is required to permit it to own a
newspaper and two television stations in the New York market, and (2) request in
the alternative, if that position is rejected or a permanent waiver is not
issued by the FCC, a temporary waiver to hold the two television stations and
newspaper for a period not to extend beyond the date which is the later of (A)
twelve months from the Closing Date and (B) the conclusion of any then pending
FCC rule making proceeding regarding 47 C.F.R. Section 73.3555(d); provided,
that the foregoing sentence shall be subject to the provisions of subsection (b)
below. Failure to obtain any of the waivers set forth above shall not limit
Buyer's obligations pursuant to subsection (b) below.

         (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement other
than the following sentence, the Company and Buyer and FTH each agree to take
promptly any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment and obtain all consents or waivers under any antitrust, competition
or communications or broadcast Law that may be validly required by any U.S.
federal, state or local antitrust or competition Governmental Authority, or by
the FCC or similar Governmental Authority, or by any Australian Law, in each
case with competent jurisdiction, so as to enable the parties to close the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as expeditiously as reasonably
possible, including committing to or effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
orders, trust, or otherwise, the sale or disposition of such of its assets or
businesses as are required to be divested in order to obtain the FCC Consent (as
defined below), or to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of or
vacate or lift, any decree, order, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining
order or other order in any suit or proceeding by or with any Governmental
Authority (each, an "Order"), that would otherwise have the effect of preventing
or materially delaying the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) neither Buyer
nor FTH shall be required to divest any of its material assets or accept any
material limitation on any of its material businesses other than (x) the
divestiture of such broadcast assets (i.e., newspaper and television stations)
as it is required to divest or (y) the material limitation on such broadcast
assets or Buyer's and FTH's operation thereof as it is required to be subject
to, in the case of each of clauses (x) and (y) in order to comply with the FCC
Multiple Ownership Rules or a final Order in an action brought by an antitrust
or competition or FCC or similar Governmental Authority, (ii) notwithstanding
clause (i), neither the Company, Buyer nor FTH shall be required to divest or to
hold separate, or to accept any substantial limitation on the operation of, or
to waive any rights material to, the Los Angeles television station of Buyer or
the Company (each of the actions described in clause (i) and (ii) above being an
"Adverse Condition"), (iii) neither party shall be required to take any of the
foregoing actions if such action is not conditioned on the consummation of the
Merger and (iv) without limiting Buyer's obligations set forth herein, the
Company shall not agree to any of the foregoing without Buyer's


                                       45
<PAGE>   54
consent and, at Buyer's request, the Company shall agree to any of the foregoing
so long as such agreement is conditioned upon consummation of the Merger.

         (c) Each of Buyer, FTH and the Company shall give (or shall cause its
respective subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and Buyer, FTH
and the Company shall use, and cause each of its subsidiaries to use, its
reasonable best efforts to obtain any third party consents not covered by
paragraphs (a) and (b) above, necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
Forward Merger or, if a Restructuring Trigger has occurred, the Reverse Merger;
provided that neither Buyer nor FTH shall be required to pay, and the Company
shall not pay, without Buyer's prior written consent, any material consideration
to obtain any such third party consent. Each of the parties hereto will furnish
to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other
may request in connection with the preparation of any required governmental
filings or submissions and will cooperate in responding to any inquiry from a
Governmental Authority, including immediately informing the other party of such
inquiry, consulting in advance before making any presentations or submissions to
a Governmental Authority, and supplying each other with copies of all material
correspondence, filings or communications between either party and any
Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement.

     SECTION 6.4 Access to Information; Confidentiality.

         (a) From the date hereof to the Effective Time, Buyer will comply with
the reasonable requests of the Company to make officers available to respond to
the reasonable inquiries of the Company in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to make available information regarding Buyer
and its subsidiaries as the Company may reasonably request.

         (b) From the date hereof to the Effective Time, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law and contracts, the Company will provide to Buyer (and its
officers, directors, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, agents
and other representatives, collectively, "Representatives") access to all
employees, sites, properties, information and documents which Buyer may
reasonably request regarding the business, assets, liabilities, employees and
other aspects of the Company; provided, however, that the Company shall not be
required to provide access to any employees, sites, properties, information or
documents which would breach any agreement with any third-party or which would
constitute a waiver of the attorney-client or other privilege by the Company.

         (c) Except with respect to matters related to the hiring of employees
and the solicitation for hiring of employees, which matters shall be governed by
the provisions of Section 6.17 hereof, the parties hereto shall comply with, and
shall cause their respective Representatives to comply with all of their
respective obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement dated September 16,
1999 between Buyer and Chris-Craft, as supplemented by the Addendum to the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated August 7, 2000 (as so supplemented, the
"Confidentiality Agreement"); provided that, following any termination of this
Agreement, Section 6.17 hereof shall be of no further force or effect.


                                       46
<PAGE>   55
         (d) No investigation pursuant to this Section 6.4 shall affect any
representation or warranty in this Agreement of any party hereto or any
condition to the obligations of the parties hereto.

     SECTION 6.5 No Solicitation of Competing Transactions.

         (a) The Company shall not, directly or indirectly, through any officer,
director, agent or otherwise, initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage
(including by way of furnishing non-public information), or take any other
action knowingly to facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal that
constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Competing Transaction
(as defined below), or enter into or maintain or continue discussions or
negotiate with any person or entity in furtherance of such inquiries or to
obtain a Competing Transaction, or agree to or endorse any Competing
Transaction, or authorize any of the officers, directors or employees of the
Company or any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or
other agent or representative of the Company to take any such action, and the
Company shall notify Buyer as promptly as practicable of all of the relevant
material details relating to all inquiries and proposals which the Company or
any such officer, director, employee, investment banker, financial advisor,
attorney, accountant or other agent or representative may receive relating to
any of such matters, provided, however, that prior to the adoption of this
Agreement and the approval of the Merger by the stockholders of the Company,
nothing contained in this Section 6.5 shall prohibit the Board of Directors of
the Company from (i) furnishing information to, or entering into and engaging in
discussions or negotiations with, any person that makes an unsolicited proposal
that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Company's financial advisors and independent legal
counsel, can be reasonably expected to result in a Superior Proposal; provided
that prior to furnishing such information to, or entering into discussions or
negotiations with, such person, the Company (1) provides notice to Buyer to the
effect that it is furnishing information to, or entering into discussions or
negotiations with, such Person and provides, in any such notice to Buyer in
reasonable detail the identity of the Person making such proposal and the
material terms and conditions of such proposal, and (2) has received from such
person or entity an executed confidentiality agreement or (ii) complying with
Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to a tender or
exchange offer or making any disclosure required under applicable Law.

         (b) For purposes of this Agreement, "Competing Transaction" shall mean
any of the following involving the Company: (i) any merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination, issuance or purchase of securities or other
similar transaction other than transactions specifically permitted pursuant to
Section 5.1 of this Agreement; (ii) any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge,
transfer or other disposition of the assets of the Company in a single
transaction or series of related transactions; (iii) any tender offer or
exchange offer for the Company's securities or the filing of a registration
statement under the Securities Act in connection with any such exchange offer;
in the case of clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above, which transaction would result
in a third party (or its stockholders) acquiring more than 25% of the voting
power of the capital stock then outstanding or more than 25% of the assets of


                                       47
<PAGE>   56
the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; or (iv) any public
announcement of an agreement, proposal, plan or intention to do any of the
foregoing, either during the effectiveness of this Agreement or at any time
thereafter.

     For purposes of this Agreement, a "Superior Proposal" means any
proposal made by a third party which would result in such party (or in the case
of a parent-to-parent merger, its stockholders) acquiring, directly or
indirectly, including pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, share purchase, asset
purchase, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture or similar
transaction, more than 50% of the voting power of the capital stock then
outstanding or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, for consideration which the Board of Directors
of the Company determines in its good faith judgment, after consultation with
independent legal counsel and its financial advisors, to be more favorable to
the Company's stockholders than the Merger.

     SECTION 6.6 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance.

         (a) The Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving
Corporation shall contain the provisions with respect to indemnification set
forth in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Company on
the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of individuals who at any time prior to the
Effective Time were officers, directors or employees of the Company in respect
of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including,
without limitation, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), unless
such modification is required by law.

         (b) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain (or cause to be
maintained) in effect for six years from the Effective Time directors' and
officers' liability insurance covering those persons who are currently covered
by the Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy on terms
comparable to such existing insurance coverage; provided, however, that in no
event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend pursuant to this
Section 6.6 more than an amount per year equal to 300% of current annual
premiums paid by the Company for such insurance; and provided further that if
the annual premiums exceed such amount, Buyer shall be obligated to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available for an annual cost not exceeding
such amount.

         (c) In addition to the other rights provided for in this Section 6.6
and not in limitation thereof (but without in any way limiting or modifying the
obligations of any insurance carrier contemplated by Section 6.6(b)), from and
after the Effective Time, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law (the "Indemnifying
Party"), (i) indemnify and hold harmless (and release from any liability to
Buyer or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective subsidiaries), the
individuals who, on or prior to the Effective Time, were officers, directors or
employees of the Company or served on behalf of the Company as an officer,
director or employee of any of the Company's current or former subsidiaries or
affiliates (including, without limitation, those affiliates listed in Section


                                       48
<PAGE>   57
6.6(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (collectively, "Covered Affiliates")
or any of their predecessors in all of their capacities (including as
stockholder, controlling or otherwise) and the heirs, executors, trustees,
fiduciaries and administrators of such officers, directors or employees (the
"Indemnitees") against all Expenses (as defined hereinafter), losses, claims,
damages, judgments or amounts paid in settlement ("Costs") in respect of any
threatened, pending or completed claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether
criminal, civil, administrative or investigative, based on, or arising out of or
relating to the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, employee or
stockholder (controlling or otherwise) of the Company or any of its current or
former subsidiaries or Covered Affiliates or any of their predecessors arising
out of acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time (including,
without limitation, in respect of acts or omissions in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (an "Indemnifiable Claim";
except for acts or omissions which involve conduct known to such Person at the
time to constitute a material violation of Law); provided that the Surviving
Corporation and Buyer shall not be responsible for any amounts paid in
settlement of any Indemnifiable Claim without the consent of Buyer and the
Surviving Corporation; and (ii) advance to such Indemnitees all Expenses
incurred in connection with any Indemnifiable Claim (including in circumstances
where the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of such claim) promptly
after receipt of reasonably detailed statements therefor; provided that, the
person to whom Expenses are to be advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to
indemnification from Buyer or the Surviving Corporation. Any Indemnifiable Claim
shall continue until such Indemnifiable Claim is disposed of or all judgments,
orders, decrees or other rulings in connection with such Indemnifiable Claim are
fully satisfied. Except as otherwise may be provided pursuant to any Indemnity
Agreement, the Indemnitees as a group may retain only one law firm with respect
to each related matter except to the extent there is, in the opinion of counsel
to an Indemnitee, under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict
on any significant issue between positions of any two or more Indemnitees;
provided that any law firm or firms so retained shall be reasonably acceptable
to Buyer. The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume and control the
defense of any potential Indemnifiable Claim at its expense and through counsel
of its choice if it gives notice of its intention to do so to the Indemnified
Party within 30 days of its receipt of notice from the Indemnified Party that a
potential Indemnifiable Claim has been made and so long as it unconditionally
agrees in writing (x) to indemnify fully and indefinitely, subject only to
limitations required by applicable Law, and (y) not to seek repayment of any
Expenses advanced (unless such repayment would otherwise be available pursuant
to clause (ii) of the first sentence of this Section 6.6(c) solely because such
matter was excluded from the definition of Indemnifiable Claim pursuant to the
exception contained in the definition thereof appearing immediately prior to the
initial proviso in this subsection) from, the Indemnitees in respect of such
potential Indemnifiable Claim, and acknowledges in writing its obligation to do
so under this Section; provided, however, that, if there exists or is reasonably
likely to exist a conflict of interest that would make it inappropriate in the
judgment of the Indemnified Party, in its reasonable discretion, for the same
counsel to represent both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, then
the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain its own counsel at the expense
of the Indemnifying Party. In the event that the Indemnifying Party exercises
the right to undertake any such defense against any such Indemnifiable Claim as
provided above, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying
Party in such defense and make


                                       49
<PAGE>   58
available to the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party's expense, all
witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the Indemnified
Party's possession or under the Indemnified Party's control relating thereto as
is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party. Similarly, in the event the
Indemnified Party is, directly or indirectly, conducting the defense against any
such Indemnifiable Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with the
Indemnified Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnified Party,
at the Indemnifying Party's expense, all such witnesses, records, materials and
information in the Indemnifying Party's possession or under the Indemnifying
Party's control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnified
Party. No such Indemnifiable Claim may be settled by any Indemnified Party
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent will
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. For the purposes of this Section 6.6,
"Expenses" shall include reasonable attorneys' fees and all other reasonable
costs, charges and expenses paid or incurred in connection with investigating,
defending, being a witness in or participating in (including on appeal), or
preparing to defend, be a witness in or participate in any Indemnifiable Claim,
but shall exclude damages, losses, claims, judgments and amounts paid in
settlement. The term "Indemnitees" shall exclude persons who both (x) were
serving as officers or directors or employees of the Covered Affiliates listed
on Section 6.6(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule at the request of an entity
other than the Company or one of its current or former subsidiaries, or any
predecessor thereto, and (y) are not otherwise an Indemnitee.

         (d) Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 9.1 hereof to the
contrary, this Section 6.6 shall survive the consummation of the Merger
indefinitely, is intended to benefit each Indemnitee, shall be binding, jointly
and severally, on all successors and assigns of Buyer, the Surviving Corporation
and its subsidiaries, and shall be enforceable by the Indemnitees and their
successors. In the event that Buyer or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person or (ii) transfers all or substantially all
of its properties or assets to any Person, then, and in each case, the
successors and assigns of Buyer or the Surviving Corporation or its subsidiary,
as the case may be, shall expressly assume and be bound by the indemnification
obligations set forth in this Section 6.6.

         (e) The obligations of the Surviving Corporation, its subsidiaries and
Buyer under this Section 6.6 shall not be terminated or modified in such a
manner as to adversely affect any Indemnitee to whom this Section 6.6 applies
without the consent of such affected Indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that
the Indemnitees to whom this Section 6.6 applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 6.6).

     SECTION 6.7 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give
prompt notice to Buyer, and Buyer shall give prompt notice to the Company, of
(i) the occurrence, or nonoccurrence, of any event the occurrence, or
nonoccurrence, of which would be likely to cause (x) any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate or (y) any
covenant, condition or agreement contained in this Agreement not to be complied
with or satisfied or (z) the Forward Merger not to be consummated and (ii) any
failure of the Company or Buyer, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice


                                       50
<PAGE>   59
pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

     SECTION 6.8 Tax Matters. Buyer and Chris-Craft shall submit any filings
or documents necessary to obtain the IRS Ruling and shall engage, through their
representatives in any communications with the IRS and Buyer and, on behalf of
the Company, Chris-Craft shall control the process of obtaining the IRS Ruling.
Buyer and the Company shall make reasonable best efforts to obtain the IRS
Ruling, the tax opinions set forth in Sections 7.2(f) and 7.3(c) hereof, and the
FCC Consent, including taking any reasonable actions requested by the IRS or the
FCC in connection with obtaining the IRS Ruling and the FCC Consent and
cooperating in preparing and submitting any filings and documents to the IRS and
the FCC in a prompt manner. In the case of the Forward Merger (a) the Agreement
is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 1.368-2(g) of the income tax regulations promulgated under the Code; (b)
neither the Company nor Buyer nor their affiliates shall directly or indirectly
(without the consent of the other) take any action, that would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the intended tax treatment of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (c) officers of Buyer, Acquisition Sub and the
Company shall execute and deliver to (i) Squadron, Ellenoff, Plesent & Sheinfeld
LLP, tax counsel to Buyer, and Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays & Handler, LLP,
counsel to the Company, certificates substantially in the form agreed to by the
parties as of the date hereof and other appropriate representations at such time
or times as may be reasonably requested by such law firms, including
contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement and at the Effective
Time, in connection with their respective deliveries of opinions, pursuant to
Sections 7.2(f) and 7.3(c) hereof, with respect to the tax treatment of the
Merger and (ii) Squadron, Ellenoff, Plesent & Sheinfeld LLP, counsel to Buyer
and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, counsel to Chris-Craft, such
representations as are required by the IRS in order to issue the IRS Ruling; and
(d) none of the Buyer, Acquisition Sub or the Company shall take or cause to be
taken any action which would cause to be untrue (or fail to take or cause not to
be taken any action which would cause to be untrue) any of such certificates and
representations.

     SECTION 6.9 Stock Exchange Listing. Buyer and the Company shall (a) as
promptly as reasonably practicable prepare and submit to the NYSE an application
covering the Buyer Shares to be issued in the Merger, and shall use their
reasonable best efforts to cause such securities to be approved for listing on
the NYSE prior to the Effective Time, (b) within two business days after the
Effective Time, prepare and submit to ASX, pursuant to the applicable listing
rules of the ASX, applications covering the Buyer Preferred Stock underlying the
Buyer Shares issued pursuant to the Merger and cause such securities to be
approved for quotation by the ASX, and (c) promptly seek the ASX Waiver or, if
the ASX Waiver is not granted, as soon as possible thereafter call a special
meeting of shareholders to obtain the Buyer Shareholder Approval) and take all
actions and prepare all documents and shareholder materials required in
connection therewith.

<PAGE>   60
                  SECTION 6.10 Public Announcements. Buyer and the Company shall
consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any
public statements with respect to this Agreement and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement without the prior consent of the
other (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as
may be required by Law or any listing rules of, or listing agreement or
arrangement with, a national securities exchange or the ASX to which Buyer or
the Company is a party. The parties have agreed on the text of a joint press
release by which Buyer and the Company will announce the execution of this
Agreement.

                  SECTION 6.11 Affiliates of the Company. The Company represents
and warrants to Buyer that prior to the date of the Stockholders' Meeting the

without limitation, all directors and executive officers of the Company, and the
Company represents and warrants to Buyer that the Company has advised the
persons identified in such letter of the resale restrictions imposed by
applicable securities laws. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain from each person identified in such letter a written agreement,
substantially in the form of Exhibit A. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain as soon as practicable from any person who may be deemed
to have become an affiliate of the Company after the Company's delivery of the
letter referred to above and prior to the Effective Time, a written agreement
substantially in the form of Exhibit A.

                  SECTION 6.12 Employee Matters.

                           (a) During the one-year period commencing on the
Effective Date, Buyer shall provide or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide to each Company Employee employee benefits (including incentive
opportunities but excluding benefits under equity-based plans) that are either
(i) in the aggregate, substantially comparable to the benefits being provided to
Company Employees as of the date of this Agreement under the Company Benefit
Plans or (ii) substantially similar to those being provided to similarly
situated employees of the Buyer (other than for former employees of the
Company).

                           (b) Without limiting the generality of paragraph (a)
of this Section 6.12, if the Effective Time occurs prior to December 31, 2000,
(1) each Company Employee who received an annual bonus in respect of 1999 and is
eligible to receive an annual bonus for the year 2000 and who, is employed by
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be entitled to
receive, in lieu of any other bonus to which the participant may otherwise be
entitled under such plan, or for the period from January 1, 2000 through the
Effective Time, as the case may be, a prorated bonus (the "Pro-Rata Bonus"),
determined by multiplying (i) the participant's annual bonus in respect of 1999
by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the number of days in
calendar year 2000 through and including the Effective Time and the denominator
of which is 366 and (2) each such Company Employee who remains employed with the
Company (or its successor) or any affiliate thereof through December 31, 2000,
shall be entitled to receive an additional bonus such that, when added to such
employee's Pro-Rata Bonus, such employee's aggregate annual bonus in respect of
2000 is not less than such employee's annual bonus in respect of 1999. Such
annual bonus with respect of 2000 shall be payable at


                                       52
<PAGE>   61
such time that annual bonuses are normally paid to similarly situated employees
of the Company. If the Effective Time occurs during the calendar year 2001, then
the process described in (i) of the preceding sentence shall apply in an
analogous manner to the Company's 2001 Bonus Plan and to other employees who
receive an annual bonus in respect of the year 2000, with the references to the
year 2000 therein being deemed to be references to the year 2001 and with
references to the year 1999 therein being deemed to be references to the year
2000 and subject to Section 6.12(a), the process for determining the bonus for
those who remain employed on and after the Effective Time through December 31,
2001 shall be determined in the discretion of the Buyer.

                           (c) Without limiting the generality of paragraph (a)
of this Section 6.12, with respect to each Surviving Corporation plan and such
other employee benefit plans as may be maintained for Company Employees from
time to time following the Effective Time by Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or
any subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation (including, without limitation,
plans or policies providing severance benefits and vacation entitlement), and
service with the Company and any of its subsidiaries (or a predecessor to the
Company's or any of its subsidiaries' business or assets) shall be treated as
service with the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, as
the case may be, to the extent recognized in the comparable plans of the Company
for purposes of determining eligibility to participate and vesting but not for
purposes of benefit accrual. Such service also shall apply for purposes of
satisfying any waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements, or the
application of any preexisting condition limitations. In the event Company
Employees are transferred to a new health plan maintained by the Surviving
Corporation effective as of a date within the annual plan year for purposes of
accumulating annual deductibles, copayments and out-of-pocket maximums, Company
Employees shall be given credit for amounts they have paid under a corresponding
benefit plan during the new health plan's year in which the Company Employees
are transferred for purposes of applying deductibles, copayments and
out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with
the terms and conditions of the benefit plan maintained by Surviving Corporation
or any of its subsidiaries. Buyer shall also honor, or cause the Surviving
Corporation to honor, all vacation, personal and sick days accrued by the
Company Employees under the plans, policies, programs and arrangements of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time to
the extent reserved against the Company's financial statements.

                           (d) Without limiting the generality of paragraph (a)
of this Section 6.12, the Surviving Corporation shall, or shall cause its
subsidiaries to, honor, in accordance with their terms, and shall, or shall
cause its subsidiaries to, make required payments when due under, all Company
Benefit Plans maintained or contributed to by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party
(including, but not limited to, employment, incentive and severance agreements
and arrangements), that are applicable with respect to any Company Employee or
any director of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (whether current, former
or retired) or their beneficiaries; provided, however, that, subject to the
provisions of Section 6.12(e) of the Chris-Craft Disclosure Schedule, the
foregoing shall not preclude the Surviving Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries from amending or terminating any Company Benefit Plan in accordance
with its terms.

                  SECTION 6.13 Letters of the Company's Accountants. The Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered to Buyer two
"comfort" letters in customary form from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the
Company's independent public accountants, one dated a date within five business
days before the date on which the Registration Statement shall become effective
and one dated a date within five business days before the Closing Date, each
addressed to Buyer.

                  SECTION 6.14 Letters of Buyer's Accountants. Buyer shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered to the Company two "comfort"
letters in customary form from Arthur Andersen LLP, Buyer's independent public
accountants, one dated a date within five business days before the date on which
the Registration Statement shall become effective and one dated a date within
five business days before the Closing Date, each addressed to the Company.

                  SECTION 6.15   [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED].

                  SECTION 6.16 Other Merger Agreements. Buyer shall comply with
its obligations under the Chris-Craft Merger Agreement and the UTV Merger
Agreement. The Company shall comply with its obligations under the Voting
Agreement related to the UTV Merger.

                  SECTION 6.17 Employee Solicitation. In addition to, and not in
limitation of any restrictions on the parties hereto contained in other
documents, the parties hereto agree that during the period from the date hereof
to the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the consummation of the
Merger, neither they nor any of their controlled affiliates shall solicit for
employment any current senior management level employees or any of the three (3)
highest compensated on air talent employees at each station of the other party
hereto. This Section 6.17 shall govern in the event of any inconsistency between
this Section 6.17 and Section 6.4 hereof.

                  SECTION 6.18 Post-Closing Covenant of Buyer. As of or promptly
following the Effective Time, in the event of the Forward Merger (as defined in
the Chris-Craft Merger Agreement) under the Chris-Craft Merger Agreement Buyer
shall cause such assets as Buyer shall determine, but at a minimum shall include
the broadcast assets and related liabilities held or previously held by the
Company and its subsidiaries, to be transferred to and assumed by one or more
direct or indirect subsidiaries of Buyer, and shall cause such assets and
liabilities to be ultimately held by a newly formed subsidiary which is
controlled by Buyer within the meaning of Section 368(c) of the Code ("Newco")
of Fox Entertainment Group, Inc. ("FEG"). As of or promptly following the
Effective Time, Newco and either FTH or a wholly owned subsidiary will enter
into the Newco-FTH Agreement (as hereinafter defined). The Newco-FTH Agreement
shall be an agreement prepared by Buyer and FTH as soon as practicable after the
date hereof and in any event no later than August 31, 2000 which (i) reflects
and is consistent with the terms set forth on Exhibit C hereto and (ii)
otherwise is as Buyer and FTH shall determine, but which is consistent with the
objective of obtaining the FCC Consent (without an Adverse Condition) with
respect to the Forward Merger and, if the Chris-Craft Merger is to be effected
as a Forward Merger (as defined in the Chris-Craft Merger Agreement), with
respect to the Chris-Craft Merger,


                                       54

and the IRS Ruling; provided that it shall not contain any provisions as to
which Chris-Craft or, if the Merger is to be effected as a Forward Merger, the
Company reasonably objects by reason of concerns as to the Federal income tax
treatment of the Chris-Craft Merger or, if the Merger is a Forward Merger, the
Forward Merger, or the ability to obtain the FCC Consent (without any Adverse
Condition) or the IRS Ruling for the Forward Merger or, if the Chris-Craft
Merger is to be effected as a Forward Merger (as defined in the Chris-Craft
Merger Agreement), for the Chris-Craft Merger. Buyer and FTH shall comply with
this Section 6.18 in a manner deemed appropriate by Buyer and FTH; provided,
that Buyer and FTH shall act in a manner that preserves (i) the qualification of
the Merger or the Chris-Craft Merger, as the case may be, as a reorganization
under Section 368(a) of the Code and (ii) the effectiveness and validity of the
FCC Consent (as defined below). In the event (and only in the event) that the
Merger is a Reverse Merger and the Chris-Craft Merger is a Reverse Merger (as
defined in the Chris-Craft Merger Agreement), as of or promptly following the
Effective Time, the broadcast assets and related liabilities held by the Company
and its subsidiaries (or the Company and its subsidiaries themselves by way of
merger) will be transferred to and assumed by FTH or one or more direct or
indirect subsidiaries thereof. The foregoing processes contained in this Section
6.18 and the actions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to constitute
"transactions contemplated by this Agreement" for purposes of Buyer's
representations and warranties herein.

                  SECTION 6.19 Form of Merger. In the event that there is a
Ruling Failure or an FCC Failure (each, a "Restructuring Trigger"), then the
Merger shall be effected as the Reverse Merger and not as the Forward Merger
and, in lieu of News Publishing Australia Limited, a newly formed indirect
subsidiary of Buyer (which could, at the election of Buyer, be a subsidiary of
Chris-Craft unless the Chris-Craft Merger has not occurred prior to the
Effective Time) shall be Acquisition Sub and Buyer shall cause such Acquisition
Sub to execute a counterpart signature page to this Agreement and become a party
hereto; provided, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Chris-Craft Merger
is to be effected as a Forward Merger (as defined in the Chris-Craft Merger
Agreement), then such Acquisition Sub shall be a first-tier subsidiary of Buyer
that is controlled by Buyer within the meaning of Section 368(c) of the Code. In
the event that, following the occurrence of a Restructuring Trigger and prior to
the Effective Time, subsequent events occur such that the conditions to
effecting the Forward Merger are all satisfied, then the Merger shall occur as
if such Triggering Event had never occurred. For purposes of this Agreement, a
"Ruling Failure" shall be deemed to have occurred (i) if the IRS Ruling (as
defined herein) is not obtained on or prior to the seven-month anniversary of
the submission of the ruling request to the IRS (unless a responsible officer of
the IRS has indicated to representatives of both the Company and Buyer that the
IRS Ruling is likely to be issued within the next succeeding three months and
such IRS Ruling is so issued within such three-month period) in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to each of the parties hereto or (ii) a
responsible officer of the IRS has indicated to representatives of both
Chris-Craft and Buyer prior to the three-month anniversary of this Agreement
that the IRS Ruling, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to each of
the parties hereto, is not likely to be issued, and such indication shall not
have been reversed or withdrawn prior to the five-month anniversary of the date
of this Agreement or (iii) either Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays & Handler, LLP or
Squadron, Ellenoff, Plesent & Sheinfeld LLP indicates in writing to Chris-Craft
and Buyer that it will not be able to deliver its respective opinion pursuant to
Section 7.3 or Section 7.2, as the case may be. For purposes of this Agreement,
an


                                       55
<PAGE>   64
"FCC Failure" shall be deemed to have occurred (i) if the FCC Consent (without
an Adverse Condition) is not obtained on or prior to the ten-month anniversary
of this Agreement (unless a responsible officer of the FCC has indicated to
representatives of both the Company and Buyer that the FCC Consent (without an
Adverse Condition) will be issued within the next succeeding two months and such
FCC Consent is so issued within such two-month period) in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to each of the parties hereto or (ii) a responsible
officer of the FCC has indicated to representatives of both the Company and
Buyer that the FCC Consent, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
each of the parties hereto, will not be issued and, prior to the three-month
anniversary of this Agreement, such indication shall not have been reversed or
withdrawn; provided that no FCC Failure shall have occurred if a responsible
officer of the FCC has indicated (and subsequently not withdrawn or changed such
indication) to representatives of both the Company and Buyer that the sole
reason or reasons for the FCC Consent (without an Adverse Condition) not having
been obtained does not relate in any manner to whether the Merger is the Forward
Merger or the Reverse Merger and that there is no material greater likelihood of
obtaining the FCC Consent (without an Adverse Condition) with respect to the
Reverse Merger than the Forward Merger.

                  SECTION 6.20 Advance of Funds. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall (and shall be permitted
to) advance funds to Chris-Craft on an as needed basis, including, without
limitation, to pay any and all fees and expenses payable by Chris-Craft in
connection with the Chris-Craft Merger; provided, however, that any such
advances shall be made pursuant to short term loans on arms-length terms and
must be repaid no later than 30 days after consummation of the Merger, unless
the Chris-Craft Merger has also been consummated.

                  SECTION 6.21 Obligations of FTH. In view of the fact that one
or more subsidiaries of FTH would become the licensees of the Company Stations
under either the Forward Merger or the Reverse Merger and would otherwise
benefit from either merger, FTH agrees that it shall take such actions, and
shall cause its subsidiaries to take such actions, as may be necessary to
accomplish the requirements of FTH under Sections 6.3, 6.18 and 6.19 hereof and
any other requirements of this Agreement relating to the effectuation of, or
transactions to be accomplished immediately following, the Forward Merger and
the Reverse Merger, as the case may be.

                            CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER

<PAGE>   65
                           (b) any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act
relating to the Merger shall have expired or been terminated;

                           (c) no Governmental Authority or court of competent

Law, rule, regulation, executive order or Order which is then in effect and has
the effect of making the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibiting the
consummation of the Merger;

                           (d) the Registration Statement shall have been
declared effective, and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement shall be in effect and no proceedings for such purpose
shall be pending before or threatened by the SEC;

                           (e) the FCC Consent (as defined below) shall have
been obtained. "FCC Consent," as used herein, means action by the FCC granting
its consent to the assignment or to the transfer of control of the FCC licenses
of the Company and UTV to FTH (or a wholly owned subsidiary of FTH), including
transfer of those authorizations, licenses, permits, and other approvals, issued
by the FCC, and used in the operation of the Company Stations, pursuant to
appropriate applications filed by the parties with the FCC, as contemplated by
this Agreement;

                           (f) all other authorizations, consents, waivers,
orders or approvals for the Merger required to be obtained, and all other
filings, notices or declarations required to be made, by Buyer and the Company
prior to the consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereunder, shall have been obtained from, and made with, all required
Governmental Authorities, including the ASX Waiver or, if the ASX Waiver is not
granted, the Buyer Shareholder Approval, and except for such authorizations,
consents, waivers, orders, approvals, filings, notices or declarations the
failure to obtain or make which would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Company Material Adverse Effect or Buyer Material Adverse Effect;
provided, however, that a party who has failed to fulfill its obligations under
Section 6.3 hereof shall not be entitled to deem this Section 7.1(e) unsatisfied
by reason of such non-fulfillment;

                           (g) the Buyer Shares issuable to the Company's
stockholders in the Merger shall have been authorized for listing on the NYSE,
subject to official notice of issuance;

                           (h) the Chris-Craft Merger shall have occurred or the
stockholders of Chris-Craft shall have failed to approve the Chris-Craft Merger
at a duly held stockholders' meeting called for such purpose or at any
adjournment or postponement thereof; and

                           (i) all conditions to all parties' obligations to
consummate the UTV Merger, except completion of the UTV Merger, shall have been
satisfied or waived; provided, however, that this condition may not be enforced
by a party if such party's actions or failure to act has prevented the
conditions to the consummation of the UTV Merger from being satisfied; and
provided further that this condition may not be enforced by the Company by
reason of the failure


                                       57
<PAGE>   66
to obtain the requisite stockholder vote by the stockholders of UTV at a duly
held stockholders' meeting called for such purpose or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof.

                  SECTION 7.2 Conditions to the Obligations of Buyer. The
obligations of Buyer to consummate the Merger are subject to the satisfaction or
waiver by Buyer of the following further conditions:

                           (a) each of the representations and warranties of the
Company contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality shall be
true and correct, and each of the representations and warranties of the Company
contained in this Agreement that are not so qualified shall be true and correct
in all material respects, in each case as of the date of this Agreement and as
of the Effective Time with the same effect as though made as of the Effective
Time (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case
as of such date), and the Buyer shall have received a certificate signed on
behalf of the Company by the chief executive officer or chief financial officer
of the Company to such effect;

                           (b) the Company shall have performed or complied in
all material respects with all material agreements and covenants required by
this Agreement to be performed or complied with by it on or prior to the
Effective Time, and Buyer shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of

Company to such effect;

in the letter referred to in Section 6.11 an executed copy of an agreement
substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto;

                           (d) Buyer shall have received evidence, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to it, that Buyer or the Company shall have
obtained (i) all material consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications

qualifications and orders of Governmental Authorities or third parties required
(other than those set forth in Section 7.2(d) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule) for the consummation of the Merger, except, in the case of this clause
(ii), for those the failure of which to be obtained individually or in the
aggregate could not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect or a Buyer Material Adverse Effect; provided, however, that if Buyer has
failed to fulfill its obligations under Section 6.3 hereof it shall not be
entitled to deem this Section 7.2(d) unsatisfied by reason of such
non-fulfillment;

                           (e) [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]

                           (f) In the case of the Forward Merger, Buyer shall
have received (i) the opinion of Squadron, Ellenoff, Plesent & Sheinfeld LLP, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, dated as of the Closing
Date, on the basis of facts, representations and assumptions set forth in such
opinion, the IRS Ruling, and certificates obtained from officers of Buyer,
Acquisition Sub and the Company, all of which are consistent with the state of
facts


                                       58
<PAGE>   67
existing as of the Effective Time, to the effect that (A) the Merger will
qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code,
(B) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, no income, gain or loss will be
recognized by Buyer, Acquisition Sub and the Company as a result of the Merger,
and (C) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, no income, gain or loss will be

received and may rely upon the certificates and representations referred to in
Section 6.8 hereof; and

                           (g) the FCC Consent shall not contain any Adverse
Condition.

                  SECTION 7.3 Conditions to the Obligations of the Company. The
obligations of the Company to consummate the Merger are subject to the
satisfaction or waiver by the Company of the following further conditions:

                  (a) each of the representations and warranties of Buyer
contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality shall be true
and correct, and each of the representations and warranties of Buyer contained
in this Agreement that are not qualified shall be true and correct in all
material respects, in each case as of the date of this Agreement and as of the
Effective Time with the same effect as though made on and as of the Effective
Time (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case
as of such date), and the Company shall have received a certificate signed on

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                        TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

                  SECTION 8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and
the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time,
notwithstanding any requisite adoption of this Agreement and approval of the
Merger, as follows:

                           (a) by mutual written consent duly authorized by the
Boards of Directors of each of Buyer and the Company;

                           (b) by either Buyer or the Company, if the Effective
Time shall not have occurred on or before 15 months from the execution of this
Agreement (the "Termination Date");

                           (c) by the Company, upon a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Buyer or FTH set
forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Buyer shall
have become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in Section
7.3(a) or (b) cannot be satisfied on or before the Termination Date (a
"Terminating Buyer Breach");

                           (d) by Buyer, upon breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this
Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of the Company shall have become
untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in Sections 7.2(a) or
(b) cannot be satisfied on or before the Termination Date ("Terminating Company
Breach");

                           (e) by either Buyer or the Company, if any
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have issued an Order or
taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such Order or
other action shall have become final and nonappealable;

                           (f) by Buyer or the Company if the approval of the
Merger by the stockholders of the Company required for the consummation of the
Merger as set forth in Section 7.1(a) shall not have been obtained by reason of
the failure to obtain such required vote at a duly held Stockholders' Meeting or
at any adjournment or postponement thereof provided, however, the Company shall
not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(f)
if the breach by Chris-Craft of the Voting Agreement is the reason for such
failure;

                           (g) by Buyer or the Company if the Chris-Craft Merger
Agreement shall have been terminated; provided, however, that a party shall not
have the right to terminate the Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(g) if its
actions or failure to act shall have prevented


                                       60
<PAGE>   69
the consummation of the Chris-Craft Merger; provided, further, that the Company
shall not have the right to terminate the Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.1(g) if the Chris-Craft Merger shall have been terminated as a result of the
failure of the Chris-Craft stockholders to approve the Chris-Craft Merger at a
duly held stockholders meeting called for such purpose or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof; or

                           (h) by Buyer or the Company if the UTV Merger
Agreement shall have been terminated; provided, however, that a party shall not
have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(h) if
its actions or failure to act shall have prevented the consummation of UTV
Merger; and provided further that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 8.1(h) may not be enforced by the Company by reason of the
failure to obtain the requisite stockholder vote by the stockholders of UTV at a
duly held stockholders' meeting called for such purpose or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof.

                  SECTION 8.2 Effect of Termination. Subject to Sections 8.5 and
9.1 hereof, in the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void, there shall be no liability
under this Agreement on the part of Buyer, FTH or the Company or any of their
respective officers or directors and all rights and obligations of each party
hereto shall cease; provided, however, that nothing herein shall relieve any
party from liability for the willful breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement.

                  SECTION 8.3 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by mutual
agreement of the parties hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their
respective Boards of Directors at any time prior to the Effective Time;
provided, however, that, after the adoption of this Agreement and the approval
of the Merger by stockholders of the Company, there shall not be any amendment
that by Law requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company without
the further approval of such stockholders and provided further that any such
amendment must also be approved by the Special Committee. This Agreement may not
be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto.

hereunder.
