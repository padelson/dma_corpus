or the Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser, as the case may be, such information and other data

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(a)&nbsp;any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of Seller contained in
<U>ARTICLE III</U> or <U>ARTICLE IV</U> of this Agreement, which representations and warranties
shall be deemed to have been made as of the date hereof (as modified by the Seller Disclosure
Schedules) and as of the Closing Date (as modified by the Seller Disclosure Schedules but excluding
any modified, updated or supplemented items disclosed in the Updated Seller Disclosure Schedules);
or


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;any breach of any covenant or agreement made by the Seller or Company in this Agreement;
and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(c)&nbsp;any foreign, federal, state or local income Taxes imposed on or payable by any of the
Acquired Companies for any Pre-Closing Period or pre-Closing portion of any Straddle Period,
excluding any such taxes that have been accrued for on the Closing Statements.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">8.3. <U>Indemnification by Purchaser</U>. Following the Closing, the Purchaser shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Seller, its Affiliates and respective officers, directors,
employees, agents, successors and assigns (each a &#147;<U>Seller Indemnified Party</U>&#148; and
collectively, the &#147;<U>Seller Indemnified Parties</U>&#148;) from and against any and all Losses,
arising out of or resulting from:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(a)&nbsp;any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of the Purchaser contained
in <U>ARTICLE V</U> of this Agreement, which representations and warranties shall be deemed to
have been made as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date ; or


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;any breach of any covenant or agreement made by the Purchaser in this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">8.4. <U>Limitations</U>. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement (other than claims for actual fraud or breach of any Fundamental Rep which, in each
instance, shall not be subject to the limitations set forth in this <U>Section&nbsp;8.4</U>):


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(a)&nbsp;The maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses arising out of or resulting from the
causes enumerated in <U>Section&nbsp;8.2(a) and (b)</U> that may be recovered from Seller shall not
exceed the amounts then remaining in the Escrow Fund.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;No indemnification by the Seller with respect to any Loss otherwise payable under
<U>Section&nbsp;8.2(a)</U> and no indemnification by the Purchaser with respect to any Loss otherwise
payable under <U>Section&nbsp;8.3(a)</U>, shall in either case be payable (i)&nbsp;with respect to any
individual Loss unless such Loss is in excess of two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.00)
(and no such individual Loss shall be counted toward the &#147;Basket&#148; (as defined below) and (ii)&nbsp;until
such time as all such indemnifiable Losses shall aggregate to more than five hundred thousand
dollars ($500,000.00) (the &#147;<U>Basket</U>&#148;), after which time the Seller or the Purchaser (as the
case may be) shall be liable in full for all indemnifiable Losses in excess of the Basket, subject
to subsection (a)&nbsp;above.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">8.5. <U>Indemnification Procedures</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(a)&nbsp;The obligations and liabilities of the Seller and the Purchaser under this <U>ARTICLE
VIII</U> with respect to Losses arising from claims of any third party which are subject to the
indemnification provided for in this <U>ARTICLE VIII</U> (&#147;<U>Third Party Claims</U>&#148;) shall be
governed by and contingent upon the terms and conditions set forth in this <U>Section&nbsp;8.5</U>. If
any Purchaser Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party (the &#147;<U>Indemnified Party</U>&#148;), as
the case may be, shall receive notice of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall give
the Seller or the Purchaser (each, the &#147;<U>Indemnifying Party</U>&#148;), as the case may be, notice of
such Third Party Claim within ten (10)&nbsp;days after the receipt by the Indemnified Party of such
notice; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the failure to provide such notice shall not
release the Indemnifying Party from any of its respective obligations under this <U>ARTICLE
VIII</U> except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure.
The notice of claim shall describe in reasonable detail the facts known to the Indemnified Party
giving rise to such indemnification claim, and the amount or good faith estimate of the amount
arising therefrom.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume and control the defense of such Third
Party Claim at its expense and through counsel of its choice if it gives written notice of its
intention to do so to the Indemnified Party within fifteen (15)&nbsp;days of the receipt of such notice
from the Indemnified Party and the Third Party Claim involves money damages and not an injunction
or other equitable relief that could have an adverse effect on the Acquired Companies and the
Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing its liability to the Indemnified Party under this
Article&nbsp;VIII and agrees to indemnify the Indemnified Party in accordance with the terms of Article
VIII, subject to the Indemnifying Party&#146;s right to rescind its assumption of the defense and
acceptance of liability of such Third Party Claim; provided, however, if there exists or is
reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest that would make it inappropriate in the judgment
of the Indemnified Party in its sole and absolute discretion for the same counsel to represent both
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
retain its own counsel in each jurisdiction for which counsel is required, at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party. In the event that the Indemnifying Party exercises the right to undertake any
such defense against any such Third Party Claim as provided above, the Indemnifying Party shall
conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently and the Indemnified Party
shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnifying
Party, at the Indemnifying Party&#146;s expense, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and
information in the Indemnified Party&#146;s possession or under the Indemnified Party&#146;s control relating
thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party. Similarly, in the event the
Indemnified Party is, directly or indirectly, conducting the defense against any such Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in such defense and make
available to the Indemnified Party, at the Indemnifying Party&#146;s expense, all such witnesses,
records, materials and information in the Indemnifying Party&#146;s possession or under the Indemnifying
Party&#146;s control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnified Party. No such Third
Party Claim may be settled by any party conducting the defense against such claim without the prior
written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld;
provided, however, Seller shall have the right to settle any claim for which it is the
Indemnifying Party without the prior written consent of any other party if such settlement provides
for a complete and unconditional release of the Indemnified Party, does not include any admission
of culpability and involves only the payment of money damages.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">8.6. <U>Determination of Losses</U>. The Parties shall make appropriate adjustments for Tax
benefits and insurance coverage in determining Losses for purposes of this <U>ARTICLE VIII</U>.
All indemnification payments under this <U>ARTICLE VIII</U> shall be deemed adjustments to the
Purchase Price. The Purchaser will (and will cause the Acquired Companies to) use commercially
reasonable efforts to seek full recovery under applicable insurance policies covering any Losses to
the same extent as they would if such Losses were not subject to indemnification under this
Agreement. In addition, the amount of Losses for which indemnification is provided under this
Agreement shall be net of the amount of any specific reduction to the Net Working Capital or Net
Worth made prior to the Closing and attributable to the subject matter in dispute.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">8.7. <U>Exclusive Remedy</U>. Except in the case of claims for actual fraud or breach of any
Fundamental Rep: (a)&nbsp;the Parties acknowledge and agree that the foregoing indemnification
provisions in the ARTICLE VIII shall be the exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Parties with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b)&nbsp;the Purchaser agrees that its
right to indemnification pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII shall be limited solely and exclusively to
the Escrow Amount. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, no Member of Seller shall be liable to any Purchaser Indemnified Party except for
claims for intentional fraud by such Member.


<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt"><B>ARTICLE IX<BR>
TERMINATION</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">9.1. <U>Termination of Agreement</U>. This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be abandoned at any time prior to the Closing as provided below:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(a)&nbsp;by mutual written consent of Seller and Purchaser;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;the Seller may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the Purchaser at any
time prior to the Closing Date if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before ninety (90)&nbsp;days
after the date of this Agreement (the &#147;<U>Termination Date</U>&#148;), by reason of the failure of any
condition precedent under <U>Section&nbsp;7.2</U> hereof, (unless the failure of the Closing to occur
on or prior to the Termination Date results primarily from the Seller or the Company breaching any
of their representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement); and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(c)&nbsp;the Purchaser may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the Seller at any
time prior to the Closing Date if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before the Termination
Date, by reason of the failure of any condition precedent under <U>Section&nbsp;7.1</U> hereof,
(unless the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to the Termination Date results primarily
from the Purchaser breaching any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this
Agreement).


<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt">9.2.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%"><U>Effect of Termination</U>. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to <U>Section
9.1</U> above, all rights and obligations of the Parties hereunder shall terminate without any
liability of any Party to any other Party, except as provided in <U>Section&nbsp;9.3 herein</U>;
<U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, (i)&nbsp;that the confidentiality provisions contained in <U>Section
6.5</U> and <U>Article&nbsp;X</U> above shall survive any such termination; and (ii)&nbsp;that no such
termination shall relieve any party hereto from liability for any breach by such party of any
covenant or obligation set forth in this Agreement. If Seller elects the Reverse Break-up Fee in
<U>Section&nbsp;9.3</U>, Purchaser&#146;s obligation to pay the Reverse Break-up Fee and Seller&#146;s right to
enforce that obligation shall survive the termination of this Agreement. If Seller pursues the
specific performance remedy in <U>Section&nbsp;9.3</U> then this Agreement shall remain in effect until
the final resolution of Seller&#146;s specific performance action.<U>Break-Up Fee</U>. If the
conditions to Purchaser&#146;s obligation to consummate the Closing (as set forth in <U>Section
7.1</U>) are satisfied (other than those conditions that can only be satisfied at Closing and that
are capable of being satisfied at Closing) and the Closing does not occur (other than through the
failure of Seller or the Company to comply with their obligations under this Agreement) within five
(5)&nbsp;Business Days of Purchaser&#146;s receipt of written notice from Seller that Seller and the Company
are ready to consummate the Closing, at Seller&#146;s election and in Seller&#146;s sole discretion, Seller
shall have the right to elect (1)&nbsp;to obtain specific performance as provided for in <U>Section
10.12</U> of the Agreement and to obtain any additional relief provided for by law or equity, other
than monetary damages; or (2)&nbsp;to require Purchaser to pay to the Company in immediately available
funds on such fifth (5th) Business Day an amount equal to Seventy Five Million Dollars
($75,000,000) (the &#147;<U>Reverse Break-up Fee</U>&#148;). Seller shall notify Purchaser of its remedy
election on said (5th) Business Day. If Seller elects to receive the Reverse Break-up Fee and it
is paid in full, and only in such event, then (i)&nbsp;neither Purchaser nor any of its directors,
officers, employees, partners, managers, members, shareholders or Affiliates (each a &#147;<U>Purchaser
Affiliate</U>&#148;), shall be subject to (nor shall Seller, the Company or their respective Affiliates
seek to recover) monetary damages in excess of the Reverse Break-up Fee, and (ii)&nbsp;Seller, the
Company and their respective Affiliates shall be precluded from any other remedy against Purchaser
or any Purchaser Affiliate, at law or in equity or otherwise, and none of Seller, the Company and
their respective Affiliates shall seek to obtain any recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind,
including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against Purchaser or any Purchaser
Affiliate in connection with this Agreement and the transaction contemplated hereby. If Seller
elects the specific performance remedy, but a court determines that Seller is not entitled to
specific performance, then Seller shall be awarded the Reverse Break-up Fee. The parties hereto
agree that the monetary damages that Seller will suffer as the result of the Closing not taking
place cannot be measured with accuracy and that monetary damages alone will not make Seller whole.
The parties hereto further agree that the Reverse Break-up Fee, however, represents a fair and
reasonable estimation of the minimum amount of monetary damages for breach of contract that would
result to Seller in the event of a termination by Seller pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;9.3</U> under
the circumstances described in this last paragraph of this <U>Section&nbsp;9.3</U>.

Purchaser as part of the express representations and warranties set forth in <U>Article&nbsp;III</U>,
the Purchaser acknowledges that (w)&nbsp;there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such
projection and forecasts, (x)&nbsp;it is familiar with such uncertainties, (y)&nbsp;it is taking full
responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all such projections
and forecasts so furnished to it and (z)&nbsp;it shall have no claim against any Person with respect
thereto other than a claim for actual fraud.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">10.4. <U>Succession and Assignment</U>. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the Parties named herein and their respective successors and permitted assigns. No
