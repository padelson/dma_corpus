Statement_ ") setting forth Sellers good faith estimate of the Companys Net

Miller will also determine the final coal inventory on the Closing Date.

Objection Notice pursuant to _Section 2.5(c)_. If Purchaser does not deliver

binding upon Purchaser and Seller.   

(c) _Review by Auditor_. If the Purchaser gives the Seller a timely Purchaser
Objection Notice to the Closing Statements, then the Seller and the Purchaser
shall use their reasonable best efforts to resolve any such objection. If a
written resolution is not obtained within thirty (30) days after the Seller
has received the Purchaser Objection Notice, the issue(s) in dispute will
be submitted to the Auditor for resolution, which resolution will be limited
to determining whether Purchasers or Seller position is correct. The
determination of the Auditor shall be set forth in a written notice
delivered, as promptly as practicable after the issue(s) in dispute have
been submitted to the Auditor, to the Purchaser and the Seller by the Auditor
and will be final, binding and conclusive on the parties. The Purchaser and

the Auditor for such determination. The Purchaser and the Seller will use all
reasonable efforts to cause the Auditor to render its decision as promptly as
practicable, including without limitation by promptly complying with all
reasonable requests by the Auditor for information, books, records and
similar items.

plus the amount, if any, by which Closing Date Net Working Capital exceeds
the Reference Net Working Capital, or minus the amount, if any, by which the
Reference Net Working Capital exceeds the Closing Date Net Working
Capital.

calculation of Closing Date Net Worth and Closing Date Net Working Capital
becomes final pursuant to _Section 2.5(b) or (c)_ : (i) Purchaser shall pay
to Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by Seller, an amount equal to the amount, if any, by which the
Final Purchase Price exceeds the Purchase Price, as adjusted for the
Estimated Adjustment Amount, or (ii) Seller shall pay to Purchaser, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
Purchaser, an amount equal to the amount, if any, by which the Purchase Price,
as adjusted by the Estimated Adjustment Amount, exceeds the Final Purchase

this _Section 2.5(f)_ being referred as the " _Adjustment Payment_ ", in
either case, (x) together with interest on the Adjustment Payment at the

any, to the Purchaser of the Adjustment Payment in accordance with _Section
2.5(f)_ and to satisfy any Loss(es) incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties under _ARTICLE VIII,_ in the event Seller fails to pay such amounts
as required under Section 2.5(f)(ii) above, (and shall be the Purchasers
sole recourse with respect to any such indemnifiable Loss(es) under ARTICLE

amount of any funds disbursed by the Escrow Agent to Purchaser from
the Escrow Account, under the terms of the Escrow Agreement, with regard to
the obligations of Seller to Purchaser under Section 2.5(f)(ii), will be

Purchaser that the Escrow Agent may be required to disburse all or a portion
of the Escrow Fund (such claimed amount, the " _Claim Amount_ ") to the
Purchaser pursuant to _Section 8.2_, then the portion of the Escrow Fund
subject to such Claim Notice shall continue to be held by the Escrow Agent
until the Claim Amount with respect thereto has been resolved. The amount of

under the terms of the Escrow Agreement, with regard to the indemnification
obligations of Purchaser to Seller under Section 6.2 and Section 7.2(g) will
be replaced by Purchaser depositing such amounts back into the Escrow Fund
within five (5) business days from the date of Escrow Agents release of such
funds to Seller. As soon as any dispute with respect to such Claim Amount has
been resolved in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, the
Escrow Agent shall be instructed to disburse such portion of the Escrow
Fund, if any, as is required to be disbursed to Purchaser pursuant to
_Section 8.2_ in connection with such Claim Amount, and the Escrow Agent

complete and accurate list of all real property, including mineral rights,
leased or subleased by an Acquired Company (collectively, the " _Leased
Real Property_ "). Collectively the Owned Real Property and the Leased Real
Property are the " _Real Property_." Seller has delivered or made available
to Purchaser true, accurate and complete __ copies of all of the deeds,
leases and other instruments (as recorded, including all amendments thereto)
to which an Acquired Company is a party, and copies of all title
opinions, maps and surveys in the possession of the Acquired Companies
relating to such Real Property. The Owned Real Property includes the surface
estate only and does not include any coal or mineral estate. The Real
Property includes all real property (surface, coal or otherwise) necessary
to conduct the business of the Acquired Companies as currently conducted in
the Ordinary Course of Business on the Closing Date. None of the Acquired
Companies has any interest in any other real property other than the Real
Property. The Acquired Companies have good and marketable title to the
surface of the Owned Real Property and good and marketable leasehold title to
the Leased Real Property, free and clear of any Liens, but subject to the
Permitted Exceptions. Except as provided in the respective Coal Leases, each
Coal Lease demising the Leased Real Property to the Acquired Companies
demises all of the coal in such lands covered by the applicable Coal Lease. No
third parties (other than the landlords or sub-landlords under the Coal
Leases covering the Leased Real Property) have any right to receive any
royalties or other compensation in respect of the coal mined on the Leased
Real Property by the Acquired Companies. Each Coal Lease demising the
Leased Real Property is senior and superior of record, both in time and
right, to any monetary Lien that encumbers either a Fee Owners fee simple
coal interests in, or a Sub-landlords coal leasehold of, the Leased Real
Property, and the foreclosure of any such monetary Liens will not, by
operation of law or otherwise, terminate such Coal Lease or dispossess the
Acquired Company of its rights in the Leased Real Property under such Coal
Lease.   

(b) _Schedule 3.13(b)_ sets forth all Liens on the Real Property of which
the Company has Knowledge. The Company has not received notice that any
buildings, plants, and structures owned or leased by the Acquired Companies
do not lie wholly within the boundaries of the Real Property owned or leased
by the Acquired Companies, or encroach upon the property of, or
otherwise conflict with the property rights of, any other Person.   

(c) None of the Acquired Companies has received any notice of, nor does the
Company have any Knowledge of, any actual or threatened reduction or
curtailment of any utility service supplied to the Real Property. None of the
Acquired Companies has received any notice of, nor does the Company have any
Knowledge of, any violation of any Law affecting the use or occupancy of the
Real Property.   

(d) There are no Proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened, against or relating to the any Acquired Companys ownership or
leasehold of subleasehold interest in the Real Property (including, without
limitation, any Proceeding for the taking or condemnation of all or any
portion of the Real Property or Proceeding relating to the title to the mining
rights leased by the Acquiring Companies in any coal lease of the Leased Real
Property).   

(e) There are no encroachments from or upon property adjoining the Real
Property, or upon any easements located on the Real Property, that would have
a Material Adverse Effect.   

(f) The Acquired Companies have adequate rights of ingress and egress to and
from the Real Property and public roads in order to conduct their business in
all material respects as it is currently being conducted.   

(g) _Personal Property and Equipment._ A list of the personal property,
equipment and fixed assets owned or leased by the Acquired Companies having a
book value in excess of $50,000.00, identifying the Acquired Company that
owns such personal property, is set forth on _Schedule 3.13(g)_. Each
Acquired Company has marketable title to the personal property owned by
it, subject to the Liens set forth on _Schedule 3.13(g)_. Except as set
forth in _Schedule 3.13(g)_ , the tangible personal property owned or leased
by the Acquired Companies constitute all of the tangible personal property
used to operate the business of the Acquired Company as of the date hereof.
_Schedule 3.13(g)_ identifies all tangible personal property owned by
any Acquired Company that is leased to a contractor for the Acquired
Companies.   

(h) Seller has made available to Purchaser all material studies in the
Companys or any other Acquired Companys possession or control of the
quality and quantity of the coal reserves leased by the Acquired Companies
and all updates to such studies that were prepared by, or at the request
of, the Company or any other Acquired Company.   

(i) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.13(i),_ other than the Permitted
Exceptions, none of the Real Property is subject to lease to third
parties.   

(j) To the Companys Knowledge, each of the leases covering the Leased Real
Property, including coal leases, set forth on _Schedule 3.13(a)(ii)_, is in
full force and effect, and the lessee Acquired Company has received no notice
from the lessor thereof, and the Company does not have Knowledge of, any
condition which constitutes, or with notice or lapse of time or both would
constitute, a default by any Acquired Company thereunder.   

(k) Except as disclosed on _Schedule 3.13(k)_, each Acquired Companys use
and operation of the Real Property in the Ordinary Course of Business as
currently conducted does not violate, in any material respect, any Laws, and
all coal facilities on the Real Property are constructed, occupied and used
by the applicable Acquired Company in the Ordinary Course of Business
as currently conducted in compliance, in all material respects, with all
Laws.   

3.14. _Intellectual Property and Information Technology_.   

(a) The Acquired Companies do not own any Intellectual Property. Except for
the contracts set forth on _Schedule 3.15(ii)_ and as would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (i) each Acquired Company has

Intellectual Property necessary for the operation of the businesses of such
Acquired Company as presently conducted, and (ii) each item of Intellectual
Property owned or used by any Acquired Company immediately prior to the
Closing hereunder will be owned or available for use by such Acquired Company
on identical terms and conditions immediately subsequent to the
Closing hereunder. _Schedule 3.14_ hereto sets forth a complete and accurate
list of all material Intellectual Property licenses or agreements with a
third party to which any Acquired Company is a party, as either a licensee or
licensor, pursuant to which it grants or receives rights to Intellectual
Property or information technology related services (the " _Software Licenses_
"), except for licenses for commercially available "off the shelf"
software.   

(b) To the Knowledge of the Company, no Acquired Company has infringed upon
any Intellectual Property rights of third parties, and no Acquired Company
has received any complaint, claim, demand, or notice alleging any such
infringement (including any claim that such Acquired Company must license or
refrain from using any Intellectual Property rights of any third party),
except where any such infringement would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of the Company, no third party has
infringed in any material respect upon any Intellectual Property rights of
any Acquired Company.   

3.15. _Material Contracts_. _Schedule 3.15(i)_ lists the following contracts
and other agreements to which any Acquired Company is a party or is used in
the operations or businesses of the Acquired Companies as of the date

3.14_;   

(c) any agreement (or group of related agreements) under which it has created,
incurred, assumed, or guaranteed any indebtedness for borrowed money, or any

The Company has made available to the Purchaser a correct and complete copy of
each written agreement listed in _Schedule 3.15(i)_ (as amended to date).
With respect to each such agreement: (A) the agreement is legal, valid,
binding, enforceable, and to the Knowledge of the Company, is in full force
and effect, except as such enforcement may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or
similar laws affecting creditors rights generally and by general principles
of equity; (B) the agreement will continue to be legal, valid, binding,
enforceable, and in full force and effect on identical terms following
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby except as such

generally and by general principles of equity; and (C) to the Knowledge of
the Company, no party is in breach or default and no event has occurred which
with notice or lapse of time would constitute a breach or default, or permit
termination, modification, or acceleration, under the agreement, except for
any such breach or default that would not have a Material
Adverse Effect.   

Any contract necessary for the operations of the business of the Acquired
Companies that is not, as of the date of this Agreement, in the name of an

i. Each Employee Benefit Plan (and each related trust, insurance contract, or
fund) complies in form and in operation in all respects with the applicable
requirements of ERISA and the Code, except where the failure to comply would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   

ii. Neither Seller, any Acquired Company, any ERISA Affiliate, nor any of
their respective current or former directors, officers, Employee Benefit Plan
fiduciaries, employees or any other persons, has engaged directly or
indirectly in any "prohibited transaction," as such term is defined in

respect to any Employee Benefit Plan, other than for contributions, payments
or benefits due in the ordinary course or for other ordinary course expenses
under the Employee Benefit Plans currently sponsored by the Seller, any of
the Acquired Companies and ERISA Affiliates.   

iii. Each such Employee Benefit Plan which is an Employee Pension Benefit
Plan, that is intended to be qualified, is the subject of a determination or
opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that it meets
the requirements of Code Section 401(a) and nothing has occurred that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any
such Employee Benefit Plan. All such Employee Benefit Plans have been timely
amended to meet the requirements of the Code and applicable regulations and
guidance issued thereunder.   

iv. No Proceeding with respect to the administration or the investment of the
assets of any such Employee Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for
benefits and processing of qualified domestic relations orders) is pending,
except where the Proceeding would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.   

v. No Acquired Company nor any ERISA Affiliate is a party to, is required to,
nor has it or any one of them ever been required to, contribute with regard
to a "multiemployer plan" as defined under Sections 3(37)(A) or 4001(a)(3) of
ERISA, or Section 414(f) of the Code.   

vi. The Company has delivered or made available to the Purchaser correct and
complete copies of the current plan documents and all amendments thereto and
summary plan descriptions, the most recent determination or opinion letter
received from the Internal Revenue Service, the most recent Form 5500 Annual
Report, and all related trust agreements, insurance contracts, funding
agreements and other material documents which implement each such Employee
Benefit Plan.   

vii. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not (i) entitle any Continuing Employee to severance pay, unemployment
compensation or any other payment from the Acquired Companies or (ii)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount
of compensation due any Continuing Employee from the Acquired
Companies.   

viii. No payment due or to become due to any employee of an Acquired Company
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, by any
Acquired Company or ERISA Affiliate is or shall be an "excess parachute
payment" under Code Section 280G.

409A of the Code such plan has been maintained and administered in good faith
compliance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the guidance

the presence of selenium which reveals its existence in excess of
5 micrograms per liter or 5 parts per billion.   

(c) To the Knowledge of Seller, in submitting any application for a permit or

its behalf has submitted information in those applications which is accurate,
complete and truthful, and when acted upon will support the permitting action
sought of the agency.   

(d) To the Knowledge of Seller, in submitting any application for a permit or
for a renewal thereof, no Acquired Company nor any employee or agent acting
on its behalf has submitted information in those applications which is in
inaccurate, incomplete or untruthful, or has submitted information that is
misleading, and which if known or revealed to the responsible agency will
cause the denial of the permit being sought.

Company are covered by valid and, except for insurance policies that have
expired under their terms in the Ordinary Course of Business, currently
effective insurance policies or binders of insurance (including general

provisions of such policies.

objections are asserted with respect to the Acquisition under any Law or if
any suit is instituted by any Governmental Authority or any private party
challenging the Acquisition, each of the Parties shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any such objections or challenge
so as to permit consummation of the Acquisition. The Seller and the Purchaser
shall each bear fifty percent (50%) of the filing fee applicable to the HSR
Act.   

6.4. _Operation of Business_. The Acquired Companies will not, and the Seller
will cause the Acquired Companies not to, engage in any practice, take any
action, or enter into any transaction outside of the Ordinary Course of
Business without the prior written consent of the Purchaser (such consent not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Acquired Companies will not, and the Seller
will cause the Acquired Companies not to, without the prior written consent
of the Purchaser (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned):   

(a) authorize or effect any change in or amendment or modification to the
Governing Documents of any of the Acquired Companies;   

(b) grant any options, warrants, or other rights to purchase or obtain any of
its ownership interests or issue, sell, or otherwise dispose of any of its
ownership interests (except upon the conversion or exercise of options,
warrants, and other rights currently outstanding if any);   

(c) issue any note, bond, or other debt security or create, incur, assume, or
guarantee any indebtedness for borrowed money or capitalized lease obligation
outside the Ordinary Course of Business;   

(d) impose any Lien upon any of the assets of any Acquired Company outside the
Ordinary Course of Business;   

(e) make any capital investment in, make any loan to, or acquire (by merger,
consolidation, acquisition or otherwise) the securities or assets of any
other Person outside the Ordinary Course of Business; with the exception that
any Acquired Company may make capital expenditures consistent with its
proposed development plans as made available to the Purchaser, provided that,
any such individual capital expenditure shall not exceed $250,000.00 and all
such capital expenditures, in the aggregate, shall not exceed $2,000,000.00
without the Purchasers prior written approval, excluding those items set
forth on the purchase orders listed in _Schedule 3.15_ and those assets to
be transferred by Seller to the Company as listed _Schedule 3.15(ii)_;   

(f) adopt any new Employee Benefit Plan or amend any existing Employee Benefit
Plan in any material respect, except for amendments which do not increase the
benefits payable to participants in such Employee Benefit Plans in any
material respect or which may be required by applicable Law or (ii) increase
any compensation of or enter into any employment, severance, termination or
similar agreement with any of its employees, officers, managers or directors,
except for compensation increases in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice and the payment of amounts pursuant to and
consistent with an existing Employee Benefit Plan;   

(g) materially change any of the accounting methods used by them unless
required by GAAP or applicable Law; and   

(h) make any change in employment terms for any of the directors, officers,
and employees of any Acquired Company outside the Ordinary Course of
Business.   

6.5. _Full Access; Confidentiality Agreement_.   

(a) The Company will, and the Seller will cause the Company to, permit
representatives of the Purchaser to have full access at all reasonable times
and upon reasonable prior notice, and in a manner so as not to interfere with
the normal business operations of the Acquired Companies, to all premises,
properties, personnel, books, records (including Tax records), contracts, and
documents of or pertaining to the Acquired Companies.   

(b) The provisions of that certain letter agreement by and between the Company
and the Purchaser dated April 20, 2010 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "),
shall continue to apply to the Parties as though all such Parties were
original signatories thereto. If this Agreement is terminated for any reason
whatsoever, the Parties shall continue to be bound by the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement and the Purchaser shall return to the Company
all tangible embodiments (and all copies) of "Evaluation Material" (as
defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) that are in its possession.   

6.6. _Notice of Developments_. Seller will give prompt written notice to the
Purchaser of any material adverse development causing a breach of any of
Companys representations and warranties in _ARTICLE III_ (as modified by the
Seller Disclosure Schedules), Seller will give prompt written notice to the
Purchaser of any material adverse development causing a breach of any of its
representations and warranties in _ARTICLE IV_ (as modified by the
Seller Disclosure Schedules), and the Purchaser will give prompt written
notice to the Company and the Seller of any material adverse development
causing a breach of any of its representations and warranties in _ARTICLE V._
No disclosure by any Party pursuant to this _Section 6.6_, however, shall be
deemed to amend or supplement the Seller Disclosure Schedules or to prevent
or cure any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by
any Party on the date hereof.   

On or immediately before the Closing Date, the Seller and the Company may
amend or supplement the Seller Disclosure Schedules to reflect any matter
that arises after the date hereof that, if existing or known on the date
hereof, would have been required to be disclosed in such Seller Disclosure
Schedules (the " _Updated Seller Disclosure Schedules_ "); provided, however,
that no such amendment or supplement shall prevent or cure any breach or
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by the Company on the date
hereof solely for purposes of  _Section 8.2(a)_ hereof. As such, any Updated
Seller Disclosure Schedule shall be applicable to the Purchasers condition
to close as set forth in _Section 7.1_ but in no manner shall be applicable
to and shall be disregarded for purposes of _Section 8.2(a)_.   

6.7. _Exclusivity_. The Acquired Companies will not solicit, initiate, or
encourage the submission of any proposal or offer from any Person relating to
the acquisition of all or substantially all of the ownership Units or assets
of any Acquired Company (including any acquisition structured as a merger,
consolidation, or share exchange). The Seller agrees that neither it nor any
of the Acquired Companies nor any of the officers, managers or directors of
the Seller or any of the Acquired Companies shall, and that each shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its representatives and agents
not to (and shall not authorize any of them to) directly or indirectly: (i)
solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries
with respect to, or the making, submission or announcement of, any offer or
proposal for an Alternative Proposal; (ii) participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any nonpublic information
with respect to, any Alternative Proposal; (iii) engage in discussions with
any Person with respect to any Alternative Proposal, except as to the
existence of these provisions; (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any
Alternative Proposal; or (v) enter into any letter of intent or similar
document or any contract agreement or commitment contemplating
any Alternative Proposal or transaction contemplated thereby. The Seller and
each of the Acquired Companies will immediately cease any and all existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any third parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any Alternative Proposal. As promptly
as practicable after receipt of any Alternative Proposal or any request for
nonpublic information or inquiry which it reasonably believes would lead to
an Alternative Proposal, the Seller shall provide the Purchaser with oral and
written notice of the material terms and conditions of such Alternative
Proposal, request or inquiry, and the identity of the Person or group making
any such Alternative Proposal, request or inquiry.   

6.8. _Insurance and Indemnification_.   

(a) Following the Closing, the Purchaser will provide, and will cause the
Company to provide, each individual who served as a manager, director or
officer of any Acquired Company at any time prior to the Closing Date with
director and officer liability insurance coverage for a period of two (2)
years after the Closing Date that is no less favorable in coverage and amount
than any applicable insurance in effect immediately prior to the Closing
Date.   

(b) Following the Closing, the Purchaser will observe, and will cause the
Acquired Companies to observe, any indemnification provisions now existing in
the articles of organization or incorporation of any Acquired Company for the
benefit of any individual who served as a manager, director or officer of
such Acquired Company at any time prior to the Closing Date.   

6.9. _Employee Matters_. Purchaser shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates
to, provide each individual who is employed by any of the Acquired Companies
on the Closing Date and who continues employment with Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates after the Closing Date (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") with a
position providing base pay that is at least equal to the base pay provided
to such Continuing Employees by the applicable Acquired Company immediately
prior to the Closing Date. Nothing in this _Section 6.9_, however, will
limit the right of Purchaser to terminate or suspend employment of any
Continuing Employee after the Closing, subject only to the provisions of
_Section 6.10_. For a period of at least twelve (12) months beginning on the
Closing Date, the Purchaser shall provide, or cause to be provided, to
Continuing Employees, employee benefits and programs that, in the aggregate,
are substantially similar either to the Employee Benefit Plans maintained or
contributed to by the Acquired Companies (as the case may be) for employees
of the Acquired Companies as of the date of this Agreement or to
employee benefit plans and programs provided by the Purchaser to similarly
situated employees of the Purchaser. Continuing Employees shall receive
service and vesting credit under any employee benefit plans and programs of
the Purchaser and its controlled group of corporations in which they are
eligible to participate for any service with the Acquired Companies. For the
entire calendar year of 2010, Continuing Employees shall be permitted to take
earned but not taken vacation time-off as provided in Sellers Vacation Time-
Off policy. Continuing Employees shall also receive credit under any group
health plan of the Purchaser and its controlled group of corporations
in their initial year of eligibility for such plan for any co-payments,
deductibles or other out-of-pocket costs already incurred by such employees
under any other group health plan for such period.   

6.10. _WARN Act_. Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 6.9_, Seller
agrees that prior to the Closing, and Purchaser agrees that for ninety (90)
days after the Closing, Seller or Purchaser shall not, or allow any of the
Acquired Companies to, take any act or allow any failure to act that would be
a violation of any WARN Act.   

6.11. _Tax Matters_. The Purchaser shall prepare and file, or cause to be
prepared and filed, all Tax Returns for each of the Acquired Companies for
all periods ending after the Closing Date, which Tax Returns shall be
consistent with past practice. In the case of Tax Returns for periods
starting on or before the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date (a "
_Straddle Period_ "), the Purchaser shall provide the Seller with an
opportunity to review and comment on such Tax Returns no less than thirty
(30) days prior to the due date thereof. The Purchaser shall make, or cause
to be made, any changes to such Tax Returns reasonably requested by the Seller
so long as none of such changes result in any additional material Taxes to
the Purchaser or any of the Acquired Companies (other than Taxes of the
Acquired Companies for which Seller is responsible hereunder). The Seller
shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax
Returns required to be filed by the Acquired Companies for all periods ending
on or before the Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Period_ "). The Seller shall
deliver to the Purchaser complete copies of such Tax Returns within thirty
(30) days of filing, except for U.S. federal and state income and franchise
tax returns. The Purchaser shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Seller (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) file any amended
Tax Return or claim for Tax refund in respect of a Pre-Closing Period, and
the Seller shall be entitled to retain, or receive immediate payment from the
Purchaser, of any refund or credit with respect to Taxes in respect of a Pre-
Closing Period. As soon as practicable, but in any event within fifteen (15)
days after the Sellers or the Purchasers request, as the case may be, the
Purchaser shall deliver to the Seller or the Seller shall deliver to the
Purchaser, as the case may be, such information and other data relating to
the Tax Returns and Taxes of the Acquired Companies and shall provide such
other assistance as may reasonably be requested, to cause the completion and
filing of all Tax Returns or to respond to audits by any taxing authorities
with respect to any Tax Returns or taxable periods or to otherwise enable the
Seller, the Purchaser or the Acquired Companies to satisfy their accounting
or Tax requirements.   

6.12. _Further Actions_. For a period of twelve (12) months from and after the
Closing Date, each of the parties hereto shall execute and deliver such
documents and other papers and take such further actions as may be reasonably
required to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and give effect to the
transactions contemplated hereby. Within one hundred and twenty (120)
days from the date of this Agreement, Purchaser shall change the name of
INR-1 Holdings, LLC and INR-WV Operating, LLC to remove "INR" from the
name.   

6.13. _Transition Services Agreement_. Effective as of the Closing Date, the
Purchaser or the applicable Acquired Companies, on the one hand, and the
Seller or an applicable Affiliate of the Seller, on the other hand, shall
enter into the Transition Services Agreement.   

6.14. _Confidentiality; Non-Solicitation_.   

(a) For a period of two (2) years following the Closing Date, Seller shall and
shall cause its Affiliates to keep confidential and not use in any manner any
and all confidential information relating to the Acquired Companies or the
Purchaser that remains in or comes into Sellers or such Affiliates
possession; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not
preclude Seller from (i) disclosing such confidential information if
compelled to disclose the same by judicial or administrative process or by
other requirements of any applicable Law (subject to the following provisions
of this _Section 6.14(a_)), (ii) disclosing or using such
confidential information if the same is in the public domain (other than as a
result of a breach of this  _Section 6.14(a)_ by Seller or any Affiliate of
Seller) or (iii) disclosing or using such confidential information if the
same is acquired from a Person that is not known to Seller to be under an
obligation to keep such information confidential. If Seller is requested or
required (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or
documents in a Proceeding) to disclose any such confidential information,
Seller shall as soon as reasonably practicable notify the Purchaser of any
such request or requirement so that the Purchaser may seek a protective Order
or other appropriate remedy and waive compliance with the provisions of this
_Section 6.14(a)_. If, in the absence of a protective Order or other remedy
or the receipt of a waiver by the Purchaser, Seller is required to disclose
such information, Seller, without liability hereunder, may disclose that
portion of such information which the Seller reasonably believes it is
legally required to disclose.   

(b) Seller shall not and shall cause its Affiliates not to, for a period of
one (1) year following the Closing Date, without the prior written consent of
the Purchaser, directly or indirectly, solicit, cause to be solicited
(including by recommending for employment) or hire any Person who is now
employed by any Acquired Company, the Purchaser or any Affiliate of any of
the foregoing; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall not be restricted
from conducting any general solicitation for employees (including through the
use of employment agencies) not specifically directed at any such Persons;
and _provided_ _further_ , that Seller shall not be restricted in hiring any
such Person who responds to any such general solicitation.

ARTICLE VIII 
 INDEMNIFICATION    

8.1. _Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Agreements_. All
of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall
survive the Closing until the Escrow Release Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (i) the warranties and representations of Seller in Section 3.12 (Taxes)
shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations,
and (ii) the Fundamental Reps shall survive indefinitely; _provided_  
_further_ , that if written notice of a claim has been given before the
expiration of the applicable representations and warranties, then the
relevant representations and warranties shall survive as to such claim, until
such claim has been finally resolved. No Proceeding may be instituted to
enforce, or seek damages or other remedies with respect to the breach of
any representation or warranty after the expiration of the period of survival
for such representation or warranty as described above.   

8.2. _Indemnification by Seller_. Following the Closing, Seller shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser, its Affiliates and their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns
(each a " _Purchaser Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the " _Purchaser
Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and all Liabilities, losses,
damages, claims, costs, expenses, fines, fees, deficiencies, interest,
awards, judgments, amounts paid in settlement and penalties (including,
without limitation, reasonable attorneys, consultants and experts fees and
expenses and other costs of defending, investigating or settling claims)
actually suffered or incurred by them (but excluding any punitive damages,
consequential damages, special damages, incidental damages, indirect damages,
lost profits or similar items except to the extent that a Purchaser
Indemnified Party actually pays such amounts to a third party)
(hereinafter, " _Loss(es)_ "), arising out of or resulting from:   

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of Seller
contained in  _ARTICLE III_ or _ARTICLE IV_ of this Agreement, which
representations and warranties shall be deemed to have been made as of the
date hereof (as modified by the Seller Disclosure Schedules) and as of the
Closing Date (as modified by the Seller Disclosure Schedules but
excluding any modified, updated or supplemented items disclosed in the
Updated Seller Disclosure Schedules); or   

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement made by the Seller or Company in
this Agreement; and   

(c) any foreign, federal, state or local income Taxes imposed on or payable by
any of the Acquired Companies for any Pre-Closing Period or pre-Closing
portion of any Straddle Period, excluding any such taxes that have been
accrued for on the Closing Statements.   

8.3. _Indemnification by Purchaser_. Following the Closing, the Purchaser
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller, its Affiliates and respective
officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns (each a "
_Seller Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified
Parties_ ") from and against any and all Losses, arising out of or resulting
from:   

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of the
Purchaser contained in _ARTICLE V_ of this Agreement, which representations
and warranties shall be deemed to have been made as of the date hereof and as
of the Closing Date ; or   

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement made by the Purchaser in this
Agreement.   

8.4. _Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement (other than claims for actual fraud or breach of any
Fundamental Rep which, in each instance, shall not be subject to the
limitations set forth in this _Section 8.4_):   

(a) The maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses arising out of or
resulting from the causes enumerated in _Section 8.2(a) and (b)_ that may be
recovered from Seller shall not exceed the amounts then remaining in the
Escrow Fund.   

(b) No indemnification by the Seller with respect to any Loss otherwise
payable under  _Section 8.2(a)_ and no indemnification by the Purchaser with
respect to any Loss otherwise payable under _Section 8.3(a)_, shall in
either case be payable (i) with respect to any individual Loss unless such
Loss is in excess of two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.00) (and no
such individual Loss shall be counted toward the "Basket" (as defined below)
and (ii) until such time as all such indemnifiable Losses shall aggregate to
more than five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000.00) (the " _Basket_ "),
after which time the Seller or the Purchaser (as the case may be) shall be
liable in full for all indemnifiable Losses in excess of the Basket,
subject to subsection (a) above.   

8.5. _Indemnification Procedures_.   

(a) The obligations and liabilities of the Seller and the Purchaser under this
_ARTICLE VIII_ with respect to Losses arising from claims of any third party
which are subject to the indemnification provided for in this _ARTICLE VIII_
(" _Third Party Claims_ ") shall be governed by and contingent upon the terms
and conditions set forth in this _Section 8.5_. If any Purchaser Indemnified
Party or Seller Indemnified Party (the " _Indemnified Party_ "), as the case
may be, shall receive notice of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party
shall give the Seller or the Purchaser (each, the " _Indemnifying Party_ "),
as the case may be, notice of such Third Party Claim within ten (10) days
after the receipt by the Indemnified Party of such notice; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure to provide such notice shall not release the
Indemnifying Party from any of its respective obligations under this
_ARTICLE VIII_ except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially
prejudiced by such failure. The notice of claim shall describe in reasonable
detail the facts known to the Indemnified Party giving rise to such
indemnification claim, and the amount or good faith estimate of the
amount arising therefrom.   

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume and control the defense
of such Third Party Claim at its expense and through counsel of its choice if
it gives written notice of its intention to do so to the Indemnified Party
within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of such notice from the Indemnified
Party and the Third Party Claim involves money damages and not an
injunction or other equitable relief that could have an adverse effect on the
Acquired Companies and the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing its
liability to the Indemnified Party under this Article VIII and agrees to
indemnify the Indemnified Party in accordance with the terms of Article VIII,
subject to the Indemnifying Partys right to rescind its assumption of the
defense and acceptance of liability of such Third Party Claim; provided,
however, if there exists or is reasonably likely to exist a conflict of
interest that would make it inappropriate in the judgment of the Indemnified
Party in its sole and absolute discretion for the same counsel to represent
both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to retain its own counsel in each jurisdiction for
which counsel is required, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. In the
event that the Indemnifying Party exercises the right to undertake any such
defense against any such Third Party Claim as provided above, the Indemnifying
Party shall conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and
diligently and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying
Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnifying Party, at the
Indemnifying Partys expense, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials
and information in the Indemnified Partys possession or under the
Indemnified Partys control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the
Indemnifying Party. Similarly, in the event the Indemnified Party is,
directly or indirectly, conducting the defense against any such Third
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with the Indemnified
Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnified Party, at the
Indemnifying Partys expense, all such witnesses, records, materials and
information in the Indemnifying Partys possession or under the
Indemnifying Partys control relating thereto as is reasonably required by
the Indemnified Party. No such Third Party Claim may be settled by any party
conducting the defense against such claim without the prior written consent
of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed or
withheld; provided, however, Seller shall have the right to settle any claim
for which it is the Indemnifying Party without the prior written consent of
any other party if such settlement provides for a complete and unconditional
release of the Indemnified Party, does not include any admission of
culpability and involves only the payment of money damages.   

8.6. _Determination of Losses_. The Parties shall make appropriate adjustments
for Tax benefits and insurance coverage in determining Losses for purposes of
this _ARTICLE VIII_. All indemnification payments under this _ARTICLE VIII_
shall be deemed adjustments to the Purchase Price. The Purchaser will (and
will cause the Acquired Companies to) use commercially reasonable efforts to
seek full recovery under applicable insurance policies covering any Losses
to the same extent as they would if such Losses were not subject to
indemnification under this Agreement. In addition, the amount of Losses for
which indemnification is provided under this Agreement shall be net of the
amount of any specific reduction to the Net Working Capital or Net Worth made
prior to the Closing and attributable to the subject matter in dispute.   

8.7. _Exclusive Remedy_. Except in the case of claims for actual fraud or
breach of any Fundamental Rep: (a) the Parties acknowledge and agree that the
foregoing indemnification provisions in the ARTICLE VIII shall be the
exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Parties with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) the Purchaser agrees that its right
to indemnification pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII shall be limited solely and
exclusively to the Escrow Amount. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth herein, to the fullest extent permitted by law, no Member of Seller
shall be liable to any Purchaser Indemnified Party except for claims for
intentional fraud by such Member.   

ARTICLE IX 
 TERMINATION    

9.1. _Termination of Agreement_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be abandoned at any time
prior to the Closing as provided below:   

(a) by mutual written consent of Seller and Purchaser;   

(b) the Seller may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the
Purchaser at any time prior to the Closing Date if the Closing shall not have
occurred on or before ninety (90) days after the date of this Agreement (the
" _Termination Date_ "), by reason of the failure of any condition precedent
under _Section 7.2_ hereof, (unless the failure of the Closing to occur on
or prior to the Termination Date results primarily from the Seller or the
Company breaching any of their representations, warranties or covenants
contained in this Agreement); and   

(c) the Purchaser may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the
Seller at any time prior to the Closing Date if the Closing shall not have
occurred on or before the Termination Date, by reason of the failure of any
condition precedent under _Section 7.1_ hereof, (unless the failure of the
Closing to occur on or prior to the Termination Date results primarily from
the Purchaser breaching any representation, warranty or covenant contained in
this Agreement).   

9.2.    

 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 9.1_ above, all rights and obligations of the Parties hereunder
shall terminate without any liability of any Party to any other Party, except
as provided in _Section 9.3 herein_;  _provided_ , _however_ , (i) that the
confidentiality provisions contained in _Section 6.5_ and _Article X_ above
shall survive any such termination; and (ii) that no such termination shall
relieve any party hereto from liability for any breach by such party of
any covenant or obligation set forth in this Agreement. If Seller elects the
Reverse Break-up Fee in  _Section 9.3_, Purchasers obligation to pay the
Reverse Break-up Fee and Sellers right to enforce that obligation shall
survive the termination of this Agreement. If Seller pursues the specific
performance remedy in _Section 9.3_ then this Agreement shall remain in
effect until the final resolution of Sellers specific performance action.
_Break-Up Fee_. If the conditions to Purchasers obligation to consummate the
Closing (as set forth in _Section 7.1_ ) are satisfied (other than those
conditions that can only be satisfied at Closing and that are capable of
being satisfied at Closing) and the Closing does not occur (other than through
the failure of Seller or the Company to comply with their obligations under
this Agreement) within five (5) Business Days of Purchasers receipt of
written notice from Seller that Seller and the Company are ready to
consummate the Closing, at Sellers election and in Sellers sole discretion,
Seller shall have the right to elect (1) to obtain specific performance as
provided for in _Section 10.12_ of the Agreement and to obtain any additional
relief provided for by law or equity, other than monetary damages; or (2) to
require Purchaser to pay to the Company in immediately available funds on
such fifth (5th) Business Day an amount equal to Seventy Five Million
Dollars ($75,000,000) (the " _Reverse Break-up Fee_ "). Seller shall notify
Purchaser of its remedy election on said (5th) Business Day. If Seller elects
to receive the Reverse Break-up Fee and it is paid in full, and only in such
event, then (i) neither Purchaser nor any of its directors, officers,
employees, partners, managers, members, shareholders or Affiliates (each a "
_Purchaser Affiliate_ "), shall be subject to (nor shall Seller, the Company
or their respective Affiliates seek to recover) monetary damages in excess of
the Reverse Break-up Fee, and (ii) Seller, the Company and their respective
Affiliates shall be precluded from any other remedy against Purchaser or any
Purchaser Affiliate, at law or in equity or otherwise, and none of Seller, the
Company and their respective Affiliates shall seek to obtain any recovery,
judgment, or damages of any kind, including consequential, indirect, or
punitive damages, against Purchaser or any Purchaser Affiliate in connection
with this Agreement and the transaction contemplated hereby. If Seller elects
the specific performance remedy, but a court determines that Seller is not
entitled to specific performance, then Seller shall be awarded the Reverse
Break-up Fee. The parties hereto agree that the monetary damages that Seller
will suffer as the result of the Closing not taking place cannot be measured
with accuracy and that monetary damages alone will not make Seller whole. The
parties hereto further agree that the Reverse Break-up Fee, however,
represents a fair and reasonable estimation of the minimum amount of monetary
damages for breach of contract that would result to Seller in the event of a
termination by Seller pursuant to this _Section 9.3_ under the circumstances
described in this last paragraph of this _Section 9.3_.   

ARTICLE X

contemplated hereby. Except for the express representations and warranties
set forth in _ARTICLE IV_ , the Purchaser acknowledges that the Seller makes
no representation or warranty, express or implied, at law or in equity, in
respect of the Seller or any of its assets, Liabilities or operations, and
any such representations or warranties are hereby expressly disclaimed. The
Purchaser acknowledges that the representations and warranties contained in
_ARTICLE III_ and _ARTICLE IV_ are the only representations or warranties
given by, or on behalf of, the Seller or the Company and that all other
express or implied warranties are disclaimed, including any representations
or warranties made by any officer, employee or consultant. The Purchaser
acknowledges that no representations and warranties are being made herein by
or on behalf of Sellers members.   

(c) The Purchaser acknowledges that it has inspected and is knowledgeable of
the coal reserves that are included with the Leased Real Property (" _Coal
Reserves_ "). Accordingly, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
_Article III_, the Coal Reserves are accepted by Purchaser on an "as is"
basis, there being no warranties or representations, either expressed
or implied, including but not limited to (a) mineability of the coal, (b)
merchantability of the coal, (c) fitness for a particular purpose, (d)
quality of the coal or (e) quantity of the coal. With respect to any
projection or forecast delivered by or on behalf of the Seller or the Company
to the Purchaser as part of the express representations and warranties set
forth in _Article III_, the Purchaser acknowledges that (w) there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such projection and forecasts,
(x) it is familiar with such uncertainties, (y) it is taking
full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and
accuracy of all such projections and forecasts so furnished to it and (z) it
shall have no claim against any Person with respect thereto other than a
claim for actual fraud.

inure to the benefit of the Parties named herein and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. No Party may assign either this Agreement
or any of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior
written approval of the other Parties; provided that the Purchaser may
assign this Agreement, without the approval of the Seller or the Company, to
a Subsidiary of the Purchaser, provided that no such transfer or assignment
shall relieve Purchaser of its obligations hereunder or alter or change any
obligation of any other party hereto.   

10.5. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together will constitute one and the same instrument.
