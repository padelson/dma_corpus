_6.2_ , as the case may be), the  outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
or Parent Common  Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into
or  exchanged for a different number of shares or different class,  in each
case by reason of any reclassification,  recapitalization, subdivision, stock
split, reorganization,  combination, contribution or exchange of shares, or a
stock  dividend or dividend payable in other securities shall be  declared
with a record date within such period, or any similar  event shall have
occurred, the Exchange Ratio and any other  number or amount contained herein
which is based upon the price  of Parent Common Stock, including the
Measurement Price, or the  number of shares of Company Common Stock or Parent
Common Stock,  as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to
provide  to Parent and the holders of Company Common Stock the same 
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such  event. 

  



  

   ARTICLE 2   

  



  

   EXCHANGE OF  SHARES   

  



  

  Section 2.1 _Exchange  Fund._ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall 
appoint a bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the  Company to
act as exchange agent (the "Exchange  Agent") for the purpose of exchanging
Shares for the  Merger Consideration. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent  shall deposit, or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent,  in
trust for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company  Common Stock,
certificates representing the shares of Parent  Common Stock to be issued
pursuant to _Section 1.9_.  Parent agrees to make available directly or
indirectly to the  Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash
sufficient to  pay cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to  _Section
2.5 _and any dividends pursuant to  _Section 2.3_. All cash in lieu of
fractional shares  and certificates for shares of Parent Common Stock,
together  with any dividends with respect thereto, deposited with the 
Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the  "Exchange Fund." 

  



  

  Section 2.2 _Exchange  Procedures._ Promptly (and in any event no more 
than three business days) after the Effective Time, the  Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to  each holder of record
of Shares: (i) a letter of  transmittal (the "Letter of Transmittal"), 
which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of  loss and
title to the Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of  the Shares to the
Exchange Agent, and which shall be in such  form and have such other
provisions as Parent and the Company  may reasonably agree and (ii)
instructions for effecting  the surrender of the Shares in exchange for the
Merger  Consideration. Upon surrender of the Shares to the Exchange  Agent
together with such Letter of Transmittal, duly executed  and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and  such other documents as may be
reasonably required by the  Exchange Agent, the holder of such Shares shall
be entitled to  receive in exchange therefor (A) one or more shares of 
Parent Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry  form unless
a physical certificate is requested by such holder)  representing, in the
aggregate, the whole number of shares of  Parent Common Stock that such
holder has the right to receive  pursuant to _Section 1.9 _and/or (B) a check
in  the amount equal to the cash that such holder has the right to  receive
pursuant to the provisions of this  _Article 2_, consisting of cash in lieu
of fractional  shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.5  _and
any unpaid dividends pursuant to _Section 2.3  _(collectively, "Cash
Payment"). No interest  will be paid or accrued on any Cash Payment. In the
event of a  transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not 
registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger  Consideration
and any Cash Payment to which such holder is  entitled may be issued and paid
to such a transferee if the  Shares representing such Company Common Stock
are presented to  the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required
to  evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any  applicable
stock transfer taxes have been paid. 

  



  

  Section 2.3 _Dividends  with Respect to Unexchanged  Shares._
Notwithstanding any other provision of  this Agreement, no dividends declared
or made after the  Effective Time with respect to shares of Parent Common
Stock  with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the 
holder of any Shares that have not been surrendered to the  Exchange Agent by
such holder in accordance with  _Section 2.2 _with respect to the shares of
Parent  Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon 
such surrender of such Shares and no cash payment in lieu of  fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any  such holder pursuant to
_Section 2.5 _until, in each  case, such holder surrenders such Shares in
accordance with  _Section 2.2_. Subject to the effect of Applicable  Laws,
following the surrender of any such Shares, there shall be  paid to such
holder of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in  exchange therefor,
without interest, (i) promptly after the  time of such surrender, the amount
of any cash 

  
 ##### Table of Contents

  

  

  payable in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to  which such
holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.5  _and the amount of dividends
with a record date after the  Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to
such whole  shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate 
payment date, the amount of dividends with a record date after  the Effective
Time but prior to surrender of such Shares and a  payment date subsequent to
such surrender payable with respect  to such whole shares of Parent Common
Stock. 

  



  

  Section 2.4 _No  Further Ownership Rights or Claims Relating to Company
Common  Stock_. All Merger Consideration issued and any cash paid  upon
conversion of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to  _Article 1 _and
this _Article 2 _shall be  deemed to have been issued and paid in exchange
for, and in full  satisfaction of, all rights pertaining to such shares of
Company  Common Stock and any claims for, relating to or arising out of 
shares of Company Common Stock or ownership thereof. 

  



  

  Section 2.5 _No  Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock_. 

  



  

  (a) No certificates or scrip or shares of Parent Common  Stock
representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or  book-entry credit
of the same shall be issued upon the surrender  for exchange of the Shares
and such fractional share interests  will not entitle the owner thereof to
vote or to have any rights  of a stockholder of Parent or a holder of shares
of Parent  Common Stock. 

  



  

  (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,  each holder of
Shares converted pursuant to the Merger who would  otherwise have been
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of  Parent Common Stock (after
taking into account all Shares  delivered by such holder) shall receive, in
lieu thereof, cash  (without interest) in an amount equal to the product of

(ii) the average of the closing prices for a  share of Parent Common Stock as
reported on the New York Stock  Exchange (the "NYSE") Composite
Transactions  Tape for the 15 trading days ending on the third trading day 
immediately preceding the Closing Date (the "Measurement  Price"). Such
payment of cash consideration is in lieu  of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock. 

  



  

  (c) As promptly as practicable after the determination of  the amount of
cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional  interests pursuant to
_Section 2.5(b)_, the Exchange  Agent shall so notify Parent, and Parent
shall deposit or cause  the Surviving Corporation to deposit such amount with
the  Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward  payments
to such holders of fractional interests subject to and  in accordance with
the terms hereof. 

  



  

  Section 2.6 _Dividends  with Respect to Company Common Stock._ At or
after  the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall  pay
from funds on hand at the Effective Time any dividends with  a record date
prior to the Effective Time that may have been  declared or made by the
Company on shares of Company Common  Stock which remain unpaid at the
Effective Time. 

  



  

  Section 2.7 _Termination  of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange 
Fund (including the proceeds of all investments thereof, any  shares of
Parent Common Stock and any amount of the Cash  Payment) that remains
undistributed to the holders of Shares for  one year after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to Parent,  and all holders of the Shares who have not
theretofore complied  with this _Article 2 _shall thereafter look only to 
Parent for the Merger Consideration and any Cash Payment with  respect to
such Shares. Any such portion of the Exchange Fund  remaining unclaimed by
holders of Shares five years after the  Effective Time (or such earlier date
immediately prior to such  time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become  property of any Governmental Entity) shall, to the extent  permitted
by Applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free  and clear of any
claim or interest of any person previously  entitled thereto. 

  



  

  Section 2.8 _No  Liability._ None of Parent, Merger Sub, the  Company,

Insurance  Corporation; provided, that no gain or loss thereon shall affect 
the

this _Article 2_. Any interest or other  income resulting from such
investments shall promptly be paid to  Parent. 

  



  

  Section 2.10 _Lost  Certificates._ If any certificate for Shares shall 
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an  affidavit of that
fact by the person claiming such certificate  to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by Parent, the  posting by such person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as  Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be  made against it with respect to such certificate, the Exchange 
Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or  destroyed
certificate the applicable Merger Consideration and  any Cash Payment with
respect to the Shares formerly represented  thereby. 

  



  

  Section 2.11 _Withholding  Rights._ Each of the Surviving Corporation
and  Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the  consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to  any holder of Shares such
amounts as it is required to deduct  and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under  the Code and the Treasury Regulations, or any
provision of  state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts
are  so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case  may
be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes  of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the  Shares in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was  made by the Surviving Corporation
or Parent, as the case may be. 

  



  

  Section 2.12 _Further  Assurances._ After the Effective Time, the

execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of  the Company or Merger Sub,
all deeds, bills of sale, assignments  and assurances and to take and do, in
the name and on behalf of  the Company or Merger Sub, all other actions and
things to vest,  perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving 
Corporation all right, title and interest in, to and under the  rights,
properties and assets acquired or to be acquired by the  Surviving
Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the  Merger. 

  



  

  Section 2.13 _Stock  Transfer Books._ The stock transfer books of the 
Company shall be closed immediately upon the Effective Time and  there shall
be no further registration of transfers of shares of  Company Common Stock
thereafter on the records of the Company.  On or after the Effective Time,
all Shares presented to the  Exchange Agent or Parent in accordance with the
provisions of  this Agreement shall be converted into the Merger
Consideration  and any Cash Payment payable with respect to the shares of 
Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby.

Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business and,  to the extent such concept
or a similar concept exists in the  relevant jurisdiction, is in good
standing under the laws of any  jurisdiction in which the character of the
properties owned or  leased by it therein or in which the transaction of its
business  requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so 
qualified or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate,  has not had
and is not reasonably likely to have a Company  Material Adverse Effect. The
CompanyÂ’s Subsidiary has all  requisite corporate power and authority to own,
operate and  lease its properties and to carry on its business as now 
conducted. The Company has made available to Parent true and  complete copies
of such SubsidiaryÂ’s articles of  incorporation and bylaws, as currently in

any amendments thereto) required to be filed by them since  December 31, 2006
(each registration statement, prospectus,  report, schedule, form, proxy
statement, information statement  or other document (other than preliminary
materials) so filed,  each in the form (including exhibits and any amendments
thereto)  filed with the SEC, collectively, the "Company  Reports"). No
Subsidiary of the Company is required to  file any form, report, registration
statement or prospectus or  other document with the SEC. As of its respective
date, each  Company Report (i) complied in all material respects with  the
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act or the  Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the "Securities  Act"), as the case may be, and the rules and 
regulations thereunder and (ii) did not contain any untrue  statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact  required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the  statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under  which they were made, not misleading, except for any
statements  in any Company Report that have been modified by an amendment
to  such report filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof. Each of  the
consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by  reference into
the Company Reports (including related notes and  schedules) complied as to
form in all material respects with the  applicable accounting requirements
and the published rules and  regulations of the SEC with respect thereto and
fairly presents  in all material respects the consolidated financial position
of  the Company and its Subsidiaries (or such entities as indicated  in such
balance sheet) as of its date, and each of the  consolidated statements of
operations, cash flows and changes in  stockholdersÂ’ equity included in or
incorporated by  reference into the Company Reports (including any related
notes  and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects the  results
of operations, cash flows or changes in  stockholdersÂ’ equity, as the case
may be, of the Company  and its Subsidiaries (or such entities as indicated
in such  balance sheet) for the periods set forth therein (subject, in  the
case of unaudited statements, to (x) such exceptions as  may be permitted
by  Form 10-Q  of the SEC and (y) normal, recurring year-end audit 
adjustments which are not material in the aggregate), in each  case in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the  periods involved,
except as may be noted therein. 

  



  

  (b) There are no liabilities or obligations of the Company  or any of its
Subsidiaries of any nature (whether accrued,  absolute, contingent or
otherwise) that would be required to be  reflected on, or reserved against

the notes  thereto prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied, 
other than (i) liabilities and obligations incurred in the  ordinary course
of business, (ii) liabilities or  obligations that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had  and are not reasonably likely to have a Company

hereby. 

  



  

  (c) Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002  (the "Sarbanes-
Oxley Act"), the Company has  been and is in compliance in all material
respects with the  applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The
Company has  established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
and  internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are  defined
in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of  Rule 13a-15  under the Exchange
Act) as required by  Rule 13a-15  under the Exchange Act. The CompanyÂ’s
disclosure controls  and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that
all  material information required to be disclosed by the Company in  the
reports that it files under the Exchange Act are recorded,  processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods  specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC, and that all such  material information is accumulated and
communicated to the  management of the Company as appropriate to allow
timely  decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the 
certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of  the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act. The Company has disclosed, based on its  most recent evaluations,
to the CompanyÂ’s outside auditors  and the audit committee of the board of
directors of the Company  (A) all significant deficiencies in the design or
operation  of its internal control over financial reporting (as defined in 
Rule 13a-15(f)  of the Exchange Act) and any material weaknesses that have
more  than a remote chance to materially adversely affect the  CompanyÂ’s
ability to record, process, summarize and report  financial data and (B) any
fraud, whether or not material,  that involves management or other employees
who have a  significant role in the CompanyÂ’s internal control over 
financial reporting. 

  



  

  (d) All filings required to be made by the Company or any  of its
Subsidiaries with the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission ("FERC") and the

  filings complied, as of their respective dates, with all  requirements of
the applicable statutes and the rules and  regulations, except for filings

arbitrations, audits, hearings,  investigations, litigation, suits or
proceedings (whether civil,  criminal, administrative, investigative or
appellate)  (collectively, "Actions") pending or, to the  CompanyÂ’s
knowledge, threatened, against the Company or any  of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective properties, that,  individually or in the aggregate, have
had or are reasonably  likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

or, to the knowledge of the Company,  threatened, against the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries.

that, individually or in the  aggregate, would reasonably be likely to have a
Company Material  Adverse Effect, and (ii) except for actions taken in 
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated  hereby, the
Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their  respective businesses only
in the ordinary course.

or any of its Subsidiaries (including any  Return required to be filed by an
affiliated, consolidated,  combined, unitary or similar group that included
the Company or  any of its Subsidiaries) have been properly filed on a
timely  basis with the appropriate Governmental Entities and all taxes  that

pending with any Governmental Entity  with regard to any tax or Return of the
Company or any of its  Subsidiaries as to which any taxing authority has
asserted any  claim; and (ii) neither the Company nor any of its 
Subsidiaries has any liability for any tax under Treasury  Regulation Section
1.1502-6  or any similar provision of any other tax law, except for taxes 
of the affiliated group of which the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries is
the common parent, within the meaning of  Section 1504(a)(1) of the Code or
any similar provision of  any other tax law. Neither the Company nor any of
its  Subsidiaries has granted any request, agreement, consent or  waiver to

upon the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries is  a party to any closing agreement described in Section
7121  of the Code or any predecessor provision thereof or any similar 
agreement under any tax law. Neither the Company nor any of its  Subsidiaries
is a party to, is bound by or has any obligation  under any tax sharing,
allocation or indemnity agreement or any  similar agreement or arrangement.
Since December 31, 2005,  the Company has not made or rescinded any election
relating to  taxes or settled or compromised any claim, action, suit, 
litigation, proceeding, arbitration, investigation, audit or  controversy
relating to any tax, or, except as may be required  by Applicable Law, made
any change to any of its methods of  reporting income or deductions for
federal income tax purposes  from those employed in the preparation of its
most recently  filed federal Returns. The Company has not engaged in any 
"listed transaction" within the meaning of Treasury  Regulation Section
1.6011-4.  Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a 
"controlled corporation" or a "distributing  corporation" in any distribution

the two-year period ending on the date  hereof or (ii) that otherwise
constitutes part of a  "plan" or "series of related transactions"  (within
the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) that  includes the Merger. 

  



  

  (c) No claim has ever been made by an authority in a  jurisdiction where
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries does  not file Returns that the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is  or may be subject to taxation by that
jurisdiction. There are no  Liens for taxes (other than taxes not yet due and
payable) upon  any of the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

agreed to by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries filed or  received since
December 31, 2006. 

  



  

  (f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a  party to any
agreement, contract, arrangement or plan that has  resulted or could result,
separately or in the aggregate, in the  payment of any amount that will not
be fully deductible as a  result of Section 162(m) of the Code (or any
corresponding  provision of state, local or foreign tax law). Neither the 
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a United States  real property

  (g) The unpaid taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries  (i) did not, as
of the most recent fiscal month end for the  Company, exceed the reserve for

"multiemployer plan" (as defined in  Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA), (ii) a
"multiple  employer plan" (within the meaning of Section 413(c)  of the
Code) or (iii) subject to Title IV or  Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of
the Code.  Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of 
the transactions contemplated hereby shall cause any payment or  benefit to
any employee, officer or director of the Company or  any of its Subsidiaries

Sections 4999 and 280G  of the Code, respectively, whether or not some other
subsequent  action or event would be required to cause such payment or 
benefit to be triggered, and the execution of, and performance  of the
transactions contemplated by, this Agreement will not  (either alone or upon
the occurrence of any additional or  subsequent event) constitute an event
under any benefit plan,  policy, arrangement or agreement or any trust or
loan (in  connection therewith) that will or may result in any payment 
(whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration,  forgiveness of
indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in  benefits or obligations to
fund benefits with respect to any  employee of the Company or any Subsidiary
thereof, nor will the  consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement  limit or restrict the right to terminate any Company Benefit

  Section 3.23 _Takeover  Statutes; Rights Plans._ Assuming the accuracy
of  the representations of Parent in _Section 4.20  _hereof, the execution,
delivery and performance of this  Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated  hereby will not cause to be applicable to the
Merger the  restrictions on "business combinations" set forth in  Sections
607.0901 and 607.0902 of the FBCA or any state  anti-takeover law (a

(collectively,  "Liens") except for Permitted Liens, title to  or valid
leasehold interests in the inventory, equipment and  other tangible and

in all  material respects. 

  



  

  (b) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has complied  in all material
respects with the terms of all leases to which  it is a party or under which
it is in occupancy and all leases  to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or  under which it is in occupancy are in full force
and effect.  Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries enjoys peaceful and 
undisturbed possession of the properties or assets purported to  be leased
under its leases, except where the failure to have  such possession has not
had and is not reasonably likely to have  a Company Material Adverse
Effect. 

  



  

  (c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has  violated the
terms of any easement, right-of-way, prescriptive  right or way of necessity,
whether or not of record (an  "Easement"), except any such violations that,

to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.  Except as would not reasonably be
likely to have a Company  Material Adverse Effect, all Easements in favor of
the Company  or any of its Subsidiaries are valid and enforceable and grant 
the rights purported to be granted thereby and all rights  necessary
thereunder for the operation of the respective  businesses of the Company and
its Subsidiaries. There are no  spatial gaps in the Easements in favor of the
Company or any of  its Subsidiaries that would reasonably be likely to have
a  Company Material Adverse Effect and all parts of the pipeline  assets
which constitute a portion of the assets of the Company  or any of its
Subsidiaries are located either on property which  is owned in fee by the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries or on  property which is subject to an
Easement in favor of the Company  or one of its Subsidiaries. Neither the
Company nor any of its  Subsidiaries has received any notice from any person
disputing  or challenging its ownership of any fee interests or Easement, 
other than disputes or challenges that have not had or are not  reasonably
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

forth in the Company Reports  and are properly calculated and adequate.

warranties of Parent expressly contained in  _Article 4 _and the
representations and warranties of  Parent and Merger Sub expressly contained

cost estimates, forecasts, projections  and information, both in writing and
orally, with respect to  Parent by Parent or its agents and representatives.
The Company  acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in any such

   REPRESENTATIONS  AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT   

  



  

  Except (i) as set forth in the disclosure schedule dated  the date of this
Agreement and delivered to the Company by  Parent concurrently with the
execution and delivery of this  Agreement (the "Parent Disclosure
Schedule")  and making reference to the particular section or subsection of 
this Agreement to which exception is being taken ( _provided _ that any
information set forth in one section or subsection  of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule will be deemed to apply to  each other section or subsection of the
Parent Disclosure  Schedule to which its relevance is reasonably apparent)
or  (ii) to the extent the qualifying nature of such disclosure  is readily
apparent therefrom, as disclosed in the Parent  Reports filed on or after
January 1, 2007 and prior to the  date hereof, Parent represents and warrants
to the Company as  follows: 

  



  

  Section 4.1 _Existence;  Good Standing; Corporate Authority._ Parent is
a  corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good  standing
under the laws of the State of Delaware. Parent is duly  qualified to do
business and, to the extent such concept or a  similar concept exists in the
relevant jurisdiction, is in good  standing under the laws of any
jurisdiction in which the  character of the properties owned or leased by it
therein or in  which the transaction of its business requires such 
qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in  good
standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and  is not
reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse  Effect. Parent has all
requisite corporate power and authority  to own, operate and lease its
properties and to carry on its  business as now conducted. The copies of the
certificate of  incorporation and bylaws of Parent attached to the Parent 
Disclosure Schedule are true and complete copies of such  documents as
currently in effect. 

  



  

  Section 4.2 _Authorization,  Validity and Effect of Agreement._ Parent has
the  requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver  this
Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated  by this

  Agreement, subject in the case of consummation of the Merger and  the
issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued  in the Merger
pursuant to _Section 1.9 _(the  "Share Issuance") to obtaining the Parent 
Stockholder Approval. The execution and delivery of this  Agreement and the
consummation by Parent of the transactions  contemplated hereby have been
duly authorized by all requisite  corporate action on behalf of Parent, other
than in the case of  consummation of the Merger and the Share Issuance
obtaining the  Parent Stockholder Approval. Parent has duly executed and 
delivered this Agreement and, assuming due authorization,  execution and
delivery hereof by the other parties hereto, this  Agreement constitutes a
valid and legally binding obligation of  Parent, enforceable against Parent
in accordance with its terms,  subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent  transfer, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws 
relating to creditorsÂ’ rights and general principles of  equity. 

  



  

  Section 4.3 _Capitalization._ The  authorized capital stock of Parent
consists of  12,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock, par value $0.4867 
per share, and 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par  value $0.01 per
share ("Parent Preferred  Stock"), of which 200,000 shares have been 
designated as Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred  Stock, par value
$0.01 per share. As of the Cut-off Time, there  were (i) 6,840,358
outstanding shares of Parent Common  Stock, (ii) 1,110,392 shares of Parent
Common Stock  reserved for issuance upon vesting of outstanding equity
awards  as set forth in _Section 4.3_ of the Parent Disclosure  Schedule
(collectively, "Parent Equity  Awards"), (iii) 94,711 outstanding shares of 
Parent Common Stock reserved for issuance upon conversion of  ParentÂ’s 8.25%
convertible debentures due 2014 and  (iv) no outstanding shares of Parent
Preferred Stock. Since  the Cut-off Time, no additional shares of Parent
Common Stock  have been issued (other than pursuant to Parent Equity Awards 
which were outstanding as of the Cut-off Time and are included  in the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock reserved for  issuance upon vesting of
outstanding Parent Equity Awards in  clause (ii) above), no additional Parent
Equity Awards have  been issued or granted, and there has been no increase in
the  number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise  of the
Parent Equity Awards from those issuable under such  Parent Equity Awards as
of the Cut-off Time. All issued and  outstanding shares of Parent Common
Stock are duly authorized,  validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and
free of preemptive  rights. There are no options, warrants, calls,
subscriptions,  convertible securities or other rights, agreements or 
commitments which obligate Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to  issue,
transfer, sell or register any shares of capital stock or  other securities
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries other than  (A) the Parent Equity
Awards, which are listed on  _Section 4.3 _of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule,  (B) the Rights Agreement, dated August 20, 1999,  between Parent
and Computershare Trust Company, N.A (as  amended to date, the "Rights
Agreement") and  (C) the 8.25% convertible debentures due 2014. There are
no  outstanding obligations of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to 
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital  stock of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. Except for the  Parent Equity Awards,
there are no outstanding stock  appreciation rights, security-based
performance units,  "phantom" stock or other security rights or other 
agreements or arrangements pursuant to which any person is or  may be
entitled to receive any payment or other value based on  the revenues,
earnings or financial performance, stock price  performance or other
attribute of Parent or any of its  Subsidiaries or assets or calculated in
accordance therewith  (other than payments or commissions to employees or
agents of  Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of 
business consistent with past practices). Parent has no  outstanding bonds,
debentures, notes or other obligations the  holders of which have the right
to vote (or, other than the  8.25% convertible debentures due 2014, which are
convertible  into or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) 
with the stockholders of Parent on any matter. There are no  voting trusts or
other agreements or understandings to which  Parent is a party with respect
to the voting of capital stock of  Parent. 

  



  

  Section 4.4 _Subsidiaries._ Each  of ParentÂ’s Subsidiaries is a
corporation or other legal  entity duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing  under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or 
organization. Each of the ParentÂ’s Subsidiaries is duly  qualified to do
business and, to the extent such concept or a  similar concept exists in the
relevant jurisdiction, is in good  standing under the laws of any
jurisdiction in which the  character of the properties owned or leased by it
therein or in  which the transaction of its business requires such 
qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in  good
standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and  is not
reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse  Effect. Each of the
ParentÂ’s Subsidiaries has all requisite  corporate or other entity power and
authority to own, operate  and lease its properties and to carry on its
business as it is  now conducted. Parent has made available to the Company
true and  complete copies of each such SubsidiaryÂ’s articles or  certificate
of incorporation and bylaws, as currently in effect.  As of the date of this
Agreement, all of the outstanding shares  of capital stock of, or other
ownership interests in, each of  ParentÂ’s Subsidiaries are duly authorized,
validly issued,  fully paid and nonassessable, and are owned, directly or 
indirectly, by Parent free and

or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other  ownership interests),
except for restrictions imposed by law.

that,  individually or in the aggregate, have not had and are not 
reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect: 

  



  

  (a) Since January 1, 2007, neither Parent nor any of  its Subsidiaries has

and effect. Since January 1, 2007,  (i) neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has violated  or received any written notice of violation with
respect to any  Parent Permit and (ii) to the knowledge of Parent, no 
Governmental Entity has taken or threatened to take any action  to terminate,

any of the properties of  Parent or any of its Subsidiaries under, any of the
terms,  conditions or provisions of any Parent Material Contract; or  (iii)
subject to the filings and other matters referred to  in _Section 4.6(b) _and

clauses (ii) and (iii), any such  violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults,
terminations,  cancellations, liabilities, obligations, Liens or 
contraventions, that, individually or in the aggregate, have not  had and are
not reasonably likely to have a Parent Material  Adverse Effect. 

  



  

  (b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by  Parent or
Merger Sub nor the consummation by either of them of  the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby will  require Parent, Merger Sub or
any of ParentÂ’s Subsidiaries  to obtain any consent, approval, authorization,
order or  declaration of, provide any notification to, or make any filing

Public Service Commission (the  "MPSC"), except for any consent, approval, 
qualification, authorization, order or declaration as to which  the failure

  (c) This Agreement, the Merger and the transactions  contemplated hereby
do not, and will not, upon consummation of  such transactions, result in any
"change of control"  or similar triggering event under any (i) Parent
Material  Contract, (ii) Parent Benefit Plan, which, in the case of  either
clause (i) or (ii), gives rise to rights or benefits  not otherwise available
absent such change of control or similar  triggering event and requires

(iii) material Parent Permit. 

  



  

  Section 4.7 _SEC  Documents and Compliance_. 

  



  

  (a) Parent and its Subsidiaries have filed with the SEC all  documents
(including exhibits and any amendments thereto)  required to be filed by them
since December 31, 2006 (each  registration statement, prospectus, report,
schedule, form,  proxy statement, information statement or other document
(other  than preliminary materials) so filed, each in the form  (including
exhibits and any amendments thereto) filed with the  SEC, collectively, the
"Parent Reports"). No  Subsidiary of Parent is required to file any form,
report,  registration statement or prospectus or other document with the 
SEC. As of its respective date, each Parent Report  (i) complied in all
material respects with the applicable  requirements of the Exchange Act or
the Securities Act, as the  case may be, and the rules and regulations
thereunder and  (ii) did not contain any untrue statement of a material 
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated  therein or
necessary to make the statements made therein, in the  light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not  misleading, except for any
statements in any Parent Report that  have been modified by an amendment to
such report filed with the  SEC prior to the date hereof. Each of the
consolidated balance  sheets included in or incorporated by reference into
the Parent  Reports (including related notes and schedules) complied as to 
form in all material respects with the applicable accounting  requirements
and the published rules and regulations of the SEC  with respect thereto and
fairly presents in all material  respects the consolidated financial position
of Parent and its  Subsidiaries (or such entities as indicated in such
balance  sheet) as of its date, and each of the consolidated statements  of
operations, cash flows and changes in stockholdersÂ’  equity included in or
incorporated by reference into the Parent  Reports (including any related
notes and schedules) fairly  presents in all material respects the results of
operations,  cash flows or changes in stockholdersÂ’ equity, as the case  may
be, of Parent and its Subsidiaries (or such entities as  indicated in such
balance sheet) for the periods set forth  therein (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to  (x) such exceptions as may be permitted by  Form
10-Q  of the SEC and (y) normal, recurring year-end audit  adjustments which
are not material in the aggregate), in each  case in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied during the  periods involved, except as may be noted
therein. 

  



  

  (b) There are no liabilities or obligations of Parent or  any of its
Subsidiaries of any nature (whether accrued,  absolute, contingent or
otherwise) that would be required to be  reflected on, or reserved against
in, a consolidated balance  sheet of Parent and its Subsidiaries or in the
notes thereto  prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied, other 
than (i) liabilities and obligations incurred in the  ordinary course of
business, (ii) liabilities or  obligations that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had  and are not reasonably likely to have a Parent
Material Adverse  Effect and (iii) liabilities or obligations incurred
under  this Agreement or in connection with the transactions  contemplated
hereby. 

  



  

  (c) Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Parent  has been and is
in compliance in all material respects with the  applicable provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Parent has  established and maintains disclosure controls
and procedures and  internal control over financial reporting (as such terms
are  defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of  Rule 13a-15 
under the Exchange Act) as required by  Rule 13a-15  under the Exchange Act.
ParentÂ’s disclosure controls and  procedures are reasonably designed to
ensure that all material  information required to be disclosed by Parent in
the reports  that it files under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, 
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the  rules and
forms of the SEC, and that all such material  information is accumulated and
communicated to the management of  Parent as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding  required disclosure and to make the certifications
required  pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 
Parent has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluations, to  ParentÂ’s
outside auditors and the audit committee of the  board of directors of Parent
(A) all significant  deficiencies in the design or operation of its internal
control  over financial reporting (as defined in  Rule 13a-15(f)  of the
Exchange Act) and any material weaknesses that have more  than a remote
chance to materially adversely affect  ParentÂ’s ability to record, process,
summarize and report  financial data and (B) any fraud, whether or not
material,  that involves management or other employees who have a 
significant role in ParentÂ’s internal control over  financial reporting.

  (d) All filings required to be made by Parent or any of its  Subsidiaries

the extent required, the FPSC, DPSC  and the MPSC), as the case may be,
including all reports and  financial information have been made and all such
filings  complied, as of their respective dates, with all requirements of 
the applicable statutes and the rules and regulations, except  for filings

transactions contemplated hereby, Parent and its Subsidiaries  have conducted
their respective businesses only in the ordinary  course. 

  



  

  Section 4.10 _Taxes_. 

  



  

  (a) Except for such matters that, individually or in the  aggregate, have
not had and are not reasonably likely to have a  Parent Material Adverse
Effect, all Returns required to be filed  by or with respect to Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries  (including any Return required to be filed by an
affiliated,  consolidated, combined, unitary or similar group that included 
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) have been properly filed on a  timely
basis with the appropriate Governmental Entities, and all  taxes that have
become due (regardless of whether reflected on  any Return) have been duly
paid or deposited in full on a timely  basis or adequately reserved for in
accordance with GAAP. All  such Returns filed by Parent are true, correct and
complete in  all material respects. 

  



  

  (b) (i) No audit or other administrative or court  proceeding is presently
pending with any Governmental Entity  with regard to any tax or Return of
Parent or any of its  Subsidiaries as to which any taxing authority has
asserted any  claim; and (ii) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries 
has any liability for any tax under Treasury  Regulation Section 1.1502-6 
or any similar provision of any other tax law, except for taxes  of the
affiliated group of which Parent or any of its  Subsidiaries is the common
parent, within the meaning of  Section 1504(a)(1) of the Code or any similar
provision of  any other tax law. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries 
has granted any request, agreement, consent or waiver to extend  any period
of limitations applicable to the assessment of any  tax upon Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries. Neither Parent nor  any of its Subsidiaries is a party to
any closing agreement  described in Section 7121 of the Code or any
predecessor  provision thereof or any similar agreement under any tax law. 
Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, is  bound by or has
any obligation under any tax sharing, allocation  or indemnity agreement or
any similar agreement or arrangement.  Since December 31, 2005, Parent has
not made or rescinded  any election relating to taxes or settled or
compromised any  claim, action, suit, litigation, proceeding, arbitration, 
investigation, audit or controversy relating to any tax, or,  except as may
be required by Applicable Law, made any change to  any of its methods of
reporting income or deductions for federal  income tax purposes from those
employed in the preparation of  its most recently filed federal Returns.
Parent has not engaged  in any "listed transaction" within the meaning of 
Treasury  Regulation Section 1.6011-4.  Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has been a  "controlled corporation" or a "distributing 
corporation" in any distribution that was purported or  intended to be
governed by Section 355 of the Code (or any  similar provision of state,
local or foreign law)  (i) occurring during the two-year period ending on the
date  hereof or (ii) that otherwise constitutes part of a  "plan" or "series
of related transactions"  (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code)
that  includes the Merger. 

  



  

  (c) No claim has ever been made by an authority in a  jurisdiction where
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries does not  file Returns that Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries is or may be  subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.
There are no Liens for  taxes (other than taxes not yet due and payable) upon
any of the  assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. 

  
 ##### Table of Contents

  

  

  (d) Parent and its Subsidiaries have withheld and paid all  material taxes
required to have been withheld and paid in  connection with any amount paid
or owing to any employee,  independent contractor, creditor, stockholder or
other third  party. 

  



  

  (e) _Section 4.10(e) _of the Parent Disclosure  Schedule lists all
federal, state, local, and foreign income tax  Returns filed with respect to
any of Parent or its Subsidiaries  for taxable periods ended on or after
December 31, 2006,  identifies those Returns that have been audited since 
December 31, 2004, and identifies those Returns that  currently are the
subject of audit. Parent has made available to  the Company correct and
complete copies of all federal income  tax Returns, examination reports, and
statements of deficiencies  assessed or proposed to be assessed against or
agreed to by  Parent or any of its Subsidiaries filed or received since 
December 31, 2006. 

  



  

  (f) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party  to any
agreement, contract, arrangement or plan that has  resulted or could result,
separately or in the aggregate, in the  payment of any amount that will not
be fully deductible as a  result of Section 162(m) of the Code (or any
corresponding  provision of state, local or foreign tax law). Neither
Parent  nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a United States real  property
holding corporation within the meaning  Section 897(c)(2) of the Code during
the applicable period  specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code.
Each of  Parent and its Subsidiaries has disclosed on its federal income 
tax Returns all positions taken therein that could give rise to  a
substantial understatement of federal income tax within the  meaning Section
6662 of the Code. 

  



  

  (g) The unpaid taxes of Parent and its Subsidiaries  (i) did not, as of
the most recent fiscal month end for  Parent, exceed the reserve for tax
liability (other than any  reserve for deferred taxes established to reflect
timing  differences between book and tax income) set forth on the face  of
the most recent balance sheet of Parent (other than in any  notes thereto)
included in a Parent Report and (ii) do not  exceed that reserve as adjusted
for the passage of time through  the Closing Date in accordance with the past
custom and practice  of Parent and its Subsidiaries in filing their Returns.
Since  the date of the most recent balance sheet of Parent included in  a
Parent Report, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has  incurred any
liability for taxes arising from extraordinary  gains or losses, as that term
is used in GAAP, outside the  ordinary course of business consistent with
past custom and  practice. 

  



  

  Section 4.11 _Employee  Benefit Plans_. 

  



  

  (a) _Section 4.11(a) _of the Parent Disclosure  Schedule contains a true
and complete list of all Parent Benefit  Plans. The term "Parent Benefit
Plans" means  all material employee benefit plans and other benefit 
arrangements, including all material "employee benefit  plans" as defined in

material employee benefit, bonus,  incentive, deferred compensation, stock
option (or other  equity-based), severance, employment, change in control,
welfare  (including post-retirement medical and life insurance) and  fringe
benefit plans, practices or agreements, whether or not  subject to ERISA or 
U.S.-based  and whether written or oral, sponsored, maintained or

Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates, as described below, or  to which Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates  is a party, is or may have any
present or future liability, or  is required to provide benefits under

statements, the  most recent audited financial statements or other annual 
financial reports, the most recent actuarial valuation reports  and Internal
Revenue Service determination  and/or  opinion letters, if applicable, for
each such plan. Parent does  not intend to, nor does Parent contemplate
taking any actions  to, alter, modify, freeze, terminate or otherwise amend
any  Parent Benefit Plan prior to Closing, other than in the ordinary 
course of business consistent with past practice or except as  may be
required by the Applicable Laws. 

  



  

  (b) Except for such matters that, individually or in the  aggregate, have
not had and are not reasonably likely to have a  Parent Material Adverse
Effect, (i) all applicable  reporting and disclosure requirements have been
met with respect  to the Parent Benefit Plans; (ii) to the extent
applicable,  the Parent Benefit Plans comply with the requirements of ERISA 
and the Code or with the regulations of any applicable  jurisdiction, and any
Parent Benefit Plan intended to be  qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code has received a  favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue
Service  (or is entitled to rely upon a favorable opinion letter issued  by
the Internal Revenue Service) and nothing has occurred,  whether by action or
inaction, that could reasonably be expected  to cause the loss of such tax
qualification; (iii) the  Parent Benefit Plans have been maintained and
operated in  accordance with their 

  
 ##### Table of Contents

  

  

  terms and in compliance with Applicable Laws, and there are no  breaches
of fiduciary duty in connection with the Parent Benefit  Plans; (iv) there
are no pending or, to ParentÂ’s  knowledge, threatened claims against or
otherwise involving any  Parent Benefit Plan, and no Action (excluding
routine claims for  benefits incurred in the ordinary course of Parent
Benefit Plan  activities) has been brought against or with respect to any 
Parent Benefit Plan; (v) all material contributions  required to be made to
the Parent Benefit Plans have been made  or provided for; (vi) with respect
to any "employee  pension benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(2) of 
ERISA, that is subject to Title IV of ERISA and has been  maintained or
contributed to within six years prior to the  Effective Time by Parent, its
Subsidiaries or any trade or  business (whether or not incorporated) which is
under common  control, or which is treated as a single employer, with
Parent  or any of its Subsidiaries under Section 414(b), (c),  (m) or (o) of
the Code or Section 4001(b)(1) or  4001(a)(14) of ERISA, neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries  or ERISA Affiliates has incurred any direct or
indirect  liability under Title IV of ERISA in connection with any 
termination thereof or withdrawal therefrom. No "reportable  event" (as such
term is defined in Section 4043 of  ERISA) has occurred with respect to any

loan (in  connection therewith) that will or may result in any payment 
(whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration,  forgiveness of
indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in  benefits or obligations to

  (b) Each Parent Material Contract is in full force and  effect, and each
of Parent and its Subsidiaries has performed  all obligations required to be
performed by it to date under  each Parent Material Contract to which it is a
party, except  where such failure to be in full force and effect or such 
failure to perform, individually or in the aggregate, has not  had and is not
reasonably likely to have a Parent Material  Adverse Effect. Except for such
matters that, individually or in  the aggregate, have not had and are not
reasonably likely to  have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, neither Parent
nor any of  its Subsidiaries (i) knows of, or has received written  notice
of, any breach of or violation or default under (nor, to  the knowledge of
Parent, does there exist any fact, condition or  circumstance which with the
passage of time or the giving of  notice or both would result in such a
violation or default  under) any Parent Material Contract, or (ii) has
received  written notice of the desire of the other party or parties to  any
such Parent Material Contract to exercise any rights such  party has to
cancel, terminate or repudiate such contract or  exercise remedies
thereunder.

  Section 4.23 _Takeover  Statutes; Rights Plans._ Assuming the accuracy
of  the representations of the Company in _Section 3.20  _hereof, the
execution, delivery and performance of this  Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated  hereby will not cause to be applicable to
the Merger the  restrictions on "business combinations" set forth in 
Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Except  for the Rights
Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its  Subsidiaries has any preferred
share purchase rights plan or  similar rights plan in effect. 

  



  

  Section 4.24 _Properties_. 

  



  

  (a) Parent and its Subsidiaries have, free and clear of all  Liens except
for Permitted Liens, title to or valid leasehold  interests in, the
inventory, equipment and other tangible and  intangible property used or held
for use in the conduct of their  respective businesses, in each case as
necessary to permit  Parent and its Subsidiaries to conduct their
respective  businesses as currently conducted in all material respects. 

  



  

  (b) Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has complied in all  material
respects with the terms of all leases to which it is a  party or under which
it is in occupancy and all leases to which  Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party or under which it  is in occupancy are in full force and effect.
Each of Parent and  its Subsidiaries enjoys peaceful and undisturbed
possession of  the properties or assets purported to be leased under its 
leases, except where the failure to have such possession has not  had and is
not reasonably likely to have a Parent Material  Adverse Effect. 

  



  

  (c) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has violated  the terms of
any Easement, except any such violations that,  individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and are not  reasonably likely to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.  Except as would not reasonably be likely to have a
Parent  Material Adverse Effect, all Easements in favor of Parent or any  of
its Subsidiaries are valid and enforceable and grant the  rights purported to
be granted thereby and all rights necessary  thereunder for the operation of
the respective businesses of  Parent and its Subsidiaries. There are no
spatial gaps in the  Easements in favor of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
that  would reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse  Effect
and all parts of the pipeline assets which constitute a  portion of the
assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries are  located either on property
which is owned in fee by Parent or  one of its Subsidiaries or on property
which is subject to an  Easement in favor of Parent or one of its
Subsidiaries. Neither  Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
notice from  any person disputing or challenging its ownership of any fee 
interests or Easement, other than disputes or challenges that  have not had
or are not reasonably likely to have a Parent  Material Adverse Effect. 

  



  

  Section 4.25 _Information  Supplied._ None of the information supplied or
to  be supplied by Parent for inclusion or incorporation by  reference in
(i) the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be  filed by the Company and
Parent with the SEC, and any amendments  or supplements thereto, or (ii)
the  Form S-4  to be filed by Parent with the SEC in connection with the 
Merger, and any amendments or supplements thereto, will, at the  respective
times such documents are filed, and, in the case of  the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, at the time the Joint  Proxy Statement/Prospectus or
any amendment or supplement  thereto is first mailed to the respective
stockholders of the  Company and Parent, at the time of the Company
Stockholder  Approval and the Parent Stockholder Approval and at the 
Effective Time, and, in the case of the  Form S-4,  when it becomes
effective under the Securities Act, contain any  untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any  material fact required to be made therein
or necessary in order  to make the statements made therein, in light of the 
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 

  



  

  Section 4.26 _Regulatory  Proceedings._ Neither Parent nor any of its 
Subsidiaries all or part of whose rates or services are  regulated by a
Governmental Entity (i) has rates which have  been or are being collected
subject to refund, pending final  resolution of any rate proceeding pending
before a Governmental  Entity or on appeal to the courts or (ii) is a party
to any  rate proceeding before a Governmental Entity or on appeal from 
Orders of a Governmental Entity which could result in Orders  having a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. The reserves of Parent  and its Subsidiaries for any
pending refund(s) described above  in clause (i) are set forth in the Parent
Reports and are  properly calculated and adequate. _Section 4.26 _of  the
Parent Disclosure Schedule lists all (A) pending rate  proceedings involving
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries before a  Governmental Entity or on appeal
to the courts and identifies  the status thereof, and (B) closed rate
proceedings  involving Parent or any of its Subsidiaries before a 
Governmental Entity since January 1, 2007, and the  resolution thereof.

representations and warranties made by Parent in this  _Article 4 _and by

other

  person makes any representation or warranty with respect to the  Parent or
its Subsidiaries or their respective business,  operations, assets,
liabilities, condition (financial or  otherwise) or prospects,
notwithstanding the delivery or  disclosure to the Company or any of its
affiliates or  representatives of any documentation, forecasts or other 
information with respect to any one or more of the foregoing.

behalf of the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the 
representations and warranties of the Company expressly  contained in

warranties are specifically  disclaimed. Without limiting the foregoing, as
part of its  investigation of the Company, Parent has been given financial 
information, cost estimates, forecasts, projections and  information, both in
writing and orally, with respect to the  Company by the Company or its agents
and representatives. Parent  acknowledges that there are uncertainties
inherent in any such  projections, predictions and forecasts, and Parent is
familiar  with such uncertainties. Parent has made its own evaluation of 
all such information and acknowledges that none of the  CompanyÂ’s officers,
directors, employees, affiliates,  representatives and agents is making any
representations or  warranties with respect to such information and that
neither  Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is making any  representations
or warranties with respect to such information  except, in the case of the
Company, for the specific  representations and warranties set forth in 
_Article 3_.

the  Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and  regulations
thereunder. Each of Parent and the Company shall use  reasonable best efforts
to have the  Form S-4  declared effective by the SEC and to keep the  Form
S-4  effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and  the
transactions contemplated thereby. Parent and the Company  shall, as promptly

amendment or supplement (including by incorporation by  reference) to the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the  Form S-4  shall be made without the
approval of both parties, which  approval shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed;  _provided_ that, with respect to documents filed by a party 
which are incorporated by reference in the  Form S-4  or Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, this right of approval  shall apply only with respect
to information relating to the  other party or its business, financial
condition or results of  operations. Parent will use reasonable best efforts
to cause the  Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to ParentÂ’s 
stockholders, and the Company will use reasonable best efforts  to cause the

in each case after the  Form S-4  is declared effective under the Securities
Act. Parent shall  also take any action (other than qualifying to do business

qualification of the Parent Common Stock  issuable in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in  any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC
for amendment of the  Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the  Form S-4. 
Each of the Company and Parent shall ensure that the information  provided by
it for inclusion in the Joint Proxy  Statement/Prospectus and each amendment
or supplement thereto,  at the time of mailing thereof and at the time of the
respective  Company Stockholders Meeting and Parent Stockholders Meeting, 
or, in the case of information provided by it for inclusion in  the  Form
S-4  or any amendment or supplement thereto, at the time it becomes 
effective, (i) will not include an untrue statement of a  material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be  stated therein or necessary to

respects with the provisions of the Securities Act and the  Exchange Act.

employee, agent or representative of the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries,

Company Takeover Proposal by any  such person, if and only to the extent that

CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors determines in  good faith (I) after consultation
with its independent  financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such
Company  Takeover Proposal is a Company Superior Proposal or there is a 
reasonable likelihood that such Company Takeover Proposal could  result in a
Company Superior Proposal, and (II) after  consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that failure to  take such action would be reasonably likely
to be inconsistent  with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, (C)
prior  to providing any confidential information or data to any person  in
connection with a Company Takeover Proposal by any such  person, the
CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors receives from such  person an executed
confidentiality agreement customary for a  transaction of this type (
_provided_ that such agreement  shall contain customary standstill provisions
that are no less  restrictive than those set forth in _Section 9.5(e)_),

into discussions or negotiations with any  person, the Company notifies
Parent promptly of such inquiries,  proposals or offers received by, or any
such discussions or  negotiations sought to be initiated or continued with,
any of  the respective directors, officers, employees, agents or 
representatives of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries  indicating, in
connection with such notice, the material terms  and conditions of any
inquiries, proposals or offers, provided  that such notice shall not be
required to contain any  information the provision of which the CompanyÂ’s
Board of  Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its 
outside legal counsel, would be reasonably likely to be  inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law. 

  



  

  (c) The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt  of any
Company Takeover Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent  reasonably informed
of the status and material terms and  conditions (including any change

and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, which  transaction the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in  its good faith judgment (after

of  the Company than the Merger (taking into account the person  making the

constituting or related to any Company  Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, at any time  prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval, the Board  of Directors of the Company may make a Company Adverse

to make a Company  Adverse Recommendation Change, the Board of Directors of
the  Company shall take into account any changes to the financial  terms of
this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to a  Company Notice of Adverse
Recommendation or otherwise.  Notwithstanding any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, this  Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders
of the Company  at the Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of

Surviving Corporation to deem, the period of  employment with the Company and
its Subsidiaries (and with  predecessor employers with respect to which the
Company and its  Subsidiaries shall have granted service credit) to have
been  employment and service with Parent and the Surviving Corporation  for
benefit plan eligibility and vesting purposes (but not for  purposes of
benefit accruals or benefit computations) for all of  ParentÂ’s and the

(as modified pursuant to  _Section 7.16(c)_) for a period of at least one
year  from the Closing Date for all employees and former employees of  the
Company at the Effective Time; provided, however, that  solely with respect
to employees of the Company who are members  of a labor union or collective
bargaining unit and in connection  with any agreement or amendment or renewal
thereto entered into  by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and a collective
bargaining  unit or labor union of the Company, Parent reserves the right
to  modify or terminate any Company Benefit Plan prior to such  one-year
anniversary date. After such one-year anniversary date,  participation of the
employees and former employees of the  Company in the Company Benefit Plans
may continue until such  time as it is reasonably practicable to transfer
the  participation of such employees and former employees to Parent  Benefit
Plans, if any, taking into consideration any applicable  collective
bargaining agreement obligations and contractual  arrangements with insurers
or other benefit plan providers.  Under any medical and dental plans covering
any employee or  former employee of the Company, there shall be waived, and 
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall cause the relevant  insurance
carriers and other third parties to waive, all  restrictions and limitations
for any medical condition existing  as of the Effective Time of any of such
employees and their  eligible dependents for the purpose of any such plans,
provided  such persons had the requisite "creditable" service  prior to the
Effective Time, but only to the extent that such  condition would be covered
by the relevant Company Benefit Plan  if it were not a pre-existing condition
and only to the extent  of comparable coverage in effect immediately prior to
the  Effective Time. 

  



  

  (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause  (i) its Pension
Plan to be modified as set forth in  _Exhibit 7.16(c)_ hereto and (ii) its
Employee  Stock Purchase Plan not to be renewed for the period commencing

action is prohibited or limited by  (A) Applicable Law, (B) any existing
contract between  the Company and any labor union or collective bargaining
unit or  (C) any existing Employee Benefit Plan.

shall cause to be delivered to Parent duly executed  resignations, effective

Directors of the Company and its  Subsidiaries and shall take such other
action as is necessary to  accomplish the foregoing. 

  



  

  Section 7.18 _Parent  Board of Directors._ Parent shall take all 
corporate action necessary to cause the election or appointment  to its Board

days after the date that written notice of such breach  is given to Parent by
the Company or, in the event such breach  is discovered by Parent, within 45
days after the date  written notice of such breach is given to the Company by
Parent;  _provided, however,_ that Parent may not terminate this  Agreement
under this _Section 9.3(a) _if it is then in  breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement  set forth in this Agreement such that the
Company would then be  entitled to terminate this Agreement under  _Section
9.4(a) _(without giving effect to the proviso  in _Section 9.4(a)_); 

  



  

  (b) a Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall have  occurred; or

Agreement or any representation or  warranty of Parent or Merger Sub shall
have become untrue, in  any case such that the conditions set forth in

this _Section 9.4(a)_ that  the references in _Section 8.2(a) and 8.2(b)

9.4(a)_), and such breach shall not  be curable, or, if curable, shall not
have been cured within  45 days after the date written notice of such breach
is  given to the Company by Parent or, in the event such breach is 
discovered by the Company, within 45 days after the date  written notice of
such breach is given to Parent by the Company;  _provided, however,_ that the
Company may not terminate  this Agreement under this _Section 9.4(a) _if it
is  then in breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or  agreement

terminate this Agreement under  _Section 9.3(a)_ (without giving effect to
the proviso  in _Section 9.3(a)_);

  (b) (i) The Board of Directors of the Company  authorizes the Company,
following a determination by the Board  of Directors in good faith (after
consultation with outside  counsel) that the failure to do so would be
reasonably likely to  be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of  the Company under Applicable Law, to enter into a binding 
written agreement concerning a transaction that constitutes a  Company
Superior Proposal, (ii) the Company notifies Parent  in writing that it
intends to enter into such an agreement, and  (iii) Parent does not make,
within three business days of  receipt of the CompanyÂ’s written notification
of its  intention to enter into a binding agreement for such Company 
Superior Proposal, an offer that the Board of Directors of the  Company
determines, in good faith after consultation with a  financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation and its  outside legal counsel, is at least
as favorable to the  CompanyÂ’s stockholders as such Company Superior
Proposal,  it being understood that the Company shall not enter into any 
such binding agreement during such three  business-day  period; or 

  



  

  (c) there shall have occurred a Parent Material Adverse  Effect. 

  



  

  Section 9.5 _Effect  of Termination_. 

  



  

  (a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated  (i) by Parent pursuant
to _Section 9.3(b)_, and  no Parent Material Adverse Effect shall have
occurred after the  date of this Agreement and be continuing at the time of
the  Company Adverse Recommendation Change giving rise to the  termination
by Parent, or (ii) by the Company pursuant to  _Section 9.4(b)_, then the
Company shall pay Parent a  fee equal to $3,400,000 (the "Termination Fee") 
on the first business day following the date of termination of  this
Agreement. In the event that (A) after the date of  this Agreement, a Company
Takeover Proposal is publicly made to  the Company or is publicly made
directly to the stockholders of  the Company generally or any person publicly
announces an  intention (whether or not conditional) to make a Company 
Takeover Proposal and (B) this Agreement is terminated by  either the Company
or Parent pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)  _or _9.2(c)_ , and within 365 days of
such  termination the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into  any
definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, any  Company Takeover
Proposal, then the Company shall pay Parent the  Termination Fee on the
earlier of the date the Company or its  Subsidiary enters into such agreement
with respect to such  Company Takeover Proposal and the date such Company
Takeover  Proposal is consummated. The Company acknowledges and agrees  that
(x) the agreements contained in this  _Section 9.5(a) _are an integral part
of the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (y) constitute 
liquidated damages and not a penalty and (z) without these  agreements, the
other parties would not enter into this  Agreement; accordingly, if the
Company fails promptly to pay any  amount due pursuant to this _Section
9.5(a)_, and, in  order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit
that  results in a judgment for a fee payable pursuant to this  _Section
9.5(a)_, the Company shall also reimburse  ParentÂ’s costs and expenses
(including attorneysÂ’ fees  and expenses) in connection with such suit,
together with  interest on the amount of such fee from the date such
payment  was required to be made until the date of payment at the prime 
rate of PNC Bank, Delaware in effect on the date such payment  was required
to be made. Any payment to be made under this  _Section 9.5(a) _shall be made
by wire transfer of  same-day  funds. 

  



  

  (b) In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant  to this
_Article 9_, all obligations of the parties  hereunder shall terminate,
except the obligations of the parties  pursuant to this _Section 9.5_, 
_Sections 7.5(c) _and _7.9_ and except for the  provisions of _Sections 10.2,
10.3, 10.4, 10.6, 10.8,  10.9, 10.10, 10.11, 10.12 and 10.13, provided _that
nothing  herein shall relieve any party from any liability for any breach 
by such party of any of its representations, warranties,  covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement and all  rights and remedies of the
nonbreaching party under this  Agreement, at law or in equity, shall be
preserved. 

  



  

  (c) The Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any  termination of this
Agreement, and the provisions of such  Confidentiality Agreement shall apply
to all information and  material delivered by any party hereunder. 

  



  

  (d) In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant  to this
_Article 9_, for a period of one year  following the date of such
termination, neither the Company nor  Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries will hire, or  solicit for hire or employment, directly or
indirectly, any  officer or employee of the other party or any of its 
Subsidiaries or any person who at the time of proposed hire had  been an
officer or employee of the other party or any of its  Subsidiaries within the
previous six months. For the purposes of  this provision, "solicitation"
shall not include  solicitation of any non-officer employee who is solicited
by  advertising in a newspaper or periodical of general circulation  or who
on his or her own initiative seeks employment with the  Company or Parent or
any of their respective Subsidiaries, as  the case may be.

  (e) In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant  to this
_Article 9_, for a period of one year  following the date of such
termination, without the prior  written consent of the CompanyÂ’s or ParentÂ’s
Board of  Directors, as the case may be, neither Parent nor the Company 
will directly or indirectly (nor will either of them assist or  encourage
directly or indirectly others to): (i) acquire or  agree, offer, seek or
propose to acquire, or cause to be  acquired, directly or indirectly, by
purchase or otherwise,  ownership of any voting securities or rights to
acquire any  voting securities of the other, or any of the assets or 
businesses of the other or any subsidiary or division thereof or  any bank
debt, claims or other obligations of the other or any  rights to acquire such
ownership (including from a third party);  (ii) seek or propose to influence
or control the management  or policies of the other or to obtain
representation on the  otherÂ’s Board of Directors, or solicit, or participate
in  the solicitation of, any proxies of the otherÂ’s  stockholders, or make
any public announcement with respect to  any of the foregoing; (iii) make any
public announcement  with respect to, or submit a proposal for, or offer of
(with or  without conditions) any extraordinary transaction involving the 
other or its securities or assets; or (iv) enter into any  discussions,
negotiations, arrangements or understandings with  any third party with
respect to any of the foregoing, or  otherwise form, join or in any way
participate in a  "group" (as defined in the Exchange Act) in connection 
with any of the foregoing. Each party will promptly advise the  other of any
inquiry or proposal made to it with respect to any  of the foregoing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) either  party shall be permitted to
commence a non-coercive tender offer  for the otherÂ’s common stock at a price
higher than that  contemplated by any other then-existing merger agreement
to  which the other is a party; and (B) either party may  comment on any
merger negotiation process or other matter  relating to or involving the
merger or takeover of the other  party in order to correct material
misstatements or omissions  made by the other party or its advisors. 

  



  

  Section 9.6 _Extension;  Waiver._ At any time prior to the Effective
Time,  each party may by action taken by its Board of Directors, to the 
extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the  performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of the other  parties, (ii) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations  and warranties made to such party
contained herein or in any  document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii)
waive  compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the  benefit
of such party contained herein. Any agreement on the  part of a party to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid  only if set forth in an instrument
in writing signed on behalf  of such party.
