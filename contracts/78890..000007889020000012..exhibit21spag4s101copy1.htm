| 
---|---

|

the ATM Services and CDM Services reconciliation process set out in Clause
7.6.3, 

that following investigation in accordance with Clause 7.6.4(iii) are proven
to the reasonable satisfaction of the Seller, acting reasonably ("Accepted
Shortfalls"); and

| 
---|---

|

Any payments due from the Seller to the Purchaser pursuant to Clause 7.6.5

account designated by the Purchaser to the Seller in writing. 

| 
---|--- 

7.6.7

|

Without prejudice to Clauses 14.3 and 14.4, for the avoidance of doubt, any
shortfalls or claims by Cash Solutions Customers that: (i) exclusively relate
to the period after Closing; or (ii) are submitted to the relevant Group
Company more than 90 days after Closing, shall be the sole responsibility of
the Purchaser and the Purchaser shall be entitled to have the conduct of any
such claims. 

| 
---|--- 

7.6.8

|

If the Seller investigates a Potential Shortfall or investigates and/or takes
conduct of a Pre-Closing Customer Claim, the Purchaser shall (or shall procure
that the relevant Group Companies shall):

procure that the relevant employees of the Purchaser's Group shall provide

progress any Potential Shortfall or Pre-Closing Customer Claim;

|

(to the extent permitted by Applicable Law) provide the Seller (or its
representatives), upon written notice and in accordance with the Group's 

 





policies (as were in place immediately prior to Closing), with access to the
employees, branches, secure areas, vehicles and customer sites of the Group;
and

| 
---|--- 

(v)

|

in the event of any dispute with a Cash Solutions Customer, request
documentation from and correspond with such Cash Solutions Customer on behalf
of the Seller, 

in each case as may be necessary to investigate a Potential Shortfall or
investigate and/or take conduct of Pre-Closing Customer Claim.

| 
---|--- 

7.6.9

|

The Purchaser agrees and undertakes that it shall procure that: 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

in respect of any Pre-Closing Customer Claims, the Group Companies shall

In respect of each Cash Processing Centre, in the event that the relevant

Inventory"): 

| 
---|---

|

where the relevant Cash Processing Centre did not hold any Valuables owned by
a Group Company or a member of the Seller's Group prior to Closing, the Excess
Inventory shall be for the sole benefit of the Purchaser; and 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

where the relevant Cash Processing Centre held Valuables owned by a Group
Company or a member of the Seller's Group prior to Closing, any Excess

conducted reasonable enquiries to establish that no Cash Solutions Customer
has any claim to any of the Excess Inventory. 

| 
---|--- 

7.6.11

|

For the avoidance of doubt, Clause 14 applies such that the entitlement of the
Purchaser or relevant Group Company (where appropriate) to be paid any
proceeds actually received by the Seller under the Seller's Group Insurance
Policies is not prejudiced by this Clause 7.6, provided that there shall be no
double recovery by the Purchaser in respect of a Loss under this Clause 7.6.

|

not make any admission of liability, agreement or compromise in relation to

to discuss in good faith any amendments that may be required to a Deposita

in the 6 months prior to the date of this Agreement, are consistent with such
services for such Existing Deposita Contract ("Consistent Service

|

to procure that Consistent Service Amendments as agreed between the Seller and
the Purchaser are incorporated in the relevant Deposita Support Agreement by
the relevant member of the Seller's Group and the relevant Group Company as

Company may need to provide any affected Existing Deposita Customers with
traditional cash in transit services until resolution of the Relevant Failure.
In this scenario, the Seller agrees to reimburse on demand the Purchaser (on

aggregate amount is invoiced by OCS to the Counterparty in relation to OCS

|

in the case of the Purchase Price where such withholding or deduction is: (a)

deduction or withholding has been made) is no more and no less than it would
have been entitled to receive in the absence of any such requirement to make a
deduction or withholding, provided that if a party shall have transferred (for
the avoidance of doubt, by whatever means, including by way of a declaration
of trust or anything that amounts in substance to a transfer) the benefit in

notices, returns or applications and send a copy thereof to the payer.

If the recipient of a payment made under this Agreement (or any affiliate of
or person with an interest in such recipient) obtains a refund of or obtains
and utilises a credit for any Taxation payable by it or similar benefit by
reason of any deduction or withholding for or on account of Taxation then it
shall reimburse to the payer such part of such additional amounts paid
pursuant to Clause 15.10.1 as the recipient of the payment certifies to the
payer will leave it (together with any affiliate of or person with an interest
it) (after such reimbursement) in no better and no worse position than would
have arisen if the payer had not been required to make such deduction or
withholding.

as will ensure that: 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

after payment of any Taxation charged on such sum in the hands of the
recipient (or any affiliate of or person with an interest in such recipient) 

 





(including any Taxation which would have been charged in the absence of any
Reliefs); and

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

after giving credit for any Relief that is or will be available to the
recipient (or any affiliate of or person with an interest in such recipient)

received in the absence of such a charge to Taxation or Relief provided first
that the reference in this Clause 15.10.4 to a Relief shall include any saving
of Taxation which is the subject of Clause 6.3.3 and provided secondly that if
a party shall have transferred (for the avoidance of doubt, by whatever means,
including by way of a declaration of trust or anything that amounts in
substance to a transfer) the benefit in whole or in part of this Agreement or
shall have changed its tax residence or the permanent establishment to which
the rights under this Agreement are allocated (or any affiliate of or person
with an interest in a party shall have transferred its rights under this
Agreement or its interest in the party or changed its tax residence or the
permanent establishment to which its rights under this Agreement or its
interest in the party are allocated) then the liability of the other party
under this Clause 15.10.4 shall be limited to that (if any) which it would
have been had no such transfer or change taken place.

| 
---|--- 

15.10.5

|

Clause 15.10.4 shall not apply if and to the extent that the amount of the
indemnity, compensation or reimbursement payment has already been adjusted to

relief that is or will be available in respect of the matter giving rise to
the payment.

|

notify the Seller at least twenty Business Days prior to making any deduction
(which notice shall include a statement of the amounts the Relevant Purchaser
intends to deduct or withhold in respect of making such payment and the
applicable provision of law requiring it to withhold or deduct); 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

provide the Seller with a reasonable opportunity to provide such forms or
other evidence that would eliminate or reduce any such deduction or
withholding; and 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

cooperate in good faith with the Seller to reduce or eliminate such deduction
or withholding.
