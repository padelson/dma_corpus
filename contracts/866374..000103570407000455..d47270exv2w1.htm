</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This copy of the Merger Agreement has been attached as an exhibit to the Report on Form 8-K to
provide investors with information regarding its terms. Except for its status as a legal document
governing the contractual rights among the parties thereto in relation to the proposed merger and
the other transactions contemplated thereby, the Merger Agreement is not intended to be a source of
factual, business or operational information about Flextronics, Solectron or their respective
businesses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement are not necessarily
accurate or complete as made and may be subject to exceptions set forth in the disclosure schedules
provided in accordance with the Merger Agreement. Such representations, warranties and covenants
have been negotiated by Flextronics and Solectron for the purpose of allocating contractual risk
between the parties, including where the parties do not have complete knowledge of all the facts,
and not for the purpose of establishing matters as facts. The representations and warranties may
also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable
to investors. Investors are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and any
shareholder of Flextronics or Solectron or any potential investor should not rely on the
representations, warranties and covenants therein or any descriptions thereof as characterizations
of the actual state of facts or condition of the parties or any of their affiliates.

instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to herein,
including the Confidentiality Agreement (i)&nbsp;constitute the entire agreement among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, it being understood

the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such
void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will
achieve, to the greatest extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or
unenforceable provision.

and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the
exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The
parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof
