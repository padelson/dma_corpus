CAUTIONARY STATEMENT 

   

 This copy of the Merger Agreement has been attached as an exhibit to the Report on Form 8-K to provide investors with information regarding its terms. Except for its status as a legal document governing the contractual rights among the parties thereto in relation to the proposed merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby, the Merger Agreement is not intended to be a source of factual, business or operational information about Flextronics, Solectron or their respective businesses. 

  

 The representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement are not necessarily accurate or complete as made and may be subject to exceptions set forth in the disclosure schedules provided in accordance with the Merger Agreement. Such representations, warranties and covenants have been negotiated by Flextronics and Solectron for the purpose of allocating contractual risk between the parties, including where the parties do not have complete knowledge of all the facts, and not for the purpose of establishing matters as facts. The representations and warranties may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to investors. Investors are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and any shareholder of Flextronics or Solectron or any potential investor should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants therein or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the parties or any of their affiliates.

ARTICLE I 

  

THE MERGER

    

 1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time and subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("Delaware Law"), (i) Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company (the "First Step Merger"), the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, and (ii) immediately following the First Step Merger, as part of a single integrated plan, the Company shall be merged with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent to be designated by Parent ("Merger Sub 2" and such merger, the "Second Step Merger", and collectively with the First Step Merger, the "Merger"), the separate corporate existence of the Company shall cease and Merger Sub 2 shall continue as the surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent. The terms of the First Step Merger shall be as provided in Sections 1.2 through 1.10 below, and the terms of the Second Step Merger shall be as provided in the Form of Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Second Step Merger Agreement").

Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the parties hereto shall cause the First Step Merger to be consummated by filing a Certificate of Merger in customary form and substance with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of Delaware Law (the "Certificate of Merger") (the time of such filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or such later time as may be agreed in writing by the Company and Parent and specified in the Certificate of Merger) being the "Effective Time") as soon as practicable on the Closing Date. 

   

 (b) _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt and Mosle LLP, located at 101 Park Avenue, New York, New York, or such other place as agreed to by the parties, at a time and date to be specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the third Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those that by their terms are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing but subject to the satisfaction of those conditions), or at such other time, date and location as the parties hereto agree in writing. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to herein as the "Closing Date." "Business Day" shall mean each day that is not a 

    ##### 

  

 

Saturday, Sunday or other day on which banking institutions located in the
State of California are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to
close. 

   

 1.3 _Effect of the First Step Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the First Step Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. 

  

 (a) _Certificate of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in its entirety to be identical to the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in accordance with Delaware Law and as provided in such certificate of incorporation; provided, however, that at the Effective Time, Article I of the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows: "The name of the corporation is Solectron Corporation." 

   

 (b) _Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in their entirety to be identical to the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time until thereafter amended in accordance with Delaware Law and as provided in such bylaws. 

   

 1.5 _Directors and Officers_. 

  

 (a) _Directors_. The initial directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. 

   

 (b) _Officers_. The initial officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly appointed. 

   

 (c) _Subsidiaries_. Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation shall take such action as reasonably requested by Parent to cause the directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time to be the directors and officers, respectively, of each of the Companys Subsidiaries immediately after the Effective Time, each to hold office as a director or officer of each such Subsidiary in accordance with the provisions of the laws of the respective jurisdiction of organization and the respective bylaws or equivalent organizational documents of each such Subsidiary. 

     ##### 

 

   

 1.6 _Effect on Capital Stock_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the First Step Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any shares of capital stock of the Company, the following shall occur: 

  

 (a) _Company Common Stock_. Each share of the common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 1.6(d), will be canceled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder thereof (with respect to each holder, an "Election"), but subject to Sections 1.6(b), 1.6(c), 1.6(g), 1.7 and 1.8(g), either: (i) subject to Section 1.6(f), 0.3450 (the "Exchange Ratio") of an ordinary share, no par value, of Parent ("Parent Ordinary Shares," and such fraction of a Parent Ordinary Share, "Stock Consideration") or (ii) $3.89 in cash, without interest ("Cash Consideration," and together with the Stock Consideration, the "Merger Consideration"); provided that (i) in no event shall the maximum number of shares of Company Common Stock to be converted into Stock Consideration (the "Stock Conversion Number") exceed the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) 0.70 and (ii) in no event shall the maximum number of shares of Company Common Stock to be converted into Cash Consideration (the "Cash Conversion Number") exceed the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) 0.50; and provided further that subject to Section 1.7, each holders Election shall be for either (i) Cash Consideration (a "Cash Election") for all of the shares of Company Common Stock ("Cash Election Shares") held by such holder or (ii) Stock Consideration (a "Stock Election") for all of the shares of Company Common Stock ("Stock Election Shares") held by such holder. Any Company Common Stock or Exchangeable Shares for which an Election is not timely made as provided in Section 1.8(c) below shall be deemed "Non-Election Shares." 

   

 (b) _Restricted Stock_. If any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition (including, without limitation, restrictions on transferability) under any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement or arrangement with the Company that does not by its terms provide that such repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition lapses upon consummation of the First Step Merger, including Company Common Stock issued under the Companys 2002 Stock Plan pursuant to restricted stock purchase agreements ("Company Restricted Stock"), then notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Restricted Stock shall have the right to make an Election to receive either the Stock Consideration or Cash Consideration with respect to such shares in accordance with Section 1.6(a), and such shares will be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive Stock Consideration or Cash Consideration in accordance with Section 1.6(a), which Stock Consideration or Cash Consideration will also be unvested and be subject to the same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition (including, without limitation, restrictions on transferability), and the certificates representing any Parent Ordinary Shares issued in respect thereof may accordingly be marked with appropriate legends. To the extent any shares of Company Restricted Stock are converted into the right to receive Cash Consideration, such Cash 

    ##### 

  

    

Consideration shall vest and become payable on the date that the Company
Restricted Stock would have otherwise vested pursuant to its original vesting
schedule as in effect prior to the Effective Time, and such payment shall be
made at the first regularly scheduled payroll date of Parent (or a Subsidiary
of Parent) following the vesting date applicable to such payment. 

   

 (c) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement and to the extent appraisal rights are available under Delaware Law, Company Common Stock and Series B Preferred Stock held by stockholders who shall have neither voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal for such Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the Delaware Law (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration, but instead shall be entitled to such rights, but only such rights, as are granted under such Section 262 (unless and until such stockholder shall have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, such stockholders right to appraisal under the Delaware Law). If any holder of Dissenting Shares shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost such holders rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Shares prior to the Election Deadline, such holders shares of Company Common Stock (or, if applicable, the Exchangeable Shares underlying the Series B Preferred Stock), as the case may be, shall thereupon be deemed to be Non-Election Shares for all purposes of this Agreement unless such stockholder properly makes an Election with respect to such shares prior to the Election Deadline. All Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Shares under such Section 262 after the Election Deadline shall thereupon be deemed Non-Election Shares and therefore converted into, and become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 1.8(d), of the Certificates or Book Entry Shares that formerly evidenced such Company Common Stock (or, if applicable, the Exchangeable Shares underlying the Series B Preferred Stock) as the case may be. If the Merger is rescinded or abandoned for any reason, then the right of any stockholder to be paid the fair value of such stockholders Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of Delaware Law shall cease. 

   

 (d) _Cancellation of Treasury and Parent Owned Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company or Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company or of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof. 

   

 (e) _Stock Options_. 

   

 (i) Each Company Option (as defined below) that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then exercisable, with an exercise price equal to or less than $5.00, will be assumed by Parent and converted into an option to purchase Parent Ordinary Shares ("Assumed Options"). Each Assumed Option will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions, except that (A) each Assumed Option shall be exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of whole Parent Ordinary Shares equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share) 

   ##### 

  

 

and (B) the per share exercise price for the Parent Ordinary Shares issuable
upon exercise of such Assumed Option shall be equal to the quotient
determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
at which such Company Option was exercisable immediately prior to
the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole
cent). The conversion of Company Options provided for in this Section
1.6(e)(i) with respect to any Company Options, whether or not they are
intended to be "incentive stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the
Code), shall be effected in a manner consistent with Section 424(a) of the
Code and otherwise in a manner designed to avoid their becoming deferred
compensation arrangements subject to Section 409A of the Code to the extent
permitted by Legal Requirements. 

   

 (ii) Each Company Option that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then exercisable, which is not an Assumed Option and which has not been exercised prior to the Effective Time, shall, effective at the Effective Time, be canceled and extinguished without any conversion or assumption thereof. 

  

 (f) _Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a Parent Ordinary Share will be issued by virtue of the First Step Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a Parent Ordinary Share (after aggregating all fractional Parent Ordinary Shares that otherwise would be received by such holder) shall, upon surrender of such holders Certificate(s) or Book Entry Share(s) or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in the manner provided in Section 1.10, receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, less the amount of any withholding taxes as contemplated by Section 1.8(g), which are required to be withheld with respect thereto, equal to the product of: (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the product of (x) the average of the per share closing prices of the Parent Ordinary Shares reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market during the five (5) consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date and (y) the Exchange Ratio. 

   

 (g) _Adjustments to Exchange Ratio and Cash Consideration_. The Exchange Ratio and the Cash Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect fully the appropriate effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Parent Ordinary Shares or Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with respect to Parent Ordinary Shares or Company Common Stock having a record date on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (h) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (i) _Cancellation of Series B Preferred Stock_. The Series B Preferred Stock will be cancelled as provided in the Company Charter Documents and Section 5.14 

    ##### 

  

     

 1.7 _Allocation of the Merger Consideration_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in the circumstances described below in this Section 1.7, the Merger Consideration shall be allocated as provided below in this Section 1.7: 

  

 (a) If the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which Stock Elections shall have been made (the "Stock Election Number") exceeds the Stock Conversion Number, then (i) all Cash Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration, and (ii) the Stock Election Shares of each holder shall be converted into the right to receive (x) the Stock Consideration in respect of that number of Stock Election Shares equal to the product of (1) the number of Stock Election Shares held by such holder and (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Stock Conversion Number and the denominator of which is the Stock Election Number, and (y) Cash Consideration in respect of the remaining number of such holders Stock Election Shares; 

   

 (b) If the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which Cash Elections shall have been made (the "Cash Election Number") exceeds the Cash Conversion Number, then (i) all Stock Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration, and (ii) the Cash Election Shares of each holder shall be converted into the right to receive (x) the Cash Consideration in respect of that number of Cash Election Shares equal to the product of (1) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder and (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Cash Conversion Number and the denominator of which is the Cash Election Number, and (y) Stock Consideration in respect of the remaining number of such holders Cash Election Shares; or 

   

 (c) If (x) the Stock Election Number is less than the Stock Conversion Number and (y) the Cash Election Number is less than the Cash Conversion Number (the amount by which the Cash Conversion Number exceeds the Cash Election Number, the "Cash Shortfall Number"), then: 

   

 (i) all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration; 

  

 (ii) all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration; and 

  

 (iii) the Non-Election Shares of each holder shall be treated in the following manner: (A) if the Cash Shortfall Number is greater than or equal to the number of Non-Election Shares, then all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration; or (B) if the Cash Shortfall Number is less than the number of Non-Election Shares, then the Non-Election Shares of each holder shall be converted into the right to receive (1) the Cash Consideration in respect of that number of Non-Election Shares equal to the product of (x) the number of Non-Election Shares held by such holder and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Number and the denominator of which is the total number of Non-Election Shares, and (2) Stock Consideration in respect of the remaining number of such holders Non-Election Shares. 

   ##### 

  

  

 1.8 _Surrender of Certificates; Election of Merger Consideration_. 

  

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as the exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the Merger. The Exchange Agent shall make all computations as to the allocation and the proration of the Merger Consideration contemplated by Section 1.7, and any such computations shall be binding on the Company stockholders absent manifest error. Such computations shall be made as soon as practicable after the Election Deadline, but in no event more than five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date (or such other time as may be agreed in writing by the Company and Parent). The Exchange Agent may, with the mutual agreement of Parent and the Company, make such rules as are consistent with this Section 1.8 and as shall be reasonably necessary to effect the Elections provided for herein. 

   

 (b) _Parent to Provide Merger Consideration_. 

   

 (i) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement with the Exchange Agent, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company, which shall provide that Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this Article I, the share certificate(s) representing the number of Parent Ordinary Shares issuable and the aggregate Cash Consideration payable pursuant to this Article I in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. In addition, Parent shall make available as necessary, cash in an amount sufficient for payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or distributions which holders of shares of Company Common Stock may be entitled pursuant to Section 1.8(e). Any cash and Parent Ordinary Shares deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange Fund." 

  

 (ii) Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent (A) as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, certificates representing the number of Parent Ordinary Shares sufficient to deliver, and Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely deliver, the aggregate Stock Consideration, and (B) at or prior to the Effective Time, immediately available funds equal to the aggregate Cash Consideration (together with, to the extent then determinable, any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f)) and Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely pay the Cash Consideration, and such cash in lieu of fractional shares, in accordance with this Agreement. To the extent that there are any losses with respect to any investment of the Exchange Fund, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Exchange Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by this Agreement (including with respect to former Dissenting Shares held by stockholders of the Company who shall have failed to perfect or who shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Shares under Section 262 of Delaware Law), Parent shall promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Exchange Agent to make such payments contemplated by this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) _Elections_. 

   

 (i) All Elections made pursuant to Section 1.6(a) shall be made on a form designated for that purpose that is reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company (an "Election Form"). A holder acting in different capacities or acting on behalf of different beneficial owners shall be entitled to submit an Election Form for each capacity in which such holder so acts with respect to each person for which it so acts. 

  

 (ii) Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail the Election Form to each of the Companys stockholders entitled to vote at the Company Stockholders Meeting, at the time that the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus is provided to the shareholders of the Company. Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to use reasonable best efforts to make available as promptly as possible an Election Form to any shareholder of the Company who requests such Election Form following the initial mailing of the Election Form and prior to the Election Deadline. 

  

 (iii) Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail the Election Form to each holder of record of Exchangeable Shares who is entitled to vote in respect of the Company Stockholders Meeting pursuant to the outstanding share of Series B Preferred Stock, at the time that the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus is provided to the stockholders of the Company. Such Election Form shall permit each such holder of Exchangeable Shares to complete such Election Form and make an Election as if such holder were the registered holder of the Company Common Stock to which such holder of Exchangeable Shares will be entitled on completion of the Redemption or Exchange. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Exchange Agent to make available as promptly as practicable an Election Form to any holder of Exchangeable Shares who requests such Election Form following the initial mailing of the Election Form and prior to the Election Deadline. For all purposes hereunder such an Election by a holder of Exchangeable Shares will be considered an Election made with respect to shares of Company Common Stock, subject to completion of the Redemption or Exchange. 

  

 (iv) Any Election shall be deemed to have been made properly only if the Exchange Agent shall have received, by the Election Deadline, an Election Form properly completed and signed. For purposes of this Agreement, "Election Deadline" means 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on the later of (i) the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting and (ii) the date that Parent and the Company shall agree is as near as practicable to ten (10) Business Days prior to the expected Closing Date. Parent and the Company shall cooperate to issue a press release announcing the date of the Election Deadline not more than fifteen (15), but at least ten (10), Business Days prior to the Election Deadline. 

  

 (v) An Election shall have been made properly only if the Exchange Agent shall have received, by the Election Deadline, an Election Form properly completed and signed. 

  

 (vi) If any Election is not timely or otherwise properly made with respect to any shares of Company Common Stock, such Election shall be deemed not effective, and the shares of Company Common Stock covered by such Election shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed to be Non-Election Shares, unless a proper Election is filed by the Election Deadline. 

   ##### 

  

 

None of Parent, the Company or the Exchange Agent shall have any obligation to
notify any holder of any defect in its Election prior to the Election
Deadline. 

   

 (vii) Any holder may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline, (x) change such holders Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a properly completed and signed, revised Election Form or (y) revoke his, her or its Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. All Elections shall be revoked automatically if the Exchange Agent is notified in writing by Parent or the Company that this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Article VII. 

  

 (d) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of (i) a certificate or certificates (the "Certificates") or (ii) non-certificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry ("Book Entry Shares") which in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time represented: (1) outstanding shares of Company Common Stock that were converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I; or (2) outstanding Exchangeable Shares that were redeemed or exchanged for shares of Company Common Stock in connection with the Redemption or the Exchange, as the case may be, and such shares of Company Common Stock were subsequently converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates or Book Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent and shall be in customary form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify and the Company shall reasonably approve prior to the Effective Time) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book Entry Shares in exchange for the right to receive either, but not a combination of, (x) certificates representing whole Parent Ordinary Shares or (y) the Cash Consideration, in each case determined in accordance with Section 1.6(a), and cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 1.8(e). Upon surrender of Certificates or Book Entry Shares for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent (with appropriate notice of such appointment having been provided to such holders of record), together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor share certificate(s) representing the number of whole Parent Ordinary Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.6(a), if any, any payment of the Cash Consideration which such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.6(a) and any payment in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.8(e), in each case after taking into account all Certificates or Book Entry Shares surrendered by such holder and such holders Election, and the Certificates or Book Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates or Book Entry Shares will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to evidence the right to receive such whole number of Parent Ordinary Shares into which such shares of Company Common Stock shall have been so converted in accordance with Section 1.6(a), the right to receive payment of the Cash Consideration in accordance with Section 1.6(a) and the right to 

    ##### 

  

    

receive an amount in cash in lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares in
accordance with Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or distributions payable
pursuant to Section 1.8(e). If a holder that is entitled to receive both Cash
Consideration and Stock Consideration in respect of Company Common Stock held
by such owner immediately prior to the Effective Time surrenders Certificates
or Book Entry Shares representing fewer than all of such Company Common
Stock, such holder will receive both Cash Consideration and Stock
Consideration in proportion to the relative amounts of Cash Consideration and
Stock Consideration it is entitled to receive for all of the Company
Common Stock it held immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (e) _Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. Whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared or made after the date hereof with respect to Parent Ordinary Shares with a record date after the Effective Time, such declaration shall include a dividend or other distribution in respect of all Parent Ordinary Shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the date hereof with respect to Parent Ordinary Shares with a record date after the Effective Time and no payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) will be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered Certificates or Book Entry Shares with respect to the Parent Ordinary Shares represented thereby until the holders of record of such Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall surrender such Certificates or Book Entry Shares. Subject to applicable Legal Requirements, following surrender of any such Certificates or Book Entry Shares, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to the holders thereof, without interest (i) promptly after such surrender, share certificates(s) representing such number of whole Parent Ordinary Shares issued in exchange therefor, if any, and the Cash Consideration payable, if any, in exchange therefor, in each case pursuant to Section 1.6(a), along with payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and the amount of any such dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and theretofore paid with respect to such whole Parent Ordinary Shares and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole Parent Ordinary Shares. 

   

 (f) _Transfers of Ownership_. If Parent Ordinary Shares are to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificates or Book Entry Shares surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it will be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificates or Book Entry Shares so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Persons requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of Parent Ordinary Shares in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificates or Book Entry Shares surrendered, or established to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. 

   

 (g) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Exchange Agent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, the amount of such consideration shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such consideration would otherwise have been paid. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (h) _No Liability_. None of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of Company Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Legal Requirements. For purposes of this Agreement, "Legal Requirements" shall mean any federal, state, local, municipal, foreign or other law, statute, constitution, principle of common law, resolution, ordinance, code, order, edict, decree, directive, rule, regulation, ruling or requirement issued, enacted, adopted, promulgated, implemented or otherwise put into effect by or under the authority of any Governmental Entity 

   

 (i) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent on a daily basis; provided that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to Company stockholders pursuant to this Article I. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable to Company stockholders pursuant to this Article I shall be paid to Parent as soon as practicable at the end of each calendar month. 

   

 (j) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Book Entry Shares twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates or Book Entry Shares who have not surrendered such Certificates or Book Entry Shares in compliance with this Section 1.8 shall after such delivery to Parent look only to Parent for the payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.6(a), cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 1.8(e) with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby. 

   

 1.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Stock Consideration and Cash Consideration paid, together with any cash or other distributions paid pursuant to Sections 1.6(f) and 1.8(e), upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I. 

  

 1.10 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue and/or pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such share certificate(s) representing Parent Ordinary Shares to be issued pursuant to Section 1.6(a), any Cash Consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.6(a), cash for fractional shares, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.8(e); provided, however, that Parent may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as 

   ##### 

  

 

indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Company or
the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed. 

   

 1.11  _Alternative Structure_. If the condition described in Section 6.1(f)(i) to the obligations of each party to effect the Merger is not satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date, then (i) each party shall have the right in its sole discretion to unilaterally waive such condition on behalf of all parties and (ii) if any such party so waives such condition, then the Merger shall not be consummated as described in Section 1.1, but instead, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. The terms of such merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company shall be as provided in Sections 1.2 through 1.10 above, provided that, all references therein (and in any other Section of this Agreement) to the "First Step Merger" shall be deemed to refer to the merger pursuant to this Section 1.11, and all references in this Agreement to the "Merger" shall be deemed to refer to such merger (except for references to "Merger" in Recital B, Section 2.6(b)(xiii), Section 3.6(a)(v), Section 5.12 and Section 6.1(f), which shall apply only to the Merger contemplated in Section 1.1). Nothing contained in this Section 1.11 shall have any effect on the Merger Consideration. 

  

 1.12 _Further Action_. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

 (D) the Company shall have delivered to Parent written notice (a "Company Change of Recommendation Notice") at least five (5) Business Days prior to publicly effecting the applicable action contemplated by clause (x), (y) and/or (z) above, which shall state expressly (1) that the Company has received the applicable Superior Offer, (2) the most recent terms and conditions of such Superior Offer and the identity of the Person or group making such Superior Offer (and in the event the Company intends to exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii), the Company shall provide to Parent a copy of the proposed definitive agreement to be entered into in connection with such Superior Offer), and (3) that the Company intends to effect 

   ##### 

  

    

the proposed action referenced in clause (x), (y) and/or (z) above in
connection with such Superior Offer; and 

   

 (E) after delivering the Company Change of Recommendation Notice, the Company provides Parent with a reasonable opportunity to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement during the five-Business Day period contemplated by the preceding clause (iv), and negotiate in good faith with respect thereto during such five-Business Day period, so as would enable the Company to proceed with its recommendation to stockholders in favor of the Company Voting Proposal without effecting the proposed action referenced in clause (x), (y) and/or (z) above. 

  

 (ii) In addition and not in limitation of the forgoing, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.3(a) or set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company may effect a Company Change of Recommendation for any reason other than the receipt of a Superior Offer only if all of the following conditions are met: 

   

 (A) the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good faith, after consultation with the Companys financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to effect the proposed Company Change of Recommendation would reasonably be expected to be a breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under Delaware Law; 

   

 (B) the stockholders of the Company have not yet approved the Company Voting Proposal; 

   

 (C) the Company shall have delivered to Parent a Company Change of Recommendation Notice (which notice shall not itself be a Company Recommendation Change) at least five (5) Business Days prior to publicly effecting the proposed, which shall state expressly (1) that the Company is proposing to effect a Company Recommendation Change, and (2) the reason(s) for which the Board of Directors of the Company proposes to effect the Company Recommendation Change; and 

   

 (D) after delivering the Company Change of Recommendation Notice, the Company negotiates with Parent in good faith during such five-Business Day period so as to enable the Company to proceed with its recommendation to stockholders in favor of the Company Voting Proposal without making a Company Recommendation Change. 

  

 (e) _Compliance with Disclosure Obligations_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Board of Directors of the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (ii) making any other statement or disclosure to the Companys stockholders if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel) 

    ##### 

  

    

that the failure to make such statement or disclosure would reasonably be
expected to be a breach of fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders
under applicable law; provided, however, that, in each case, any such
statements or disclosures will be subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement; and provided, further, that unless the Board of Directors of the
Company expressly publicly reaffirms its recommendation of the Merger in
connection with such statement or disclosure, such statement or disclosure
(other than a "stop, look and listen" communication of the type contemplated
by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Company
Change of Recommendation in breach of Section 5.2(a)(ii) unless the Company
shall have complied with Section 5.3(d) in connection therewith. 

   

 (f) _State Takeover Statute_. The Board of Directors of the Company shall not, in connection with any Company Change of Recommendation, take any action to change the approval of the Board of Directors of the Company for purposes of causing any state takeover statute or other state law to be applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company and its Board of Directors shall, if any takeover statute or similar Legal Requirement is or becomes applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Legal Requirement on the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 5.3(f) shall not prohibit the Company from effecting a Change of Recommendation or terminating this Agreement under the circumstances and subject to the conditions set forth in this Section 5.3. 

   

 (g) _Continuing Obligation to Call, Hold and Convene Stockholders  Meeting; No Other Vote_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but subject to the provisions of Section 7.1(d)(ii), the obligation of the Company to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Stockholders Meeting shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to it of any Acquisition Proposal, or by any Change of Recommendation. The Company shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any Acquisition Proposal, or propose to do so. 

   

 (h) _Certain Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings: 

   

 (i) "Acquisition Proposal," with respect to the Company, shall mean any offer or proposal relating to any transaction or series of related transactions involving: (a) any purchase from the Company or acquisition by any Person or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder) of more than a 20% interest in the total outstanding voting securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder) beneficially owning more than 20% of the total outstanding voting securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (b) any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than any such transaction effected by the Company in which the only parties to such transaction are any of the Company and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries pursuant to which the stockholders of the Company 

   ##### 

  

    

immediately prior to such transaction would hold less than 80% of the
outstanding voting securities of the resulting or surviving Person in such
transaction immediately after such transaction, (c) any sale, lease (other
than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice),
exchange, transfer, license (other than in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice), acquisition or disposition of more than 20%
of the assets of the Company (including its Subsidiaries taken as a whole),
or (d) any liquidation or dissolution of the Company (provided, however, that
the transactions between Parent and the Company contemplated by this
Agreement shall not be deemed an Acquisition Proposal); and 

  

 (ii) "Superior Offer," with respect to the Company, shall mean a bona fide Acquisition Proposal by a third party on terms that the Board of Directors of the Company has in good faith concluded, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, taking into account, among other things, all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the offer and the Person making the offer, to be more favorable to the Companys stockholders (in their capacities as stockholders) from a financial point of view than the Merger, provided that each reference to 20% in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be replaced with "90%" for purposes hereof and each reference to 80% in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be replaced with "10%" for purposes hereof. 

  

 (i) _Violation by Company Agents_. It is understood and agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.3 by any officer, director, agent, representative or affiliate of the Company shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the Company.

 (a) _Confidentiality_. The parties acknowledge that the Company and Parent have previously executed a mutual Confidentiality Agreement dated April 3, 2007 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), which Confidentiality Agreement will continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms and each of Parent and the Company will hold, and will cause its respective directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates and advisors (including attorneys, accountants, consultants, bankers and financial advisors) to hold and keep confidential, any proprietary information subject to the Confidentiality Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof. 

   

 (b) _Access to Information_. 

   

 (i) The Company shall afford Parent and its accountants, counsel and other representatives, reasonable access and upon reasonable prior notice during normal business hours, beginning as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, to the properties, books, analysis, projections, plans, systems, contracts (including, without limitation, Company Material Contracts), commitments, records, personnel offices and other facilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries during the period prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement to obtain all information concerning the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including, without limitation, the status of product development efforts, properties, results of operations and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries and use reasonable best 

    ##### 

 

  

efforts to make available at reasonable times during normal business hours to
Parent and its representatives, the appropriate individuals (including
management, personnel, attorneys, accountants and other professionals) for
discussion of the Companys and its Subsidiaries business, properties,
prospects and personnel as Parent may reasonably request. During such period,
the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to), subject to any
limitations imposed by Legal Requirements with respect to records of
employees, furnish promptly to Parent (A) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such
period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws and (B) all
other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent
may reasonably request.

 (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and Parent may restrict such access to the extent that (i) Legal Requirements applicable to the Company or Parent, as the case may be, or their respective Subsidiaries may reasonably require the Company or Parent, as the case may be, or their respective Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such properties, personnel or information and (ii) such access would be in breach of any confidentiality obligation, commitment or provision by which the Company or Parent, as the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries is bound or affected, which confidentiality obligation, commitment or provision or the inability to furnish such access shall then be disclosed to the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to the maximum extent permitted without resulting in such breach, or (iii) any such access or disclosure which would be reasonably likely to cause the loss of attorney-client privilege; provided that, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), the parties will cooperate to arrive at a solution that permits access to be furnished but without violating the applicable confidentiality obligation or resulting in a loss of attorney-client privilege, as applicable. 

  

 (iv) Any information obtained from the Company or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries pursuant to the access contemplated by this Section 5.4 shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement. 

  

 (c) _No Modification of Representations and Warranties or Covenants_. No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation or notification pursuant to this Section 5.4 or Section 5.5, or otherwise shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained herein, the covenants or agreements of the parties hereto or the conditions to the obligations of the parties hereto under this Agreement. 

  

 5.5 _Public Disclosure_. The parties acknowledge that they have agreed to the text of the joint press release announcing the signing of this Agreement. Without limiting any other provision of this Agreement, Parent and the Company will consult with each other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon and use reasonable best efforts to agree on any other press release or public statement with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and will not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation and (to the extent 

   ##### 

  

    

practicable) agreement, except as may be required by law or any requirement of
The Nasdaq Stock Market, the New York Stock Exchange or the Toronto Stock
Exchange; provided that the Company shall not have any obligation to consult
with Parent regarding, or provide Parent the opportunity to review and
comment upon, and Parent shall have no right to agree to, any press release or
public statements with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or any Change of
Recommendation or other action taken in accordance with Section 5.3. 

  

 5.6 _Regulatory Filings; Reasonable Best Efforts_. 

  

 (a) _Regulatory Filings_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall coordinate and cooperate with one another and shall each use reasonable best efforts to comply with all Legal Requirements that require any of them to make any filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications or submissions of other documents to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall make all such filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications or submissions of other documents in connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation: (i) Notification and Report Forms with the FTC and the DOJ as required by the HSR Act; (ii) filings under (A) Section 2.3(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter, (B) Section 3.3(d) of the Parent Disclosure Letter and (C) under pre-merger notification or control laws of any other jurisdiction that are reasonably determined by Parent and the Company, jointly, to be required in connection with the Merger; and (iii) any filings required under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any applicable state or securities or "blue sky" laws and the securities laws of any foreign country.

Parent, Merger Sub and the Company each shall promptly supply the other with any information that may be required in order to effectuate any filings or application pursuant to this Section 5.6(a). 

  

 (b) _Notification_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, will notify the other promptly upon the receipt of (i) any comments from any Governmental Entity in connection with any filings made or information provided by a party hereto in respect of the Merger and (ii) any request by any Governmental Entity for amendments or supplements to any such filings or information. Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any filing made pursuant to Section 5.6(a), Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as the case may be, will promptly inform the other of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the applicable Governmental Entity such amendment or supplement. 

  

 (c) _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the express provisions of Section 5.2 and Section 5.3 hereof and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, each of the parties agrees to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things, that are reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, as promptly as practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the following: (i) the taking of acts necessary to cause the conditions precedent set forth in Article 

   ##### 

  

    

VI to be satisfied; (ii) the obtaining of necessary waivers, consents,
approvals, orders and authorizations from Governmental Entities, the making
of necessary registrations, declarations, submissions and filings (including
registrations, declarations, and filings with Governmental Entities, if any)
and the taking of steps necessary to avoid any suit, claim, action,
investigation or proceeding by any Governmental Entity; (iii) the defending
of any suits, claims, actions, investigations or proceedings, whether
judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and seeking to have vacated or
otherwise lifted or removed any order, decree or ruling that has been issued
or granted and has the effect of restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the Merger; (iv) the entry into supplemental indentures if and as
required pursuant to any Contract to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party or to which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries are bound, with effect as of or after the Effective Time; and

consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the
purposes of, this Agreement. In connection with and without limiting the
foregoing, the Company and its Board of Directors shall, if any takeover
statute or similar Legal Requirement is or becomes applicable to the Merger,
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such Legal Requirement on the Merger, this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 (d) _No Divestiture_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to agree to any Action of Divestiture. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, take or agree to take any Action of Divestiture. For purposes of this Agreement, an "Action of Divestiture" shall mean (i) any license, sale or other disposition or holding separate (through establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or properties of Parent, its subsidiaries or affiliates, or of the Company or its Subsidiaries that individually or taken together with any or all other restrictions or requirements contemplated by this Section 5.6(d) will have or are reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on the benefits expected to be derived from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) the imposition of any limitation on the ability of Parent, its Subsidiaries or affiliates, or the Company or its Subsidiaries to conduct their respective businesses or own any capital stock or assets or to acquire, hold or exercise full rights of ownership of their respective businesses and, in the case of Parent, the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries, that individually or taken together with any or all other restrictions or requirements contemplated by this Section 5.6(d) will have or are reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on the benefits expected to be derived from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii) the imposition of any impediment on Parent, its Subsidiaries or affiliates, or the Company or its Subsidiaries under any statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, order or other legal restraint governing competition, monopolies or restrictive trade practices that individually or taken together with any or all other restrictions or requirements contemplated by this Section 5.6(d) will have or are reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on the benefits expected to be derived from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 5.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. 

  

 (a) _By the Company_. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and Merger Sub of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event of which it has Knowledge, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which is likely to cause any representation or warranty of the Company to be untrue or inaccurate such that the conditions to closing set forth in Section 6.2(a) would fail to be satisfied, (ii) to the extent it has Knowledge thereof, any failure by the Company to comply with or satisfy any covenant or other agreement to be complied with by it hereunder such that the conditions to closing set forth in Section 6.2(b) would fail to be satisfied, (iii) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event of which it has Knowledge, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, or (iv) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event of which it has Knowledge, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which would reasonably be expected to cause the failure of any other conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under Section 6.2; provided, however, that no such notification shall affect the representations or warranties of the Company or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement; provided, further, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.7(a) shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder.

Such consents, waivers and approvals shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent. In connection with seeking such consents, waivers and approvals, the Company shall keep Parent informed of all material developments and shall, at Parents request, include Parent in any discussions or communications with any parties whose consent, waiver or approval is sought hereunder. In the event the Merger does not close for any reason, Parent shall not have any liability to the Company, its stockholders or any

other Person for any costs, claims, liabilities or damages resulting from the
Company seeking to obtain such consents, waivers and approvals. 

  

 5.9 _Equity Awards and Employee Matters_. 

  

 (a) _Company Options_. At the Effective Time, each then outstanding Company Option shall either be assumed by Parent or canceled and extinguished in accordance with Section 1.6(e). The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take actions, including sending any required notices under the Company Option Plans to the option holders and causing the plan administrator(s) for the Company Option Plans to take actions, in each case, to effectuate such assumption or cancellation of the Company Options as provided in Section 1.6(e). With respect to matters described in this Section 5.9(a), the Company will use reasonable best efforts to consult with Parent (and consider in good faith the advice of Parent) prior to sending any notices or other communication materials to its Company Employees/Service Providers, it being understood that where the parties are unable to agree, the Company will make the ultimate determination as to what materials are provided to Company Employees/Services Providers prior to Closing. 

  

 (b) _Restricted Stock_. At the Effective Time, each share of Company Restricted Stock then outstanding shall be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive Stock Consideration or Cash Consideration in accordance with Section 1.6(b).

 (i) The rights of participants in the Companys employee stock purchase plan (the "Company ESPP") with respect to any offering then underway under the Company ESPP shall be determined by treating a Business Day prior to the Effective Time designated by the Company as the last day of such offering and by making such other pro rata adjustments as may be necessary to reflect the shortened offering but otherwise treating such shortened offering as a fully effective and completed offering for all purposes under the Company ESPP. Outstanding rights to purchase shares of Company Common Stock shall be exercised in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Company ESPP. 

  

 (ii) As of the Effective Time, the Company ESPP shall be terminated. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (A) provide Parent with evidence that the Company ESPP has been terminated pursuant to resolutions of Companys Board of Directors, and the form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to prior review and approval of Parent, and (B) exercise reasonable best efforts to take such other actions (including, but not limited to, if appropriate, amending the Company ESPP) that are necessary to give effect to the transaction contemplated by this Section 5.9(c). 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) _Termination of 401(k) Plan(s)_. Effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, each of the Company, its Subsidiaries and any ERISA Affiliate shall terminate any and all Company Employee Plans intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (each a "401(k) Plan"), except for any such 401(k) Plan with respect to which, no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Parent provides written notice to the Company requesting that it not be terminated. Except for 401(k) Plan(s) with respect to which such a notice is provided, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such 401(k) Plan(s) have been terminated (effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company, its Subsidiaries or such ERISA Affiliate, as the case may be. Parent shall take all steps necessary to permit each Company Employee/Service Provider who has received an eligible rollover distribution (as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of the Code), including rollovers of any outstanding loans from each 401(k) Plan, if any, to roll such eligible rollover distribution as part of any lump sum distribution to the extent permitted by each 401(k) Plan into an account under Parents 401(k) plan (the "Parents 401(k) Plan"), to the extent permitted by Parents 401(k) Plan. During the period commencing at the Effective Time and continuing through the Closing Date, the Company agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Parent in good faith to provide for the orderly transition of the administration of the 401(k) Plan(s) as of the Effective Time for the purpose of implementing the termination of such plans following the Closing Date. 

  

 (e) _Employee Benefits; Service Credit_. As of and following the Closing Date, Parent will either (a) continue the Company Employee Plans, except as provided in Sections 5.9(d), (b) permit Continuing Employees and, as applicable, their eligible dependents, to participate in the employee benefit plans, programs and policies (including without limitation any plan intended to qualify within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code and any vacation, sick, personal time off plans or programs) of Parent ("Parent Benefit Plans") on terms no less favorable than those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent, or (c) a combination of clauses (a) and (b). Following the Effective Time, solely to the extent that Continuing Employees (as defined below) are covered under Parent Benefit Plans, Parent shall give each Continuing Employee credit for prior service with the Company or its Subsidiaries, including predecessor employers, for purposes of (i) eligibility and vesting under any applicable Parent Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate at or following the Effective Time and (ii) determination of benefits levels under any vacation or severance Parent Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate at or following the Effective Time; provided that in each case under clauses (i) and (ii) above, if the Company or any of its Subsidiaries maintains a comparable Company Employee Plan, service shall be credited solely to the extent that such crediting will not result in the duplication of benefits, or under any bonus or other incentive compensation, or sabbatical or similar plan, program, agreement or arrangement. Solely to the extent that Continuing Employees are covered under Parent Benefit Plans, Parent shall give credit under those of its applicable Parent Benefit Plans that are welfare benefit plans and in which Continuing Employees become eligible to participate at or following the Effective Time, for all co-payments made, amounts credited toward deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums, and time accrued against applicable waiting periods, by Continuing Employees (including their eligible dependents), in respect of the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs or the plan year in which Continuing Employees are transitioned from Company Employee Plans to comparable Parent Employee Plans, and Parent shall waive all requirements for evidence 

   ##### 

  

    

of insurability and pre-existing conditions otherwise applicable to the
Continuing Employees under the Parent Benefit Plans which are either employee
heath plans, including medical, dental, vision and prescription drug plans in
which the Continuing Employees become eligible to participate at or following
the Effective Time. For purposes of this Agreement, "Continuing Employees"
shall mean those employees of Parent and employees of the Surviving
Corporation as of the Effective Time who were employees of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (f) _Form S-8_. At or before the Effective Time, Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of Parent Ordinary Shares for delivery upon exercise of Assumed Options pursuant to Section 1.6(e)(i). Parent shall file with the SEC, as soon as practicable following the Effective Time and in no event later than five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time, a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) with respect to any interests in Company Plans, the Assumed Options and Parent Ordinary Shares issuable thereunder and shall maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as the relevant Assumed Options remain outstanding and registration of such interests or the Parent Ordinary Shares issuable thereunder continues to be required. 

  

 (g) _Treatment of the Company Deferred Compensation Plan_. If requested by Parent, within the 30-day period prior to the Closing Date, and subject to and conditioned upon the Closing, the Company shall terminate the Companys Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Deferred Compensation Plan"), provided that nothing in this Section 5.9(g) or Section 4.1(b) is intended to preclude the Company from terminating its Deferred Compensation Plan, in accordance with its terms, in the absence of such a request. As soon as administratively practicable following the date the Deferred Compensation Plan is terminated and subject to the terms of the Deferred Compensation Plan and its related trust and trust agreement, the Company shall commence distributing the assets of the Deferred Compensation Plan. To the extent the assets will not be distributed prior to the Closing Date, the Company agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Parent in good faith prior to the Closing Date to provide for the orderly transition of the administration of the Deferred Compensation Plan as of the Effective Time for the purpose of implementing the termination of such plan following the Closing Date. 

  

 (h) _Retention Arrangements_. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor, in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, the retention arrangements which are between the Company and any officer or employee thereof (individually and collectively referred to herein as the "Executives") or are maintained for the benefit of any Executive and are set forth in Section 5.9(h) of the Company Disclosure Letter (individually and collectively referred to herein as the "Retention Arrangements"). The obligations under this Section 5.9(h) shall not be terminated, amended, or otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Executive (and his or her heirs and representatives) without the prior written consent of such affected Executive. Each of the Executives (and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.9(h), with full rights of enforcement as if a party hereto.

officers insurance policy in effect as of the date hereof for actions and

purchase the Tail Policy consistent with the provisions of this Section
5.10(b). If Parent has not so directed, and has not itself purchased the Tail
Policy prior to the Closing, the Company shall be entitled to purchase the
Tail Policy without Parents consent, provided that the total premium and

(inclusive of brokers commissions).

In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Parent or the Company or their respective Subsidiaries, officers or directors, except (i) as set forth in Section 5.4(a), this Section 7.2, Section 7.3 and Article VIII, each of which shall survive the termination of this Agreement and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for any willful breach of this Agreement. No termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations of the parties contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which obligations shall survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with their terms. 

  

 7.3 _Fees and Expenses_. 

  

 (a) _General_. Except as set forth in this Section 7.3, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses whether or not the Merger is consummated; provided, however, that Parent and the Company shall share equally the fees in connection with (i) the filing of the Notification and Report Forms filed with the FTC and DOJ under the HSR Act, and all premerger notification and reports forms under similar applicable laws of other jurisdictions, in each case pursuant to Section 5.6(a), and (ii) the filing, printing and mailing of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus (including any preliminary materials related thereto) and the Registration Statement (including financial statements and exhibits) and any amendments or supplements thereto. 

  

 (b) _Company Payment_. 

  

 (i) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(iii) or Section 7.1(d)(iii) of this Agreement, the Company shall pay to Parent a cash fee equal to $100,000,000 (the "Termination Fee") in immediately available funds concurrent with such termination. 

  

 (ii) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iii) and (x) at least three (3) days prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, a proposal for an Acquisition with respect to the Company has been publicly disclosed and which is not withdrawn, and (y) within 12 months following the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iii), an Acquisition (whether or not the Acquisition referenced in the preceding 

   ##### 

  

    

clause (x)) is consummated or the Company enters into a definitive agreement
or letter of intent with respect to an Acquisition (whether or not the
Acquisition referenced in the preceding clause (x)) and such Acquisition is
subsequently consummated, then promptly, but in no event later than two (2)
Business Days after the consummation of such Acquisition, the Company shall
pay to Parent a cash fee equal to the Termination Fee in immediately
available funds; provided that if at the time this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iii), a Triggering Event has occurred, such
termination shall be deemed to be pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(iii) and
Section 7.3(b)(i) shall apply instead of this Section 7.3(b)(ii). For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be obligated to pay to
Parent more than one Termination Fee under this Agreement. 

  

 (iii) _Interest and Costs; Other Remedies_. The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in a timely manner the amounts due pursuant to this Section 7.3(b) and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent makes a claim that results in a judgment against the Company for the amounts set forth in this Section 7.3(b), the Company shall pay to Parent the reasonable costs and expenses of Parent (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts due pursuant to this Section 7.3(b) at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made. Except in the case of willful breach of this Agreement by the Company, payment of the Termination Fee by the Company shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement for any breaches or events that result in the payment of the Termination Fee. 

  

 (c) _Parent Payments_. 

  

 (i) _Payment_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iv) and (x) at least three days prior to the Parent Stockholder Meeting, a proposal for an Acquisition with respect to Parent has been publicly disclosed which is not withdrawn, and (y) within 12 months following the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iv), such Acquisition is consummated or Parent enters into a definitive agreement or letter of intent with respect to such Acquisition and such Acquisition is subsequently consummated, then promptly, but in no event later than two Business Days after the consummation of such Acquisition, Parent shall pay to the Company a cash fee equal to the Termination Fee in immediately available funds. 

  

 (ii) _Interest and Costs; Other Remedies_. Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3(c) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the Company would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Parent fails to pay in a timely manner the amounts due pursuant to this Section 7.3(c) and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company makes a claim that results in a judgment against Parent for the amounts set forth in this Section 7.3(c) Parent shall pay to the Company the reasonable costs and expenses of the Company (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts due pursuant to this Section 7.3(c) at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

Without limiting the foregoing, it is expressly understood and agreed that the provisions in Section 5.9 (other than Section 5.9(h)) are statements of intent and no Employees/Service Providers or other Person (including any party hereto) shall have any rights or remedies, including rights of enforcement, with respect thereto and no Employee/Service Provider or other Person is or is intended to be a third-party beneficiary thereof. 

  

 8.6 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the greatest extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision. 

  

 8.7 _Other Remedies; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof 

   ##### 

  

 

in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in

 8.9 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Except as provided in Section 8.7, each of the parties hereto irrevocably consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware) in connection with any matter based upon or arising out of this Agreement or the matters contemplated herein, agrees that process may be served upon them in any manner authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware for such Persons and waives and covenants not to assert or plead any objection which they might otherwise have to such jurisdiction, venue and such process. 

  

 8.10 _Rules of Construction_.

 NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows: 

  

 1. _Certain Definitions_. Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement:

 (b) "Expiration Date" means the earlier to occur of (i) such date and time as the Merger shall become effective in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Merger Agreement and (ii) such date and time as the Merger Agreement shall have been validly terminated pursuant to Article VII thereof. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) "Options" means: (i) all securities Beneficially Owned by a Stockholder as of the date of this Agreement that are convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, shares of capital stock of the Company, including, without limitation, options, warrants and other rights to acquire shares of Company Common Stock or other shares of capital stock of the Company; and (ii) all securities of which such Stockholder acquires Beneficial Ownership during the period from the date of this Agreement through and including the Expiration Date that are convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, shares of capital stock of the Company, including, without limitation, options, warrants and other rights to acquire shares of Company Common Stock or other shares of capital stock of the Company.

 (i) in favor of (1) adoption of the Merger Agreement, including all actions and transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or the Proxy and (2) any other actions presented to holders of shares of capital stock of the Company that would reasonably be expected to facilitate the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other actions and transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or the Proxy; 

  

 (ii) against approval of any proposal made in opposition to the Merger Agreement or consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or the Proxy; and 

  

 (iii) against any Acquisition Proposal or any other action that is intended to, in any manner impede, prevent, interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage or otherwise adversely affect the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

 (c) It has the full power to dispose, vote or direct the voting of its Shares. 

  

 (d) Its Shares are, and at all times up to and including the Expiration Date such Shares will be, unless disposed of by such Stockholder, Beneficially Owned by such Stockholder, free and clear of any rights of first refusal, co-sale rights, security interests, liens, pledges, claims, options, charges, proxies, voting trusts or agreements, understandings or arrangements, or any other encumbrances of any kind or nature. 

  

 (e) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Proxy by such Stockholder does not, and such Stockholders performance of its obligations under this Agreement will not conflict with or violate any order, decree, judgment, statute, law, rule, regulation or agreement applicable to such Stockholder and its Shares or Options, except where such conflict or violation would not, individually or in the aggregate, materially impair the ability of such Stockholder to perform his or her obligations hereunder.

 (e) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Proxy by such Shareholder does not, and such Shareholders performance of its obligations under this Agreement will not conflict with or violate any order, decree, judgment, statute, law, rule, regulation or agreement applicable to such Shareholder and its Shares or Options, except where such conflict or violation would not, individually or in the aggregate, materially impair the ability of such Shareholder to perform his or her obligations hereunder.

At the Second Effective Time, the effect of the Second Step Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the applicable provisions of the Delaware Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Second Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub 2 shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub 2 shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 2. _Certificate of Merger; Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the parties hereto shall cause the Second Step Merger to be consummated by filing a Certificate of Merger in customary form and substance with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of Delaware Law (the "Certificate of Merger") 

   ##### 

  

    

immediately following the filing of the Certificate of Merger for the First
Step Merger (the time of filing the Certificate of Merger for the Second Step
Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or such later
time as may be required for the Second Step Merger to become effective
immediately following the Effective Time of the First Step Merger and
specified in the Certificate of Merger) being the "Second Effective Time"). 

  

 3. _Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation_. At the Second Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in its entirety to be identical to the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub 2, as in effect immediately prior to the Second Effective Time, until thereafter amended in accordance with Delaware Law and as provided in such certificate of incorporation; provided, however, that at the Second Effective Time, Article I of the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows: "The name of the corporation is Solectron Corporation." 

  

 4. _Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_.

 5. _Cancellation of Capital Stock_. At the Second Effective Time, each share of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time ("Merged Corporation Stock") shall, by virtue of the Merger, and without any action on the part of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, or the holder thereof, automatically cease to exist and shall be automatically cancelled, and (ii) each certificate representing shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation ("Surviving Corporation Stock") shall remain outstanding.

 9. _Termination_.

 10. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, and by facsimile, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become 

    #####

parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart. 

   

 11. _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to herein, including the First Step Merger Agreement (i) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and (ii) are not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder. 

  

 12. _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the greatest extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision. 

  

 13. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law thereof.

 16. _Assignment_. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder. 

  

 17. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB 2 AND THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR

 _ _ _ _ _ _,
2007 

  

Flextronics International Ltd. 
 One Marina Boulevard 
 #28-00 Singapore 018989 
 Attention: Chief Financial Officer  

  

Solectron Corporation 
 847 Gibraltar Drive, 
 Milpitas, California 95035 
 Attention: General Counsel  

  

Ladies and Gentlemen:  

  

 The undersigned has been advised that, as of the date of this letter, the undersigned may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of Solectron Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), as the term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the rules and regulations (the "Rules and Regulations") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of June 4, 2006 (the "Merger Agreement") among the Company, Flextronics International Ltd., a Singapore company ("Parent"), and Saturn Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Subsidiary"), Merger Subsidiary will be merged with and into the Company with the Company to be the surviving corporation in the merger (the "Merger"). 

  

 As a result of the Merger, the undersigned may elect to receive ordinary shares, no par value, of Parent ("Parent Ordinary Shares") in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock (as defined in the Merger Agreement) owned by the undersigned. 

  

 The undersigned represents, warrants and covenants to Parent and the Company that, as of the date the undersigned receives any Parent Ordinary Shares as a result of the Merger: 

  

 A. The undersigned shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of the Parent Ordinary Shares in violation of the 1933 Act or the Rules and Regulations. 

  

 B. The undersigned has carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and discussed, to the extent the undersigned felt necessary with the undersigneds counsel or counsel for the Company, the requirements of such documents and other applicable limitations upon the undersigneds ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Parent Ordinary Shares acquired in the Merger. 

  

 C. The undersigned has been advised that the issuance of Parent Ordinary Shares to the undersigned pursuant to the Merger will be registered with the SEC under the 1933 Act on a 

   ##### 

  

    

Registration Statement on Form S-4. The undersigned has also been advised
that, because, at the time the Merger is submitted for a vote of the
stockholders of the Company, the undersigned may be deemed an affiliate of
the Company, the undersigned may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of
Parent Ordinary Shares issued to the undersigned in the Merger unless such
sale, transfer or other disposition (i) has been registered under the 1933
Act, (ii) is made in conformity with Rule 145 promulgated by the SEC under
the 1933 Act, or (iii) in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to
Parent, or pursuant to a "no action" letter obtained by the undersigned from
the SEC staff, is otherwise exempt from registration under the 1933 Act. 

  

 D. The undersigned understands that Parent is under no obligation to register the sale, transfer or other disposition of Parent Ordinary Shares acquired in the Merger by the undersigned or on the undersigneds behalf under the 1933 Act or to take any other action necessary in order to enable the undersigned to make such sale, transfer or other disposition in compliance with an exemption from such registration. 

  

 E. The undersigned also understands that stop transfer instructions will be given to the Parents transfer agents and there will be placed on the certificates for Parent Ordinary Shares acquired in the Merger issued to the undersigned, or on any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance: 

  

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN A TRANSACTION
TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 APPLIES. THE
SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY BE SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR
OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF A LETTER AGREEMENT
BETWEEN THE REGISTERED HOLDER HEREOF AND FLEXTRONICS INTERNATIONAL LTD., A
COPY OF WHICH AGREEMENT IS ON FILE AT THE PRINCIPAL OFFICES OF FLEXTRONICS
INTERNATIONAL LTD." 

  

 F. The undersigned also understands that, unless the transfer by the undersigned of the undersigneds Parent Ordinary Shares acquired in the Merger has been registered under the 1933 Act or is a sale made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145, Parent reserves the right to put the following legend on the certificates issued to the undersigneds transferee: 

  

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED
UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND WERE ACQUIRED FROM A PERSON WHO RECEIVED
SUCH SECURITIES IN A TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 APPLIES. THE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN ACQUIRED BY THE
HOLDER WITH A VIEW TO, OR FOR RESALE IN CONNECTION WITH, ANY 

    ##### 

  

     

DISTRIBUTION THEREOF WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND MAY
NOT BE SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN
EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT OR IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN EXEMPTION FROM THE
REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933." 

  

 It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth in paragraphs E and F above shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such legend if (i) the securities represented thereby have been registered for sale by the undersigned under the 1933 Act or (ii) Parent has received either an opinion of counsel, which opinion and counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or a "no-action" letter obtained by the undersigned from the SEC staff to the effect that the restrictions imposed by Rule 145 under the 1933 Act no longer apply to the undersigned. 

  

 G. The undersigned further understands and agrees that the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the undersigned set forth herein are for the benefit of Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and will be relied upon by such companies and their respective counsel and accountants and agrees to hold harmless and indemnify such Persons from and against any losses, claims, damages, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) or liabilities to which such Person may become subject under the 1933 Act or otherwise as a result of the untruth, breach or failure of such representations. 

  

 H. The undersigned understands and agrees that this letter agreement shall apply to all shares of Parent Ordinary Shares acquired in the Merger that are deemed beneficially owned by the undersigned pursuant to applicable federal securities laws. 

  

 This letter agreement constitutes a complete understanding between Parent and the undersigned concerning the subject matter hereof. This letter agreement will be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law thereof. 

  

 Execution of this letter should not be considered an admission on the part of the undersigned that the undersigned is an "affiliate" of the Company as described in the first paragraph of this letter, nor as a waiver of any rights that the undersigned may have to object to any claim that the undersigned is such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.
