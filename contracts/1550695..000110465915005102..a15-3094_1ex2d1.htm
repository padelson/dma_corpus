Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, (a) Merger
Sub will merge with and into the Company, and (b) the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub will cease and the Company will continue its corporate
existence under the DGCL as the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes
referred to herein as the " **Surviving Corporation** ").

 



      
 

 



 

2.2 _Closing; Effective Time_.

 



 

(a) The closing of the Merger (the " **Closing** ") shall take place at the
offices of Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, Four Embarcadero Center, Suite
2200, San Francisco, CA 94111, at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time on a date to be
specified by the parties which shall be no later than two (2) Business Days
after satisfaction (or waiver as provided herein) of the conditions set forth
in Article IX (other than those conditions that by their nature will be
satisfied at the Closing but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions), unless another time, date and/or place is agreed to in writing by
the parties. The date upon which the Closing occurs is herein referred to as
the " **Closing Date**."

 



 

(b) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the Closing, the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub shall cause a certificate of merger (the " **Certificate
of Merger** ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the
DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of
Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware or at such later date or time as may be agreed by the Company and
Parent in writing and specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance
with the DGCL (the effective time of the Merger being hereinafter referred to
as the " **Effective Time** ").

 



 

2.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the
effects set forth herein and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, from and after
the Effective Time, all property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers,
franchises, licenses and authority of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in
the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities, obligations, restrictions and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

 



 

2.4 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of Surviving
Corporation shall be amended and restated at and as of the Effective Time to
read as did the certificate of incorporation of the Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time (except that the name of Surviving Corporation
will be "Premier Healthcare Exchange, Inc.").

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated as of the Effective Time to conform to the bylaws of
Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until amended
thereafter in accordance with applicable Law and subject to the conditions set
forth hereinafter.

 



 

(c) Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, at the
Effective Time, the directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the directors and officers of the Surviving
Corporation, each to

 



      
 

 



 

hold office until their respective death, permanent disability, resignation or
removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified.
The Company and its Subsidiaries shall take such action as may be necessary to
appoint new directors and/or officers of the Companys Subsidiaries as of the
Effective Time as designated by Parent prior to Closing.

 



 

2.5 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of any shares of capital stock of the Company:

 



 

(a) Each share of common stock of the Company, par value $0.001 per share ("
**Company Common Stock** ") (each share of Company Common Stock hereinafter
referred to as a " **Share** " and collectively, the " **Shares** "), issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the
Rollover Shares, Dissenting Shares and shares cancelled pursuant to Section
2.6(b) below) shall be converted into the right to receive and become
exchangeable for the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest, payable
as provided in Article III hereof, upon the surrender or transfer, in the
manner provided in Section 3.5, of the corresponding Certificate.

 



 

(b) Each Share held by the Company as treasury stock and each Share owned by
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub or of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time, if any, shall, by virtue of the Merger, be cancelled and
retired without any conversion thereof and without payment of any
consideration with respect thereto.

 



 

(c) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub, par value $0.001 per share,
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(d) If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding Shares shall have been changed into a different number of shares
or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares
or any similar event, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement shall be correspondingly adjusted to the extent
appropriate to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares or similar event.

 



 

2.6 _Dissenting Shares_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Shares
that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held
by stockholders who have demanded and not lost, waived or withdrawn, or who
shall be eligible to demand, appraisal rights with respect to such Shares in
the manner provided in the DGCL (collectively, the " **Dissenting Shares** ")
shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration. Such stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment
of the appraised value of such Shares held by them in

 



      
 

 



 

accordance with the DGCL, unless and until such stockholders fail to perfect
or effectively waive or withdraw or otherwise lose their appraisal rights
under the DGCL. All Shares held by stockholders who shall have failed to
perfect or who shall have effectively waived, withdrawn or lost their right to
appraisal of such Shares under the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted into and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time,
the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration in cash, without any
interest thereon, to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Article III,
upon the surrender or transfer, in the manner provided in Section 3.5, of the
corresponding Certificate.

 



 

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal or payment of the fair value received by the Company, withdrawals of
such demands, and any other related instruments served pursuant to the DGCL
and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle
or settle any such demands.

 



 

2.7 _Stock Options_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall take such action as shall be required so that (i) as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and immediately following the Spinoff
Record Date, each outstanding option to acquire Shares (" **Company Stock
Option** ") that is unvested as of the Effective Time, whether granted
pursuant to the Companys 2010 Stock Incentive Plan (the " **Company Incentive
Plan** ") or otherwise, shall, except as provided in Section 2.7(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, become immediately vested and exercisable in full
effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and immediately
following the Spinoff Record Date, (ii) each holder of a Company Stock Option
that is vested and exercisable on or prior to the Effective Time without
regard to Section 2.7(a)(i) shall be notified of his or her opportunity to
exercise such Company Stock Option on or prior to the Spinoff Record Date and
participate in the Spinoff and Merger as a Company Stockholder, (iii) each
holder of a Company Stock Option that is vested and exercisable immediately
prior to the Effective time solely by reason of Section 2.7(a)(i) shall be
notified of his or her opportunity to exercise such Company Stock Option after
the Spinoff Record Date and participate in the Merger as a Company
Stockholder, (iv) any vested Company Stock Option (including a Company Stock
Option that vests pursuant to Section 2.7(a)(i)) that remains outstanding and
unexercised as of the Effective Time that is held by a Person who remains in
the employ or service of the Company or SpinCo through the Effective Time
(each such holder a " **Company Optionholder** ") and delivers to the Company
an executed option surrender agreement in the form attached as _Exhibit C_
(the " **Option Surrender Agreement** ") not later than the close of business
at the Company headquarters at least two (2) Business Day prior to the
Effective Time (the " **Surrender Deadline** ") shall be cancelled and
extinguished as of the Effective Time (each such Company Stock Option
surrendered under the Option Surrender Agreement, a " **Surrendered Option**
") and shall represent solely the right to receive a Cash-Out Payment pursuant
to this Section 2.7, and (v) all other Company Stock Options (both vested and
unvested) outstanding as of the Effective Time shall be cancelled and

 



      
 

 



 

extinguished without consideration pursuant to the terms of the Company
Incentive Plan as of the Effective Time and shall no longer represent the
right to purchase Company Common Stock or any other Equity Securities of the
Company, Merger Sub, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Person or
to purchase any other securities or assets, of the Company, the Merger Sub,
Parent, Surviving Corporation or any other Person. As of the Effective Time,
the Company Incentive Plan shall be terminated and no Person shall have any
contractual or other right to acquire Company Common Stock pursuant to Company
Stock Options or otherwise. No Company Stock Options shall be continued,
assumed and/or substituted by Surviving Corporation or Parent.

 



 

(b) Each Company Optionholder who delivers an Option Surrender Agreement prior
to the Surrender Deadline shall be entitled to receive, in full satisfaction
of the rights of such holder with respect to any Surrendered Option, a sum,
without interest, equal to (i) the product of (A) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock for which such Surrendered Option shall not theretofore
have been exercised (the " **Option Number** ") and (B) the excess, if any, of
the Per Share Amount over the exercise price per share of such Surrendered
Option (the " **Excess Amount** "); less (ii) the product of (A) the Option
Number and (B) the Per Share Escrow Amount; less (iii) the product of (A) the
Option Number and (B) the Per Share Administrative Expense Amount; plus (iv)
any cash disbursements required to be made from the Escrow Fund to the former
holder of such Surrendered Option in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, as and when such disbursements are
required to be made; plus (v) any cash disbursements from the Administrative
Expense Account, as and when such disbursements are required to be made; plus
(vi) the Per Share Earnout Amount, as and when such disbursements are required
to be made (if any) (such sum, the " **Cash-Out Payment** "); provided,
however, if the exercise price of any such Surrendered Option equals or
exceeds the Per Share Amount, then such Surrendered Option shall be cancelled
without payment of any consideration therefor and shall be of no further force
and effect. The Cash-Out Payments to Company Optionholders hereunder (but
excluding any amounts identified in subsections 2.7(b)(iv) and 2.7(b)(vi))
shall be paid through the Surviving Corporations payroll systems (or SpinCos
payroll systems in the case of any Company Optionholder who is a SpinCo
employee as of the Effective Time) as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time and shall be net of all applicable withholdings. For purposes
of complying with requirements to deduct and withhold with respect to amounts
paid on behalf of a Company Optionholder to the Escrow Agent and the
Stockholder Representative, in either case, with respect to the Administrative
Expense Account, such amount shall be included in the taxable income amount
used for purposes of determining amounts required to be deducted and withheld
from such Company Optionholder under the preceding sentence and withholding
shall be satisfied by deduction from the Cash-Out Payment otherwise payable to
the Company Optionholder under the preceding sentence. Any subsequent payments
due with respect to Surrendered Options in connection with the amounts
identified in subsections 2.7(b)(iv) and 2.7(b)(vi) shall be paid through the
Surviving Corporations payroll systems (or SpinCos payroll systems in the
case of any Company Optionholder who is a SpinCo employee as of the Effective
Time) as soon as reasonably practicable after such subsequent payments are due
and shall be net of all applicable withholdings.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) As soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, the
Company shall mail to each person who is a holder of Company Stock Options a
letter describing the treatment of and payment for such Company Stock Option
pursuant to this Section 2.7 and, as applicable, providing instructions for
exercising a Company Stock Option and/or delivering an Option Surrender
Agreement to obtain a Cash-Out Payment with respect to such Surrendered
Options.

 



 

2.8 _Restricted Stock Units_. The Company shall take such action as shall be
required so that each holder of restricted stock units under the Company
Incentive Plan ( " **Restricted Stock Units"** and the holder an " **RSU
Holder** ") shall be entitled to receive, in full satisfaction of the rights
of such holder with respect to such Restricted Stock Units, a sum, without
interest, equal to (i) the product of (A) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock covered by such Restricted Stock Units (the " **RSU Number** ")
and (B) the Per Share Amount; less (ii) the product of (A) the RSU Number and
(B) the Per Share Escrow Amount; less (iii) the product of (A) the RSU Number
and (B) the Per Share Administrative Expense Amount; plus (iv) any cash
disbursements required to be made from the Escrow Fund to the former holder of
such cancelled Restricted Stock Unit in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, as and when such disbursements are
required to be made; plus (v) any cash disbursements from the Administrative
Expense Account, as and when such disbursements are required to be made; plus
(vi) the Per Share Earnout Amount, as and when such disbursements are required
to be made (if any) (such sum, the " **RSU Payment** "). RSU Payments to
holders of Restricted Stock Units hereunder (excluding any amounts identified
in subsections 2.8(iv), 2.8(v) and 2.8(vi)), shall be paid through the
Surviving Corporations payroll systems as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time and shall be net of all applicable withholdings. For
purposes of complying with requirements to deduct and withhold with respect to
amounts paid on behalf of a RSU Holder to the Escrow Agent and the Stockholder
Representative, in either case, with respect to the Administrative Expense
Account, such amount shall be included in the taxable income amount used for
purposes of determining amounts required to be deducted and withheld from such
RSU Holder under the preceding sentence and withholding shall be satisfied by
deduction from the RSU Payment otherwise payable to the RSU Holder under the
preceding sentence. Any subsequent payments due with respect to cancelled
Restricted Stock Units in connection with the amounts identified in
subsections 2.8(iv) and 2.8(vi) shall be paid through the Surviving
Corporations payroll systems as soon as reasonably practicable after such
subsequent payments are due and shall be net of all applicable withholdings.

 



 

2.9 _Further Assurances_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of
sale, assignments or assurances or any other acts or things are necessary,
desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise,
in the Surviving Corporation its right, title and interest in, to or under any
of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of the
Company, or (b) otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the
Surviving Corporation and its proper officers and directors or their designees
shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of
either the Company, the Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, all such
deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to do, in the name and on
behalf of either the Company, the Merger Sub

 



      
 

 



 

or the Surviving Corporation, all such other acts and things as may be
necessary, desirable or proper to vest, perfect or confirm the Surviving
Corporations right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights,
privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of the Company and
otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

Escrow Amount; less (iii) the Per Share Administrative Expense Amount; plus
(iv) any cash disbursements required to be made from the Escrow Fund to the

the obligations pursuant to clause (ii) excluding any employment and payroll
Taxes (other than such amounts associated with the Closing RSU Payments) if
such employment and payroll Taxes and the associated wages or amounts are
deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes for a taxable period (or a
portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date; provided however, that the
Cash-Out Payments and RSU Payments shall not be treated as Transaction
Expenses for purposes of computing the Merger Consideration Per Share Amount.

 



 

3.2 _Estimated Merger Consideration_.

 



 

(a) The aggregate amount to be paid by Parent at the Closing shall represent
an estimate of the Merger Consideration (such amount, the " **Estimated Merger
Consideration** ") calculated as follows: the Base Amount, _minus_ (i) the
Estimated Indebtedness Amount which is outstanding immediately prior to the
Closing, _minus_ (ii) the amount of Transaction Expenses, and _plus_ or
_minus_ , as applicable, (iii) the Estimated Positive Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount or the Estimated Negative Net Working Capital Adjustment
Amount, and _plus_ or _minus_ , as applicable.

 



 

(b) Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall prepare and deliver to Parent an estimated closing balance sheet
for the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than SpinCo) setting forth the
Companys estimated consolidated assets and liabilities as of immediately
prior to the Closing (the " **Estimated Closing Balance Sheet** "). The
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared by the Company in good faith
in the same manner as the Annual Balance Sheet and in accordance with GAAP, as
consistently applied by the Company, and shall be certified by the Chief
Financial Officer of the Company. In connection with the preparation of the
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, the Company shall also prepare a calculation
of the estimated Net Working Capital as of immediately prior to the Closing
(the " **Estimated Closing Net Working Capital** "), and the estimated amount
of Indebtedness as of immediately prior to

 



      
 

 



 

the Closing, (the " **Estimated Indebtedness Amount** "), each such estimate
to be prepared in good faith, in accordance with GAAP consistently applied by
the Company and, with respect to the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital, in
the same manner as the determination of the Net Working Capital Target (each,
an " **Estimated Statement** " and together, the " **Estimated Statements**
"). All such estimates shall be certified by the Chief Financial Officer of
the Company. To assist Parent in its review of the Estimated Closing Balance
Sheet and Estimated Statements, the Company shall make available to Parent and
its Representatives such information and detail used in connection therewith
that is reasonably requested by Parent. Parent shall notify the Company of any
dispute it has with the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet or any Estimated
Statement, and the parties shall exercise good faith efforts to agree on the
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and Estimated Statements in advance of the
Closing; provided, however, that the acceptance by Parent of the Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet or any Estimated Statement shall not limit or otherwise
affect Parents remedies under this Agreement, including Parents right to
include such changes or other changes in the Closing Balance Sheet, or
constitute an acknowledgment by Parent of the accuracy of the Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet or any of the Estimated Statements. If the Estimated
Closing Net Working Capital is less than the Net Working Capital Target, then
the Estimated Merger Consideration shall be reduced by the amount of the
deficiency (such deficiency is referred to as the " **Estimated Negative Net
Working Capital Adjustment Amount** "). If the Estimated Closing Net Working
Capital is greater than the Net Working Capital Target, then the Estimated
Merger Consideration shall be increased by the amount of the excess (such
increase is referred to as the " **Estimated Positive Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount** ")). The Estimated Merger Consideration is subject to
adjustment after the Closing pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.10.

 



 

(c) Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall deliver to Parent a schedule of all unpaid Transaction Expenses
incurred in connection with the Merger, identifying each Person that provided
services that generated Transaction Expenses and the amount necessary to
satisfy in full the Surviving Corporations obligation for such Transaction
Expenses (the " **Transaction Expense Certificate** ").

 



 

3.3 _Funded Indebtedness_. A reasonable time prior to the Closing Date and in
any event no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall deliver to Parent a payoff letter prepared in good faith in a
form to be reasonably approved by Parent from each holder of Funded
Indebtedness showing the payoff amount for such Funded Indebtedness as of the
Closing Date. Parent shall pay, on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries,
as applicable, such items of Funded Indebtedness at Closing in accordance with
the payment instructions in each such payoff letter.

 



 

3.4 _Payment of Estimated Merger Consideration_. At and upon the Effective
Time, Parent shall remit and/or apply the Estimated Merger Consideration as
follows:

 



 

(a) Thirteen Million Dollars ($13,000,000) (the " **Escrow Amount** ") shall
be deposited by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an escrow
account (the " **Escrow Account** ") established with SunTrust Bank (the "
**Escrow Agent** ") pursuant

 



      
 

 



 

to the terms and conditions set forth in the escrow agreement substantially in
the form attached as _Exhibit D_ (the " **Escrow Agreement** ") to be entered
into at the Closing by Parent, the Stockholder Representative and the Escrow
Agent. The Escrow Amount shall be deemed to be withheld from the Company
Stockholders, Company Optionholders or RSU Holders in accordance with each
such Company Stockholders, Company Optionholders and RSU Holders Pro Rata
Portion as set forth in the Allocation Certificate; provided, however, that
the Escrow Amount deposited in the Escrow Account at the Effective Time shall
be reduced by the pro rata portion (as specified in the Allocation
Certificate) of such amount allocable to any Dissenting Shares held by a
Company Stockholder unless and until the Company Stockholder shall have failed
to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn, waived or lost his right to
appraisal and payment under the DGCL, as the case may be, with respect to such
Dissenting Shares; provided, further, that Parent shall deposit the amount
allocable to any Dissenting Shares with the Escrow Agent promptly following
the withdrawal, waiver or loss of the right to appraisal with respect to such
Dissenting Shares;

 



 

(b) an aggregate amount equal to the Administrative Expense Amount shall be
deposited by wire transfer of immediately available funds in an escrow account
with the Escrow Agent (the " **Administrative Expense Account** "). The
Administrative Expense Amount shall be deemed to be withheld from the Company
Stockholders, Company Optionholders and RSU Holders in accordance with each
such Company Stockholders, Company Optionholders or RSU Holders Pro Rata
Portion as set forth in the Allocation Certificate; provided, however, that
the Administrative Expense Amount deposited to such account shall be reduced
by the pro rata portion of such amount allocable to any Dissenting Shares held
by a Company Stockholder unless and until the Company Stockholder shall have
failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn, waived or lost his
right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL, as the case may be, with
respect to such Dissenting Shares; provided, further, that Parent shall
deposit the amount allocable to any Dissenting Shares with the Escrow Agent
promptly following the withdrawal, waiver or loss of the right to appraisal
with respect to such Dissenting Shares;

 



 

(c) the Escrowed Earnout Amount shall be deposited with the Escrow Agent; and

 



 

(d) the remaining amount of the Estimated Merger Consideration, less the Cash-
Out Payments and the RSU Payments that are being paid through the Surviving
Corporations payroll system pursuant to Section 2.7 and Section 2.8, and less
applicable withholdings, if any, shall be paid in cash (the " **Closing Cash
Payment** ") by wire transfer of immediately available funds (the " **Payment
Fund** ") to SunTrust Bank as paying agent (the " **Paying Agent** "), for the
benefit of, and for further payment to, the Company Stockholders (other than
the holders of any Rollover Shares or any Dissenting Shares). Following the
Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall be entitled to distribute (in
accordance with and as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within
two (2) Business Days, after satisfaction of the procedures set forth in
Section 3.5) all such funds to the Company Stockholders entitled thereto
pursuant to Article II and this Article III, on a pro rata basis as set forth
in the Allocation Certificate (provided that no payment shall be made with
respect to any Rollover Shares or any Dissenting Shares and Parent shall
retain

 



      
 

 



 

any portion of the Closing Cash Payment with respect to such Dissenting Shares
until such time as the Company Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or
shall have effectively withdrawn, waived or lost his right to appraisal and
payment under the DGCL, as the case may be, with respect to such Dissenting
Shares; provided, further, that Parent shall deposit the amount allocable to
any Dissenting Shares with the Paying Agent promptly following the withdrawal,
waiver or loss of the right to appraisal with respect to such Dissenting
Shares). Parent and the Company each agree to deliver to the Paying Agent such
other information as shall be reasonably necessary to enable the Paying Agent
to properly apply the amount paid by Parent under this Section 3.4(d) to the
Company Stockholders.

 



 

3.5 _Paying Agent_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no event later
than two (2) Business Days after the Effective Time), Parent shall instruct
the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than the
Rollover Shares) that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time a letter of transmittal in substantially the form attached as
_Exhibit E_ (the " **Letter of Transmittal** ") for use in exchanging Shares
for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such Shares. Upon surrender
by a Company Stockholder to the Paying Agent of a certificate representing
Shares (a " **Certificate** ") (other than Certificates representing Rollover
Shares) for cancellation, together with such Letter of Transmittal, duly
executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such
other documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions,
such Company Stockholder shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
cash in an amount equal to the product of the number of Shares represented by
a Certificate and the Per Share Merger Consideration (payable in accordance
with and subject to the terms of this Agreement), and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.

 



 

(b) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is surrendered, it
shall be a condition to such payment that (i) such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (ii)
the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any and all
Taxes required as a result of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate or establish by evidence satisfactory to
the Paying Agent that any such Taxes have been paid or are not payable. Until
surrendered or transferred as contemplated by this Section 3.5, each
Certificate (other than Certificates representing Rollover Shares or
Dissenting Shares) shall represent at all times after the Effective Time
solely the right to receive an amount equal to the product of the number of
Shares represented by such Certificate and the Per Share Merger Consideration
(payable in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement,
including Section 3.4) (for avoidance of doubt such amounts will be net of the
respective pro rata portion of the Escrow Amount and Administrative Expense
Amount deposited pursuant to Section 3.4(a) and (c), respectively).

 



 

3.6 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Company, the Surviving Corporation,
Parent, the Stockholder Representative, the Escrow Agent and the Paying Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement to any Company Stockholder, Company Optionholder, RSU Holder or any
other Person such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law. The Company, the Surviving Corporation,
Parent, the Stockholder Representative, the Escrow Agent and the Paying Agent
shall pay the amount so deducted or withheld to the applicable Governmental
Entity in accordance with applicable Law. Any such deduction or withholdings
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the Shares or such Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the
Stockholder Representative, the Escrow Agent or the Paying Agent, as the case
may be. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and such
other Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) imposed by Law on
any Company Stockholder, Company Optionholder or RSU Holder entitled to
receive merger consideration pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be
borne and paid by such Company Stockholder, Company Optionholder or RSU
Holder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of any tax withholding
required with respect to income to be recognized by an employee of SpinCo in
connection with either exercising a Company Stock Option or entering into an
Option Surrender Agreement, such withholding requirement may be satisfied by
payment of the amount required to be withheld to SpinCo which shall report
such taxable event and deposit such tax withholdings in accordance with
applicable Law.

 



 

3.7 _Closing of Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Shares thereafter on the records of the Company.
From and after the Effective Time, Company Stockholders who hold Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Shares, except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement or by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates
presented to the Paying Agent or Parent for any reason shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Article III, without interest.

 



 

3.8 _Abandoned Property_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains
undistributed to the Company Stockholders for 180 days after the Effective
Time shall be redelivered to Parent, and any Company Stockholder who has not
theretofore complied with Section 3.5 shall thereafter look as a general
creditor only to Parent for any payment to which such Company Stockholder is
entitled pursuant to this Agreement. Any portion of the Payment Fund remaining
unclaimed by any Company Stockholder older as of a date that is immediately
prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any government entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of
any person previously entitled thereto. To the fullest extent permitted by
law, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any
Company Stockholder for cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



 

3.9 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, the posting by
such Person of a bond, in such

 



      
 

 



 

reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation or Paying Agent may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate and the payment of any fee charged by the Paying Agent for such
service, the Paying Agent will pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate an amount equal to the product of the number of Shares
represented by such Certificate and the Per Share Merger Consideration (such
amount shall be payable in accordance with and subject to the terms of this
Agreement).

 



 

3.10 _Post-Closing Adjustment of Estimated Merger Consideration_.

 



 

(a) As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, but in any event within
ninety (90) calendar days following the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and
deliver to the Stockholder Representative a closing balance sheet for the
Company and its Subsidiaries (excluding SpinCo) setting forth the Companys
assets and liabilities on a consolidated basis as of immediately prior to the
Closing (the " **Closing Balance Sheet** "). The Closing Balance Sheet shall
be prepared in the same manner as the Annual Balance Sheet in accordance with
GAAP consistently applied by the Company and in a manner consistent with the
preparation of the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet. Parent shall also prepare
a calculation of the Net Working Capital as of immediately prior to the
Closing (the " **Final Closing Net Working Capital** "), and the amount of
Indebtedness as of immediately prior to Closing (the " **Final Indebtedness
Amount** "), which in each case shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied by the Company and, with respect to the Final Closing Net
Working Capital, in a manner consistent with the definition of the term Net
Working Capital. If the Stockholder Representative disputes the Closing
Balance Sheet, the Final Closing Net Working Capital, and/or the Final
Indebtedness Amount determined by Parent, then the Stockholder Representative
shall deliver to Parent a written statement (the " **Dispute Notice** ")
describing with reasonable detail the basis for any such dispute within thirty
(30) calendar days after receiving the Closing Balance Sheet and calculation
of the Final Closing Net Working Capital and Final Indebtedness Amount. If the
Stockholder Representative does not deliver the Dispute Notice to Parent
within such thirty (30) calendar day time period, then the determination of
the Final Closing Net Working Capital and Final Indebtedness Amount shall be
deemed final and accepted by the Stockholder Representative. Parent and the
Stockholder Representative will cooperate and act in good faith in an effort
to resolve any such dispute themselves. If such dispute is not finally
resolved within thirty (30) calendar days after Parents receipt of the
Dispute Notice, either Parent or the Stockholder Representative may promptly
thereafter cause Deloitte LLP or another mutually acceptable nationally
recognized third party accounting firm (the " **Arbitrating Accountant** ") to
review this Agreement and the disputed items or amounts in determining the
Final Closing Net Working Capital and/or Final Indebtedness Amount. Within
thirty (30) calendar days after submission to the Arbitrating Accountant for
resolution, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall each indicate in
writing their position on each disputed matter and each such partys
determination of the amount of the Final Closing Net Working Capital and/or
Final Indebtedness Amount. The Arbitrating Accountant shall make a written
determination on each disputed matter no later than sixty (60) calendar days
after submission to the Arbitrating Accountant for resolution and such
determination will be conclusive and binding upon Parent and the Stockholder
Representative with respect to

 



      
 

 



 

that disputed matter, subject to the indemnification rights of contained
herein. In conducting its review, the Arbitrating Accountant shall consider
only items in dispute, and shall base its determination solely on the written
submissions of Parent and the Stockholder Representative (i.e., no independent
investigation) and the definitions and methodologies prescribed herein. The
proposed Closing Balance Sheet and the Final Closing Net Working Capital
and/or Final Indebtedness Amount will be revised as appropriate to reflect the
resolution of any such claims pursuant to this Section 3.10(a). The fees and
expenses of the Arbitrating Accountant shall be paid one-half by Parent and
one-half by the Stockholder Representative.

 



 

(b) Parent will provide the Stockholder Representative and its Representatives
reasonable access (including electronic access to the extent available) to the
books and records of the Company and any other materials used in the
preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of the Final
Closing Net Working Capital and Final Indebtedness Amount, and shall make its
(and the Surviving Corporations) financial staff and advisors available to
the Stockholder Representative and its accountants and other representatives
and to the Arbitrating Accountant at any reasonable time in connection with
(i) the review by the Stockholder Representative of the Closing Balance Sheet
and the calculation of the Final Closing Net Working Capital and Final
Indebtedness Amount and (ii) the resolution by Parent and the Stockholder
Representative and/or the Arbitrating Accountant of any objections thereto.

 



 

(c) The Estimated Merger Consideration will be adjusted if and to the extent
that the Final Closing Net Working Capital as finally determined under this
Section 3.10 is less than or greater than the Estimated Closing Net Working
Capital. If the Final Closing Net Working Capital is less than the Estimated
Closing Net Working Capital, then the Estimated Merger Consideration will be
decreased on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the entire amount of the difference
(the " **Final Negative Net Working Capital Adjustment** "). If the Final
Closing Net Working Capital is greater than the Estimated Closing Net Working
Capital, then the Estimated Merger Consideration will be increased on a
dollar-for-dollar basis by the entire amount of the excess (the " **Final
Positive Net Working Capital Adjustment** "). Additionally, the Estimated
Merger Consideration shall be adjusted (i) upward by the amount by which the
Final Indebtedness Amount is less than the Estimated Indebtedness Amount, and
(ii) downward by the amount by which the Final Indebtedness Amount is greater
than the Estimated Indebtedness Amount. The adjustment for Indebtedness as of
the Closing, upwards or downwards, as the case may be, is referred to herein
as the " **Final Indebtedness Adjustment** ".

 



 

(d) The Final Negative Net Working Capital Adjustment or Final Positive Net
Working Capital Adjustment, as applicable, shall be netted with the Final
Indebtedness Adjustment amount and in the event such netting results in a
reduction to the Estimated Merger Consideration (such amount, the " **Final
Deficiency** "), then Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall direct
the Escrow Agent to distribute the amount of the Final Deficiency from the
Administrative Expense Account to Parent no later than two (2) Business Days
after the final determination of the Final Closing Net Working Capital and
Final Indebtedness Amount in accordance with this Section 3.10. To the extent
the Administrative Expense Account is not sufficient, then the Stockholder
Representative

 



      
 

 



 

shall direct the Escrow Agent to distribute any such shortfall from the Escrow
Fund to Parent no later than two (2) Business Days after the final
determination of the Final Closing Net Working Capital and Final Indebtedness
Amount in accordance with this Section 3.10.

 



 

(e) In the event the netting of the Final Negative Net Working Capital
Adjustment or Final Positive Net Working Capital Adjustment, as applicable,
with the Final Indebtedness Adjustment amount results in an increase to the
Estimated Merger Consideration (such amount, the " **Final Excess** "), then
Parent shall pay to the Paying Agent for payment to the Company Stockholders
(excluding any holders of Rollover Shares or Dissenting Shares who have not
withdrawn, waived or lost their right to appraisal), Company Optionholders and
RSU Holders the entire amount of the Final Excess (excluding amounts
attributable to Dissenting Shares) by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by the Paying Agent, no later than two (2)
Business Days after the final determination of the Closing Balance Sheet in
accordance with this Section 3.10; provided that an amount equal to ten
percent (10%) of the Final Excess shall be deposited into the Escrow Account
to be administered in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

3.11 _Administrative Expense Account_. The Administrative Expense Account may
be applied as the Stockholder Representative may reasonably determine as
appropriate to defray, offset or pay any charges, fees, costs, Taxes,
liabilities or expenses (" **Stockholder Representative Expenses** ") it
incurs in performing its rights, duties and obligations under this Agreement
and the other documents and instruments executed and delivered pursuant hereto
(including this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Letters of
Transmittal) by or on behalf of the Company Stockholders, Company
Optionholders and RSU Holders, as well as to pay any Final Deficiency or any
claims for indemnity pursuant to Article XII hereof and the Escrow Agreement
that are not covered by the Escrow Fund (" **Indemnity Expenses** "). At such
time and from time to time that the Stockholder Representative determines in
its good faith discretion that a portion of the Administrative Expense Account
will not be required for the payment of such fees, expenses or costs or
indemnity claims, the Stockholder Representative shall direct the Escrow Agent
to distribute such amounts to the Company Stockholders (excluding any holders
of Rollover Shares or Dissenting Shares who have not withdrawn, waived or lost
their right to appraisal), Company Optionholders and RSU Holders in accordance
with each such Company Stockholders Pro Rata Portion, Company Optionholders
Pro Rata Portion or RSU Holders Pro Rata Portion as set forth in the
Allocation Certificate, such applicable amounts from the Administrative
Expense Account. For Tax purposes, the Company Stockholders, Company
Optionholders and RSU Holders will be treated as the owner of the
Administrative Expense Account and any earnings or interest thereon. The
Stockholder Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent to report and
withhold any Taxes as they determine may be required by any Law in effect at
the time of any distribution or otherwise from the Administrative Expense
Account.

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

 



 

The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that the

qualification **,** except for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so
qualified and in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has furnished to Parent, prior to the date of this Agreement, true and
complete copies of its Charter Documents. Such Charter Documents are in full
force and effect and the Company is not in default or violation of any
provision thereunder. Section 4.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists the

Law, and each such grant was properly accounted for in accordance with GAAP.
The Company has not granted any Company Stock Option with an exercise price of
less than the fair market value of Company Common Stock on the date the

(b) Each Subsidiary of the Company is a corporation or limited liability
company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws
of the jurisdiction of its formation. Each Subsidiary of the Company has all
requisite power to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as now being conducted and as proposed to be conducted. Each is duly
qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which
it owns or leases property or conducts any

 



      
 

 



 

business so as to require such qualification, except for those jurisdictions
where the failure to be so qualified and in good standing would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has furnished to Parent, prior to the date of this Agreement, true and
complete copies of the Charter Documents of each of its Subsidiaries. Such
Charter Documents are in full force and effect and the Company is not in
default or violation of any provision thereunder.

the Company Stockholder Approval, to perform its obligations hereunder and to

(b) The affirmative vote or consent of the holders of (i) a majority of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock, voting

of the holders of any class of capital stock or other security of the Company
necessary to adopt and approve this Agreement and the Merger (the " **Company
Stockholder Approval** "). The execution and delivery of the Principal
Stockholder Consent by each of the Principal Stockholders shall constitute
Company Stockholder Approval.

 



 

(c) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub,
constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable
against it in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be
limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar Laws affecting or relating to creditors rights generally, and (ii)
the availability of injunctive relief and other equitable remedies.

and approval.

 



 

(e) The Company Board has taken all actions so that the restrictions in
section 203 of the DGCL applicable to a "business combination" (as defined in
such Section 203), and any other similar federal, state, local or foreign
"fair price" or "control share acquisition" statutes, laws or regulations (any
such statute, law or regulation, a " **Takeover Statute** "), will not apply
to Parent or Merger Sub with respect to the Merger, including the execution,
delivery or performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

4.5 _No Conflict; Authorizations_.

 



 

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does not, and
the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
by the Company will not, (i) violate the provisions of any of the Charter
Documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) result in a
violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of
time or both) a default (or give rise to any right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration) under, any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any Contract or other instrument or obligation to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets may be

or to prevent or materially alter or delay the Companys ability to consummate
the Merger. Section 4.5(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth all
consents, waivers, assignments and other approvals and actions (" **Consents**
") that are required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this

Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

") and unaudited consolidated financial statements consisting of the balance
sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries, other than SpinCo, and the related

Interim Financial Statements** " and together with the Company-Only Annual
Financial Statements, the " **Company-Only Financial Statements** "), are
included in Section 4.6(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. The Company-
Only Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with United States
generally accepted accounting principles (" **GAAP** ") applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated
in the notes to such Company-Only Financial Statements), subject, in the case
of the Company-Only Interim Financial Statements, to normal year-end
adjustments and the absence of notes (none of which footnote disclosures or
adjustments would, alone or in the aggregate, be materially adverse to the
business, assets, liabilities, financial condition or operating results of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (excluding SpinCo). The consolidated balance
sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2013 included in the Company-Only
Annual Financial Statements is referred to herein as the " **Annual Balance
Sheet**." The consolidated balance sheet of the Company included in the
Company-Only Interim Financial Statements is referred to herein as the "
**Interim Balance Sheet** " and the date as the " **Balance Sheet Date**."
Each of the Company-Only Financial Statements (including in all cases the
notes and schedules thereto, if any) (i) was prepared in accordance with the
books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries (which books and records
are true and correct in all material respects and accurately and fairly
reflect the basis for the Company-Only Financial Statements in all material
respects) and (ii) fairly presents the consolidated financial condition and
operating results and cash flows of the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as
a whole but excluding SpinCo) as of the times and for the periods referred to
therein.

 



 

(c) The Company has established and maintains a system of internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances (i) that transactions,
receipts and expenditures of the Company and its Subsidiaries are being
executed and made only in accordance with appropriate policies and procedures
and appropriate authorizations of management and the board of directors of the
Company, (ii) that transactions are recorded as necessary (A) to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and (B) to
maintain accountability for assets and (iii) regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets

 



      
 

 



 

(tangible and intangible) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has identified or been made aware of
any fraud that involves the business or management or employees of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, or any claim or allegation regarding any of the
foregoing, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received
written notice from its independent auditors regarding any of the foregoing.

 



 

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any Liabilities
(whether or not required to be reflected in financial statements in accordance
with GAAP) except for (i) Liabilities adequately disclosed, provided for,
reflected in, reserved against or otherwise described in the Interim Balance
Sheet (or in any notes thereto) (regardless of classification), (ii)
obligations under Contracts described in Section 4.14 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule or under Contracts entered into in the ordinary course of
business which are not required to be disclosed thereon due to specified
dollar thresholds or other limitations (but not Liabilities for breaches or
defaults thereof), (iii) Liabilities which have arisen after the date of the
Interim Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business or otherwise in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement (none of which is a
liability for breach of contract, breach of warranty, tort or infringement) or
(iv) Transaction Expenses.

 



 

4.7 _Accounts Receivable_. All accounts receivables of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, whether reflected on the Interim Balance Sheet or otherwise,
represent amounts owed to the Company and its Subsidiaries in the ordinary
course of business, and are current and fully collectible net of any reserves
shown on the Interim Balance Sheet (which reserves are adequate and were
calculated on a basis consistent with GAAP and past practices) in the ordinary
course of business.

 



 

4.8 _Taxes_.

 



 

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries have duly and timely filed all Tax
Returns required to have been filed by or with respect to the Company and such
Subsidiaries (taking into account applicable extensions of time to file). Each
such Tax Return is true, correct and complete in all material respects. All
Taxes due and payable by the Company and each Subsidiary of the Company have
been paid. The accruals and reserves for Taxes (rather than any reserve for
deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax
income) reflected in the Company-Only Interim Financial Statements (rather
than the notes thereto) are adequate in accordance with GAAP to cover all
unpaid Taxes of the Company and each Subsidiary of the Company for periods
ending on or prior to the Balance Sheet Date.

 



 

(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries have withheld and timely paid all Taxes
required to have been withheld and paid by them and have complied in all
material respects with all information reporting and backup withholding
requirements, including maintenance of required records with respect thereto.

 



 

(c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is currently the
beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any Tax Return.
Neither the

 



      
 

 



 

Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has waived (or is subject to a waiver of)
any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or has agreed to (or is subject
to) any extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency which
waiver or extension is currently in effect. No claim has been made by any
Taxing Authority in a jurisdiction in which the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company does not file a Tax Return that it is or may be subject to tax in
such jurisdiction. No power of attorney that is currently in force has been
granted to any person with respect to any matters relating to Taxes that could
affect the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company after the Closing Date.

 



 

(d) There is no Action now pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened
against or with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect
of any Tax or any assessment or deficiency of Tax. There are no unsatisfied
liabilities for Taxes with respect to any written notice of deficiency or
similar document received by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company from
any Taxing Authority with respect to any Tax other than liabilities for Taxes
being contested in good faith. To the Companys Knowledge, no issue has been
raised by any Taxing Authority since January 1, 2010 with respect to Taxes of
the Company or its Subsidiaries in any prior examination that, by application
of the same or similar principles, could reasonably be expected to result in
assertion of a Tax underpayment for any other taxable period of the Company or
its Subsidiaries. There are no liens for Taxes (other than statutory liens for
current property Taxes not yet due and payable) upon the assets of the Company
or any Subsidiary of the Company.

 



 

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) is a party to or is
bound by any Tax allocation or sharing agreement or Tax indemnification
agreement, (ii) has ever been a member of an affiliated, consolidated,
combined or unitary group (other than a group of which the Company is the
common parent), (iii) has any liability for or obligation to pay Taxes of any

1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of Tax Law), or as transferee or successor,
by contract or otherwise, (iv) is a party to any joint venture, partnership or
other arrangement or Contract that is or should be treated as a partnership
for U.S. federal income tax purposes or (v) is a successor to any other Person
by way of merger, liquidation or reorganization.

 



 

(f) There is no application of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
pending with a Taxing Authority requesting permission for any changes in
accounting methods applied by the Company or such Subsidiary. Neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company nor the Surviving Corporation will
be required to include in Taxable income, or exclude any item of deduction
from, Taxable income for any Taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after
the Closing Date as a result of any (i) "closing agreement" as described in
Code section 7121 (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local
or foreign income Tax law) entered into by the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company prior to the Closing; (ii) open transaction or installment
disposition made prior to the Closing; (iii) intercompany transactions
occurring prior to the Closing or any excess loss account in existence prior
to the Closing described in Treasury Regulations under Code section 1502 (or
any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax
law); (iv) any prepaid expenses incurred prior to the Closing

 



      
 

 



 

Date; (v) the completed contract method of accounting or the long-term
contract method of accounting, or any comparable provision of state, local or
foreign tax Law applied to a contract entered into by the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company prior to the Closing; or (vi) election under Code
section 108(i) made prior to the Closing.

its Subsidiaries has filed an IRS Form 8886. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has (i) taken a reporting position on a Tax Return that, if
not sustained, would be reasonably likely to give rise to a penalty for
substantial understatement of federal income Tax under Section 6662 of the
Code (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law), without
regard to any disclosure thereof.

 



 

(h) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company has constituted
either a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the
meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock
intended to qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code in
the two (2) years prior to the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(i) The Company has delivered or made available to Parent (i) correct and

issuance of any ruling from a Taxing Authority on behalf of the Company since
January 1, 2011 (regardless of whether the requested ruling was issued), and

(j) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is or has been at any time
within the last five (5) years a "United States real property holding
corporation" within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code.

 



 

(k) Each share of Company Stock that was not transferable and subject to a
substantial risk of forfeiture within the meaning of Section 83 of the Code
when

 



      
 

 



 

transferred to the recipient thereof was and, if still outstanding, is, the
subject of a valid election under Section 83(b) of the Code.

**Spinoff Taxes** ").

 



 

(n) For purposes of this Section 4.8, references to the Company and/or its
Subsidiaries shall include references to any predecessors of the Company
and/or its Subsidiaries and to any Affiliated Group of which the Company or
any of its current or former Subsidiaries is or has been a member to the

any of its Subsidiaries. Other than the Subsidiaries included in Section
4.3(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary of the Company, directly or indirectly, owns any securities or
other interest in any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other
business association or entity.

manner consistent in all material respects with standards generally followed
with respect to similar properties, and is structurally sufficient and

or services supplied by the business infringes or misappropriates Intellectual
Property of any other Person.

Property rights, and (ii) no Person has made any claim for indemnification
under an agreement set forth, or required to be set forth in Section 4.12(g).

 



 

(h) To the Companys Knowledge, no Intellectual Property owned by any Person
prohibits or would prohibit the Company or its Subsidiaries from performing
the services currently provided and performed by its businesses.

 



 

(i) To the Companys Knowledge, all of the Company Intellectual Property is
valid and enforceable. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has taken all
reasonable steps and paid all fees, taxes and other amounts required for the

(k) All software included in the Owned Intellectual Property (" **Software**
") is adequately documented such that a person of ordinary skill and
experience would be able to access, understand, modify, improve, maintain,
repair, upgrade, enhance and add to such Software. The Company has in its
possession or control the source code of all Software owned, used or exploited
by the Company and its Subsidiaries in a form that would enable a reasonably
skilled programmer or analyst to maintain and correct that software without
third party assistance. The Software is consistent with the functions
described in any agreed specifications or end user documentation or other
information provided to customers of the Company or any of its respective
Subsidiaries on which such customers relied when licensing or otherwise
acquiring such products. The Software does not contain any (i) bug, defect, or
error that materially and adversely affects its use, functionality, or

such Software; (ii) program code, programming instruction or set of
instructions intentionally constructed for the purpose of damaging,
interfering with or otherwise adversely affecting computer programs, data
files or operations; or (iii) other software code which would have the effect

contractors and consultants to maintain the confidentiality of all Owned
Intellectual Property.

generally, and (ii) the availability of injunctive relief and other equitable
remedies. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have each performed in all
material respects their respective obligations under and are entitled to all

any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the Company, with respect to

there is no action, suit or proceeding, judgment, claim, arbitration,

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or to the Knowledge of the Company,
any present or former officer, director, member or employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in his or her capacity as such. There is no
unsatisfied judgment, penalty or award against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is in compliance with
each Order entered, issued or rendered by any Governmental Entity to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject. Section 4.15(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule sets forth all Orders to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is subject.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) To the Knowledge of the Company, there is no fact or circumstance that,
either alone or together with other facts and circumstances, would reasonably
be expected to give rise to any action, proceeding, claim, complaint,
injunction or order against, relating to or affecting the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets and properties.

 



 

4.16 _Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) Section 4.16(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth (i) a true,
correct and complete list of each Employee Benefit Plan; (ii) for each
Employee Benefit Plan listed in subpart (i) above, where applicable, the
following information: (A) each entity and corresponding Employer
Identification Number whose employees are receiving benefits under such plan;
(B) whether each such entity is an ERISA Affiliate; (C) whether such plan is
fully-insured, self-insured or a combination thereof, and if so, the portion
of the plan applicable to each; (D) each applicable insurance policy
(including the insurance carrier, policy number, and name of policyholder, as
well as the stop-loss policy and each covered entity under such stop-loss
policy) and the entities described in subpart (A) above whose employees are
receiving benefits under such policy; and (E) any service contracts or other
agreements providing for a requirement to maintain or offer benefits under
such plan to employees of a specified entity. The Company has made available
to Parent, for each Employee Benefit Plan, (i) the name of each employee who
is eligible for or receiving benefits under such plan; (ii) the name and
Employer Identification Number of the entity employing each such employee; and
(iii) the relationship of each such entity to the Parent. Except as set forth
on Section 4.16(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule with respect to each
Employee Benefit Plan, no employee or former employee of SpinCo or a
Subsidiary of SpinCo (or beneficiary of any such employee or former employee)
is eligible to participate in any Employee Benefit Plan sponsored by the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company other than SpinCo or a Subsidiary of
SpinCo.

 



 

(b) No Employee Benefit Plan (i) is either a Multiemployer Plan, a multiple
employer plan subject to Code Section 413(c), a plan funded through a
voluntary employees beneficiary association within the meaning of Code
Sections 501(c)(9) and 505, or a plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA,
and neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has withdrawn at any time within
the preceding six (6) years from any Multiemployer Plan or incurred any
withdrawal liability which remains unsatisfied, or (ii) provides health,
medical or life insurance benefits to current or future former employees of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than as required by Section 4980B
of the Code or other applicable law.

 



 

(c) Each Employee Benefit Plan has been maintained and administered, in each
case, in all material respects in compliance with its terms and with the
applicable requirements of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Laws. Each
Employee Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code is so qualified and has received a favorable determination letter
from the Internal Revenue Service or is entitled to rely upon a favorable
opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service on the pre-approved form of
such Employee Benefit Plan, and there are no facts that would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect such qualification. The Company

 



      
 

 



 

has satisfied any and all bond coverage requirements of ERISA with respect to
each Employee Benefit Plan.

 



 

(d) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has engaged in any transaction
with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan that would be reasonably likely to
subject the Company or Affiliate to any material Tax or penalty (civil or
otherwise) imposed by ERISA, the Code or other applicable Law. There are no
Actions (other than routine claims for benefits by employees, beneficiaries or
dependents of such employees arising in the normal course of operation of an
Employee Benefit Plan) pending, or to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened, with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan or any fiduciary or
sponsor of an Employee Benefit Plan with respect to their duties under such
Employee Benefit Plan or the assets of any trust under any such Employee
Benefit Plan.

 



 

(e) With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, the Company has made available
to Parent copies, to the extent applicable, of (i) the plan (or, in the case
of any unwritten Employee Benefit Plan, a description of the material terms
thereof), and trust documents and the most recent summary plan description,
(ii) the three (3) most recent annual report (Form 5500 series) and
nondiscrimination testing results, (iii) the most recent financial statements,
(iv) the most recent Internal Revenue Service determination or opinion letter,
and (v) any material associated administrative agreements or insurance
policies.

 



 

(f) No audits, inquiries, proceedings or administrative actions have been
initiated or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened, by a governmental agency
within the past three (3) years with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan.

 



 

(g) Except as set forth in Section 4.16(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
all contributions, premiums or other payments for the Employee Benefit Plans
listed on Section 4.16(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule attributable to
all periods prior to the Closing Date have been made on a timely basis and
within the time limits prescribed by ERISA or other applicable Law or have
been corrected in accordance with the Department of Labors guidance under the
Voluntary Fiduciary Correction Program or other applicable correction program,
and no resulting excise taxes or other penalties are reasonably expected to
result.

 



 

(h) Neither the Company nor, to its Knowledge, any Employee Benefit Plan
fiduciary (as defined in ERISA Section 3(21)), has engaged in any transaction
in violation of ERISA Section 406(a) and (b) (except in compliance with an
applicable exemption under ERISA Section 408) or any "prohibited transaction"
(as defined in Section 4975(c)(2) or Section 4975(d) of the Code).

 



 

(i) Except as set forth in Section 4.16(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not,
either alone or in combination with another event, (i) entitle any current or
former director, officer, employee or consultant of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to severance pay, termination pay, unemployment compensation or
any other payment or benefit under any Employee Benefit Plan, (ii) accelerate
the time of payment or vesting of benefits, or

 



      
 

 



 

increase the amount of compensation, due to any such director, officer,
employee or consultant under any Employee Benefit Plan, (iii) trigger any
funding obligation under any Employee Benefit Plan or impose any restrictions
or limitations on the Companys rights to administer, amend or terminate any
Employee Benefit Plan or (iv) result in any payment (whether in cash or
property or the vesting of property) to any " _disqualified individual_ " (as
such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) that could
reasonably be construed, individually or in combination with any other such
payment, to constitute an " _excess parachute payment_ " (as defined in
Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code). Except as set forth in Section 4.16(i) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, no current or former director, officer, employee
or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled to receive
any gross-up or additional payment by reason of the tax required by Section
4999 of the Code being imposed on such person.

 



 

(j) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any Liabilities
relating to unfunded obligations with respect to Employee Benefit Plans that
are retirement or supplemental benefit plans, or with respect to any other
Employee Benefit Plans that are not fully accrued on the Interim Balance
Sheet. No Person has any right (contingent or otherwise) to any consideration
in exchange for a Company Stock Option or Restricted Stock Unit except as
provided for in Sections 2.7 and 2.8 hereof.

 



 

(k) Section 4.16(k) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists each Employee
Benefit Plan that is in whole or in part a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" (as such term is defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code), and each
such plan (or the applicable portion thereof) complies in form, and has been
maintained and operated in compliance, with Section 409A of the Code and all
guidance and regulations issued thereunder. To the extent that Section 409A
of the Code does not apply to an Employee Benefit Plan because amounts were
deferred thereunder before January 1, 2005, such "grandfathered" plan (or
portion thereof) has not been materially modified within the meaning of Treas.
Reg. 1.409A-6 at any time after October 3, 2004. No current or former
director, officer, employee or consultant of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is entitled to receive any gross-up or additional payment by
reason of the tax required by Section 409A of the Code being imposed on such
person.

 



 

(l) With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, there are no restrictions on
the ability of the sponsor of the Employee Benefit Plan to amend or terminate
the Employee Benefit Plan, the Company has expressly reserved in itself the
right to amend, modify or terminate any such Employee Benefit Plan, or any
portion thereof, and has made no representations (whether orally or in
writing) which would conflict with or contradict such reservation or right.

 



 

4.17 _Labor and Employment Matters_.

 



 

(a) The Company has delivered to Parent a complete and accurate list (the "
**Employee List** ") setting forth (i) all employees of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof (the " **Company Employees** ")
together with their titles or positions, job descriptions, dates of hire,
regular work location, the aggregate cash compensation paid for the most
recently completed fiscal year, exempt or non-exempt

 



      
 

 



 

status, base salary (for exempt employees) or hourly rate (for non-exempt
employees), bonus and commission opportunity in effect for the current fiscal
year, and accrued and unused vacation, sick and other paid time off, visa or
other similar permit (where applicable) under which such a Company Employee is
working for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and the dates of issuance
and expiration of such visa or other similar permit; and (ii) all consultants
and other independent contractors to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
who have rendered services to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries within
the last twelve (12) months together with the aggregate cash compensation paid
for the most recently completed fiscal year. Except as set forth in the
Employee List, the employment of each of the Company Employees is terminable
at will, without cause or prior notice and without liability. To the Companys
Knowledge, no executive or management level employee or group of employees or
independent consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any plans
to terminate employment with or services to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 



 

(b) There are no and have not, in the past three (3) years, been any
controversies or labor disputes, labor slowdowns or union organization
activities, picketing or strikes pending or, to the Companys Knowledge,
threatened between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of the
Company Employees. None of the Company Employees belongs to any union or
collective bargaining unit. There is not pending any demand for recognition or
any other request or demand from a labor organization for representative
status with respect to Company Employees. No labor union has been certified by
the National Labor Relations Board (or similar foreign body) as bargaining
agent for any of the Company Employees. Each Company Employee has been
properly classified as exempt or non-exempt under applicable federal and state
laws. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any claim
or notice from any Governmental Entity to the effect that it has improperly
classified the exempt/non-exempt status of any Company Employee, and, to the
Companys Knowledge, there is no basis for any such claim. No individual
classified as of the date hereof by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as
an independent contractor or other non-employee status would be deemed an
employee or common-law employee under any Employee Benefit Plan or applicable
Law. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have complied in all material
respects with all applicable foreign, state and federal equal employment
opportunity, discrimination in employment, leave, reasonable accommodation,
confidentiality, wage and hour laws, occupational health and safety and any
other Law related to employment or working conditions, including the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, as amended (" **WARN Act**
"), and the verification requirements and the recordkeeping requirements of

the executive officers and directors of the Company and each of the Principal
Stockholders to execute and deliver to the Company a General Release in the
form of _Exhibit G_.

Statute on any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

6.12 _FIRPTA Compliance_. The Company shall at the Closing deliver to Parent a
copy of a statement conforming with the requirements of Treasury Regulations
Sections 1.897-2(h) and 1.1445-2(c)(3) and in form reasonably satisfactory to
Parent, certifying that shares of capital stock of the Company do not
constitute "United States real property interests" under Section 897(c) of the

terms of any and all Employee Benefit Plans sponsored by the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company other than SpinCo or a Subsidiary of SpinCo to
exclude eligibility based on current or former employment with SpinCo or a
Subsidiary of SpinCo, and upon the Companys receipt of a written notice of
election by the Parent, in

 



      
 

 



 

Parents sole and absolute discretion, at least three (3) days prior to
Closing, terminate any and all Employee Benefit Plans, including any plan(s)
established, sponsored or maintained pursuant to Code Section 401(k) on the
day preceding the Closing; or take such other actions prior to the Closing as
reasonably requested by the Parent to bring any of the Employee Benefit Plans
into compliance with applicable Laws. The Companys actions pursuant to this
Section 6.13 shall be taken in consultation with Parent and with Parents
consent, and the Company shall bear all of the costs and expenses of such
actions. The amendment to the Companys Code Section 401(k) Plan to exclude
current or former employees of SpinCo or a Subsidiary of SpinCo may be
effected by action of the Company to "spin-off" a portion of such plan to a
new plan maintained by SpinCo, provided such action shall be effective not

2015, the Surviving Corporation shall provide, or cause to be provided, for
each of the Company Employees who continue as employees of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries (the " **Continuing Employees** "), the
ability to participate in those group benefit plans that are identified in
Schedule 7.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and available to such
employees prior to the Closing Date (as such Employee Benefit Plans may be
amended from time to time after the Closing Date), subject in all cases to the
terms and conditions of the applicable plan.

 



 

(b) Except as provided in Section 7.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
for the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on December 31, 2015,
the Surviving Corporation shall provide, or cause to be provided, to each
Continuing Employee (i) base compensation and incentive compensation potential
(including a

 



       
 

 



 

commission based plan) that is the same as the base compensation and incentive
compensation (including commission based plan, but disregarding any equity
based compensation provided by Company for this purpose) provided to each such
employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) the bonuses set forth
on Section 6.2 of the Company Disclosure Schedule to each Continuing Employee
set forth on such schedule, to the extent such bonuses have not otherwise been
paid by the Company to such Continuing Employees prior to Closing.

 



 

(c) Surviving Corporation shall provide, or cause to be provided, to each
Continuing Employee credit for purposes of eligibility, vesting, and vacation
entitlement (but not for purposes of any defined benefit plan or equity award)
for service with the Company and/or its Subsidiaries, under comparable
employee benefit plans, programs and policies of Parent in which such
Continuing Employees become participants, to the same extent and for the same
purposes as such service was recognized under any corresponding Employee

offsets for previously accrued benefits and no duplication of benefits.

 



 

(d) Nothing herein shall be deemed to modify or amend any arrangement of
Parent, or to be a guarantee of employment for any employee of the Company, or
to change the at-will status of Continuing Employees or restrict the right of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation to terminate any such employee or to give
any person any right to any specific terms or conditions of employment.

 



 

7.2 _Earn Out._

 



 

(a) As soon as reasonably practical following the completion of Parents audit
of its consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2015, which shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP and the applicable
accounting requirements and the rules and regulations promulgated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission, but no later than March 15, 2016, the
Company shall prepare and deliver to the Stockholder Representative a
statement setting forth the 2015 Actual Revenue (the " **Preliminary 2015
Actual Revenue Statement** "). The Preliminary 2015 Actual Revenue Statement
shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied consistently with the past
accounting practices and procedures of Parent.

 



 

(b) If the Stockholder Representative disputes the Preliminary 2015 Actual
Revenue Statement, then the Stockholder Representative shall deliver to Parent
a Dispute Notice describing with reasonable detail the basis for any such
dispute within thirty (30) calendar days after receiving the Preliminary 2015
Actual Revenue Statement. If the Stockholder Representative does not deliver
the Dispute Notice to Parent within such thirty (30) calendar day time period,
then the determination of the 2015 Actual Revenue as set forth on the
Preliminary 2015 Actual Revenue Statement shall be deemed final and accepted
by the Stockholder Representative. Parent and the Stockholder Representative
will cooperate and work in good faith to resolve any such dispute themselves.
If such dispute is not finally resolved within thirty (30) calendar days after
Parents receipt of the Dispute Notice, either Parent or the Stockholder
Representative may thereafter cause the dispute to be submitted to the
Arbitrating Accountant and shall instruct

 



      
 

 



 

the Arbitrating Accounting to review this Agreement and the disputed items or
amounts in determining the 2015 Actual Revenue. Within thirty (30) calendar
days after submission to the Arbitrating Accountant for resolution, Parent and
the Stockholder Representative shall each indicate in writing their position
on each disputed matter and each such partys determination of the amount of
the 2015 Actual Revenue. The Arbitrating Accountant shall make a written
determination on each disputed matter no later than sixty (60) calendar days
after submission to the Arbitrating Accountant for resolution and such
determination will be conclusive and binding upon Parent and the Stockholder
Representative with respect to that disputed matter. In conducting its review,
the Arbitrating Accountant shall consider only items in dispute, and shall
base its determination solely on the written submissions of Parent and the
Stockholder Representative (i.e., no independent investigation) and the
definitions and methodologies prescribed herein. The fees and expenses of the
Arbitrating Accountant shall be paid by one-half by the Company and one-half
by the Stockholder Representative. Upon final determination of the Earnout
Amount in accordance with this Section 7.2(b), Parent shall distribute (or
cause the Escrow Agent, with respect to the Escrowed Earnout Amount, or the
Paying Agent, to distribute) the portion of the Earnout Amount otherwise due
and payable to the Company Stockholders, Company Optionholders and RSU Holders
within ten (10) Business Days of the date upon which the Earnout Amount became
final pursuant to this Section 7.2(b). To the extent the Earnout Amount is
less than the Escrowed Earnout Amount, each of Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall direct the Escrow Agent to distribute the Escrowed
Earnout Amount, or portion thereof, that is in excess of the Earnout Amount to
Parent within ten (10) Business Days of the date upon which the Earnout Amount
became final pursuant to this Section 7.2(b).

 



 

(c) Through December 31, 2015, the Parent and the Company, will not, and shall
cause each of their Affiliates to not, without the prior consent of the
Stockholder Representative, (i) materially decrease expenditures to support
sales and marketing at the Company below the levels set forth in the 2015
Marketing Support Budget previously furnished by the Company to Parent (the "
**Marketing Support** "), (ii) voluntarily liquidate, dissolve or wind-up the
Company or its business, (iii) sell, assign, lease or otherwise transfer
(directly or indirectly, in a single transaction or series of related
transactions) all or substantially all of the Company or any material amount
of assets (tangible or intangible) related to the Company, (iv) enter into or
permit to exist any agreement, arrangement or understanding that would
restrict or prevent payment of any Earnout Amount when due (other than the
Senior Debt as the Senior Debt Documents may be amended or modified) or (iv)
take any action for the purpose of reducing or otherwise adversely affecting
the Earnout Amount.

 



 

(d) Through December 31, 2015, the Parent and the Company shall, and shall
cause each of their Affiliates to, (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to
operate the Company substantially in the ordinary course and generally
consistent with past practices; and (ii) work with senior management of the
Company to identify, and where appropriate, pursue cross-selling
opportunities, including selling the Companys services to Parent or any of
its Affiliates.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Except as set forth herein, neither Parent nor the Company shall have any
obligations pursuant to this Section 7.2, implied or otherwise, and in
furtherance of the foregoing the parties agree and acknowledge that neither
Parent nor the Company, nor any of their Affiliates following the Closing will
be required to (and none are expected to) make any investment, contribution,
payment or capital infusions (in or to the Company or otherwise) to achieve
any amount of the 2015 Actual Revenue. The Company and each Company
Stockholder by their approval of the Merger agrees and acknowledges that
neither Parent, the Company nor any of their Affiliates owes (and each holder
of Company Common Stock, Company Stock Options, Restricted Stock Units and
Company Preferred Stock waives) any express or implied fiduciary duty or duty
of good faith or fair dealing to any of the Company Stockholders, Company
Optionholders or RSU Holders with respect to or relating to any matter that
affects the 2015 Actual Revenue or the Earnout Amount. The Company and each
Company Stockholder, Company Optionholder or RSU Holder acknowledges that (i)
upon the closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent
has the right to operate the Company and the Parents other businesses in any
way that Parent deems appropriate in its sole discretion (subject to Section
7.2(c) and (d) above), (ii) Parent has no obligation to operate the Company in
order to achieve any Earnout Amount or to maximize the amount of any Earnout
Amount (subject to Section 7.2(c) and (d) above), (iii) the Earnout Amount is
speculative and is subject to numerous factors outside the control of Parent
and the Company, (iv) there is no assurance that any Company Stockholder,
Company Optionholder or RSU Holder will receive any Earnout Amount and Parent
has not promised nor projected any Earnout Amount, and (v) the parties solely
intend the express provisions of this Agreement to govern their contractual
relationship.

 



 

(f) In the event that prior to January 1, 2016, Parent consummates any
transaction pursuant to which all or substantially all of the business,
properties or assets of Parent are transferred to another person not directly
or indirectly controlled by Parent, whether by merger, purchase of assets,
tender offer or otherwise (an " **Acquisition Transaction** "), then the
Stockholder Representative shall have the option, in its sole discretion, and
in lieu of, and in complete satisfaction of, any Earnout Amount that the
Company Stockholders, Company Optionholders and RSU Holders may otherwise be
entitled to in accordance with Section 7.2(a), to cause the Parent to
distribute (or cause the Paying Agent to distribute) the greater of (i) that
portion of the Earnout Amount actually earned through and including the
closing date of the Acquisition Transaction, and (ii) the pro-rated portion of
Thirteen Million Dollars ($13,000,000), based on the number of days that have
elapsed from January 1, 2015 through and including the closing date of the
Acquisition Transaction (the " **Accelerated Earnout** "). To assist the
Stockholder Representative in its determination whether to elect to accelerate
the Earnout, Parent shall make available to the Stockholder Representative and
its Representatives such information and detail relating to the Earnout Amount
as is reasonably requested. The Company shall be given notice of the proposed
Acquisition Transaction no less than five (5) Business Days following
execution of definitive agreements with respect to the Acquisition
Transaction, and Stockholder Representative shall notify the Parent of its
election to accelerate the Earnout Amount pursuant to this Section 7.2(f)
within ten (10) Business Days of receiving notice of such proposed Acquisition
Transaction. Any such payment

 



      
 

 



 

made pursuant to this Section 7.2(f) shall be made as soon as practicable, but
in any event within five (5) Business Days following consummation of such
Acquisition Transaction.

 



 

(g) _Subordination_.

 



 

(i) _Subordination of Earnout Amount to Senior Debt_. The Company and each of
the Company Stockholders, covenants and agrees, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement or any other agreement executed in
connection herewith, that the payment of any and all of the Earnout Amount
(other than the Escrowed Earnout Amount) shall be subordinate and subject in
right and time of payment, to the extent and in the manner hereinafter set
forth, to the prior Payment in Full of all Senior Debt. Each Company
Stockholders, Company Optionholders and RSU Holders right to receive any
payment of the Earnout Amount (other than the Escrowed Earnout Amount) is
subject to the terms of subordination set forth herein. Each holder of Senior
Debt, whether such Senior Debt is now outstanding or hereafter created,
incurred, assumed or guaranteed, shall be deemed to have acquired Senior Debt
in reliance upon the provisions contained in this Section 7.2(g). Each of the
Senior Agent and the Senior Lenders shall be a third party beneficiary of the
provisions of this Section 7.2(g) and shall be entitled to enforce the terms
and provisions hereof to the same extent as if it were a party hereto. None of
such provisions may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, nor may
any other provision of this Agreement be amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified if the effect thereof would be to amend, supplement or otherwise
modify the provisions of this Section 7.2(g), in each case without the prior
written consent of the Senior Agent.

 



 

(ii) _Liquidation, Dissolution, Bankruptcy_. In the event of any Bankruptcy
Proceeding involving Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries:

 



 

(1) All Senior Debt shall first be Paid in Full before any Distribution,
whether in cash, securities or other property, shall be made to any Company
Stockholder, Company Optionholder or RSU Holder on account of any Earnout
Amount (other than the Escrowed Earnout Amount and a distribution of
Reorganization Subordinated Securities which the Company Stockholders are
hereby specifically authorized to receive and retain).

 



 

(2) Any Distribution, whether in cash, securities or other property which
would otherwise, but for the terms hereof, be payable or deliverable in
respect of any Earnout Amount (other than the Escrowed Earnout Amount and a
distribution of Reorganization Subordinated Securities which the Company
Stockholders are hereby specifically authorized to receive and retain) shall
be paid or delivered directly to Senior Agent (to be held and/or applied to
the Senior Debt by Senior Agent in accordance with the terms of the Senior
Debt Documents) until all Senior Debt is Paid in Full. Each debtor, debtor in
possession, receiver, trustee, liquidator, custodian, conservator or other
Person having authority, shall pay or otherwise deliver all such Distributions
(other than the Escrowed Earnout Amount and a distribution of Reorganization
Subordinated Securities) to Senior Agent (to be held and/or applied to the

 



      
 

 



 

Senior Debt by Senior Agent in accordance with the terms of the Senior Debt
Documents) until all Senior Debt is Paid in Full.

 



 

(3) At the meeting of creditors or in the event of any Bankruptcy Proceeding
involving Parent or the Company, the Company Stockholders shall retain the
right to vote and file any proof of claims and otherwise act with respect to
the Earnout Amount (including the right to vote to accept or reject any plan
of partial or complete liquidation, reorganization, arrangement, composition
or extension); provided that no Company Stockholder shall initiate, prosecute
or participate in any claim, action or other proceeding challenging the
enforceability, validity, perfection or priority of the Senior Debt or any
liens and security interests securing the Senior Debt.

 



 

(4) Until all Senior Debt is Paid in Full, Senior Agent shall be irrevocably
authorized, empowered and appointed as each Company Stockholders, Company
Optionholders and RSU Holders agent and attorney-in-fact with full power of
substitution and with full authority in the place and stead of such Company
Stockholder, Company Optionholder or RSU Holder and in the name of such
Company Stockholder, Company Optionholder or RSU Holder and such or otherwise
to (i) execute, verify, deliver and file such proofs of claim upon the failure
of such Company Stockholder, Company Optionholder or RSU Holder promptly to do
so prior to 15 days before the expiration of the time to file any such proof
of claim and (ii) vote such claim in any such Bankruptcy Proceeding upon the
failure of such Company Stockholder, Company Optionholder or RSU Holder to do
so prior to 10 days before the expiration of the time to vote any such claim;
provided Senior Agent shall not have any obligation to execute, verify,
deliver, file and/or vote any such proof of claim. In the event that Senior
Agent votes any claim in accordance with the authority granted hereby, no
Company Stockholder, Company Optionholder or RSU Holder shall be entitled to
change or withdraw such vote.

 



 

(5) The Senior Debt shall continue to be treated as Senior Debt and the
provisions of Section 7.2(g) of this Agreement shall continue to govern the
relative rights and priorities of Senior Agent and Senior Lenders and Company
Stockholders, Company Optionholders and RSU Holders with respect to the
Earnout Amount even if all or part of the Senior Debt or all or part of the
security interests securing the Senior Debt are subordinated, set aside,
avoided, invalidated or disallowed in connection with any such Bankruptcy
Proceeding, and Section 7.2(g) of this Agreement shall be reinstated if at any
time any payment of any of the Senior Debt is rescinded or must otherwise be
returned by any holder of Senior Debt or any representative of such holder.

 



 

(iii) _Earnout Amount Payment Restrictions_.

 



 

(1) Notwithstanding the terms of the Subordinated Debt Documents, Parent
hereby agrees that it may not make, and each Company Stockholder agrees that
no Company Stockholder, Company Optionholder or RSU Holder may accept, any
Distribution (other than the receipt of the Escrowed Earnout Amount and the
Reorganization Subordinated Securities as provided above) with respect to the
Earnout

 



      
 

 



 

Amount until all of the Senior Debt is Paid in Full other than Permitted
Earnout Amount Payments subject to the terms of Section 7.2(g)(ii) of this
Agreement and other than the Escrowed Earnout Amount; provided, however, that
Parent and each Company Stockholder further agree that no Permitted Earnout
Amount Payment may be made by the Parent or accepted by any Company
Stockholder, Company Optionholder or RSU Holder if, at the time of such
payment (A) a Senior Default exists and such Senior Default shall not have
been cured or waived, (B) Parent and its Subsidiaries shall, immediately after
the making of such payment, have Adjusted Cash (as defined in the Senior
Credit Agreement as in effect upon the Effective Time (upon the effectiveness
of all amendments set forth in the Consent and Amendment No. 3 to Credit
Agreement dated as of even date herewith (the " **Applicable Conditions Credit
Agreement** ")) equal to at least $20,000,000, and (C) Parent and its
Subsidiaries are in compliance with the financial covenants set forth in
Section 7.14 of the Applicable Conditions Credit Agreement on a pro forma
basis (based on, with respect to the financial covenants that are tested
quarterly, the covenant levels set forth therein as of the most recently ended
Fiscal Quarter for which financial statements were required to be delivered to
Agent pursuant to Applicable Conditions Credit Agreement (the " **Applicable
Statements** ")) after giving effect to such payment (with the financial
covenant set forth in Section 7.14.2 of the Applicable Conditions Credit
Agreement calculated based on the Applicable Statements as if any Debt
incurred by Borrower or its Subsidiaries to directly or indirectly make a
distribution to Parent to pay any portion of the Earnout Amount were
outstanding on the last day of such Fiscal Quarter).

 



 

(2) Parent may resume Permitted Earnout Amount Payments (and may make any
Permitted Earnout Amount Payments missed due to the application of clause (1)
of this Section 7.2(g)(iii)) in respect of the Earnout Amount, upon a cure or
waiver of the Senior Default and satisfaction of the other conditions set
forth in clause (1) of this Section 7.2(g)(iii). No Senior Default under the
Senior Debt Documents shall be deemed to have been waived for purposes of this
Section 7.2(g)(iii) unless and until the Company shall have received a written
waiver from Senior Agent or "Required Lenders" under the Senior Credit
Agreement.

 



 

(iv) _Earnout Amount Standstill Provisions_. Until all Senior Debt is Paid in
Full, no Company Stockholder, Company Optionholder or RSU Holder shall be
permitted, without the prior written consent of Senior Agent, to take any
Enforcement Action with respect to the Earnout Amount. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each Company Stockholder may file proofs of claim in any Bankruptcy
Proceeding involving Parent, or the Company or any of their Subsidiaries. Any
Distributions (other than the Escrowed Earnout Amount and a distribution of
Reorganization Subordinated Securities permitted under Section 7.2(g)(ii) of
this Agreement) or other proceeds of any Enforcement Action obtained by any
Company Stockholder, Company Optionholder or RSU Holder in violation of the
foregoing prohibition shall in any event be held in trust by it for the
benefit of Senior Agent and Senior Lenders and promptly paid or delivered to
Senior Agent (to be held and/or applied to the Senior Debt by Senior Agent in
accordance with the terms of the Senior Debt Documents) until all Senior Debt
is Paid in Full. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no provision
herein shall prevent any Company Stockholder from (i) initiating a suit or
action (other than a Bankruptcy

 



      
 

 



 

Proceeding) within 30 days of the expiration of, and solely to the extent such
suit or action is necessary to prevent the running of any statute of
limitations or similar permanent restriction on claims or (ii) seeking
specific performance or other injunctive relief to compel Parent or the
Company to comply with any non-monetary obligation under the Subordinated Debt
Documents, so long as it (x) is not accompanied by a claim for monetary
damages or demand for payment, and (y) is not an action to enjoin or restrain
or seek other relief with respect to the sale of any Collateral (as defined in
the Senior Credit Agreement).

 



 

(v) _Incorrect Payments_. If any Distribution on account of the Earnout Amount
not permitted to be made by Parent (or any other Person) or accepted by any
Company Stockholder, Company Optionholder or RSU Holder under this Agreement
is made and received by any Company Stockholder, Company Optionholder or RSU
Holder, such Distribution shall not be commingled with any of the assets of
such Company Stockholder, Company Optionholder or RSU Holder, shall be held in
trust by such Company Stockholder, Company Optionholder or RSU Holder for the
benefit of Senior Agent and Senior Lenders and shall be promptly paid over to
Senior Agent (to be applied to the Senior Debt by Senior Agent in accordance
with the terms of the Senior Debt Documents) until all Senior Debt is Paid in
Full.

 



 

(vi) _Earnout Amount to be unsecured; Agreement Not to Contest; Agreement to
Release Liens_. Until all Senior Debt has been Paid in Full, the Earnout
Amount shall not be secured by any liens or security interests on any assets
of Parent, the Company, any of their Subsidiaries or any other Person, nor
shall the obligation of Parent to pay the Earnout Amount be guaranteed by any
Person, and any liens and security interests of any Company Stockholder,
Company Optionholder or RSU Holder in any such assets which may exist in
breach of the foregoing shall be and hereby are subordinated for all purposes
and in all respects to the liens and security interests of Senior Agent and
Senior Lenders in the assets of Parent, the Company and their Subsidiaries,
regardless of the time, manner or order of perfection of any such liens and
security interests. No Company Stockholder, Company Optionholder or RSU Holder
shall be permitted to contest the validity, perfection, priority or
enforceability of the Senior Debt, the Senior Debt Documents, or the liens and
security interests of Senior Agent and Senior Lenders in the assets securing
the Senior Debt. In the event that any Company Stockholder, Company
Optionholder or RSU Holder obtains any liens or security interests in any such
assets notwithstanding the prohibitions set forth herein, such Company
Stockholder, Company Optionholder or RSU Holder shall be obligated to promptly
execute and deliver to Senior Agent such termination statements and releases
as Senior Agent shall request to effect the release of the liens and security
interests of such Company Stockholder, Company Optionholder or RSU Holder in
such assets. In furtherance of the foregoing, Senior Agent is irrevocably
appointed as each Company Stockholders, each Company Optionholders and each
RSU Holders attorney-in-fact, with full power of substitution and with full
authority in the place and stead of each Company Stockholder, each Company
Optionholder and each RSU Holder and in the name of each Company Stockholder,
each Company Optionholder and each RSU Holder or otherwise, to execute and
deliver any document or instrument which any Company

 



      
 

 



 

Stockholder, Company Optionholder or RSU Holder may be required to deliver
pursuant to this Section 7.2(g)(vi).

 



 

(vii) _Sale, Transfer or other Disposition of Earnout Amount_.

 



 

(1) No Company Stockholder, Company Optionholder or RSU Holder may sell,
assign, pledge, dispose of or otherwise transfer all or any portion of the
Earnout Amount or any Subordinated Debt Document unless the transferee thereof
agrees in writing that the Earnout Amount or Subordinated Debt Document so
transferred remains subject to the terms of this Section 7.2(g) and notice of
such transfer and a copy of such agreement is concurrently delivered to Senior
Agent.

 



 

(2) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the subordination effected hereby shall
survive any sale, assignment, pledge, disposition or other transfer of all or
any portion of the Earnout Amount, and the terms of Section 7.2(g) of this
Agreement shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of each Company
Stockholder.

 



 

(viii) _Legends_. Until all Senior Debt has been Paid in Full, the right of
Company Stockholders to receive the Earnout Amount shall not be evidenced by
any note or any other instrument, document or agreement other than this
Agreement unless a legend approved in writing by Senior Agent is clearly,
conspicuously and prominently displayed on the face of such other Subordinated
Debt Document, as well as any renewals or replacements thereof, to give notice
of the subordination provisions set forth in this Section 7.2(g).

 



 

(ix) _Obligations Hereunder Not Affected_. All rights and interest of Senior
Agent and Senior Lenders hereunder, and all agreements, obligations and
provisions binding upon each Company Stockholder and Parent hereunder, shall
remain in full force and effect irrespective of: (1) any lack of validity or
enforceability of any document evidencing any of the Senior Debt; (2) any
change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or any other term of, all
or any of the Senior Debt, or any other permitted amendment or waiver of or
any release or consent to departure from any of the Senior Debt Documents; (3)
any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral for all or any of
the Senior Debt; (4) any failure of any Senior Lender or Senior Agent to
assert any claim or to enforce any right or remedy against any other party
hereto under the provisions of this Agreement or any Senior Debt Document; (5)
any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination of the Senior Debt for
any reason, including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or
compromise, and shall not be subject to (and Parent and each Company
Stockholder hereby waives and any right to or claim of) any defense or setoff,
counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of invalidity,
illegality, nongenuiness, irregularity, compromise, unenforceability of, or
any other event or occurrence affecting, any Senior Debt; and (6) any other
circumstance, whether similar or dissimilar which might otherwise constitute a
defense available to, or a discharge of, Parent, the Company, the Borrower or
any of their Subsidiaries in respect of the Senior Debt or any Company
Stockholder in respect of this Section 7.2(g). The Senior Lenders and Senior
Agent may in accordance with the terms of the Senior Debt

 



      
 

 



 

Documents, without notice or demand and without affecting or impairing any
Persons obligations hereunder, from time to time (i) renew, compromise,
extend, increase, accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment of, or
otherwise change the terms of the Senior Debt or any part thereof, including,
without limitation, to increase or decrease the rate of interest thereon or
the principal amount thereof; (ii) take or hold security for the payment of
the Senior Debt and exchange, enforce, foreclose upon, waive and release any
such security; (iii) apply such security and direct the order or manner of
sale thereof as Senior Agent and Senior Lenders in their sole discretion, may
determine; (iv) release and substitute one or more endorsers, warrantors,
borrowers or other obligors; and (v) exercise or refrain from exercising any
rights against Parent, the Company, Borrower, any of their Subsidiaries or any
other Person.

 



 

(x) _Modifications_.

 



 

(1) Senior Agent and Senior Lenders may at any time and from time to time
without the consent of or notice to any Company Stockholder, without incurring
liability to any Company Stockholder and without impairing or releasing the
provisions of this Section 7.2(g) that are binding upon any Company
Stockholder, change the manner or place of payment or extend the time of
payment of or renew or alter any of the terms or increase the amount of any or
all of the Senior Debt, or amend in any manner any agreement, note, guaranty
or other instrument evidencing or securing or otherwise relating to the any or
all of the Senior Debt.

 



 

(2) Until all of the Senior Debt has been Paid in Full, and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in the Subordinated Debt Documents, none of
Parent nor any Company Stockholder shall be permitted, without the prior
written consent of Senior Agent, to agree to any amendment, modification or
supplement to the Subordinated Debt Documents pertaining in any way to the
Earnout Amount the effect of which is to (A) increase the Earnout Amount or
the Escrowed Earn-Out Amount, (B) change the dates upon which payments of
Earnout Amount are due, (C) change the manner in which the Earnout Amount is
calculated, (D) obtain any guaranty of the Earn-Out Amount from any Subsidiary
of Parent, take any liens or security interests in any assets of the Parent or
Company or any guarantor of the Earnout Amount; (E) amend this Section 7.02(g)
in any respect, or (F) change or amend any other term of the Subordinated Debt
Documents if such change or amendment would result in a Senior Default,
increase the obligations of the Company or any guarantor of the Earnout Amount
in any material respect or confer additional material rights on any Company
Stockholder in a manner adverse to the Parent or the Company, any guarantor of
the Earn-Out Amount, the Senior Lenders or Senior Agent.

 



 

(xi) _Subrogation; Recovery_. Subject to the Payment in Full of all Senior
Debt, each Company Stockholder shall be subrogated to the rights of Senior
Agent and Senior Lenders to receive Distributions with respect to the Senior
Debt until the Earnout Amount is paid in full. In the event that all or any
part of a payment made with respect to the Senior Debt is recovered from the
holders of the Senior Debt in a Bankruptcy Proceeding or otherwise, any
Distribution received by a Company Stockholder with respect to the Earnout
Amount at any time after the date of the payment

 



      
 

 



 

that is so recovered, whether pursuant to the right of subrogation provided
for in this Agreement or otherwise, shall be deemed to have been received by
such Company Stockholder in trust as property of the holders of the Senior
Debt and such Company Stockholder shall forthwith deliver the same to the
Senior Agent for the benefit of the Senior Lenders (to be applied to the
Senior Debt by the Senior Agent in accordance with the terms of the Senior
Debt Documents) until all Senior Debt is Paid in Full. A Distribution made
pursuant to this Agreement to Senior Agent or a Senior Lender which otherwise
would have been made to a Company Stockholder is not, as between Parent and
such Company Stockholder, a payment by Parent to or on account of the Earnout
Amount.

 



 

(xii) _Modification_. Any modification or waiver of any provision of this
Section 7.2(g), or any consent to any departure by any party from the terms
hereof, shall not be effective in any event unless the same is in writing and
signed by Senior Agent, Parent and each Company Stockholder, and then such
modification, waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific
instance and for the specific purpose given. Any notice to or demand on any
party hereto in any event not specifically required hereunder shall not
entitle the party receiving such notice or demand to any other or further
notice or demand in the same, similar or other circumstances unless
specifically required hereunder.

 



 

(xiii) _Further Assurances_. Each Company Stockholder and Parent, promptly
will execute and deliver such further instruments and agreements and do such
further acts and things as may be reasonably requested in writing by any other
party hereto that may be necessary or desirable in order to effect fully the
purposes of Section 7.2(g) of this Agreement.

 



 

(xiv) _Successors and Assigns_. Section 7.2(g) of this Agreement shall inure
to the benefit of, and shall be binding upon, the respective successors and
assigns of Senior Agent, each Senior Lender, each Company Stockholder, and
Parent. To the extent permitted under the applicable Senior Debt Documents,
Senior Lenders may, from time to time, without notice to any Company
Stockholder or any other Person, assign or transfer any or all of the Senior
Debt or any interest therein to any Person and, notwithstanding any such
assignment or transfer, or any subsequent assignment or transfer, the Senior
Debt shall, subject to the terms hereof, be and remain Senior Debt for
purposes of this Agreement, and every permitted assignee or transferee of any
of the Senior Debt or of any interest therein shall, to the extent of the
interest of such permitted assignee or transferee in the Senior Debt, be
entitled to rely upon and be the third party beneficiary of the subordination
provided under this Section 7.2(g) and shall be entitled to enforce the terms
and provisions hereof to the same extent as if such assignee or transferee
were a party hereto. Persons refinancing any Senior Debt shall be treated as
assignees of Senior Debt and may rely on and enforce this Section 7.2(g).

 



 

(xv) _Relative Rights_. This Section 7.2(g) shall define the relative rights
of Senior Agent, Senior Lenders and Company Stockholders with respect to the
Senior Debt and Earnout Amount (other than the Escrowed Earnout Amount, the
payment and performance of which is not subordinated, restricted or limited in
any way

 



       
 

 



 

by this Section 7.2(g) or otherwise). Nothing in this Agreement shall (A)
impair, as among Parent, the Company, Senior Agent and Senior Lenders and as
between Parent, the Company and the Company Stockholders Creditor, the
obligation of Parent, the Company and their Subsidiaries with respect to the
payment of the Senior Debt and the Earnout Amount in accordance with their
respective terms, (B) affect the relative rights of Senior Agent, Senior
Lenders or Company Stockholders with respect to any other creditors of Parent,
the Company or their Subsidiaries or (C) affect the rights of any Company
Stockholder as the holder of any other debt or equity securities of Parent,
the Company or their Subsidiaries or any other Person.

 



 

(xvi) _Continuation of Subordination; Termination of Agreement_. Regardless of
any termination of this Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof, this Section
7.2(g) shall remain in full force and effect until Payment in Full of all of
the Senior Debt after which this Section 7.2(g) shall terminate without
further action on the part of the parties hereto, subject to reinstatement
pursuant to Section 7.2(g)(ii) of this Agreement.

 



 

7.3 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Parent intends to raise funds from the issuance of convertible notes
and/or common stock for aggregate net proceeds to Parent sufficient to pay the
Merger Consideration and any and all expenses and costs related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " **Financing** ").

 



 

(b) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide all
cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Financing as may be
reasonably requested by Parent or its Representatives, including (i) making
senior management of the Company available to participate in a reasonable
number of due diligence and drafting sessions; (ii) assisting with the
preparation of customary materials regarding the Company for offering
documents, registration statements, prospectuses, prospectus supplements and
similar documents required in connection with the Financing; (iii) furnishing
Parent with quarterly or annual financial statements for periods ending no
earlier than December 31, 2012 and ending no later than December 31, 2014
(which shall have been reviewed by the Companys auditors in accordance with
SAS 100), financial data, audit reports, auditors consents, auditors comfort
letters and other financial information regarding the Company, in each case of
the type and form required by Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K under the
Securities Act or other applicable Law or regulation to be included in such
documents; and (iv) providing Parent information reasonably requested by
Parent which is necessary to enable Parent to prepare pro forma financial
statements of the type and form required by Regulation S-X under the
Securities Act.

 



      
 

 



 

ARTICLE VIII.

 



 

 _COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY AND PARENT_

 



 

8.1 _Regulatory Approvals_.

 



 

(a) The Company and Parent have filed with the United States Federal Trade
Commission (the " **FTC** ") and the United States Department of Justice (the
" **DOJ** "), the notification and report form required from each of the
Company and Parent for the Merger and any supplemental information requested
in connection therewith pursuant to the HSR Act. Parent shall be responsible
for all filing fees payable in connection with such filings and for any local
counsel fees; provided that fifty percent (50%) of any filing fees shall be
deemed Transaction Expenses.

 



 

(b) The Company shall promptly following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the parties hereto (i) deliver to Parent its calculation of any
payments and/or benefits that may separately or in the aggregate constitute
Section 280G Payments and (ii) submit such Section 280G Payments to the
Company Stockholders for approval (in a manner reasonably satisfactory to
Parent), by such number of Company Stockholders as is required by the terms of
Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, so as to render the provisions of Section
280G of the Code inapplicable to any and all such payments and/or benefits;
provided, that the Company shall provide Parent for its review and comment
advance copies of its calculations and communications by which it intends to
seek such waiver and requisite approval. Prior to the Closing, the Company
shall deliver to Parent a certification by the Companys Secretary that a
stockholder vote was solicited pursuant to this Section 8.1(e) in conformance
with Section 280G of the Code and the results of such vote with respect to the
individuals whose Section 280G Payments were made subject to such vote,
subject to waiver of such Section 280G Payments if such vote was not obtained
in accordance with Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code.

 



 

8.2 _Public Announcements_. Prior to Closing, neither the Company nor Parent
shall, nor shall any of their respective Affiliates, without the approval of
the other party, which approval may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed, issue any press releases or otherwise make any public statements
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as may
be required by applicable Law or by obligations of such party or its
Affiliates pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or stock market, in which case the party required to make the release
or announcement shall allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such
release or announcement in advance of such issuance; provided that each of the
parties may make internal announcements to their respective employees that are
consistent with the parties prior public disclosures regarding the Merger.

 



 

8.3 _Further Assurances_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall
execute such documents and other instruments and take such further actions as
may reasonably be required or desirable to carry out the provisions hereof and
consummate the Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof,
each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use its respective reasonable
best efforts to (a) take or cause to be taken all actions, and to do or cause
to be done all other things, necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
Merger as promptly as practicable, and (b) obtain in a timely manner all
necessary waivers, consents and approvals and to effect all necessary
registrations and filings.

 



      
 

 



 

8.4 _Returns and Payment of Taxes_.

 



 

(a) (i) Following the Closing, the Stockholder Representative shall accurately
prepare or cause to be accurately prepared, at the sole expense of the
Stockholder Representative (paid on behalf of the Company Stockholders,
Company Optionholders and RSU Holders), and timely file or cause to be timely
filed all Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries due and required to
be filed on or after the Closing Date with respect to any taxable period
ending on or before the Closing Date, other than any SpinCo Separate Tax
Returns, which shall be prepared and filed by SpinCo in its sole discretion
(such Tax Returns to be filed or caused to be filed by the Stockholder
Representative, " **Pre-Closing Tax Returns** "). The Stockholder
Representative shall prepare such Pre-Closing Tax Return in a manner
consistent with the prior practice of the Company or any relevant Subsidiary
unless otherwise required by applicable Law. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary of the Company (including SpinCo) shall make (or shall allow to be
made) a ratable allocation election under Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii)-(iii) or any similar provision of applicable Tax Law. The
Stockholder Representative will submit all Pre-Closing Tax Returns to be filed
on or after the Closing (i) to the Parent for its review, comment and approval
(such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and
(ii) to SpinCo for its review and comment, and, in each case, Stockholder
Representative shall submit such Pre-Closing Tax Returns to Parent and SpinCo
at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the filing thereof (or, for any
Pre-Closing Tax Return due within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, as
soon as possible following the Closing and sufficiently in advance of the due
date of such Pre-Closing Tax Return to allow Parent and SpinCo a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment sufficiently on such Pre-Closing Tax
Return); provided, however, that Parents ability to review, comment and
approve such Pre-Closing Tax Returns shall extend to such Tax Returns as
revised by the Stockholder Representative to reflect any reasonable comments
of SpinCo and such Tax Return as so revised shall be submitted to Parent at
least fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the filing thereof. The Stockholder
Representative shall reflect all reasonable comments of the Parent on such
Pre-Closing Tax Returns provided to the Stockholder Representative within five
(5) calendar days prior to the due date of such Pre-Closing Tax Returns and
the Stockholder Representative shall reflect all reasonable comments of SpinCo
on such Pre-Closing Tax Returns provided to the Stockholder Representative
within twenty (20) calendar days prior to the due date of such Pre-Closing Tax
Returns. For purposes of this Section 8.4(a), Parents withholding of approval
of a Pre-Closing Tax Return shall not be deemed reasonable as it relates to
any reporting position taken by the Stockholder Representative with respect to
such Pre-Closing Tax Return if such reporting position meets the following
requirements: (i) such reporting position is at least "more likely than not"
to prevail, as defined in Treas. Reg. Section 1.6662-4(d)(2) (it being
understood that such standard shall be applied whether or not the underlying
Tax Return is a Tax Return with respect to income taxes), (ii) such reporting
position is not inconsistent with the prior practice of the Company or any
relevant Subsidiary (unless otherwise required by Law) and (iii) where
applicable, such reporting position is consistent with the positions taken by
the Company to estimate Spinoff Taxes as set forth in Schedule 4.8(m) of the
Disclosure Schedule. The Stockholder Representative, on behalf of the Company
Stockholders, Company Optionholders and RSU Holders, shall timely pay all
Taxes shown as due on all Pre-Closing Tax Returns (including all Taxes related
to SpinCo Tax Matters) except that

 



      
 

 



 

Parent will pay such amounts to the extent that such Taxes have been included
in (x) Final Closing Net Working Capital as finally determined under Section
3.10, or (y) Transaction Expenses taken into account for purposes of
determining the Merger Consideration. If income Tax liabilities included in
Final Closing Net Working Capital as finally determined under Section 3.10
exceed income Tax liabilities reported on Pre-Closing Tax Returns, and to the
extent such excess is attributable to income tax deductions, if any, reported
on Pre-Closing Tax Returns related to the Closing RSU Payments, Parent shall
pay to the Company Stockholders, and on behalf of the Company Optionholders
and RSU Holders an aggregate amount equal to such excess no later than five
(5) Business Days after the filing of such Pre-Closing Tax Returns with the
amount payable to or on behalf of each such Person allocated and payable in
the same manner as the Per Share Earnout Amount. If the income tax deductions
related to the Closing RSU Payments are not claimed on the Pre-Closing Tax
Returns but are instead claimed on the income Tax Returns for Parent or its
Affiliated Group for the period ending December 31, 2015 (" **2015 Income Tax
Returns** ") and, as a result of such deductions, Parent or its Affiliated
Group actually realizes a Tax Benefit in respect of such 2015 Income Tax
Returns (the " **2015 RSU Tax Benefit** ") (such as through a refund of Taxes
or reduction in the amount of Taxes that otherwise would have been paid on
such 2015 Income Tax Returns), then Parent shall pay to the Company
Stockholders, and on behalf of the Company Optionholders and RSU Holders an
aggregate amount equal to such 2015 RSU Tax Benefit no later than five (5)
Business Days after the filing of the 2015 Income Tax Returns with the amount
payable to or on behalf of each such Person allocated and payable in the same
manner as the Per Share Earnout Amount.

 



 

(ii) The Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Parent and the Stockholder
Representative acknowledge and agree that to the extent allowed by applicable
Tax Law and supported by "a more likely than not" standard as defined in
Treas. Reg. Section 1.6662-4(d)(2), any items of Transaction Expenses or
Indebtedness (including any such payments relating to the cancellation or
exercise of any Company Stock Options) that are deductible under applicable
Tax Law shall be allocated to Tax periods (or portions thereof) ending on or
prior to the Closing Date for purposes of preparing and filing any Tax Returns
and for purposes of determining the amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including
under clauses (iv) and (v) of the definition of Indemnified Taxes).

 



 

(iii) Following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall prepare or cause
to be prepared and timely file or cause to be timely filed all Tax Returns of
the Company and its Subsidiaries that are due after the Closing Date, other
than (x) any Pre-Closing Tax Returns, (y) any SpinCo Separate Tax Returns and
(z) any SpinCo Post-Closing Tax Returns (such Tax Returns to be filed or
caused to be filed by the Surviving Corporation, " **Post-Closing Tax
Returns** "). With respect to any Post-Closing Tax Return of the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company for any Straddle Period (each a " **Straddle
Return** "), the Surviving Corporation shall prepare such Straddle Return in a
manner consistent with the prior practice of the Company or any relevant
Subsidiary unless otherwise required by applicable Law. The Surviving
Corporation will submit all Straddle Returns (except for Straddle Returns
required to be provided to SpinCo pursuant to the terms of the SpinOff
Agreements) to be filed after the Closing to the Stockholder Representative
for a reasonable opportunity to review, comment upon all

 



      
 

 



 

such Straddle Returns and amendments thereto at least twenty (20) Business
Days prior to the filing thereof. Parent shall reflect all reasonable comments
of the Stockholder Representative on such Straddle Returns provided to the
Surviving Corporation within ten (10) Business Days after the delivery of such
Straddle Returns to the Stockholder Representative. The Stockholder
Representative, on behalf of the Company Stockholders, Company Optionholders
and RSU Holders, shall timely pay to Parent (and in all events shall pay at
least five (5) Business Days prior to the filing of such Straddle Returns) an
amount equal to all Indemnified Taxes shown as due on all Straddle Returns
(including without limitation, all Taxes related to SpinCo Tax Matters) except
to the extent that such Taxes have been included in (x) Final Closing Net
Working Capital as finally determined under Section 3.10) or (y) Transaction
Expenses taken into account for purposes of determining the Merger
Consideration.

 



 

(b) For the sole purpose of apportioning any Taxes of the Company and its
Subsidiaries relating to a Straddle Period, the Company or any relevant
Subsidiary will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, elect with the
relevant Governmental Entity to treat for all purposes the Closing Date as the
last day of a taxable period of the Company or such Subsidiary. In the case
where applicable law does not permit the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company to treat the Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period, then
for purposes of this Agreement, the portion of such Tax that is attributable
to the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company for the part of such taxable
period that ends on the Closing Date shall be (i) in the case of a Tax that is
not based or measured by income or receipts of the Company or its Subsidiaries
or that is not imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property or any other specifically identifiable transaction or
event (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the
amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period), the total amount
of such Tax for the full taxable period that includes the Closing Date
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days from
the beginning of such taxable period to and including the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the total number of days in such full taxable period,
and (ii) in the case of a Tax that is based on or measured by income or
receipts of the Company or any Subsidiary or imposed in connection with any
sale or other transfer or assignment of property or any other specifically
identifiable transaction or event, the Tax that would be due with respect to
such partial period, if such partial period were a full taxable period,
apportioning income, gain, expenses, loss, deductions and credits equitably
based on an interim closing of the books as of the end of the Closing Date.
All determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing allocations shall
be made in a manner consistent with the prior practices of the Company or
relevant Subsidiary.

 



 

(c) Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries and the Stockholder
Representative on behalf of the Company Stockholders, Company Optionholders
and RSU Holders, shall reasonably cooperate, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other party, in connection with the furnishing of information
relating to, and the filing of, any Tax Returns of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company and any audit, litigation or other Action with
respect to Taxes of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, including
with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other partys request) the

 



      
 

 



 

provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any
audit, litigation or other Action involving Taxes and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries and the Stockholder Representative on behalf
of the Company Stockholders, Company Optionholders and RSU Holders agrees to
retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the
Company, the Surviving Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries relating to
any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of
the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by another party, any
extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority.

 



 

(d) Parent will promptly notify the Stockholder Representative in writing of
any proposed assessment or claim or the commencement of any audit or
administrative or judicial or other proceeding or Action involving Taxes
which, if determined adversely, would or is reasonably expected to result in a
liability to the Company Stockholders, or Company Optionholders or RSU Holders
pursuant to Section 12.2 hereof (the " **Seller Tax Actions** "); provided,
however, that the failure to give notice as provided in this Section 8.4(d)
shall not affect Parents right to indemnification under this Agreement except
to the extent the Company Stockholders, Company Optionholders and RSU Holders
shall have been materially prejudiced by such failure and provided further
that such notice requirement shall not extend to SpinCo Tax Matters to the
extent Parent is required to provide notice to SpinCo pursuant to the terms of
the Spinoff Agreement. Parent shall control all Seller Tax Actions (including
selection of counsel and accountants) and, without limiting the foregoing, may
in its sole discretion but subject to the Stockholder Representatives consent
right described below, pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals,
proceedings, hearings, audits or conferences with any Taxing Authority or
other entity with respect thereto and may, in its sole discretion but subject
to the Stockholder Representatives consent right described below, either pay
the Tax claims and sue for a refund where applicable Law permits such refund
suits or contest the Tax claim in any permissible manner or settle or pay the
Tax claim; provided, that Parent shall afford the Stockholder Representative
the opportunity to participate in such Seller Tax Action, at its own expense,
as reasonably requested by the Stockholder Representative if such Seller Tax
Action relates to Taxes of the Company or its Subsidiaries for Tax periods
ending on or prior to the Closing Date and is not a Tax Action pursuant to
which such participation rights are extended to SpinCo under the terms of the
Spinoff Agreement and with such participation relating solely to Taxes that
are the responsibility of the Company Stockholders, Company Optionholders or
RSU Holders pursuant to this Agreement. For purposes of this Section 8.4(d),
the right of the Stockholder Representative to participate in any Seller Tax
Action shall include the right to receive a copy of all material documents or
notices received from the applicable Taxing Authority with respect to a Seller
Tax Action that relates to Taxes of the Company or its Subsidiaries for Tax
periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date and is not a Tax Action
pursuant to which such participation rights are extended to SpinCo under the
terms of the Spinoff Agreement but solely to the extent that such documents or
notices relate to Taxes that are the responsibility of the Company
Stockholders, Company Optionholders and RSU Holders pursuant to this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Parent shall not settle
or otherwise compromise

 



      
 

 



 

any Seller Tax Action that relates to Taxes of the Company or its Subsidiaries
for Tax periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date and is not a Tax Action
pursuant to which such participation rights are extended to SpinCo under the
terms of the Spinoff Agreement solely to the extent such Tax Action relates to
Taxes that are the responsibility of the Company Stockholders, Company
Optionholders and RSU Holders pursuant to this Agreement without the consent
of the Stockholder Representative, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned. For the avoidance of doubt, if a Seller Tax
Action covers a Tax period that ends on or prior to the Closing Date but also
covers a Straddle Period or a Post-Closing Tax Period, then to the extent that
participation and consent rights are extended to Stockholders Representative
pursuant to this Section 8.4(d), such participation and consent rights shall
be solely limited to the portion of the Seller Tax Action that relates to the
Tax period ending on or prior to the Closing Date. Further, for the avoidance
of doubt, with respect to any Tax Action where participation and/or consent
rights are extended to SpinCo under the terms of the Spinoff Agreement, Parent
shall not have any obligation to extend participation and/or consent rights in
connection with the same Tax Action to the Stockholders Representative
pursuant to this Section 8.4(d). Further, for the avoidance of doubt, in the
event of any conflict between this Section 8.4(d) and Section 12.5, the
procedures set forth in this Section 8.4(d) shall control.

 



 

(e) The amount of any refunds (including any refunds resulting from
overpayments of estimated Taxes ) or credits of Taxes (including any interest
paid or credited by any Taxing Authority with respect thereto) of, or with
respect to, the Company, or any of the Companys Subsidiaries of any
Indemnified Tax for a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be for the benefit of the
Company Stockholders, Company Optionholders and RSU Holders, and if received
by the Parent or the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, shall be
promptly paid to the Stockholder Representative. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any Tax refunds or credits shall be the property of the Parent to
the extent attributable to the carryback of a post-Closing Tax item or
attribute of the Company. If any amount is paid hereunder to the Stockholder
Representative or otherwise to or on behalf of the Company Stockholders,
Company Optionholders or RSU Holders in connection with a credit or refund and
such credit or refund is subsequently disallowed by a Taxing Authority, the
Stockholder Representative (and Company Stockholders, Company Optionholders
and RSU Holders) shall promptly repay the amount received with respect to such
credits or refunds to the Parent and the Stockholder Representative (and
Company Stockholders Company Optionholders and RSU Holders) shall be
responsible for any Losses arising in connection with such disallowance.

 



 

(f) The Parent shall not make, or permit to be made, any election under
Section 338 of the Code or any similar provision of state, local or foreign
Tax Law with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(g) Unless required by Law, without Stockholder Representatives prior written
consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
Parent shall not, and shall not permit the Company, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their Subsidiaries to file any amended Tax Return of the Company or
its Subsidiaries for any Tax period ending on or prior to the Closing Date.

 



      
 

 



 

(h) Any Tax allocation or sharing agreement to which the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company is a party prior to the Closing (other than any such
agreement solely between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries listed on
_Annex D_ ) shall be terminated on or before the Closing Date, and after the
Closing Date, no Company or any Subsidiary of the Company shall have any
rights or obligations under any such Tax allocation or sharing agreement.

good faith) and without gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Company
Stockholders, Company Optionholders and RSU Holders shall severally, but not
jointly, based on their Pro Rata Portion, indemnify and defend the Stockholder
Representative and its Affiliates and its respective directors, officers,
managers, stockholders, members, partners, employees, agents and
representatives, and its and their respective successors and permitted
assigns, as the case may be (each, a " **Stockholder Representative
Indemnitee** ") against, and shall hold each Stockholder Representative
Indemnitee harmless from, any and all Losses arising as a result of or
incurred in connection with any actions taken or omitted to be taken by the
Stockholder Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and any
other ancillary agreements contemplated hereby, in each case as such Losses

negligence or willful misconduct of any Stockholder Representative Indemnitee,

Stockholders, Company Optionholders and RSU Holders the amount of such
indemnified Loss to the extent attributable to such gross negligence or
willful misconduct.

 



 

11.3 _Successor Stockholder Representative_. In the event that the Stockholder
Representative dies, becomes legally incapacitated or resigns from his
position as Stockholder Representative, a successor Stockholder Representative
shall be appointed by a Majority-in-Interest, which replacement Stockholder
Representative shall be deemed to be a Stockholder Representative for all
purposes of this Agreement; provided, however, that the appointment of such
replacement Stockholder Representative shall not be effective until the
delivery to Parent of an acknowledgment signed by the successor Stockholder
Representative that he or she accepts the responsibility of successor
Stockholder Representative and agrees to perform and be bound by all of the
provisions of this Agreement applicable to the Stockholder Representative.
Each successor Stockholder Representative shall have all of the power,
authority and rights conferred by this Agreement upon the initial Stockholder
Representative and the term "Stockholder Representative" herein and the Escrow
Agreement shall be deemed to include any successor Stockholder Representative.

 



 

11.4 _Reliance by Stockholder Representative_. Each Stockholder Representative
shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any
statements furnished to it by any Company Stockholder, any Company
Optionholder, any RSU Holder, Parent, Merger Sub, or any other evidence deemed
by the Stockholder Representative to be reliable, and the Stockholder
Representative shall be entitled to act on the advice of counsel selected by
them. The Stockholder Representative shall be fully justified in failing or
refusing to take any action under this Agreement unless it shall have received
such advice or concurrence of any Company Stockholder, any Company
Optionholder and/or any RSU Holder as they deem appropriate or they shall have
been expressly indemnified to their satisfaction by the Company Stockholders,
the Company Optionholders and/or the RSU Holders (severally as to each Company
Stockholder, each Company Optionholder only and not jointly as to or with any
other Company Stockholder, any other Company Optionholder or any RSU Holder)
against any and all Liability and expense that the Stockholder Representative
may incur by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The
Stockholder Representative shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or
refraining from acting, under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and other
agreement entered into in connection with the Merger in accordance with a
request or instructions from a Majority-in-Interest, and such request or
instructions, and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto, shall
be binding upon all of the Company Stockholders and all of the Company
Optionholders. " **Majority-in-Interest** " means Company Stockholders and
Company Optionholders that, collectively, are entitled to receive not less
than fifty and one-tenth percent (50.1%) of the Merger Consideration pursuant
to this Agreement.

 



 

11.5 _Removal of Stockholder Representative_. A Majority-in-Interest shall be
entitled at any time to remove the then acting Stockholder Representative and
to appoint a successor Stockholder Representative; provided, however, that
neither such removal nor such appointment shall be effective until the
delivery to Parent of executed counterparts of a writing signed by a Majority-
in-Interest with respect to such removal

 



      
 

 



 

and appointment, together with an acknowledgment signed by the successor
Stockholder Representative appointed in such writing that he or she accepts
the responsibility of successor Stockholder Representative and agrees to
perform and be bound by all of the provisions of this Agreement applicable to
the Stockholder Representative. Each successor Stockholder Representative
shall have all of the power, authority and rights conferred by this Agreement
upon the initial Stockholder Representative and the term "Stockholder
Representative" herein and the Escrow Agreement shall be deemed to include any
successor Stockholder Representative.

 



 

11.6 _Actions of the Stockholder Representative_. A decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Stockholder Representative shall constitute a decision of
all of the Company Stockholders, Company Optionholders and RSU Holders and
shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each and every Company
Stockholder, Company Optionholder and RSU Holder, and the Escrow Agent,
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Surviving Corporation may rely upon
any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative as
being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each and every Company
Stockholder, Company Optionholder and RSU Holder. Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company and the Surviving Corporation are hereby relieved from any liability
to any Person for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative.

pursuant to this Agreement;

 



 

(viii) the Spinoff;

 



 

(ix) SpinCo or its business or operations;

 



 

(x) amounts related to any obligation of the Surviving Corporation or any of
its Affiliates to pay or provide any benefit to any Continuing Employee in

period following the Closing under any incentive compensation plan, stock
appreciation rights plan or agreement, employment agreement, salary
continuation plan or agreement, deferred compensation plan or agreement,
supplemental executive compensation agreement, phantom stock plan or
agreement, sale, "stay-around," "change-in-control," retention, or similar
bonuses or payments to current or former directors, officers, employees and
consultants or any other similar arrangement in effect or in place as of the

made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on or prior to the Closing Date
or otherwise required to be paid by the Company or of its Subsidiaries or the
Surviving

 



      
 

 



 

Corporation pursuant to agreements or employee plans entered into or adopted
on or prior to the Closing Date.

otherwise becomes subject to any Losses as a result of or in connection with
any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
obligation of the Company, or any of the other matters set forth in Section
12.2(a), then (without limiting any of the rights of the Surviving Corporation
as a Parent Indemnitee) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries shall also be
deemed, by virtue of its ownership of the stock of the Surviving Corporation,
to have incurred Losses as a result of and in connection with such inaccuracy
or breach but in either case the total amount both Parent and the Surviving
Corporation may recover shall not exceed the amount of Losses.

 



 

(c) Subject to Section 12.2(h), with respect to claims for Losses under
Section 12.2(a)(i), the Company Stockholders, Company Optionholders and RSU
Holders shall not be liable for any Loss or Losses unless and until the
aggregate amount of all Losses for which the Parent Indemnitees are otherwise
entitled to indemnification under this Article XII exceeds One Million Dollars
($1,000,000) (the " **Deductible** "), and then only to the extent that such
Losses exceed the Deductible. The Deductible shall not apply to breaches or
inaccuracies of the Company Fundamental Representations or the representations
and warranties of the Company contained in Sections 4.8 (Taxes) and 4.16
(Employee Benefits).

 



 

(d) Subject to Section 12.2(h), the maximum liability of the Company
Stockholders, Company Optionholders and RSU Holders for indemnifiable Losses
pursuant to Section 12.2(a)(i) hereunder shall be limited in the aggregate:

 



 

(i) in the case of Losses for breaches or inaccuracies of the Company General
Representations, the related Company Disclosure Schedules and the
certifications related thereto set forth in the certificate delivered pursuant
to Section 9.2(l)(i), the Escrow Fund and rights of set-off pursuant to
Section 12.4; and

 



 

(ii) in the case of Losses for breaches or inaccuracies of the Company

Disclosure Schedules and the certifications related thereto set forth in the
certificate delivered pursuant to Section 9.2(l)(i), the greater of (1) the
Base Amount, plus the Earnout Amount and the value of any Rollover Shares
(based on the value on the Closing Date of the Parent Shares exchanged for
such Rollover Shares as determined by the provisions of the Rollover
Commitment Letter) or (2) the Merger Consideration plus the Earnout Amount and
the value of any Rollover Shares (based on the value on the Closing Date of

(viii), (ix), (x) and (xii)) shall be limited in the aggregate to such Company
Stockholders, Optionholders or RSU Holders (as the case may be) Pro Rata
Portion of the greater of (1) the Base Amount, plus the Earnout Amount and the
value of any Rollover Shares (based on the value on the Closing Date of the
Parent Shares exchanged for such Rollover Shares as determined by the
provisions of the Rollover Commitment Letter) or (2) the Merger Consideration
plus the Earnout and the value of any Rollover Shares (based on the value on
the Closing Date of the Parent Shares exchanged for such Rollover Shares as
determined by the provisions of the Rollover Commitment Letter).

 



 

(f) In determining the existence of any misrepresentation or a breach or the
amount of any Losses, any qualifications in the representations, warranties
and covenants with respect to a Material Adverse Effect, materiality, material
or similar terms shall be disregarded and will not have any effect with
respect to the calculation of the amount of any Losses attributable to a
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of the Company set forth in
this Agreement or in exhibits, annexes or schedules hereto, or in any
certificates or other instruments delivered by or on behalf of the Company
pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(g) Parent and each Company Stockholder, Company Optionholder and RSU Holder
acknowledges and agrees that, should the Closing occur, its sole and exclusive
remedy against Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation or any Company
Stockholder, Company Optionholder or RSU Holder, as the case may be, with
respect to any and all matters arising out of, relating to or connected with
this Agreement and the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby (other than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud or
intentional misrepresentation or breach) shall be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Article XII. Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall (i) limit any Parent Indemnitees right to seek and
obtain any equitable, injunctive or similar relief to which any Parent
Indemnitee may be entitled or (ii) limit any Parent Indemnitees remedies with
respect to matters relating to any agreement other than this Agreement. The
parties hereto agree and acknowledge that notwithstanding anything contained
herein, Parents and its Affiliates (including the Company) recourse against
any Company Stockholder for any breach of or failure by such Company
Stockholder to perform or otherwise fulfill or comply with any covenant,
undertaking, agreement or obligation under the Restrictive Covenant Agreement,
the Retention Agreements, any employment agreement or any other agreement
(other than this Agreement) shall be governed by the terms and conditions of
each such agreement and not this Agreement.

 



 

(h) The existence of a breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty
of the Company contained in Sections 4.8 (Taxes) and the extent of any Losses
arising in connection with an Tax matter (including in connection with the
breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty) shall be determined
without regard to disclosures made in any schedules attached to this
Agreement.

 



 

(i) The parties hereto agree and acknowledge that, notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, the limitations contained in this Section
12.2

 



      
 

 



 

shall not apply in the case of fraud or in the case of an intentional
misrepresentation or breach.

 



 

(j) The adoption and approval of this Agreement and the Merger by the Company
Stockholders constitute approval of the indemnification obligations of the
Company Stockholders, Company Optionholders and RSU Holders set forth in this
Article XII.

 



 

12.3 _Indemnification by Parent_. Subject to the limitations set forth herein,
from and after the Closing, Parent shall indemnify and defend the Company
Stockholders and the Company Optionholders against, and shall hold them
harmless from, any Loss resulting from, arising out of, or incurred by the
Company Stockholders and the Company Optionholders in connection with, or
otherwise with respect to:

 



 

(a) any inaccuracy or breach of any representation and warranty of the Parent
contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or other instrument
delivered by or on behalf of the Parent pursuant to Article IX (in each case,
without giving effect to any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or similar
qualification contained or incorporated directly or indirectly in such
representation or warranty with respect to existence of an inaccuracy or a
breach or the determination or calculation of Losses with respect thereto);

 



 

(b) any inaccuracy or breach of or failure to perform by the Parent of any
covenant, obligation or agreement of the Parent contained in this Agreement or
in any certificate or other instrument delivered by or on behalf of the Parent
pursuant to Article IX;

 



 

(c) With respect to claims for Losses under Section 12.3(a), the Parent shall
not be liable for any Loss or Losses unless and until the aggregate amount of
all Losses incurred by the Company Stockholders and the Company Optionholders
exceeds the Deductible, and then only to the extent that such Losses exceed
the Deductible. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
Parents and Merger Subs liability under or in connection with this
Agreement, shall be limited to the amount of the Escrow Fund in the aggregate.

 



 

12.4 _Escrow Fund and Set-Off._

 



 

(a) As partial security for the indemnity provided in Section 12.2(a), at the
Closing, Parent shall cause to be delivered to the Escrow Agent the Escrow
Amount. The Escrow Amount, together with any and all income and proceeds
thereon, shall be referred to hereinafter as the " **Escrow Fund.** " The
Escrow Fund shall be available to pay, to the extent there are not sufficient
funds in the Administrative Expense Account, the Final Deficiency, if any, and
to compensate Parent Indemnitees for the indemnification obligations of the
Company Stockholders, the Company Optionholders and RSU Holders under this
Article XII. Other than as provided in Section 12.2(d)(i), the Parties hereto
agree and acknowledge that claims against the Escrow Fund are not the
exclusive remedy of Parent or any Parent Indemnitee for indemnifiable Losses
hereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) The Escrow Fund shall be held and disbursed by the Escrow Agent in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and the Escrow Agreement. Any
amounts that are disbursed from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of any claim
shall be drawn pro rata from the portion of the Escrow Fund allocable to the
Company Stockholders, the Company Optionholders and RSU Holders in accordance
with their respective interests therein as set forth in the Allocation
Certificate.

 



 

(c) The Escrow Fund shall be in existence on the Closing Date and shall
terminate at 5:00 p.m., Pacific Time, on the fifteenth (15) month anniversary
of the Closing Date (the period of time from the Closing Date through and
including such termination date is referred to herein as the " **Escrow
Period** "); provided, however _,_ that the Escrow Period shall not terminate
with respect to any amount (the " **Remaining Escrow Funds** ") that is
subject to any claim that is pending against the Escrow Fund as of such date
and time and, solely with respect to all such claims, the Escrow Period shall
be extended until such date and time as all such claims are resolved or
finally determined in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

(d) Subject to the limitations contained in this Article XII, if any Earnout
Amount is due and payable under this Agreement, the Company (and by virtue of
the Company Stockholders approval of the Merger, the Company Stockholders,
the Company Optionholders and the RSU Holders) agree that Parent and the
Company may withhold and offset any indemnifiable Losses claimed by or due and
payable to any Parent Indemnitee pursuant to this Article XII against the
Earnout Amount (including any amount held in escrow (other than with respect
to the first $6,887,417 of the Escrowed Earnout Amount)), thereby reducing the
amount of Earnout Amount payable under this Agreement.

 



 

12.5 _Indemnification Procedure for Third Party Claims_.

 



 

(a) In the event that any claim or demand, or other circumstance or statement
of facts which could give rise to any claim or demand, for which an Indemnitor
may be liable to an Indemnitee hereunder is asserted or sought to be collected
by a third party (" **Third Party Claim** "), the Indemnitee shall as soon as
practicable notify the Indemnitor in writing of such Third Party Claim ("
**Notice of Claim** "); provided that any Notice of Claim required to be
provided to the Company Stockholders, the Company Optionholders and the RSU
Holders as Indemnitors pursuant to Section 12.2 shall be delivered to the
Stockholder Representative; provided, further, that the failure to provide the
Notice of Claim shall not release any Indemnitor from any of its, his or her
obligations under this Article XII except to the extent that such Indemnitor
has been actually and materially prejudiced by such failure. The Notice of
Claim shall (i) state that the Indemnitee has paid, suffered, reserved or
properly accrued Losses or reasonably anticipates that it will incur liability
for Losses for which such Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification pursuant
to this Agreement, (ii) state the amount of such Losses to the extent known,
and (iii) specify in reasonable detail the material facts known to the
Indemnitee giving rise to such claim and the nature of the misrepresentation,
breach of warranty, breach of covenant or claim to which each such item is
related and the computation of the amount to which such Indemnitee claims to
be entitled hereunder. The Indemnitee shall enclose with the Notice of Claim a
copy of all relevant papers served

 



      
 

 



 

with respect to such Third Party Claim, if any, and any other documents
evidencing such Third Party Claim.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Indemnitor (to the extent the
Indemnitors are the Company Stockholders and the Company Optionholders, the
Stockholder Representative) acknowledges in writing, subject to the
limitations contained in this Article XII, the obligation of the Indemnitors
to indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnitees against any Losses that may
result from such Third Party Claim, then the Indemnitor (to the extent the
Indemnitors are the Company Stockholders, the Company Optionholders, and the
RSU Holders, the Stockholder Representative) shall be entitled to assume and
control the defense of such Third Party Claim at their expense through counsel
of their choice (such counsel to be reasonably acceptable to Parent) if the
Indemnitor (to the extent the Indemnitors are the Company Stockholders, the
Company Optionholders and the RSU Holders, the Stockholder Representative)
gives notice of such intention to Indemnitee within twenty (20) days of the
receipt of the Notice of Claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Stockholder Representative shall not have the right to assume the defense of
the Third Party Claim to the extent (i) any such claim seeks, in addition to
or in lieu of monetary losses, any injunctive or other equitable relief, (ii)
the Stockholder Representative fails to provide reasonable assurance to Parent
of the adequacy of the Escrow Fund to provide indemnification in accordance
with the provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement with respect to
such proceeding, (iii) there exists or is reasonably likely to exist a
conflict of interest that would make it inappropriate (in the judgment of
Parent in its reasonable discretion) for the same counsel to represent both
the Parent Indemnitee and the Indemnitors, (iv) the Third Party Claim involves
or relates to the subject matter contained in Section 4.9 (Compliance with
Law, Authorizations), Section 4.22 (Healthcare Regulatory Matters) or Section
4.23 (HIPAA Compliance), (v) any such claim relates to or arises in connection
with any criminal action, indictment, allegation or Action, or (vi) settlement
of, or an adverse judgment with respect to, the Third Party Claim may
establish (in the judgment of Parent) a precedential custom or practice
adverse to the business interests or reputation of Parent or any of its
Affiliates or involves any Tax liability of Parent or any of its Affiliates;
provided, further, that if by reason of the Third Party Claim a lien,
attachment, garnishment, execution or other Lien is placed upon any of the
property or assets of such Parent Indemnitee, the Indemnitor, if it desires to
exercise the right to assume such defense of the Third Party Claim, must
furnish a satisfactory indemnity bond to obtain the prompt release of such
lien, attachment, garnishment, execution or other Lien; (provided, further,
the Stockholder Representative shall, at its own cost and expense and without
recourse to the Escrow Fund, have the right to observe and be reasonably
informed of the defense of such Third Party Claim, but Parent shall control
all aspects of such defense, including the investigation, defense and
settlement thereof).

 



 

(c) If the Stockholder Representative assumes the defense of a Third Party
Claim as provided above, they will conduct the defense actively, diligently
and at their own expense, and, subject to the limitations contained in this
Article XII, the Company Stockholders, Company Optionholders and RSU Holders
will indemnify and hold the Parent Indemnitees harmless from and against all
Losses caused by or arising out of such Third Party Claim. The Parent
Indemnitees shall reasonably cooperate with the

 



      
 

 



 

Stockholder Representative in such defense and make available to the
Stockholder Representative (at the Stockholder Representatives expense) all
pertinent records, materials and information in the Parent Indemnitees
possession or under the Parent Indemnitees control relating thereto as is
reasonably requested by the Stockholder Representative. Except with the
written consent of the Parent, the Stockholder Representative will not, in the
defense of a Third Party Claim, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement (i) which does not include as an unconditional term
thereof the giving to the Parent Indemnitee and all of its Affiliates by the
third party of a release from all liability with respect to such suit, claim,
action, or proceeding; (ii) unless there is no finding or admission of (A) any
violation of Law by the Parent Indemnitee (or any Affiliate thereof), (B) any
liability on the part of the Parent Indemnitee (or any Affiliate thereof) or
(C) any violation of the rights of any Person and no effect on any other
claims of a similar nature that may be made by the same third party against
the Parent Indemnitee (or any Affiliate thereof); and (iii) which exceeds the
then current value of the Escrow Fund. The Stockholder Representative shall be
required to provide Parent a copy of any proposed judgment or proposed
settlement before the Stockholder Representative consents or enters into any
such judgment or settlement. Without limiting the foregoing, the Stockholder
Representative shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into
any settlement if within twenty (20) Business Days after Parent is provided a
copy of the proposed final judgment or proposed settlement, Parent provides
written notice to the Stockholder Representative that in the reasonable
judgment of Parent such judgment or settlement would adversely affect the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or any Parent Indemnitee.

 



 

(d) In the event that the Stockholder Representative fails or elects not to
assume the defense of a Parent Indemnitee against such Third Party Claim which
the Stockholder Representative had the right to assume under this Section 12.5
(or after assuming such defense, fails to actively and diligently conduct the
defense thereof) or if the Stockholder Representative is not entitled to
assume such defense under this Section 12.5, the Parent Indemnitees shall have
the right, at the expense of the Indemnitees, to defend or prosecute such
claim (and in such event shall do so actively and diligently) and may settle
such claim or consent to entry of judgment after giving written notice thereof
to the Stockholder Representative, on such terms as such Parent Indemnitee may
deem appropriate; provided, however, that if the Parent Indemnitee settles any
such Third Party Claim or consents to entry of judgment without the consent of
the Stockholder Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), the settlement of such claim or consent to entry of
judgment shall not, nor shall the entry of any judgment in and of itself,
prevent the Stockholder Representative from contesting (on behalf of the
Indemnitors) the issue of whether such claim is within the scope of and
subject to indemnification under this Article XII. The Stockholder
Representative shall cooperate with the Parent Indemnitees in such defense and
make available to the Parent Indemnitees, at their expense, all such
witnesses, records, materials and information in their possession or under
their control relating thereto as is reasonably requested by the Parent
Indemnitee. If the Stockholder Representative does not elect to assume the
defense of a Third Party Claim which it has the right to assume hereunder, the
Parent Indemnitees shall have no obligation to do so.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) To the extent that this Section 12.5 conflicts with the terms of Section
8.4, the terms of Section 8.4 shall control.

 



 

12.6 _Indemnification Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims_. The Indemnitee
will notify the Indemnitor in writing promptly of its discovery of any matter
that does not involve a Third Party Claim, such notice to contain the
information set forth in the following sentence; provided that any Notice of
Claim required to be provided to the Company Stockholders, the Company
Optionholders and RSU Holders as Indemnitors pursuant to Section 12.2 shall be
delivered to the Stockholder Representative; provided, further, that the
failure to provide the Notice of Claim shall not release any Indemnitor from
any of its, his or her obligations under this Article XII except to the extent
that such Indemnitor has been actually and materially prejudiced by such
failure. The Notice of Claim shall (i) state that the Indemnitee has paid,
suffered, reserved or properly accrued Losses or reasonably anticipates that
it will incur liability for Losses for which such Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) state the amount of such
Losses to the extent known, and (iii) specify in reasonable detail the
material facts known to the Indemnitee giving rise to such claim and the
nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty, breach of covenant or
claim to which each such item is related and the computation of the amount to
which such Indemnitee claims to be entitled hereunder. The Indemnitor shall
have twenty (20) days after receipt of any notice for a claim by an Indemnitee
to dispute such claim. The Indemnitee will reasonably cooperate and assist the
Indemnitor in determining the validity of any claim for indemnity by the
Indemnitee and in otherwise resolving such matters. Such assistance and
cooperation will include providing reasonable access to and copies of
information, records and documents relating to such matters, furnishing
employees to assist in the investigation, defense and resolution of such
matters and providing legal and business assistance with respect to such
matters. If the Indemnitor fails to dispute such claim within the twenty day
period specified above, or upon a final resolution of any dispute in favor of
an Indemnitee (a " **Resolved Claim** "), such claim specified by the
Indemnitee shall be conclusively deemed Losses subject to indemnification
under this Article XII, and, to the extent such Losses are not satisfied by a
distribution from the Escrow Fund, the Indemnitor(s) shall, within five (5)
Business Days, make payment by wire transfer to a bank account designated in
writing by such Indemnitee (such designation to be made at least two (2)
Business Days prior to the date such payment is due) in immediately available
funds of such amount, together with interest thereon at a rate equal to the
rate of interest from time to time announced by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as its
prime rate, calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed from
the Closing Date to the date of payment.

 



 

12.7 _Calculation of Indemnity Payments_. The amount of Losses payable under
this Article XII by the Indemnitor shall be reduced by (a) any and all amounts
actually received by the Indemnitee under applicable insurance policies (less
(i) the cost and expense of pursuing such insurance recovery, (ii) the
deductible associated therewith and (iii) the amount of all retro-premium
obligations and reasonably anticipated premium increases resulting from such
recovery) or from any other Person alleged to be responsible therefor (less
the cost and expense of pursuing such recoveries), and (b) any Tax benefits
actually realized by the Indemnitee or any member of its Affiliated Group

 



      
 

 



 

prior to the time such Losses are payable by the Indemnitor and attributable
to such Losses. If the Indemnitee receives any amounts under applicable
insurance policies or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any
Losses or actually realizes any Tax benefits attributable to such Losses,
subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Indemnitor (and in the case of
any such Tax benefits, the Tax benefit is actually realized by the Indemnitee
in the Tax year of the Loss or the immediately following Tax year), then such
Indemnitee shall promptly reimburse the Indemnitor for any payment made or
expense incurred by such Indemnitor in connection with providing such
indemnification up to the amount received or actually realized by the
Indemnitee, net of any expenses incurred by such Indemnitee in collecting such
amount. In connection with any Losses for which an Indemnitee may seek
indemnification under this Article XII, such Indemnitee will in its reasonable
discretion in determining whether to seek recovery under available insurance
coverage; provided, however, that the Indemnitee shall have no obligation to
first submit or to collect upon any applicable insurance coverage as a
precondition to making a claim for indemnification hereunder or obtaining
indemnification for Losses therefor, and the parties hereto agree, without
limiting any other rights any Indemnitor may have against any Indemnitee, not
to delay in any manner the payment to any Indemnitee of such indemnification
based on the Indemnitees failure to have sought or obtained recovery under
available insurance coverage at the time any such claim is made. With respect
to the Tax benefits described above, which for avoidance of doubt are limited
to Tax benefits actually realized by the Indemnitee in the Tax year of the
Loss or the Tax year immediately following the Tax year of the Loss (such Tax
benefits, the " **Realized Tax Benefits** "), the following shall apply: (i)
the aggregated amount of such Realized Tax Benefits with respect to any Loss
shall in no event exceed the indemnification payment actually received from
the Indemnitor with respect to such Loss; (ii) such Realized Tax Benefits
shall be calculated in good faith by the Indemnitee and the Indemnitee shall
have no obligation to disclose Tax Returns or other confidential Tax
information in support of such calculation; (iii) such good faith calculation
of the Realized Tax Benefits shall be made by computing the amount of Taxes
before and after inclusion of any Tax items attributable to the Losses for
which the indemnification payment was made and by treating such Tax items as
the last items claimed for any taxable period; and (iv) if subsequent Tax
adjustments are made for any taxable period as a result of or in settlement of
any audit or other administrative proceeding that results in any reduction in
the amount of any Realized Tax Benefit, the Indemnitor shall promptly refund
the difference between the amount of the Realized Tax Benefit paid by the
Indemnitee and the amount that should have been paid after taking into account
such adjustments (again, all as determined in good faith by the Indemnitee).

 



 

12.8 _Characterization of Indemnification Payments_. Except as otherwise
required by applicable Law, the parties shall treat any indemnification
payment made hereunder as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration.

 



 

12.9 _Payments_. The indemnification required by this Article XII shall be
made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the
investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or Losses are
incurred or accrued.

 



       
 

 



 

12.10 _Effect of Investigation; Waiver_. The Parent Indemnitees right to
indemnification under this Article XII or other remedies provided in this
Agreement shall not be affected by any investigation (including any
environmental, regulatory or intellectual property investigation or
assessment) conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable
of being acquired) by, Parent or any of its Affiliates or other
Representatives at any time, whether before or after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy
or inaccuracy of, breach of or compliance with any representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation. The waiver of any condition based upon the accuracy of
any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with
any covenant or obligation, will not affect the right to indemnification,
reimbursement or other remedy based upon any such representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation.
