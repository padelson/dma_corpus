AGREEMENT

the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this
Agreement agree as follows:

 ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent
permitted hereunder) of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than
those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied or waived (if
permitted hereunder) at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver
(to the extent permitted hereunder) of such conditions at the Closing, at the
Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged with and into the Company in
accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as
amended from time to time (the " _DGCL_ ") whereupon the separate existence
of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving
corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

 



2 (b) The consummation of the Merger shall take place at a closing (the "
_Closing_ ") to occur at the offices of DLA Piper LLP (US), 401 Congress
Avenue, Suite 2500, Austin, Texas 78701, on a date and at a time to be agreed
upon by Parent and the Company, which date shall be no later than the
second Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted
hereunder) of the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth
in _Article VI_ (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied or waived (if permitted hereunder) at the Closing, but subject to
the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of such
conditions at the Closing), or at such other location, date and time as Parent
and the Company shall mutually agree upon in writing. The date upon which the
Closing shall actually occur pursuant hereto is referred to herein as the "
_Closing Date_."

 

(c) On the Closing Date, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file a
certificate of merger to effect the Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "),
in such appropriate form and substance as is determined by the parties and in
accordance with the DGCL, with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, and make any other filings or recordings required by the DGCL in
connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time
(the " _Effective Time_ ") as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or at such later time as may be
mutually agreed to by the parties and as specified in the Certificate of
Merger).

 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects as
set forth in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger, and the applicable
provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be
subject to all of the debts, obligations, liabilities, restrictions,
disabilities and duties of each of the Company and Merger Subsidiary.

 

Section 1.2 _Conversion of Shares of Capital Stock_ _._ At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
Parent, the Company, Merger Subsidiary or the holders of any securities of
Parent, the Company, Merger Subsidiary or any other Person:

 

(a) each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than shares canceled pursuant to _Section_ __ _
1.2_(b) and Dissenting Shares, if any) shall be converted into the right to
receive $0.35 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), and
upon conversion thereof, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein. For the avoidance of doubt, no Rollover Shares shall be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration;

 

(b) each share of Company Common Stock, Series A Preferred Stock and Series
B Preferred Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent
(including the Rollover Shares), Merger Subsidiary or any wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Company or Parent (other than Merger Subsidiary) immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically canceled and shall cease
to exist, and no consideration or payment shall be delivered in exchange
therefor; and

(c) each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers
and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



3 Section 1.3 _Surrender and Payment_. _ _

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an agent reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of
exchanging for the aggregate Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof
(i) certificates representing shares of Company Capital Stock (the "
_Certificates_ ") or (ii) uncertificated shares of Company Capital Stock (the
" _Uncertificated Shares_ "). At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit and
make available to the Exchange Agent the aggregate Merger Consideration to be
paid in respect of the Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares (but not,
for the avoidance of doubt, the Dissenting Shares, the Company Option Merger
Consideration or the Company RSU Merger Consideration) (the " _Exchange Fund_
"). All cash deposited with the Exchange Agent shall only be used for the
purposes provided in this Agreement, or as otherwise agreed by the Company and
Parent before the Effective Time. Any income from investment of the Exchange
Fund will be payable to the Surviving Corporation. Promptly after the
Effective Time (but in no event later than five Business Days after the
Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to send to each holder
of shares of Company Capital Stock at the Effective Time (other than the
Company, Parent, Merger Subsidiary, any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company
or Parent, or holders of Dissenting Shares who have not subsequently withdrawn
or lost their rights of appraisal) a letter of transmittal, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Surviving Corporation, and instructions
(which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section_ __ _ 1.7_) or
transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such
exchange.

 

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Capital Stock that have been converted
into the right to receive the aggregate Merger Consideration payable in
respect thereof shall be entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to the
Exchange Agent of a Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 1.7_), together with a properly completed letter
of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent
(or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may
reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated
Shares, the aggregate Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Company
Capital Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share. Until so
surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes
only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. No interest or dividends
will be paid or accrue on any Merger Consideration payable to holders
of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares.

(c) If any portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration is to be paid
to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate
or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition
to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share
shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment
shall pay in advance to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes
required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
payable.

 

(d) After the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall
be closed with respect to all shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Capital Stock. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided for, and in accordance with
the procedures set forth, in this _Article I_.

 



4 (e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders
of shares of Company Capital Stock one year after the Effective Time shall be
returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged
shares of Company Capital Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance
with this  _Article I_ prior to that time shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration, in respect of
such shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none
of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to
any holder of shares of Company Capital Stock for any amounts paid to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.
Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Capital Stock
immediately prior to such time when such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Entity shall become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(f) Any portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration made available to
the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.4_ in respect of any
Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Parent, upon demand.

 

Section 1.4 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Capital Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of
Company Common Stock canceled in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.2(b)_) and
held by a holder who has not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or
consented thereto in writing and who has properly exercised appraisal rights
of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares being
referred to collectively as the " _Dissenting Shares_ " until such time as
such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses such
holders appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares) shall
not be converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger
Consideration but instead such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
the holder thereof shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by
Section 262 of the DGCL payment of the appraised value of such shares in
accordance with the DGCL; provided, however, that if, after the Effective
Time, such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or otherwise
loses such holders right to appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or
if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not
entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such shares of
Company Capital Stock shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted

the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Vested Company
Option (the " _Company Option Merger Consideration_ "); provided, however,
that if the exercise price per share of any such Vested Company Option is

shall be canceled and terminated without any cash payment being made in
respect thereof. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the
Company Option Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, at the

any required withholding Tax as contemplated in _Section_ __ _ 1.6_) equal to
the product of (A) the Merger Consideration and (B) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Vested Company RSU (the " _Company RSU
Merger Consideration_ ").; provided that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, any payment in respect of any Company
RSU which immediately prior to such cancellation was treated as "deferred
compensation" subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be made on the

respect to the making of such payment under

 



6  any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax law. If the Company,
Exchange Agent, Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so
withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of Company Capital
Stock, Company Stock Options, Company RSUs, as applicable, in respect of which
the Company, Exchange Agent, Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may
be, made such deduction and withholding.

Section 1.7 _Lost Certificates_ _._ If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit (in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Exchange Agent) of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the delivery by such Person of a written indemnity
agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and which
indemnity shall not require the posting by such Person of a bond,
the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the aggregate Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
shares of Company Capital Stock represented by such Certificate, as
contemplated by this _Article I_.

Section 1.8 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,

in stock, the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect
such change, and such adjustment shall provide the Company Stockholders with
the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
change; provided, however, that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 1.9_ shall be
construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to the
Company Capital Stock that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

Each of Merger Subsidiary and Parent is duly qualified to do business and is
in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties
owned or leased or the nature of its activities make such qualification
necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed, qualified or in good

Section 4.2 _Authority; Binding Nature of Agreement_. Each of

Merger Subsidiary and Parent of its obligations hereunder and the consummation
by each of Merger Subsidiary and Parent of the Transactions have been duly
authorized by the boards of directors of each of Merger Subsidiary and Parent.
Other than the approval by Parent in its capacity as the sole stockholder of

accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

 Section 4.3 _Non-Contravention_.

 

(a) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Merger
Subsidiary and Parent nor the consummation by Merger Subsidiary and Parent of
the Transactions will, directly or indirectly (with or without notice or lapse

certificate or articles of incorporation or bylaws, or other
similar organizational documents of Merger Subsidiary or Parent; or (ii)
subject to obtaining or making the consents, approvals, orders,
authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings referred to in

material adverse effect on the ability of Merger Subsidiary or Parent to
consummate the Transactions.

(b) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or
registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity is

Subsidiary makes any representation with respect to information supplied or to
be supplied by or on behalf of the Company for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Schedule 13E-3 or the Proxy Statement.

Section 4.7 _Activities of Merger Subsidiary_. Merger Subsidiary was

Representatives specifically for use or incorporation by reference therein.

 

Section 4.9 _Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company the duly executed Guarantee.
The Guarantee is in full force and effect as of the Agreement Date and
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each Guarantor, enforceable
against each Guarantor in accordance with its terms (subject to the

constitute a default or breach on the part of any Guarantor under the
Guarantee.

Agreement, Parent and the stockholders party thereto have delivered to the

to fund the Merger Consideration and all other amounts required to be paid in
connection with the consummation of the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement and the payment of all related fees and

Parent and Merger Subsidiary is Solvent as of the Agreement Date, and each of
Parent and the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries (on a consolidated
basis) will, after giving effect to the Merger or the Transactions, and
payment of all other amounts required to be paid in connection with the
consummation of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement and the payment of all related fees and expenses, and assuming the
representations and warranties in  _Article III_ are true and correct in all
material respects, be Solvent at and after the Closing. As used in this
_Section_ __ _ 4.11_, the term " _Solvent_ " shall mean, with respect to a
particular date, that on such date, (a) the sum of the assets, at a fair
valuation, of Parent and, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation and the
Companys Subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis) and of each of them (on a
stand-alone basis) will exceed their debts, (b) Parent and, after the
Closing, the Surviving Corporation and the Companys Subsidiaries (on a

and does not intend to incur, and does not believe that it will incur, debts
beyond its ability to pay such debts as such debts mature, and (c) Parent has
and, after the Closing, the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries (on a
consolidated basis) and each them (on a stand-alone basis) will have,
sufficient capital and liquidity with which to conduct its business. For
purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 4.11_, " _debt_ " means any liability on a
claim, and " _claim_ " means any (i) right to payment, whether or not such a
right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent,
matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or
unsecured, and (ii) any right to an equitable remedy for breach of
performance if such breach gives rise to a payment, whether or not such right
to an equitable remedy is reduced to judgment, fixed, contingent, matured,
unmatured, disputed, undisputed, secured or unsecured.

of their Affiliates, on the one hand, and any director, officer or employee of
the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries, on the other hand.

 

(b) There are no Contracts or commitments to enter into Contracts pursuant
to which any stockholder of the Company would be entitled to receive

or the Merger or agrees to vote against any Superior Proposal.

Representatives or any other Person will have or be subject to any liability
or indemnification obligation or other obligation of any kind or nature to

taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation of the adequacy and
accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking

amendments or modifications thereof) received from any Excluded Party (which
shall include a copy of the proposal made by such Excluded Party (which copy
may be redacted to omit the identity of such Excluded Party) and a summary of
any financing material related thereto (if any)).

 



30  After the Go-Shop Period End Date, the Company shall notify Parent promptly
(and in any event within forty-eight hours following receipt), orally and
in writing, of the Companys receipt of any Acquisition Proposal (including
material amendments or proposed material amendments thereto) and provide a
summary of the material terms and conditions thereof.

 

(b) Following the Go-Shop Period End Date, the Company shall keep
Parent informed of the status of any Acquisition Proposal, on a reasonably
current basis (and in any event within forty-eight hours of the occurrence of
any material changes, developments, discussions or negotiations), specifying
(i) the material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal,
including material amendments or proposed material amendments, and (ii)
whether the Company has any intention to provide confidential information to
such Person. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall (i) promptly
notify Parent in writing if it determines to initiate actions concerning a
proposal, offer, inquiry, contact or request, in each case as permitted by
this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_, and (ii) provide Parent with forty-eight hours
prior notice (or such lesser prior notice as is provided to the members of the
Company Board or members of the Special Committee) of any meeting of the
Company Board or the Special Committee at which the Company Board or the
Special Committee, as applicable, is reasonably expected to consider any
inquiry, proposal or offer relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_,
at any time after the Go-Shop Period End Date and prior to the receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval, the Company and its Representatives may (acting
under the direction of the Special Committee), following the receipt of a
written Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ that such Acquisition Proposal

Company shall have complied with the requirements of  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_
with respect to such Acquisition Proposal):

(i) contact the person or group of persons who has made such Acquisition
Proposal to clarify and understand the terms and conditions thereof and to
notify such person of the restrictions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_;

 

(ii) provide information (including any non-public information or data
concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) in response to the request
of the person or group of persons who has made such Acquisition Proposal, if
prior to providing such information, the Company has received from the person
or group of persons so requesting such information an executed a
confidentiality agreement, a copy of which shall be promptly (and, in any
event, within 48 hours) provided to Parent; _provided_ that the Company shall
make available to Parent all material non-public information concerning the
Company and its Subsidiaries that is provided to any person or group of
persons making such Acquisition Proposal that is given such access to the
extent not previously provided to Parent and Merger Subsidiary within 48
hours of providing it to such person or group of persons; and/or

 

(iii) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with the
person or group of persons who has made such Acquisition Proposal (including
solicitation of revised Acquisition Proposals);

_provided_ that prior to taking any action described  _Section_ __ _
5.3(c)(ii)_ or _Section_ __ _ 5.3(c)(iii)_ above, the Special Committee has
determined, in good faith (after consultation with a financial advisor of
internationally recognized reputation and independent legal counsel), that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to
result in a Superior Proposal. For the avoidance of doubt, after the Go-Shop
Period End Date, the Company may continue to take any of the actions
described in this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(c)_ with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal submitted by a Solicited Person on or before the Go-Shop Period End
Date if the Special Committee has determined, in good faith (after
consultation

 



31  with a financial advisor of internationally recognized reputation and
independent legal counsel), that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or
could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal (each such
Solicited Person, an " _Excluded Party_ "). Any Excluded Party shall cease to
be an Excluded Party for all purposes of this Agreement immediately at such
time as the offer or proposal with respect to an Acquisition Proposal made by
such Person is withdrawn, is terminated or expires, or the Special Committee
determines in good faith that such offer or proposal has ceased to constitute,
or is no longer reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Proposal.

(d) Except as set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)_, neither the
Company Board nor the Special Committee shall (i) change, withhold, withdraw,
qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Subsidiary, or
propose publicly to change, withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner
adverse to Parent or Merger Subsidiary, the Company Recommendation, (ii)

Acquisition Proposal, (iii) fail to make the Company Recommendation or fail to

Exchange Act in a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9

or (v) resolve or publicly announce its intention to do any of such actions
under clauses (i) through (iv) (any of such actions under clauses (i) through
(v) being referred to as a " _Change of Recommendation_ ") or (vi) authorize,
approve or recommend, or cause or permit the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement or other similar definitive agreement relating to, any
Acquisition Proposal (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval, the Company or the Special Committee shall have received a written
Acquisition Proposal that the Special Committee determines, in good faith
(after consultation with independent legal counsel), constitutes a Superior
Proposal, the Company Board may effect a Change of Recommendation, recommend
a Superior Proposal, authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement and/or
authorize the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, but
only (i) if such Acquisition Proposal is not the result of a material breach
by the Company of _Sections_ _ 5.3(b)_ and _5.3(c)_ ; (ii) after (A)
providing written notice to Parent (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ")
advising Parent that the Company or the Special Committee, as applicable, has
received a Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of
such Superior Proposal and identifying the person making such Superior
Proposal and a summary of any financing materials related thereto (if any) and
indicating that the Company Board intends to effect a Change of Recommendation
(it being understood that the Notice of Superior Proposal shall not
constitute a Change of Recommendation), (B) negotiating with and causing its
financial and legal advisors to negotiate with Parent and its Representatives
in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate), during the five
Business Day period immediately following delivery of the Notice of Superior
Proposal (the " _Notice Period_ "), to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease
to constitute a Superior Proposal, and (C) permitting Parent and its
Representatives to make a presentation to the Special Committee regarding this
Agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent Parent
desires to make such presentation); _provided_ , that any material
modifications to such Acquisition Proposal that the Special Committee has
determined to be a Superior Proposal shall be deemed a new Superior Proposal
and the Company shall be required to provide a new Notice of Superior
Proposal ( _provided_ that any additional Notice Period shall be reduced to
three Business Days); and (iii) following the end of such Notice Period(s),
the Special Committee determines, in good faith (after consultation with a
financial advisor of internationally recognized reputation and independent
legal counsel), after considering the terms of any proposed modification or
amendment to this Agreement by Parent, that the Acquisition Proposal
giving rise to the Notice of Superior Proposal continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal.

 



32 (e) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ shall be deemed to
prohibit the Company or the Company Board (or the Special Committee) from
complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state or
non-U.S. Law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that if such
disclosure includes a Change of Recommendation or has the substantive effect
of withdrawing or adversely modifying the Company Recommendation, such
disclosure shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation (it being
understood that a statement by the Company that describes the Companys
receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with
respect thereto, or any "stop, look or listen" communication that
contains only the information set forth in Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act shall not constitute a Change of Recommendation).

 

Section 5.4 _Proxy Filing and Schedule  13E-3_.

(a) The Company shall prepare and file with the SEC, as promptly as
practicable after the Agreement Date (and in any event no later than fifteen
Business Days), the Schedule 13E-3 and a proxy statement in preliminary form
relating to the meeting of the Companys stockholders to be held in
connection with the approval of the adoption of this Agreement and the
Transactions, including the Merger (such proxy statement, including any
amendment or supplement thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") and, subject to
_Section_ __ _ 5.3_, shall include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement. Each of Parent and the Company shall provide the other with the
information contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 5.6(c)_ and shall otherwise
reasonably assist and cooperate with the other in connection with any of the
actions contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 5.4_, including the preparation,
filing and distribution of the Schedule 13E-3 and the Proxy Statement and the
resolution of any comments in respect thereof received from the SEC.

 

(b) If the Company determines that it is required to file any document
other than the Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3 with the SEC in
connection with the Merger pursuant to applicable Law (such document, as
amended or supplemented, an " _Other Required Company Filing_ "), then the
Company shall prepare and file as soon as practicable such Other Required
Company Filing with the SEC. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Proxy Statement, Schedule 13E-3 and any Other Required Company
Filing to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules of the SEC and the OTCQX. The
Company may not file the Proxy Statement, Schedule 13E-3 or any Other
Required Company Filing with the SEC, or respond to any SEC comments thereon,
without providing Parent and its counsel, to the extent practicable, a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, which comments shall be
considered by the Company in good faith.

(c) If at any time prior to the Stockholders Meeting (as defined below),
any information relating to the Company, Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any of
their respective Affiliates is discovered by the Company, on the one hand, or
Parent or Merger Subsidiary, on the other hand, that should be set forth in
an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, Schedule 13E-3, or any
Other Required Company Filing, as the case may be, so that such filing would
not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, then the party that discovers such information will promptly
notify the other, and an appropriate amendment or supplement to such filing
describing such information will be prepared and filed as soon as practicable
with the SEC by the Company and, to the extent required by applicable Law or
the SEC or its staff, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

 

Section 5.5 _Stockholders Meeting_. Subject to Section 5.3 and
unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to _Article VII_ , the
Company will take, in accordance with applicable Law and its certificate of
incorporation and bylaws, all action necessary to establish a record date for,
call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of holders of the Company
Capital Stock (the " _Stockholders_

 



33   _Meeting_ ") as promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of
this Agreement to consider and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement. Once
established, the record date of the Stockholders Meeting may not be changed
without the consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) or as required by applicable Law. In the event that the date of the
Stockholders Meeting as originally called is for any reason adjourned or
postponed or otherwise delayed, the Company agrees that unless Parent shall
have otherwise approved in writing, it shall implement such adjournment or
postponement or other delay in such a way that the Company does not establish
a new record date for the Stockholders Meeting, as so adjourned, postponed or
delayed. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_, the Company shall solicit from
the stockholders of the Company proxies in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement in accordance with the DGCL, and, subject to Section 5.3, the
Company Board shall recommend such adoption and shall take all lawful action
to solicit such adoption of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company may adjourn or postpone the
Stockholders Meeting (i) to the extent necessary to ensure that any supplement
or amendment to the Proxy Statement that is required by applicable Law is
timely provided to the Companys stockholders, (ii) if as of the time for
which the Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient
shares of Company Capital Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business to be conducted at the
Stockholders Meeting, or (iii) if additional time is reasonably required to
solicit proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, with the prior
written consent of Parent. The Company shall, upon the reasonable request of
Parent, advise Parent at least on a daily basis on each of the last ten
Business Days prior to the date of the Stockholders Meeting, as to the
aggregate tally of the proxies received by the Company with respect to
the Company Stockholder Approval.

Section 5.6 _Filings; Other Actions; Notification_.

(a) _Proxy Statement_. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger
Subsidiary, on the other hand, shall promptly notify the other of the receipt
of any comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement, Schedule 13E-3
or any Other Required Company Filing and of any request by the SEC for any
amendment or supplement thereto or for additional information and shall
promptly provide to Parent copies of all correspondence between the Company
and/or any of its Representatives and the SEC with respect to the Proxy
Statement, Schedule 13E-3 or any Other Required Company Filing. The Company
and Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to promptly provide
responses to the SEC with respect to all comments received in respect of the
Proxy Statement or Schedule 13E-3 by the SEC and the Company shall cause the
definitive Proxy Statement and Schedule 13E-3 to be mailed as promptly as
reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than five Business Days)
after the date the SEC staff advises that it has no further comments thereon
or that the Company may commence mailing the Proxy Statement and Schedule
13E-3 (the " _SEC Clearance Date_ "); provided that on the 10th calendar day
after the filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement and Schedule 13E-3 if the
SEC has not affirmatively notified the Company during such period that it
will or will not be reviewing the Proxy Statement or Schedule 13E-3, then the
Company shall contact the SEC on such date regarding the preliminary Proxy
Statement and Schedule 13E-3 and if no response is received from the SEC then
the second Business Day after such contact will be deemed the SEC Clearance
Date. If necessary in order to comply with applicable securities Laws after
the Proxy Statement and Schedule 13E-3 shall have been so disseminated, the
Company shall disseminate as soon as practicable amended, supplemental or
supplemented proxy material, and if required in connection therewith, re-
solicit proxies.

(b) _Cooperation_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and use (and
shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable
best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be
done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
this Agreement and applicable Laws, including the Antitrust Laws, to
consummate and make effective the Merger as soon as practicable, including
preparing and filing as promptly as practicable (and in any event shall make
all

 



34  filings pursuant to the HSR Act within ten days of the Agreement Date) all
documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings and
to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents, registrations, approvals,
permits and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any
third party and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger
and the Transactions. The Company and Parent will each request early
termination of the waiting period with respect to the Merger under the HSR Act
and, where available, under applicable Foreign Antitrust Laws. The Company and
Parent, and their respective Subsidiaries, shall (i) keep one another
promptly apprised of any communications received from a Governmental Entity
concerning the Merger and of the other Transactions; (ii) respond as promptly
as practicable to all requests for additional information from a Governmental
Entity under any Antitrust Law concerning the Merger or any of the
Transactions; (iii) provide each other in advance, with a reasonable

Transactions; and (iv) provide each other advance notice of all meetings,
conferences, or discussions with a Governmental Entity concerning the Merger
or the other Transactions, and, unless prohibited by the Governmental Entity,
permit one another to attend and participate therein either directly or
through counsel. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, and subject to reasonable confidentiality considerations, Parent
and the Company shall have the right to review in advance and, to the extent
practicable, each will consult with the other on and consider in good faith
the views of the other in connection with, all of the information relating to
Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their respective
Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection
with the Merger and the Transactions. In exercising the foregoing rights,
each of the Company and Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable. Nothing in this Agreement shall require the Company or the
Companys Subsidiaries to take or agree to take any action with respect to its
business or operations unless the effectiveness of such agreement or action
is conditioned upon Closing; provided, that neither the Company nor any of its
Affiliates shall take or agree to take any such action without the prior
written consent of Parent.

 

(c) _Information_. Subject to applicable Laws, the Company and Parent each
shall, upon request by the other, furnish the other with all information
concerning itself, its respective Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement or any other statement,
filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger, and shall provide the other
party with final copies of any filings made with a Governmental Entity, with
the exception of material responsive to a request for additional information
from Government Antitrust Entities.

 

(d) _Status_. Subject to applicable Laws and the instructions of any
Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent each shall keep the other
apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the Merger,
including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other
communications received by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, or any
of the Companys Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any Governmental
Entity with respect to the Merger and the Transactions. Neither the Company
nor Parent shall permit any of its officers or any other Representatives to
participate in any meeting or substantive telephone discussion with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry
with respect to the Merger unless, to the extent practicable, (i) it consults
with the other party in advance and (ii) to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, it gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meeting or substantive telephone discussion.

 



35 (e) _Regulatory Matters_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement, without limiting the generality of the other undertakings
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_, each of the Company (in the case of
_Section_ __ _ 5.5(e)(i)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 5.5(e)(iii)_ set forth below)
and Parent (in all cases set forth below) agree to take or cause to be taken
the following actions:

Antitrust Entity or that are necessary, proper or advisable to permit
consummation of the Transactions;

 

(ii) the prompt use of its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of
any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction or other order, decree,
decision, determination or judgment that would delay, restrain, prevent,
enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Transactions, including,
without limitation, the defense through litigation on the merits of any claim
asserted in any court, agency or other proceeding by any Person, including,
without limitation, any Governmental Entity, seeking to delay, restrain,
prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of such transactions and
the proffer and agreement by Parent of its willingness to sell, lease,
license or otherwise dispose of, or hold separate pending such disposition,
and promptly to effect the sale, lease, license, disposal and holding separate
of, such assets, rights, product lines, licenses, categories of assets or
businesses or other operations, or interests therein, of Parent, the Company
or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates (and the entry into
agreements with, and submission to orders of, the relevant Government
Antitrust Entity giving effect thereto) if such action should be reasonably
necessary or advisable to avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove the actual,
anticipated or threatened (x) commencement of any proceeding in any forum or
(y) issuance of any order, decree, decision, determination, judgment or Law
that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation
of the Transactions by any Government Antitrust Entity (it being understood
that no such action will be binding on the Company, Parent or any of their
respective Affiliates unless it is contingent upon the occurrence of the
Closing); provided, that neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates shall
take or agree to take any such action without the prior written consent of
Parent; and

(iii) the prompt use of its reasonable best efforts to take, in the event
that any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction, decision, order,
judgment, determination, decree or Law is entered, issued or enacted, or

Transactions in accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that
would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of
the Transactions, any and all steps (including, without limitation, the
appeal thereof, the posting of a bond or the taking of the steps contemplated
by _clause (ii)_ of this _paragraph (e)_ ) necessary to resist, vacate,
modify, reverse, suspend, prevent, eliminate, avoid or remove such actual,
anticipated or threatened injunction, decision, order, judgment,
determination, decree or enactment so as to permit such consummation on a
schedule as close as possible to that contemplated by this Agreement.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
(i) neither the Company nor any of the Companys Subsidiaries will be
required to agree to the payment of a consent fee, "profit sharing" payment or
other consideration (including increased or accelerated payments) or the
provision of additional security (including a guarantee), in connection with
the Merger, including in connection with obtaining any consent pursuant to any
Company Material Contract, (ii) in no event will the Company, any of the
Company Subsidiaries, Parent or Merger Subsidiary be required to take or
commit to take any actions that would be reasonably likely to materially
adversely impact or impose limitations on the ownership by Parent of any of
its Subsidiaries of all or a material portion of the Companys business or
assets and (iii) in no event will Parent or Merger Subsidiary be obligated
pursuant

 



36  to this Agreement to, and the Company will not, without the written consent
of Parent, sell, divest, license or hold separate any capital stock or other
equity or voting interests or a material portion of the Companys business or
assets.

 

Section 5.7 _Deregistration_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company

the Merger shall be a joint press release and thereafter (unless and until a
Change of Recommendation has occurred or in connection therewith) the Company

releases or otherwise making public announcements with respect to the Merger
and the Transactions and prior to making any filings with any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity (including any national securities exchange or
interdealer quotation service) with respect thereto, except in all cases as
may be required by Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement
with or rules of any national securities exchange or interdealer quotation
service or by the request of any Governmental Entity.

37  incur any other actual or potential liability in connection with the Debt

Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect
to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses with respect
to acts, errors, omissions and service prior to the Effective Time that are at
least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of

Subsidiaries as of the Agreement Date, and during such six-year period such
provisions shall not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner

38  of the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries or other Affiliates
(regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged action or omission,
occurred prior to, at or after the Effective Time), or (ii) any of the
Transactions; provided, however, that if, at any time prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a
written notice asserting a claim for indemnification under this _Section_ __
_ 5.10(b)_, then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time until such time as such claim is fully and
finally resolved. In the event of any such claim, proceeding, investigation
or inquiry, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to control the
defense thereof after the Effective Time, (ii) each Indemnified Person shall
be entitled to retain his or her own counsel, whether or not the Surviving
Corporation shall elect to control the defense of any such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry, (iii) the Surviving Corporation shall pay all
reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel retained by an Indemnified Person
promptly after statements therefor are received, whether or not the Surviving
Corporation shall elect to control the defense of any such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry, and (iv) no Indemnified Person shall be liable for
any settlement effected without his or her prior express written consent.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section_ __ _
5.10(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither the Surviving Corporation nor
any of its Affiliates (including Parent) shall settle or otherwise compromise
or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with
respect to any claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry for which
indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Person under this Agreement
unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an
unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from all liability arising
out of such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry; provided, that
undertakings consistent with Section 145(e) of the DGCL shall be provided by
an Indemnified Person to the extent required or permitted by applicable Law or
the governing documents of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries.

 

(c) _Insurance_. During the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
maintain in effect the Companys current directors and officers liability
insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time, covering each person covered by the DandO
Insurance, on terms with respect to the coverage and amounts that are
equivalent to those of the DandO Insurance. Prior to the Effective Time,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Company may purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on the DandO Insurance. In
the event that the Company elects to purchase such a "tail" policy prior to
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such "tail" policy in full force and
effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu
of all other obligations of the Surviving Corporation (and Parent) under the
first sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 5.9(c)_ for so long as such "tail"
policy shall be maintained in full force and effect. In satisfying its
obligations under this Section 5.10 _(c)_ , the Surviving Corporation shall
not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of three hundred percent
(300%) of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full
fiscal year (such three hundred percent (300%) amount, the " _Maximum Annual
Premium_ "); provided that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the
Maximum Annual Premium.

 

(d) _Successors and Assigns_. If the Surviving Corporation (or Parent) or
any of its successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations of the Surviving
Corporation (or Parent) set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.90_.

 



39 (e) _No Impairment; Third Party Beneficiaries_. The obligations set forth
in this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_ shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise
modified in any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any
other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the "tail"
policy referred to in _Section_ __ _ 5.9(c)_ (and their heirs and
representatives)) without the prior written consent of such affected
Indemnified Person or other person who is a beneficiary under the
DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section_ __ _ 5.9(c)_
(and their heirs and representatives). Each of the Indemnified Persons or
other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail"
policy referred to in _Section_ __ _ 5.9(c)_ (and their heirs and
representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.9_, with full rights of enforcement as if a party thereto.
The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and other persons who are beneficiaries
under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section_ __ _
5.9(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) under this _Section_ __ _
5.9_ shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights
that such persons may have under the certificates of incorporation, bylaws or
other equivalent organizational documents, any and all indemnification
agreements of or entered into by the Company or any of the Companys
Subsidiaries, or applicable Law (whether at law or in equity).

 

(f) _Joint and Several Obligations_. The obligations and liability of the
Surviving Corporation, Parent and their respective Subsidiaries under this
_Section_ __ _ 5.9_ shall be joint and several.

 

(g) _Preservation of Other Rights_. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to
directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been
in existence with respect to the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries
for any of their respective directors, officers or other employees, it being
understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this _Section_
__ _ 5.9_ is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such
policies.

 

Section 5.11 _Transaction Litigation_. Prior to the earlier of the
Effective Time or the date of termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.1_, the Company shall promptly notify Parent of all Legal
Proceedings commenced or threatened in writing against the Company or any of
the Companys Subsidiaries, in each case in connection with, arising from or
otherwise relating to the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement (" _Transaction Litigation_ ") (including by providing copies of
all pleadings and other documentation with respect thereto) and thereafter
keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. The
Company shall (a) give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense,
settlement or prosecution of any Transaction Litigation; and (b) consult with
Parent with respect to the defense, settlement and prosecution of any
Transaction Litigation. Further, the Company may not compromise, settle or
come to an arrangement regarding, or agree to compromise, settle or come to
an arrangement regarding, any Transaction Litigation unless Parent has
consented thereto in writing (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). For purposes of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.11_,
"participate" means that Parent will be kept apprised of proposed strategy and
other significant decisions with respect to the Transaction Litigation by the
Company (to the extent that the attorney-client privilege between the Company
and its counsel is not undermined or otherwise affected), and Parent may offer
comments or suggestions with respect to such Transaction Litigation, but will
not be afforded any decision-making power or other authority over such
Transaction Litigation except for the settlement or compromise consent set
forth above.

 Section 5.12 _Rule 16b-3_. Merger Subsidiary, Parent and the Company
shall take all such steps as may be reasonably required to cause the
Transactions, and any other dispositions of equity securities (including
derivative securities) of the Company or acquisitions of equity securities of
Parent by each individual who is or will be subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the
Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



40 Section 5.13 _Employee Matters_. 

(a) For purposes of this Section 5.13, (i) the term " _Covered Employees_ "
means employees who are actively employed by the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company at the Effective Time; and (ii) the term " _Continuation Period_ "
means the period beginning at the Effective Time and ending on the
first anniversary of the Effective Time.

(b) During the Continuation Period, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary to, provide to the Covered Employees
for so long as such Covered Employees remain employees of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Company during the Continuation
Period, compensation (such term to include salary, annual cash bonus
opportunities, commissions and severance) and benefits that are in the
aggregate, no less favorable than the compensation (excluding any equity or
equity-based compensation, retention, change of control, transaction or
similar bonuses, and nonqualified deferred compensation) and benefits
(excluding, any defined benefit pension plan or retiree medical benefits)
being provided to Covered Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(c) In the event any Covered Employee first becomes eligible following the
Effective Time and in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs to
participate under any employee benefit plan, program, policy, or arrangement
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries
that is a health benefit plan (a " _Parent Employee Benefit Plan_ ") Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to use commercially reasonable
efforts to: (i) waive any preexisting condition exclusions and waiting periods
with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to any
Covered Employee under any Parent Employee Benefit Plan providing medical,
dental, or vision benefits to the same extent such limitation would have been
waived or satisfied under the analogous Company Employee Benefit Plan the
Covered Employee participated in immediately prior to coverage under the
Parent Employee Benefit Plan; and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide each Covered Employee with credit for any copayments and deductibles
paid prior to the Covered Employees coverage under any Parent Employee
Benefit Plan providing medical, dental or vision benefits during the calendar
year in which the Effective Time occurs in which such amount was paid, to the
same extent such credit was given under the analogous Company Employee
Benefit Plan that the Covered Employee participated in immediately prior to
coverage under the Parent Employee Benefit Plan, in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under the Parent Employee Benefit
Plan.

 

(d) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall recognize, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries to recognize, all
service of each Covered Employee prior to the Effective Time, to the Company
(or any predecessor entities of the Company or any of the Companys
Subsidiaries) for vesting and eligibility purposes (but not for benefit
accrual purposes, except for vacation and severance, as applicable, and not
for any purpose under any equity-based plan or arrangement) to the same extent
as such Covered Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit
for such service under any similar Company Plan (other than any equity-based
plan) in which such Covered Employee participated immediately prior to the
Effective Time. In no event shall anything contained in this _Section_ __ _
5.13(d)_ result in any duplication of benefits or compensation for the same
period of service.

(e) Nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.12_ shall (i) be construed to limit
the right of Parent or any of its Affiliates (including, following the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) to amend, modify or terminate any
Company Plan, Company Employee Benefit Plan, or other benefit or compensation
plan program, policy, contract, agreement or arrangement (ii) be construed to
establish or modify or amend benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement
or arrangement, (iii) be construed to require Parent or any of its Affiliates
(including, following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation

 



41  or any of its Subsidiaries) to retain the employment or service of or
provide any particular term or condition of employment or service to any
particular Person for any fixed period of time following the Effective Time,
or to limit the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates (including,
following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries) to terminate the employment or service of any Person at any
time and for any or no reason, or (iv) be construed to create any rights or
remedies including any third party beneficiary rights in any Person not a
party to this Agreement.

 

Section 5.14 _Confidentiality_. The parties hereto acknowledge that
Parent and the Company have previously executed a confidentiality agreement,
dated as of December 14, 2016 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which
Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms, except as expressly modified herein.

 

Section 5.15 _Obligations of Merger Subsidiary_. Parent shall take all
action necessary to cause Merger Subsidiary and the Surviving Corporation to
perform their respective obligations under this Agreement and to consummate
the Merger and the Transactions upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement. Parent and Merger Subsidiary will be jointly and
severally liable for the failure by either of them to perform and discharge
any of their respective covenants, agreements and obligations pursuant to and
in accordance with this Agreement. 

Section 5.16 _Parent Vote_. Subject to the Voting Agreements, immediately
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent, in its
capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Subsidiary, will execute and
deliver to Merger Subsidiary and the Company a written consent approving the
Merger in accordance with the DGCL.

Section 5.17 _Director and Officer Resignations_. The Company shall cause
(a) each member of the Company Board, (b) each director or manager of each
Company Subsidiaries and/or (c) each officer of each of the Company and each
Company Subsidiary, in each case, if requested by the Parent to the Company
in writing at least three Business Days prior to the Closing, to tender his or
her resignation effective as of the Closing, as the case may be and shall
cause the Company Board and the board (or equivalent governing body) of any
relevant Company Subsidiary to pass any relevant resolutions and make any
necessary filings in connection with any such resignations.

 

Section 5.18 _Actions Taken at the Direction of the Beneficial
Owners_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, the Company shall not be deemed to be in breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement hereunder, including, without
limitation, _Article III_ and _Article V_ hereof, if the alleged breach is
the proximate result of action or inaction by the Company at the express
written direction of any Beneficial Owner, regardless of whether there is any
approval by or direction from the Company Board (acting with the concurrence
of the Special Committee) or the Special Committee.

Section 7.4 _Termination Fee_.

 

(a) _Company Termination Fee_.

 

(i) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to  _Section_

Company shall pay to Parent an amount equal to Parents reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including legal fees and expenses)
incurred by Parent and its Affiliates on or prior to the termination of this
Agreement in connection with the Transactions, in an amount not to exceed

(i) the agreements contained in this _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ are an integral
part of the Transactions, (ii) the damages resulting from termination of this
Agreement under circumstances where a Company Termination Fee is payable
are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and therefore, the
amounts payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.4(a)_ are not a penalty but
rather constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will 

 



46  compensate Parent for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions, and (iii)
without the agreements contained in this _Section_ __ _ 7.4_, the parties
would not have entered into this Agreement.

Section 8.2 _Extension of Time, Waiver, etc_. At any time prior to
the Effective Time, any party may, subject to applicable Law: (a) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other party hereto;
_provided_ , _however_ , __ that after adoption of this Agreement by the
holders of Company Capital Stock (if applicable), no waiver shall be made
which would pursuant to applicable Law require further approval by such
holders without obtaining such further approval; (b) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or acts of any other party hereto; or
(c) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waive compliance by the other
party with any of the agreements contained in this Agreement or, except as
otherwise provided in the Agreement, waive any of such partys conditions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Merger
Subsidiary or Parent in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a
waiver of rights, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such rights
preclude any other or further exercise of such rights or the exercise of any
other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party.

Section 8.3 _No Additional Representations; No Survival_. To the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, none of the Company, Merger Subsidiary,
Parent, their respective Affiliates or their respective Subsidiaries,
stockholders, controlling Persons or Representatives shall have any liability
or responsibility whatsoever to any other party hereto, its Affiliates or any
of their respective Subsidiaries, stockholders, controlling Persons or
Representatives on any basis (including in contract or tort, under federal or
state securities Laws or otherwise) based upon any information provided or
made available, or statements made (or any omissions therefrom), to such
party, its Affiliates or any of their respective Subsidiaries, stockholders,
controlling Persons or Representatives, including in respect of the specific
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in _Article III_ and
in respect of the specific representations and warranties of Merger Subsidiary
and Parent set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 3.1_, except as and only to the
extent expressly set forth in this Agreement with respect to such
representations and warranties, subject to the limitations and restrictions
contained in this Agreement. None of the representations and warranties in
this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall
survive the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement. This
_Section_ __ _ 8.3_ shall not limit the survival of any covenant or
agreement of the parties hereto contained in this Agreement which by its terms
contemplates performance after the earlier of the Closing or the termination
of this Agreement.

 



47 Section 8.4 _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiary_. This
Agreement, including the exhibits and annexes hereto, the Company Disclosure
Schedules, the documents and instruments relating to the Merger referred to in
this Agreement (including the Voting Agreements, the Rollover Agreement, the
Guarantee and the Confidentiality Agreement), constitutes the entire
agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
of this Agreement, provided, however, the Voting Agreements, the Rollover
Agreement, the Guarantee and the Confidentiality Agreement shall not be
superseded, shall survive any termination of this Agreement and shall continue
in full force and effect until the earlier to occur of (a) the Effective Time
and (b) the date on which the Voting Agreements, the Rollover Agreement, the
Guarantee, or the Confidentiality Agreement, as applicable, is terminated in
accordance with its terms. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARENT AND
MERGER SUBSIDIARY, ON THE ONE HAND, NOR THE COMPANY, ON THE OTHER HAND, MAKES
ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES TO THE OTHER, AND EACH PARTY HEREBY
DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR AS
TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY OTHER INFORMATION, MADE (OR MADE
AVAILABLE) BY ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT TO, OR
IN CONNECTION WITH, THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT
OR THE TRANSACTIONS, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER
OR THE OTHERS REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH
RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING. This Agreement is not intended,
and shall not be deemed, to create any agreement of employment with any
person, to confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns or to
otherwise create any third-party beneficiary hereto, except with respect to
the directors and officers of the Company covered by _Section_ __ _ 5.9_.

 

Section 8.5 _Applicable Law; Jurisdiction; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_.

 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL
BE INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH, AND ALL
ACTIONS, SUITS AND PROCEEDINGS ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, THE LAWS
OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO ANY CHOICE OR CONFLICTS OF LAW
PROVISION OR RULE THAT WOULD CAUSE THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER
JURISDICTION. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the personal
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such
Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over any action, suit or
proceeding, the federal courts of the United States of America located in the
County of New Castle, Delaware, solely in respect of the interpretation and
enforcement of the provisions of (and any claim or cause of action arising
under or relating to) this Agreement and of the documents referred to in this
Agreement, and in respect of the Transactions, and hereby irrevocably waive,
and agree not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for
the interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such document, that it is
not subject thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought
or is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may not
be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be
enforced in or by such courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that
all claims relating to such action, proceeding or transactions shall be heard
and determined in such courts. The parties hereto hereby consent to and grant
any such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and, to the extent
permitted by Law, over the subject matter of such dispute, agree that a final
judgment in any such action suit or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any manner
provided by Law (provided, however, that nothing in the foregoing shall
restrict any partys rights to seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or
any appeal from, a final trial court judgment),

 



48  and agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any
such action or proceeding in the manner provided in _Section_ __ _ 8.8_ or in
such other manner as may be permitted by Law shall be valid and sufficient
service thereof.

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE
TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS.
EACH PARTY HEREBY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT
OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT
SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED
THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
AND THE TRANSACTIONS BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS CONTAINED IN THIS  _Section_ __ _ 8.5_. THE PARTIES AGREE
THAT ANY OF THEM MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS PARAGRAPH WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN
EVIDENCE OF THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY, AND BARGAINED-FOR AGREEMENT AMONG
THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY TO WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY ACTIONS, SUIT OR PROCEEDING WHATSOEVER BETWEEN OR AMONG THEM
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS.

 

(c) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which monetary
damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy would occur in
the event that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this
Agreement (including any party hereto failing to take such actions as are
required of it hereunder in order to consummate this Agreement) in accordance
with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that, subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.4_, (A) the
parties hereto will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity, to an injunction, specific performance
and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof;
(B) the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ are not intended to and do not
adequately compensate the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger
Subsidiary, on the other hand, for the harm that would result from a breach of
this Agreement, and will not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in
any respect any partys right to an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief; and (C) the right of specific enforcement is an integral
part of the Transactions and without that right, neither the Company nor
Parent would have entered into this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall be entitled to seek specific
performance to and to cause Parent or Merger Subsidiary to consummate the
Merger on the terms and subject to the conditions in this Agreement, if, and
only if, (A) all conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ and _Section_ __
_ 6.2_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
at the Closing, _provided_ that such conditions are reasonably capable of
being satisfied) have been satisfied or waived, and (B) the Company has
irrevocably confirmed in a written notice to Parent that (1) all of the
conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.2 _(other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing,  _provided_ that such conditions are reasonably capable of being
satisfied) have been satisfied or waived, and (2) if specific performance is
granted, then the Closing will occur.

 

(d) Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that the rights to an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedy contemplated
herein are an integral part of the

 



49  Transactions and without such right, none of the parties hereto would have
entered into this Agreement. The parties hereto hereby agree not to raise any
objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific
performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement by any party hereto, and to specifically enforce the terms and
provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of,
or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of any party
under this Agreement. Any party hereto seeking an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each
party hereto irrevocably waives any right that it may have to require the
obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security. The
parties hereto further agree that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in
this _Section_ __ _ 8.5_, a party hereto shall not in any respect waive its
right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to a party under
this Agreement in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the
event that the remedies provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 8.5_ are not
available or otherwise are not granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 8.5_ shall require any party hereto to institute any
proceeding for (or limit any partys right to institute any proceeding for)
specific performance under this  _Section_ __ _ 8.5_ prior or as a condition
to exercising any termination right under _Article VII_ (and pursuing damages
after such termination), nor shall the commencement of any legal proceeding
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 8.5_ or anything set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 8.5_ restrict or limit any partys right to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article VII_ or pursue any
other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, to the
extent any party hereto brings an action, suit or proceeding to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement
(other than an action to specifically enforce any provision that expressly
survives termination of this Agreement) when expressly available to such party
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Termination Date shall
automatically be extended to (i) the twentieth (20th) business day following
the resolution of such action, suit or proceeding, or (ii) such other time
period established by the court presiding over such action, suit or
proceeding.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the
event that the Company pursues the collection of damages from Parent, Merger
Subsidiary or any of their Affiliates, in connection with this Agreement or
the Transactions (other than for fraud), (i) the parties hereto agree that
such damages shall not in any event be in excess of the amount of the
aggregate Merger Consideration, (ii) the receipt of such damages shall be the
Companys sole and exclusive remedy under this Agreement and shall be deemed
to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or
incurred by the Company or any of its Affiliates in connection with this
Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated hereby
(and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such
termination, (iii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
Company shall no longer be entitled to seek specific performance pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 8.5_ and (iv) none of the Company nor any of its
Affiliates shall be entitled to bring or maintain any other Legal Proceeding
against Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates
arising out of this Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
any matters forming the basis for such damages claim and the Company shall
cause any such Legal Proceeding brought by the Company or its Affiliates, and
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (which shall be understood not
to include the payment of any out-of-pocket monies or the agreement to any
material undertaking) to cause any Legal Proceeding brought by any other
Person, to be dismissed with prejudice promptly (or not undertaken, as
applicable) and in any event within three Business Days from the payment of
such damages. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 8.5(f)_ shall limit or restrict
the right or ability of the Company to pursue its rights under  _Section_ __
_ 8.6_.

 

Section 8.6 _Attorneys_ __ _Fees_. In any action at law or suit in
equity to enforce this Agreement or the rights of any of the parties
hereunder, the prevailing party in such action or suit shall be entitled to
receive a reasonable sum for its attorneys fees and all other reasonable
costs and expenses incurred in such action or suit.

 



50 Section 8.7 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto, in whole or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise),
without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any attempt to
make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void, except
that Merger Subsidiary may assign, in its sole discretion, any or all of its
rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to any one or
more direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries of Parent without the
consent of the Company, but no such assignment shall relieve Merger Subsidiary
of any of its obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

 Section 8.8 _Certain Provisions Regarding Debt Financing Sources_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto: (i) agrees that it will not bring or support any person
in any action, suit, proceeding, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-
party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether
in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any of the Debt
Financing Sources (which defined term for the purposes of this provision
shall include the Debt Financing Sources and their respective affiliates,
equityholders, members, partners, officers, directors, employees, agents,
advisors, representatives, successors or assigns of the foregoing) in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including, but not limited to, any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the executed commitment letter and fee letter, dated
as of the date hereof, from the Debt Financing Sources (collectively, the "
_Debt Commitment Letter_ ") or the performance thereof or the Debt Financing
contemplated thereby, in any forum other than the federal and New York state
courts located in the Borough of Manhattan within the City of New York; (ii)
agrees that, except as specifically set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter,
all claims or causes of action (whether at law, in equity, in contract,
in tort or otherwise) against any of the Debt Financing Sources in any way
relating to this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance
thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, shall be exclusively governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New
York, without giving effect to principles or rules or conflict of laws to the
extent such principles or rules would require or permit the application of
laws of another jurisdiction; and (iii) hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any right such party may have to a trial by jury in
respect of any litigation (whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or
in tort or otherwise) directly or indirectly arising out of or relating in
any way to this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance
thereof or the financings contemplated thereby. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, (a) the Company and its
subsidiaries, affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners,
managers, members or stockholders shall not have any rights or claims against
any Debt Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or in respect of any, or in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to have been made in
connection herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof
or the financings contemplated thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract,
in tort or otherwise and (b) no Debt Financing Source shall have any liability
(whether in contract, in tort or otherwise) to any of the Company or its
subsidiaries, affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners,
managers, members or stockholders for any obligations or liabilities of any
party hereto under this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or
by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or in respect
of any oral representations made or alleged to have been made in connection
herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any
way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the
financings contemplated thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Debt Financing Sources are intended third-party beneficiaries
of, may enforce, and shall be entitled to the protections of this _Section_ __
_ 8.8_.

judgment of a court of competent

 



52  jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this Agreement is
invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit such term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases or to replace such term or provision with a term or
provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing
the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this

court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the
