Common Stockholder List in exchange for the portion of the Aggregate Base

Common Merger Consideration payable to such stockholder at the Effective Time
in accordance with Section 1.6(a) hereof and for the portion of the Aggregate
Additional Common Merger Consideration, if any, payable to such holders
pursuant to the Note Holder Payoff and Recapitalization Agreement. Upon
compliance by an owner of Company Common Stock with the instructions so
provided, the Exchange Agent shall issue to such owner in exchange for the
shares of Company Stock so surrendered a check in the amount of the portion of
the Aggregate Base Common Merger Consideration such owner is entitled to
receive at the Effective Time. The shares of Company Common Stock so
surrendered by such owner shall forthwith be canceled. From and after the
Effective Time and until so surrendered, outstanding certificates of Company
Common Stock will be deemed to evidence only the right to receive the
applicable portion of the Aggregate Common Merger Consideration attributable
to the shares of Company Common Stock evidenced by such certificates, subject
to the provisions of Section 1.13 with respect to Dissenting Shares. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, the portion of the
Aggregate Common Merger Consideration attributable to such shares may be
issued to the transferee thereof if the certificate evidencing such Company
Common Stock is presented to Parent or the Exchange Agent accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.

  



  

1.8 _Dividends Declared After the Effective Time_. Dividends and other
distributions declared after the Effective Time on Parent Common Stock to be
issued hereunder shall be paid to each Person receiving shares of Parent
Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement or the Note Holder Payoff and
Recapitalization Agreement; provided, however, that no such dividends or other
distributions so declared shall be paid to any holder of Company Preferred
Stock until the certificate(s) evidencing such holders shares of Company
Preferred Stock are surrendered for exchange as provided herein. Subject to
the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such shares, there
shall be paid to such holder, without interest, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
payable with respect to the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
issued to such holder, less the amount of any withholding taxes which may be
required thereon.

  



  

1.9 _Transfers of Company Stock_. From and after the Effective Time,
there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the
shares of Company Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, certificates evidencing shares
of Company Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be
canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement in accordance with the procedures set forth
in this Article I.

  



  

1.10 _Unclaimed Merger Consideration_. Subject to Section 1.13, any
portion of the Merger Consideration that remains unclaimed by the former
stockholders of the Company one year after the Effective Time shall be
returned to Parent. None of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation,
the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of
shares of Company Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

  



  

12

  



     

1.11 _Lost or Stolen Certificates_. In the event any certificate
evidencing Company Stock shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit with respect thereto by the person claiming such
certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent will deliver
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate the Merger
Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement;
provided, however, that, as a condition precedent to the delivery of such
Merger Consideration, the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates
shall indemnify Parent against any claim that may be made against Parent or
the Surviving Corporation with respect to the certificates alleged to have
been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  



  

1.12 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after
the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the officers and
directors of the Company and Merger Sub will take all such lawful and
necessary action.

  



  

1.13 _Dissenter s Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, any shares of Company Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not consented to the
Merger and who has delivered a written demand for appraisal of such shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (each, a "Dissenting Stockholder")
shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
attributable to such shares unless and until such holder fails to perfect or
effectively withdraws or otherwise loses such holders right to appraisal
under the DGCL. A Dissenting Stockholder may receive payment of the fair value
of the shares of Company Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by such Dissenting Stockholder ("Dissenting Shares")
in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL, provided such Dissenting
Stockholder complies with the applicable provisions of the DGCL. At the
Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall be canceled and cease to exist and
shall represent only the right to receive the fair value thereof in accordance
with the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any Dissenting Stockholder fails
to perfect or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses such Dissenting
Stockholders right to appraisal, such Dissenting Stockholders Dissenting
Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted, as of the
Effective Time, into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
attributable to such shares. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice
of any written demands for appraisal, withdrawals of demands for appraisal and
any other instruments served under the DGCL, and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in and direct all negotiations, proceedings or settlements with
respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal and
shall not, except with Parents prior written consent, settle or offer to
settle any such demands.

  



  

1.14 _Appointment of Representative_. By virtue of the approval of this
Agreement by the holders of Company Stock, and with respect to certain Note
Holders pursuant to the terms of the Note Holder Payoff and Recapitalization
Agreement, each such holder shall be deemed to have (i) approved the
appointment of FS Private Investments III LLC (the "Representative") as the
"Representative" under the Escrow Agreement, the Note Holder Payoff and
Recapitalization Agreement, the Representative Agreement and this Agreement,
(ii) appointed the Representative

  



  

13

  



     

as agent and attorney-in-fact for and on behalf of each such holder with
respect to all matters arising under the Note Holder Payoff and
Recapitalization Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Representative Agreement
and this Agreement, and (iii) approved and agreed to be bound by the other
terms and conditions of the Representative Agreement. The Representative shall
have full power and authority to represent such holders and their successors
with respect to all matters arising under the Escrow Agreement, the Note
Holder Payoff and Recapitalization Agreement, the Representative Agreement and
this Agreement, and all actions taken by the Representative under such
agreements shall be binding upon all such holders and their successors as if
expressly confirmed and ratified in writing by each of them, including,
without limitation, resolving all claims relating to the Escrow Fund and any
indemnification claims and obligations.

  



  

1.15 _Restricted Securities_. All shares of Parent Common Stock and all
Warrants issued pursuant to this Agreement, and all shares of Parent Common
Stock issued pursuant to the exercise of Warrants, will be "restricted
securities" as defined in Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") and all certificates representing such
shares and Warrants shall bear an appropriate legend evidencing such
restrictions with respect to the resale thereof and any other legends required
by applicable law.

2.4 _Authority Relative to this Agreement_. Subject to obtaining the
requisite approval of the Companys stockholders, the Company has all
necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party and to perform its
obligations hereunder and thereunder and consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents to which the Company is a party and the
performance of the transactions contemplated herein or therein by the Company
have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the
part of the Company, subject only to obtaining the Company Stockholder Consent
(as hereinafter defined) and the filing and recordation of the Certificate of
Merger as required by the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the duly constituted board of directors of the Company (the

interests of the Company and its stockholders; (ii) approved this Agreement in
accordance with the provisions of the DGCL and the Company Charter Documents,
(iii) approved the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iv)
directed that this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, the Merger, be submitted
to the stockholders of the Company for their approval; and (v) resolved to
recommend that the stockholders of the Company vote in favor of the approval
of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby. The only approval of the Companys stockholders required to adopt

separately as a single class or series, and the approval by the holders of not
less than a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Preferred Stock and

contemplated by this Agreement or Note Holder Payoff and Recapitalization
Agreement (collectively, the "Company Stockholder Consent"), all in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the DGCL and the

  



  

17

  



     

Company Charter Documents, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of
the Company or its stockholders are necessary to authorize the execution and
delivery by the Company of this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents
to which it is a party or to the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, other than the filing of the
Certificate of Merger. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed by
the Company, and assuming (x) the Company Stockholder Consent is obtained, (y)
the execution and delivery by the Company of the other Transaction Documents
to which it is a party, and (z) this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents to which it is a party constitute valid and legally binding
obligations of each of Parent and Merger Sub, this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents to which the Company is a party constitute the valid and
legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company
in accordance with their respective terms, except to the extent the
enforcement hereof and thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other similar
laws relating to creditors rights generally, and to general principles of
equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding at
law or in equity).

performing its obligations under this Agreement or under the other
Transaction Documents to which it is a party, or (iii) for such consents,

Value"), being more than $2,000,000 less than the PV-10 Value attributed to
such well in the Recent Reserve Report. Nothing in this Section 2.33 shall
constitute a representation or warranty regarding title to any Mineral
Property, including any representation or warranty to any working interest or
net revenue interest of the Company in any lease, well or unit comprising the

3.4 _Authority Relative to this Agreement_. Each of Parent and Merger
Sub has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party and,
subject to obtaining the Merger Sub Stockholder Consent and the Parent
Stockholder Consent (both as hereinafter defined), to perform its obligations
hereunder and thereunder and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents to which each of Parent and Merger Sub is a party and
the performance of the transactions contemplated herein and therein by each of
Parent and Merger Sub have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of Parent and Merger Sub, subject only to
obtaining the Merger Sub Stockholder Consent and the Parent Stockholder
Consent, and the filing and recordation of the Certificate of Merger as
required by the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
duly constituted board of directors of Parent (the "Parent Board"), at a
meeting duly called and held, by the unanimous vote of all directors: (i)
determined that the Merger is fair to and in the best interests of Merger Sub,
Parent and Parents stockholders; (ii) approved this Agreement in accordance
with the provisions of the DGCL and the Merger Sub and Parent Charter
Documents; (iii) approved the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (iv) directed that this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, the Merger,
be submitted to the stockholders of Parent for their approval; and (v)
resolved to recommend that the stockholders of Parent vote in favor of the
approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. The only approval of Merger Subs stockholders required
to approve and adopt this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
is the approval by the Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub ("Merger
Sub Stockholder Consent"). The only approval of

  



  

42

  



     

Parents stockholders required to approve and adopt this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the issuance of shares of Parent
Common Stock and Warrants hereunder) is the approval by the holders of Parent
Common Stock representing a majority of the outstanding shares of Parent
Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL, the rules and
regulations of Nasdaq and Parents Charter Documents (the "Parent Stockholder
Consent"), and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or its
stockholders are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery by Parent
of this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents to which Parent is party or
the consummation by Parent of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, other than the filing of the Certificate of Merger. This Agreement
has been duly and validly executed by Parent and Merger Sub and assuming (w)
the Parent Stockholder Consent is obtained, (x) the Merger Sub Stockholder
Consent is obtained, (y) the execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub
of the other Transaction Documents to which each is a party, and (z) this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party
constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company and the other
parties thereto (other than Parent and Merger Sub), this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents to which each of Parent and Merger Sub is a party
constitute the valid and legally binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub,
enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with their respective
terms, except to the extent the enforcement hereof and thereof may be limited
by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent
conveyance or other similar laws relating to creditors rights generally, and
to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is
considered in a proceeding at law or in equity).

party under, or give to others any rights of termination,

INDEBTEDNESS; ADJUSTMENTS; CASUALTY LOSS

  



   

       



  |  

5.1

  |  

_Outstanding Indebtedness_. 

---|---|--- 
 

  



  

(a) Except with respect to (i) that portion, if any, of the Indebtedness
owing under the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Senior Notes that will be
paid in shares of Parent Common Stock and Warrants pursuant to and in
accordance with the terms of the Note Holder Payoff and Recapitalization
Agreement, and (ii) that portion of the Indebtedness owing under or with
respect to Company Preferred Stock that will be discharged by the delivery of
Parent Common Stock and Warrants pursuant to and in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and the Note Holder Payoff and Recapitalization Agreement,
all Indebtedness of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that remains
outstanding immediately prior to the Closing will be paid by Parent in cash at
the Closing; provided, however, that the sum of all such Indebtedness paid by
Parent in cash at the Closing shall in no event exceed the positive
difference between the Adjusted Cash Number and the sum of (A) the Aggregate
Base Common Merger Consideration, (B) the amount of the Escrow Fund, (C) the
amount of the Representative Fund, and (D) if applicable, the Aggregate
Minimum Preferred Merger Consideration.

  



  

(b) The term "Indebtedness" shall mean (i) indebtedness for borrowed
money, including principal, interest, fees, prepayment premiums and other
obligations in respect thereof, but excluding purchase money indebtedness
secured by vehicles and equipment owned or leased by the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries, (ii) other indebtedness evidenced by bonds, debentures,
notes or similar instruments, including principal, interest, fees, prepayment
premiums and other obligations in respect thereof, (iii) obligations for the
payment of dividends on or other payments with respect to Company Stock or
other equity securities of the Company, whether matured or unmatured,
contingent or conditional, and (iv) any amounts payable by the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries at or by reason of or in connection with the Closing,
including fees and expenses of counsel and other advisors to the Company and
obligations to employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries under the
Plans (other than amounts payable pursuant to any employment agreement set
forth in Schedule 2.19(b) that will not be terminated at Closing).

  



  

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, Indebtedness shall not include (i) any
cash collateral or credit requirements with respect to any Hydrocarbon Hedge
Contracts that,

  



  

55

  



     

at Parents sole discretion, will remain in existence after the Closing, (ii)
any cash collateral or credit requirements under any outstanding letters of
credit issued to secure Company obligations, to the extent such letters of
credit will, at Parents sole discretion, remain in effect after the Closing,
(iii) any amounts that are reflected as Current Liabilities on the Closing
Date Balance Sheet and taken into account in determining the Working Capital
Adjustment, or (iv) any amounts that would be required to be paid to close
out, settle and relieve the Company and the Company Subsidiaries from their
obligations under any Hydrocarbon Hedge Contract.

  



  

5.2 _Working Capital Adjustment_. Not less than five (5) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall furnish to Parent (i) the
unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company (the "Prior Month Balance
Sheet") as of the last day of the most recent calendar month ending more than
twenty-five (25) days prior to the Closing Date, (ii) a certification by the
chief financial officer of the Company (the "Company CFO") to the effect that,
to the best of such certifying officers actual knowledge or awareness, the
Prior Month Balance Sheet has been prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied
on a consistent basis with prior periods, subject only to the same
qualifications as the Company Recent Financial Statements, and (iii) a
projected consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing Date,
which shall be prepared from the Prior Month Balance Sheet, taking into
account those changes in the amount of each item of Current Assets and Current
Liabilities shown on the Prior Month Balance Sheet, and any new items of
Current Assets or Current Liabilities, as deemed reasonably necessary by the
Company CFO to reflect (A) transactions occurring since the date of the Prior
Month Balance Sheet and reasonably expected to occur at or prior to Closing,
(B) other items of Current Assets and Current Liabilities reflected in
Schedule 5.2, and (C) any obligation required by Section 6.7(d) to be treated
as a Current Liability without regard to the term over which such obligations
are payable (the "Projected Closing Date Balance Sheet"). Attached as Schedule
5.2 is an agreed template of the spreadsheet that will be used by the Company
CFO in preparing the Projected Closing Date Balance Sheet and the adjustments
thereto necessary to determine the Estimated Adjusted Working Capital of the
Company at and as of the Closing Date. The attached spreadsheet has been
completed, using June 30, 2007 as the date of the Prior Month Balance Sheet
and September 12, 2007 as the Closing Date, solely for purposes of example.
Parent shall have two (2) Business Days after receipt of the above described
information to review and comment on the Projected Closing Date Balance Sheet
and the proposed adjustments thereto necessary to calculate the Estimated
Adjusted Working Capital of the Company at and as of the Closing Date, and the
parties shall work together in good faith during such period to ensure that
such balance sheet reflects a fair projection of the consolidated financial
condition of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date
determined in accordance with this Section 5.2 and that the adjustments
proposed are consistent with the parameters set out in Schedule 5.2. At such
time as the Projected Closing Date Balance Sheet has been reviewed by both
parties and any agreed changes are made, the Company CFO shall designate the
amended (if applicable) Projected Closing Date Balance Sheet as the "Closing
Date Balance Sheet." At the Closing, the Initial Cash Number will be adjusted
upward by the amount of the positive, or downward by the amount of the
negative, Estimated Adjusted Working Capital of the Company as at the Closing
Date (the "Working Capital Adjustment"). The term "Estimated Adjusted Working
Capital" shall mean the sum of (y) the sum of the Current Assets less the sum
of the Current Liabilities reflected on the Closing Date Balance Sheet,
subject to the adjustments

  



  

56

  



     

described in Schedule 5.2, and (z) the amount of Approved Capital Expenditures
reflected on the Closing Date Balance Sheet (with the unpaid amount, if any,
of such Approved Capital Expenditure to be included as a current liability on
the Closing Date Balance Sheet). The Prior Month Balance Sheet, the Projected
Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Balance Sheet shall each be
prepared in the same manner and in accordance with this Section 5.2, including
the adjustments set forth in Schedule 5.2, and utilizing the same standards as
the balance sheet included in the Company Recent Financial Statements (other
than review by the Companys independent auditors). For purposes of this
Agreement, the terms "Current Assets" and "Current Liabilities" mean the
current assets and current liabilities, respectively, reasonably described by
the subheadings under each such term in Schedule 5.2.

  



  

5.3 _Hydrocarbon Hedge Contracts Adjustment_. All Hedge Contracts
relating to crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids or any other
hydrocarbons (for example, swaps, floors, collars, puts, calls and other
options), or relating to the sale, pricing or marketing thereof (for example,
basis swaps and similar instruments), to which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is a party or by which any of the Mineral Properties are bound
(collectively, "Hydrocarbon Hedge Contracts") are described in Schedule
2.19(b).

  



  

(a) Parent and the Company have agreed that the aggregate net dollar
amount that would be required to be paid by the Company to close out, settle
and relieve the Company from all obligations under all Hydrocarbon Hedge
Contracts as of the date of this Agreement is $22,000,000 (the "Execution Date
Hedge Liability").

  



  

(b) As used herein, the term (i) "Settlement Cost" means the amount that
would be required to be paid by the Company to close out, settle and relieve
the Company from all obligations under a Hydrocarbon Hedge Contract under
which the Company has an unrealized mark-to-market loss, and (ii) "Settlement
Benefit" means the amount that the Company would be entitled to receive upon
the close out and settlement of a Hydrocarbon Hedge Contract under which the
Company has an unrealized mark-to-market gain. On the third Business Day
preceding the Closing Date, the Company will obtain and furnish to Parent a
written statement from the counterparty to each Hydrocarbon Hedge Contract
then outstanding stating the Settlement Cost or the Settlement Benefit under
such Hydrocarbon Hedge Contract as of the close of business on the fourth
Business Day preceding the Closing Date. The Company may propose to Parent an
alternative means of determining Settlement Cost or Settlement Benefit, and if
in the reasonable judgment of Parent exercised in good faith, such alternative
means is feasible and may be executed within the same time frame, and achieves
exactly the same economic result with no residual exposure or liability to the
Company, as settlement through the Hydrocarbon Hedge Contract counterparties,
the alternative means proposed by the Company will be utilized for determining
Settlement Cost or Settlement Benefit. In the event the sum of the Settlement
Costs exceeds the sum of the Settlement Benefits for all of the Hydrocarbon
Hedge Contracts outstanding as of the close of business on the fourth Business
Day preceding the Closing Date, the amount of the excess shall constitute the
"Closing Date Hedge Liability." In the event the sum of the Settlement
Benefits exceeds the sum of the Settlement Costs for all of the Hydrocarbon
Hedge Contracts

  



  

57

  



     

outstanding as of the close of business on the fourth Business Day preceding
the Closing Date, the amount of the excess shall constitute the "Closing Date
Hedge Asset."

  



  

(c) In the event the Execution Date Hedge Liability exceeds the Closing
Date Hedge Liability, then the Initial Cash Number and the Initial Parent
Common Stock Number shall be adjusted downward at the Closing in accordance
with Section 5.3(g) by the amount of the Closing Date Hedge Liability.

  



  

(d) In the event the Closing Date Hedge Liability exceeds the Execution
Date Hedge Liability, then the Initial Cash Number and the Initial Parent
Common Stock Number shall be adjusted downward at the Closing in accordance
with Section 5.3(g) by an amount equal to the sum of (A) the Execution Date
Hedge Liability, and (B) twenty-five percent (25%) of the difference between
the Execution Date Hedge Liability and the Closing Date Hedge Liability.

  



  

(e) In the event there is a Closing Date Hedge Asset, then the Initial
Cash Number shall be adjusted upward at the Closing by the amount of the
Closing Date Hedge Asset.

  



  

(f) In no event shall the Company close out or settle any of the
Hydrocarbon Hedge Contracts (other than current month contracts settled on
schedule and in the ordinary course) after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the Closing, except with the prior written consent of Parent.

  



  

(g) The adjustment to the Initial Cash Number and the Initial Parent
Common Stock Number described in (c) or (d) above (in the event there is a
Closing Date Hedge Liability), or the adjustment to the Initial Cash Number
described at (e) above (in the event there is a Closing Date Hedge Asset),
whichever is applicable, is referred to herein as the "Hedge Contract
Adjustment." In the event there is a Closing Date Hedge Liability, the Hedge
Contract Adjustment shall be a cash-based adjustment which shall be applied
pro-rata based on the Initial Cash Number of $185,000,000, an assumed Initial
Parent Common Stock Number of 20,000,000 shares and an assumed Parent Stock
Price of $5.35 per share, resulting in an assumed total value of $107,000,000
attributable to the Initial Parent Common Stock Number of Parent Common
Stock shares. Accordingly, in such event the Hedge Contract Adjustment will
be applied 63.36% to the Initial Cash Number and 36.64% to the Initial Parent
Common Stock Number, with shares of Parent Common Stock conclusively valued at
$5.35 per share for purposes of such calculation. For example, if the Hedge
Contract Adjustment is determined to be a downward adjustment of $10,000,000,
then the Initial Cash Number would be adjusted downward by 63.36% of such
amount, or $6,336,000, and the Initial Parent Common Stock Number would be
adjusted downward by 36.64% of $10,000,000 ($3,664,000), divided by $5.35 per
share, or 684,860 shares.

  



  

5.4 _Tax Burden Adjustment_. The Initial Cash Number shall be adjusted
downward at Closing by the sum of $30,000 to compensate Parent for the
allocation of current income tax liability with respect to earnings on the
Escrow Fund.

  



  

58

  



     

5.5 _Casualty Loss_. Except as otherwise hereinafter provided in this
Section 5.5, the parties obligation to proceed with the Closing shall not be
excused and no adjustment to the Merger Consideration shall be required if,
after the execution of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, any
Property is damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty or is taken under
the right of eminent domain. The Company shall not voluntarily compromise,
settle or adjust any claims, causes of action or demands against third
parties, arising out of such damage, destruction or taking, or commit, use or
apply any insurance proceeds or payments toward the repair, restoration or
replacement of the affected property without the prior written consent of
Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). In the
event Properties are damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty or are
taken under the right of eminent domain and as a result thereof the value of
all of the Properties is, in Parents good faith judgment, reduced by an
amount exceeding $25,000,000 (net of insurance proceeds), then either the
Company or Parent may terminate this Agreement in its entirety without
liability to either party.

_Confidentiality; Access_. 

---|---|--- 
 

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of the Confidentiality Agreement to
the contrary, the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and
effect until the Closing, and in the event the Closing does not occur, then
for the stated term specified in

  



  

59

  



     

the Confidentiality Agreement (without regard to any provision thereof
regarding earlier termination).

  



  

(b) Subject to obtaining any required consents of third parties,
including third party operators of the Properties (with respect to which
consents the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain), the
Company will afford Parent and its financial advisors, accountants, counsel
and other representatives, at Parents sole expense, reasonable access during
normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to the properties, books,
records and personnel of the Company during the period prior to the Closing to
obtain all information concerning the business, properties, results of
operations and personnel of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as Parent
may reasonably request. No information or Knowledge obtained by Parent in any
investigation pursuant to this Section 6.2(b) will affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty contained herein or the conditions to
the obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger.

  



  

(i) Parent may make or cause to be made at its expense such examination
as it may desire of the title of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to
the Properties. For purposes of Parents examination of title to the
Properties, the Company shall (i) give to Parent and to the employees,
consultants, independent contractors, attorneys and other advisers of Parent
reasonable access at any reasonable time to all of the files, records,
contracts, correspondence, computer output and data files, maps, reports,
plats, abstracts of title, lease files, well files, unit files, division order

production therefrom, and (ii) authorize Parent and its representatives to
consult with attorneys, abstract companies and other consultants or
independent contractors of the Company, whether utilized in the past or

(ii) Insofar as the Company has the power and authority to grant such
right, prior to the Closing Parent and its employees, agents and contractors
shall have the right, at the sole risk and expense of Parent, but with the
cooperation and assistance of the Company, to: (i) enter all or any portion of
the Properties to inspect, inventory, test, investigate, study and examine the
Properties to verify the accuracy of the representations made in Section 2.16;
(ii) conduct air, water or soil tests on the Properties and make such samples
and borings and analysis as Parent may consider necessary or appropriate for
such purposes; (iii) conduct such other independent inspections, tests,
investigations, studies or examinations as may be necessary or appropriate for
the preparation of health, safety, environmental or other reports
or assessments relating to the operation, use, maintenance, condition or
status of the Properties, and their compliance with all applicable Legal
Requirements; and (iv) conduct an independent assessment of the extent of any
possible existing or contingent liabilities due or related to the

  



  

60

  



     

operation, use, maintenance, condition or status of the Properties.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary pursuant to this Section 6.2(b),
Parent shall not undertake any Phase II invasive sampling or destructive
testing without the prior approval of the Company, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed insofar as the Company has the power and
authority to grant such right. Parent agrees that the Company may establish
reasonable limitations on Parents activities pursuant to this Section 6.2(b)
to the extent the Company determines that such limitations are reasonably
necessary to protect the Properties, the Companys operations or interests of
third parties in the Properties with respect to operations conducted thereon.
Parent shall provide the Company with a copy of all third-party reports
relating to environmental inspections, testing and reviews.

  



  

(c) Subject to obtaining any required consents of third parties,
including third party operators of Properties owned by Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries (with respect to which consents Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain), Parent will afford the Company and its
financial advisors, accountants, counsel and other representatives, at the
Companys sole expense, reasonable access during normal business hours, upon
reasonable notice, to the properties, books, records and personnel of Parent
during the period prior to the Closing to obtain all information concerning
the business, properties, results of operations and personnel of Parent, as
the Company may reasonably request. No information or Knowledge obtained by
the Company in any investigation pursuant to this Section 6.2(c) will affect
or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained herein or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger.

  



  

(d) Access to each partys properties, books, records and personnel
shall be subject to the following conditions: (i) the party granted such
access (the "Accessing Party") waives and releases all claims against each of
the other parties hereto and its shareholders, members, partners, directors,
officers, employees, agents and contractors, for injury to or death of persons
or damage to property arising in any way from the exercise of rights granted
to the Accessing Party pursuant to this Section 6.2 or the activities of such
Accessing Party or its financial advisors, accountants, counsel or
representatives on such properties, provided that such Accessing Party does
not hereby assume the risk of damage, injury or death attributable to the
willful misconduct or gross negligence of any of the other parties or their
employees, agents or contractors; and (ii) the Accessing Party shall indemnify
each of the other parties and its shareholders, directors, officers,

indemnitees harmless from and against any and all Losses whatsoever arising
out of (A) any and all statutory or common law liens or other encumbrances for

6.3 _Public Statements/Disclosure_. From the date of this Agreement
until Closing or termination, the parties shall consult with each other prior
to issuing any press release or any written public statement with respect to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall work together
in good faith to reach agreement on the contents of any such press release or
other written public statement, except that any party may make any disclosure
as may be required by applicable law or any listing agreement with a national
securities exchange if it determines in good faith that it is required to do
so and, with respect to such disclosure, provides the other parties with prior
notice and a reasonable opportunity to review the disclosure.

  



  

6.4 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of Parent and the Company
will provide the other with prompt written notice upon any officer of such
party obtaining Knowledge of any event, development or condition that: (i)
would cause any of such partys representations and warranties to become
untrue or misleading or which may affect its ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) had it existed or been known
on the date hereof would have been required to be disclosed under this
Agreement; (iii) gives such party any reason to believe that any of the
conditions set forth in Article VII will not be satisfied; (iv) is of a nature
that is or may be materially adverse to the operations, prospects or condition
(financial or otherwise) of Parent or the Company; or (v) would require any
amendment or supplement to the Information Statement. The parties shall have
the obligation to periodically supplement or amend the Company Disclosure
Schedule and Parent Disclosure Schedules (the "Disclosure Schedules") with
respect to any matter hereafter arising or discovered of which any such party
has Knowledge which, if existing or known at the date of this Agreement, would
have been required to be set forth or described in the Disclosure Schedules.
The obligations of the parties to amend or supplement the Disclosure Schedules
shall terminate on the Closing Date. Notwithstanding any such amendment or
supplementation, for purposes of Sections 7.2(a), 7.3(a), 8.3, 8.4 and 10.2,
the representations and warranties of the parties shall be made with reference
to the Disclosure Schedules as they exist at the time of execution of this
Agreement. Each of the Company and Parent agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to remedy (y) the occurrence or failure to occur of any
event of which any officer of such party has Knowledge, which occurrence or
failure to occur would reasonably be expected to cause any of the
representations or warranties of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, in
this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at the
Effective Time, and (z) any material failure on the part of the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, agreement
or condition to be complied with or satisfied thereby hereunder; provided,
however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.4 shall
not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party
receiving such notice.

_Information Statement_. 

---|---|--- 
 

  



  

(a) As soon as is reasonably practicable after receipt by Parent from
the Company of all financial and other information relating to the Company as
Parent may reasonably request for its preparation, Parent shall prepare and
file with the SEC the information statement required by Regulation 14C
promulgated under the Exchange Act (the "Information Statement"). The Company
shall furnish to Parent all information concerning the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as Parent may reasonably request in connection with the
preparation of the Information Statement.

  



  

62

  



     

(b) Parent shall comply with all applicable provisions of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and all applicable
provisions of the DGCL, in the preparation, filing and distribution of the
Information Statement. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall ensure
that the Information Statement does not, as of the date on which it is
distributed to the holders of Parent Common Stock, and as of the Effective
Date, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (provided that Parent
shall not be responsible for the accuracy or completeness of any information
relating to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or any other information
furnished by the Company for inclusion in the Information Statement).

  



  

6.6 _Directors and Officers; Observation Rights_. At and as a condition
to Closing, all of the officers and directors of the Company and each Company
Subsidiary shall tender their resignations from such positions; provided,
however, that the officers of the Company who are Continuing Employees shall
not be required to resign as officers of the Company. The Representative may,
by written notice to Parent, designate a Person (the "Observer") to attend, as
an observer, any and all meetings of the Parent Board during the period prior
to the time more than fifty percent (50%) of the shares of Parent Common Stock
issued to the Jefferies Investors pursuant to this Agreement and the Note
Holder Payoff and Recapitalization Agreement are resold (excluding transfers
to Affiliates) in one or more private transactions, pursuant to Rule 144
promulgated under the Securities Act or distributed to the public by means of
a public offering as described in Section 6.9. During such period, the
Observer shall be given notice of all meetings of the Parent Board in the same
manner and at the same time as notice thereof is given to the members of the
Parent Board and, if requested by the Observer, shall be provided with copies
of all materials that are provided to the members of the Parent Board.

6.7

_Employees; Severance Obligations_. 

---|---|--- 
 

  



  

(a) The Company has heretofore furnished to Parent a listing of all
current employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, including each
employees (i) name, (ii) title, position or job description, (iii) current
salary or hourly rate, (iv) the location where such employee generally
performs services for the Company, and (v) the date such employee was employed
by the Company (collectively, the "Eligible Employees"). Parent shall have the
right to contact the Eligible Employees to discuss their continued employment
following the Closing. As soon as reasonably practicable following the
execution of this Agreement, but in no event less than five (5) days prior to
the Closing, Parent shall notify the Company of each Eligible Employee whose
employment with the Company (or with Parent or a Parent Subsidiary) will be
continued beyond the Closing (each a "Continuing Employee").

  



  

(b) For a period of at least one year beginning on the Closing Date,
Parent shall cause each Continuing Employee: (i) to continue in the employ of
the Company or by Parent or a Parent Subsidiary in essentially the same
position with similar job responsibilities as such employees current position
with the Company (subject to such

  



  

63

  



     

employees desire to continue in such position during such period and the
satisfactory performance by such employee of his/her assigned duties, to the
same extent required of Parents and Parents Subsidiaries similarly situated
employees); (ii) to receive salary of not less than such Continuing Employees
current salary from the Company; and (iii) to receive the same benefits
(including annual bonuses) on substantially the same basis as that provided by
Parent and Parents Subsidiaries to its similarly situated employees.

  



  

(c) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
employee benefit plans and programs maintained by Parent and its subsidiaries
after the Closing to recognize each Continuing Employees years of service and
level of seniority with the Company for purposes of term of employment and
eligibility, vesting, benefit accrual, retirement eligibility, and benefit
determination under such plans and programs, including paid vacation, paid
sick time, severance benefits and employer contribution rates under retirement
plans. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each employee
welfare benefit plan or program sponsored by Parent and its subsidiaries that
a Continuing Employee may be eligible to participate in on or after the
Closing Date to waive any preexisting condition exclusion or any proof
of insurability requirement with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee or such employees
dependents.

  



  

(d) All severance and other obligations of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to its employees, officers, directors, consultants or agents
arising prior to or resulting from their resignation or the termination of
their employment or engagement prior to or in connection with the Closing,
together with any payments due upon change of control, will be borne and paid
by the Company prior to or contemporaneously with the Closing, or shall be
treated as Indebtedness and paid by Parent at the Closing, or to the extent
payable after the Closing, shall be treated as a current liability of the
Company (regardless of the term over which such obligations are payable) and
taken into account in determining the Estimated Adjusted Working Capital and
the Final Adjusted Working Capital. All obligations of the Company under
the employment agreements described in Schedule 2.19(b) with Continuing
Employees shall be the obligations of the Surviving Corporation, except to the
extent such obligations relate to acts, occurrences or omissions prior to the
Closing. The aggregate amount of the retention bonuses that will be due and
payable to Continuing Employees on June 30, 2008, under the Companys
Retention Bonus Plan will be treated as a Current Liability for purposes of
determining the Estimated Adjusted Working Capital under Section 5.2 and the
Final Adjusted Working Capital under Section 9.1; provided, however, that with
respect to those Continuing Employees, if any, whose employment with the
Company or a Company Subsidiary terminates prior to June 30, 2008 in such a
manner that the retention bonus that otherwise would be payable to such
employees is not payable pursuant to the terms of the Companys Retention
Bonus Plan, then on July 15, 2008, Parent shall deliver to the Representative,
as an addition to the Representative Fund, the amount of the unpaid retention
bonus attributable to each such employee and included as a Current Liability
for purposes of the applicable working capital determinations.

6.8 _Voting Agreement_. The Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause each Company Affiliate listed in Schedule 6.8 and each Note
Holder to enter into a voting agreement at the Closing in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit E (the "Voting Agreement").

  



  

6.9 _Registration Rights_. Parent shall, within ninety (90) days after
the Closing Date, prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on
Form S-3 (or other applicable form) for the resale of all Parent Common Stock
and Warrants issued in the Merger or pursuant to the Note Holder Payoff and
Recapitalization Agreement, and all Parent Common Stock to be issued upon
exercise of the Warrants. At the Closing, Parent will execute and deliver a
registration rights agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F (the
"Registration Rights Agreement").

  



  

6.10 _Lock-Up_. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause each Company Affiliate so designated in Schedule 6.10 and each Note
Holder to execute and deliver to Parent, at or prior to the Closing, a Lock-Up
Letter (the "Lock-Up Letter") in the form attached hereto as Exhibit G. The
certificates evidencing shares of Parent Common Stock received by such Company
Affiliates and Note Holders in the Merger shall bear a legend reflecting such
restrictions.

director, officer, manager, general partner or employee of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary at any time prior to the Effective Time (the "DandO
Indemnified Persons"), whether in their respective Charter Documents or in any
indemnification agreements or under applicable law, shall survive the Merger

shall be observed by the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to the
fullest extent permitted by law.

  



  

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall
maintain, or cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain, in effect the
current policies of directors and officers liability and fiduciary liability
insurance covering each DandO Indemnified Person maintained by the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries (or policies of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous) with
respect to claims arising from facts and events that occurred prior to the
Closing Date.

  



  

(c) If Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with
or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each
such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.11.

  



  

(d) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not amend, repeal or
otherwise modify the Charter Documents of the Surviving Corporation or its
subsidiaries or manage

  



  

65

  



     

the Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights hereunder or thereunder of the DandO Indemnified
Persons. The provisions of this Section 6.11 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Person who will have been a
director or officer of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for all
periods ending on or before the Closing Date and may not be changed without
the consent of the Representative.

provision made for the payment of those SLPH stockholders who cannot be
located) not less than five (5) days prior to the Closing.

the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement

Certifying Holder any holder who furnishes a Non-Foreign Affidavit which
Parent knows or reasonably believes, based upon receipt of notice pursuant to

POST-CLOSING WORKING CAPITAL RECONCILIATION

  



   

       



  |  

9.1

  |  

_Working Capital Reconciliation_. 

---|---|--- 
 

  



  

(a) Not later than the day that is seventy-five (75) days after the
Closing Date, Parent shall furnish to the Representative (i) a draft of the
unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company as at the Closing Date
(the "Proposed True-Up Balance Sheet"), together with (ii) a proposed
calculation of the Final Adjusted Working Capital. The term "Final Adjusted
Working Capital" shall mean the sum of (y) the Current Assets less Current
Liabilities of the Company at the Closing Date, and (z) the amount of Approved
Capital Expenditures as of the Closing Date (with the unpaid amount, if any,
of such Approved Capital Expenditures at the Closing Date to be included as a
current liability), in each case determined based on the best information
reasonably available for the determination thereof, calculated in the same
manner and adjusted by utilizing the same adjustments (that is, adjustments of
the same nature, not necessarily in the same amount) to Current Assets and
Current Liabilities, and taking into account Approved Capital Expenditures in
the same manner, as set out in Schedule 5.2 and used for the determination of
the Estimated Adjusted Working Capital at Closing. The Representative will
have a period of fifteen (15) days after receipt of the Proposed True-Up
Balance Sheet and the proposed calculation of the Final Adjusted Working
Capital (the "W/C Review Period") to review and comment on same. During the
W/C Review Period, Parent shall provide such written support for its
calculations as the Representative reasonably may request and shall work
together in good faith with the Representative to agree upon any changes to
the Proposed True-Up Balance Sheet and the adjustments necessary to determine
the Final Adjusted Working Capital that reasonably may be required to
ensure that the final determination of Final Adjusted Working Capital is
based upon the best information reasonably available for the determination
thereof and calculated in the same manner and adjusted by using the same
adjustments (in nature but not necessarily amount) as set out in Section 5.2
and used to determine the Estimated Adjusted Working Capital. To the extent
requested by the Representative, any former officer or employee of the Company
who then is employed by or serving as a consultant to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective subsidiaries shall be made freely
available and encouraged to assist the Representative in the review of and
furnishing of comments on the Proposed True-Up Balance Sheet and the proposed
calculation of the Final Adjusted Working Capital furnished by Parent. In the
event the Representative does not provide Parent with a written notice of
objections to Parents determination of Final Adjusted Working Capital, as the
same may be amended in

  



  

75

  



     

writing during the W/C Review Period, prior to the expiration of the W/C
Review Period, then Parents proposed determination of the Final Adjusted
Working Capital, as last amended during the W/C Review Period with such
amendment furnished in writing to the Representative, shall become final and
not thereafter subject to review, reconsideration or audit, and shall be
deemed agreed to by the Representative.

  



  

(b) In the event Parent and the Representative agree or are deemed to
agree upon the determination of the Final Adjusted Working Capital, then (i)
if the Final Adjusted Working Capital is more favorable to the Company (that
is, a smaller negative working capital or a larger positive working capital)
than the Estimated Adjusted Working Capital, then Parent shall promptly
deliver to the Escrow Agent to be distributed pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement, an amount of cash equal to the difference between the
Estimated Adjusted Working Capital and the Final Adjusted Working Capital, or
(ii) if the Final Adjusted Working Capital is less favorable to the Company
(that is, a greater negative working capital or a smaller positive working
capital) than the Estimated Adjusted Working Capital, then Parent shall have
the immediate right to make a claim against the Escrow Fund in an amount
equal to the difference between the Final Adjusted Working Capital and the
Estimated Adjusted Working Capital.

  



  

(c) If (i) prior to the expiration of the W/C Review Period the
Representative furnishes Parent a written notice of objections to Parents
determination of Final Adjusted Working Capital, and (ii) within ten (10) days
after receipt by Parent of the Representatives written notice of objections
to Parents determination of Final Adjusted Working Capital, Parent and the
Representative are unable to agree on a determination of the Final Adjusted
Working Capital, then the matter of determining the Final Adjusted Working
Capital shall be determined by binding arbitration pursuant to an arbitration
proceeding initiated and conducted in accordance with the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). Either
party may initiate the arbitration proceeding by providing the other party a
notice of intent to arbitrate. The arbitration shall be limited to the
determination of the Final Adjusted Working Capital. The arbitration
proceeding shall be conducted in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, by a single
arbitrator agreed to by the parties, or if they are unable to agree, selected
by the AAA. The arbitrator shall be a certified public accountant ("CPA")
having not less than ten (10) years experience as a CPA, including experience
as an accountant or auditor in the oil and gas exploration and production
industry. Each party agrees to use its best efforts to facilitate submission
of the disputed matters to the arbitrator in time to obtain a final decision
of the arbitrator within sixty (60) days after submission of the matter to
arbitration. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final, conclusive and
binding on the parties and not subject to appeal or judicial review of any
nature. Each of Parent and the Representative shall bear and pay (y) all
of such partys own attorneys fees, witness fees and other expenses incurred
by such party in connection with the arbitration, and (z) one-half (1/2) of
the fees of the AAA and the fees and expenses of the arbitrator.

  



  

(d) Upon receipt by the parties of the final decision of the arbitrator
(i) if the Final Adjusted Working Capital as determined by the arbitrator is
more favorable to the Company (that is, a smaller negative working capital or
a larger positive working capital)

  



  

76

  



     

than the Estimated Adjusted Working Capital, then Parent shall promptly
deliver to the Escrow Agent to be distributed pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement, an amount of cash equal to the difference between the
Estimated Adjusted Working Capital and the Final Adjusted Working Capital, or
(ii) if the Final Adjusted Working Capital as determined by the arbitrator is
less favorable to the Company (that is, a greater negative working capital or
a smaller positive working capital) than the Estimated Adjusted Working
Capital, then Parent shall have the immediate right to make a claim against
the Escrow Fund in an amount equal to the difference between the Final
Adjusted Working Capital and the Estimated Adjusted Working Capital.

  



  

(e) Promptly after the determination of the Final Adjusted Working
Capital and either payment by Parent to the Escrow Agent or payment by the
Escrow Agent to Parent pursuant to Section 9.1(d), the amount of the Escrow
Fund shall be adjusted, if applicable, as provided by the terms of the Escrow
Agreement.

statute of limitations applicable to any claim with respect to such covenant
or agreement.

  



  

10.2 _Indemnification of Parent Indemnified Parties_. Parent and the
Surviving Corporation, and their respective officers, directors, employees,
consultants, stockholders and Affiliates (collectively, the "Parent
Indemnified Parties"), pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, shall be
indemnified out of and to the extent of the balance remaining from time to
time in the Escrow Fund, from and against any and all Losses which (i) any of
the Parent Indemnified Parties shall have actually sustained, or to which any
of the Parent Indemnified Parties shall have actually been subjected, relating
to or arising directly or indirectly out of any breach or default by the
Company of any of its representations or warranties contained in Article II
hereof or any of its covenants or agreements under this Agreement, (ii) the
Surviving Corporation or any Company Subsidiary shall have actually sustained,
or to which the Surviving Corporation or any Company Subsidiary shall have
actually been subjected, by reason of any claim asserted by any Note Holder or
any former holder of Company Preferred Stock, (iii) the Surviving Corporation

77

  



     

and conditions of this Article X, or (iv) subject to the limitations set out
in Section 10.9, the Surviving Corporation or any of the Company Subsidiaries
shall have actually sustained, or to which the Surviving Corporation of any of
the Company Subsidiaries shall have actually been subjected, arising out of or
relating to the pending litigation matters (the "Pending Litigation")
described in Schedule 2.10 as (A) _Forman Petroleum Corporation/Heirs of Lydia
Bergeron, et al., v. BP Amoco, et al.,_ No. 99-19530, on the docket of the
Civil District Court for the Parish of New Orleans in the State of Louisiana,

(including, without limitation, interest, penalties, court costs and
reasonable legal fees and expenses) including those arising from any demands,
claims, suits, actions, costs of investigation, notices of violation or
noncompliance, causes of action, proceedings and assessments whether or not
made by third parties or whether or not ultimately determined to be valid.
Solely for the purpose of determining the amount of any Losses (and not for
determining any breach) for which the Parent Indemnified Parties may be
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article X, any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement that is qualified by a term or terms such
as "material," "materially," or "Material Adverse Effect" shall be deemed made
or given without such qualification and without giving effect to such words.
Any Losses which any Parent Indemnified Party shall have actually sustained,
or to which any of the Parent Indemnified Parties shall have actually been
subjected, are referred to herein as "Indemnified Losses."

  



  

10.3 _Defense of Third-Party Claims_. A Parent Indemnified Party shall
give prompt written notice (a "Notice of Third-Party Claim") to the
Representative of the commencement or assertion of any action, proceeding,
demand or claim by a third party (each, a "Third-Party Action") in respect of
which such Parent Indemnified Party will seek indemnification hereunder. Each
such Notice of Third-Party Claim shall set forth (i) a brief description of
the nature of the Third-Party Action, (ii) the total amount of the actual out-
of-pocket Loss or the anticipated potential Loss (including any costs or
expenses which have been or may be reasonably incurred in connection
therewith), and (iii) whether such Loss may be covered (in whole or in part)
under any insurance and the estimated amount of such Loss which may be
covered under such insurance. Any failure to so notify the Representative
shall not preclude an Indemnified Party from making a claim under this Article
X, except to the extent the failure to give such notice materially and
adversely prejudices the Representative, or except as provided in Section
10.5(a). The Representative shall have the right to assume control of the
defense of, settle or otherwise dispose of such Third-Party Action on such
terms as the Representative deems appropriate, subject to the following:

  



  

(a) The Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled, at their own
expense, to participate in the defense of such Third-Party Action; provided,
however, that the reasonable attorneys fees of the Parent Indemnified Parties
shall constitute Losses if (i) the employment of separate counsel shall have
been authorized in writing by the Representative in connection with the
defense of such Third-Party Action, (ii) the Representative shall not, within
twenty (20) days after receipt of Notice of a Third-Party Claim, have promptly
employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Parent

  



  

78

  



     

Indemnified Parties to take charge of such Third-Party Action, or (iii) the
Parent Indemnified Parties counsel shall have advised the Parent Indemnified
Parties in writing, with a copy to the Representative, that there is a
conflict of interest that would make it inappropriate under applicable
standards of professional conduct to have common counsel or that there are
defenses available to the Parent Indemnified Parties that are not available to
the Representative; provided, however, that in the event the Parent
Indemnified Parties retain separate counsel pursuant to this Section 10.3(a),
Parents claim for Indemnified Losses with respect to the engagement of such
separate counsel shall be limited to the reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses charged by a single law firm.

  



  

(b) The Representative shall obtain the prior written approval of the
Parent Indemnified Parties (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) before
entering into or making any settlement, compromise, admission or
acknowledgment of the validity of such Third-Party Action or any liability in
respect thereof if (i) pursuant to or as a result of such settlement,
compromise, admission or acknowledgment, injunctive or other equitable relief
would be imposed against any of the Parent Indemnified Parties, (ii) such
settlement, compromise, admission or acknowledgment would materially adversely
affect the business, operations, properties, assets, condition (financial or
other) or reputation of any of the Parent Indemnified Parties, or (iii) the
aggregate Loss resulting from such settlement exceeds one-half (1/2) of the
amount of the Escrow Fund remaining in escrow and not subject to pending
claims under the Escrow Agreement.

  



  

(c) To the extent that the Parent Indemnified Parties participate in the
defense of any Third-Party Action as contemplated by Section 10.3(a), the
Parent Indemnified Parties shall obtain the prior written approval of the
Representative (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) before entering into
or making any settlement, compromise, admission or acknowledgment of the
validity of such third party action or any liability in respect thereof.

  



  

(d) The Representative shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term
thereof the giving by each claimant or plaintiff to each Parent Indemnified
Party of a release from all liability in respect of such Third-Party Action.

  



  

(e) The Representative shall not be entitled to control (but shall be
entitled to participate at its own expense in the defense of), and the Parent
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to have sole control over, the defense
or settlement, compromise, admission or acknowledgment of any Third-Party
Action (i) as to which the Representative fails to assume the defense within a
reasonable length of time, or (ii) to the extent the Third-Party Action seeks
an order, injunction or other equitable relief against any of the Parent
Indemnified Parties which, if successful, would materially adversely affect
the business, operations, properties, assets, condition (financial or other)
or reputation of any of the Parent Indemnified Parties; provided, however,
that the Parent Indemnified Parties shall make no settlement, compromise,
admission or acknowledgment that would give rise to a

  



  

79

  



     

claim against the Escrow Fund without the prior written consent of the
Representative, which will not be unreasonably withheld.

  



  

(f) The parties hereto shall extend reasonable cooperation in
connection with the defense of any Third-Party Action pursuant to this Article
X and, in connection therewith, shall furnish such records, information, and
testimony and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials
and appeals as may be reasonably requested.

  



  

10.4 _Direct Claims_. In any case in which a Parent Indemnified Party
seeks indemnification hereunder which is not subject to Section 10.3 hereof
because no Third-Party Action is involved, the Parent Indemnified Party shall
promptly notify the Representative in writing (a "Notice of Direct Claim") of
any Indemnified Losses which such Parent Indemnified Party claims are subject
to indemnification under the terms hereof. Each Notice of Direct Claim shall
set forth (i) a brief description of the nature of the claim and the basis
therefor, (ii) the total amount of the actual out-of-pocket Loss or the
anticipated potential Loss (including any costs or expenses which have been or
may be reasonably incurred in connection therewith), and (iii) whether such
Loss may be covered (in whole or in part) under any insurance and the
estimated amount of such Loss which may be covered under such insurance. Any
failure to so notify the Representative shall not prevent the Parent
Indemnified Party from making a claim under this Article X, except to the
extent the failure to give such notice materially and adversely prejudices the
position of the Representative with respect to such claim, or except as
provided in Section 10.5(a).

_Limitations on Liability_. 

---|---|--- 
 

  



  

(a) In no event shall a Parent Indemnified Party have any right under
this Article X to indemnification with respect to an Indemnified Loss unless
the Parent Indemnified Party provides to the Representative a Notice of Third-
Party Claim or a Notice of Direct Claim with respect to such Indemnified Loss
prior to the expiration of the Survival Period. The indemnification and other
obligations under this Article X shall terminate with the expiration of the
Survival Period, except that any Third-Party Claim described in any Notice of
Third-Party Claim, and any direct claim described in any Notice of Direct
Claim, furnished to the Representative prior to the expiration of the Survival
Period shall be preserved until final resolution thereof despite the
subsequent expiration of the Survival Period. Except as set forth in the
preceding sentence, no claim for indemnification under this Article X shall
be brought after the end of the Survival Period.

  



  

(b) The rights of the Parent Indemnified Parties to make claims against
the Escrow Fund and any proceeds thereof pursuant to this Article X shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of such Parent Indemnified Parties after the
Closing with respect to any claims for indemnification under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (i) none of (A) the
former stockholders of the Company, (B) the Note Holders, (C) the
Representative, or (D) any of such parties respective officers, directors,
employees, consultants, stockholders or affiliates, shall have any direct
(that is,

  



  

80

  



     

other than by reason of any such Persons interest in the Escrow Fund)
obligation or liability to indemnify any Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to
this Article X, it being understood and agreed by the parties that the Parent
Indemnified Parties right to indemnification under this Article X shall be
satisfied solely out of the Escrow Fund, and (ii) no Parent Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to make any claim for indemnification pursuant to this
Article X against any of the Persons described in subclauses (A) through (D)
of clause (i) above.

  



  

(c) Except with respect to Indemnified Losses resulting from (i) a
breach by the Company of any covenant made by the Company under this
Agreement, (ii) a breach by the Company of any of the representations and
warranties made by the Company in Section 2.15, or (iii) Indemnified Losses
resulting from claims described at clause (ii), (iii) or (iv) of Section 10.2,
the Parent Indemnified Parties shall have no right to indemnification out of
the Escrow Fund pursuant to this Article X until such time as the aggregate
Indemnified Losses for which the Parent Indemnified Parties are otherwise
entitled to indemnification hereunder equals or exceeds $2,000,000 (the
"Basket"), at which point the Parent Indemnified Parties right to
indemnification out of the Escrow Fund shall be limited to the amount by which
Indemnified Losses exceed the Basket. Indemnified Losses resulting from (x) a
breach by the Company of any covenant made by the Company under this
Agreement, (y) a breach by the Company of any of the representations and
warranties made by the Company in Section 2.15, or (z) any of the claims
described at clause (ii), (iii) or (iv) of Section 10.2 shall not be subject
to the Basket but shall be subject to the other limitations set forth in this
Article X. For purposes of the preceding sentence, nothing in Article II of
this Agreement shall be deemed to be a covenant. Claims against the Escrow
Fund permitted under Section 9.1 and 12.6 shall not be subject to the
provisions of this Article X or the Basket.

  



  

(d) The provisions of this Article X shall apply in such a manner as not
to give duplicative effect to any item of Adjustment. To avoid double counting
as to any matter, the term "Losses" shall not include any Loss suffered with
respect to any liability or obligation of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries to the extent that such liability or obligation (or a reserve
therefor) is set forth in the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet or is reflected
in any of the Adjustments, even if the events, facts or circumstances giving
rise to such Loss would also constitute a breach of any of the Companys
representations and warranties under Article II.

  



  

10.6 _Insurance_. If any matters giving rise to a claim of Indemnified
Losses pursuant to this Article X by the Parent Indemnified Parties is
reasonably likely to be covered by any insurance policy of Parent, then no
amount shall be recovered pursuant to this Article X unless and until such
Parent Indemnified Parties shall have made commercially reasonable efforts for

(c) Notwithstanding any provision of the Escrow Agreement to the
contrary, on the first Business Day that is 18 months after the Closing Date,
the Pending Litigation shall cease to be a Pending Claim under the Escrow

Litigation and such appeal remains pending, in which event the Pending Claim
relating to such litigation shall continue as a Pending Claim in an amount

Parent has Knowledge on the date of this Agreement, have been taken into
account in determining the amount of the Merger Consideration and other
amounts payable by Parent hereunder, and no additional claims may be made by
the Parent Indemnified Parties with respect to such matters and the Parent
Indemnified Parties shall have no right to indemnification under this Article
X with respect to such matters. The alleged title defects and other matters
described in this Section 10.10 are not intended and shall not be deemed to
constitute an acknowledgment by the Company or Parent that the title defects
and other matters referred to herein actually exist or an acknowledgment or
admission by the Company or Parent with respect to the possible consequences
thereof.

12.2 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an
Exhibit or Schedule, such reference shall be to an Exhibit or Schedule to this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. When a reference is made in this
Agreement to Sections or subsections, such reference shall be to a Section or
subsection of this Agreement. Unless otherwise indicated the words "include,"
"includes" and "including" when used herein shall be deemed in each case to be
followed by the words "without limitation." The headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this

  



  

96

  



     

Agreement. When reference is made herein to "the business of" an entity, such
reference shall be deemed to include the business of all direct and indirect
subsidiaries of such entity. Reference to the subsidiaries of an entity shall
be deemed to include all direct and indirect subsidiaries of such entity.

  



  

12.3 _Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures_. This Agreement may be executed
in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being
understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart. Delivery by
facsimile to the other party, or to counsel for such other party, of a
counterpart executed by a party shall be deemed to meet the requirements of
the previous sentence.

  



  

12.4 _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents, including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto
(i) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof, and (ii) are not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights
or remedies hereunder (except as specifically provided in this Agreement).

  



  

12.5 _Adjustment of Merger Consideration; Distributions from Escrow
Fund_. The return of any portion of the Escrow Fund to Parent pursuant to
Article IX or Article X of this Agreement, or pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement, that otherwise would have been paid to the former holders of
Company Stock as Merger Consideration shall constitute an adjustment to the
Merger Consideration in the same manner as if effected at the Closing. Any
funds distributable to the former holders of Company Stock from the Escrow
Fund or the Representative Fund shall constitute a portion of the Merger
Consideration to which such holders are entitled by virtue of the Merger. All
distributions from the Escrow Fund and the Representative Fund (i) to the
former holders of Company Common Stock shall be made by the Exchange Agent to
the same former holders of Company Common Stock and in the same manner as the
Aggregate Base Common Merger Consideration paid at Closing is distributed to
such former holders pursuant to Section 1.6 and 1.7, and (ii) to the former
holders of Company Preferred Stock shall be made as directed by the
Representative in accordance with the Note Holder Payoff and Recapitalization
Agreement. The right of the former holders of Company Stock to receive
distributions from the Escrow Fund and the Representative Fund ("Distribution
Rights") shall be personal to such Company stockholders and shall not attach
to or in any manner follow any shares of Parent Common Stock received by such
former holders in the Merger. Neither Parent, the Exchange Agent nor the
Representative shall be bound by or obligated to honor any notice of
assignment of Distribution Rights and shall be entitled, without liability or
recourse, to remit any distributions from the Escrow Fund and the
Representative Fund as provided in this Section 12.5.

  



  

12.6 _The Representative_. The parties acknowledge that the
Representatives rights, duties and obligations under this Agreement, the Note
Holder Payoff and Recapitalization Agreement, the Representative Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement are solely as a representative of the holders of Company
Stock and the Note Holders and that to the full extent permitted by applicable
law, the Representative shall have no personal liability to the holders of

  



  

97

  



     

Company Stock or the Note Holders for actions taken by the Representative in
good faith in such capacity. All reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
the Representative that are directly related to the performance or discharge
of the Representatives duties and obligations under this Agreement shall be
paid out of the Representative Fund until such fund is exhausted, after which
time such expenses shall be paid or reimbursed by Parent, and Parent shall
have an immediate claim against the Escrow Fund for the amount of the
Representatives expenses so paid or reimbursed by Parent.

  



  

12.7 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement,
or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

  



  

12.8 _Other Remedies; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise provided
herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby,
or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one
remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto
agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state
having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity.

  



  

12.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the law of the State of Delaware regardless of the law that
might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law.

  



   

       



  |  

12.10

  |  

_Rules of Construction_. 

---|---|--- 
 

  



  

(a) Each of the parties hereto agrees that it has been represented by
independent counsel of its choice during the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and that it has executed the same upon the advice of such
independent counsel. Each party and its counsel cooperated in the drafting and
preparation of this Agreement and the documents referred to herein, and any
and all drafts relating thereto shall be deemed the work product of the
parties and may not be construed against any party by reason of its
preparation. Therefore, the parties hereto waive the application of any law,
regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an
agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such
agreement or document.

  



  

(b) The inclusion of any information in the Disclosure Schedules shall
not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself and solely by
virtue of the

  



  

98

  



     

inclusion of such information in the Disclosure Schedules, that such
information is required to be listed in the Disclosure Schedules or that such
items are material to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be.
The headings, if any, of the individual sections of each of the Disclosure
Schedules are inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to
constitute a part thereof or a part of this Agreement. The Disclosure
Schedules are arranged in sections corresponding to those contained in Article
II and Article III merely for convenience. This parties acknowledge that this
Agreement requires the inclusion in each separate section of the Company
Disclosure Schedule the disclosure of all information called for by the
corresponding section of Article II, without regard for the fact that the same
information may be called for in two or more sections of Article II
and therefore should be disclosed on two or more sections of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if despite the Companys
reasonable good faith efforts to comply with such requirement, the Company
includes disclosure of certain information in one or more but less than all
sections of the Company Disclosure Schedule that call for the disclosure of
such information, and the relevance of the information to the section(s) in
which it is not disclosed is reasonably apparent on the face of the disclosure
in the section(s) where such information is disclosed, then the Company shall
be deemed to have disclosed such information in the sections of the Company
Disclosure Schedule where such information is not disclosed and the failure of
the Company to include such information in the appropriate section(s) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule shall not constitute an inaccuracy of
representation or breach of warranty. Disclosure Schedules (i) include matters
set forth in documents referenced in the Schedules and (ii) do not purport to
disclose any agreements, contracts or instruments entered into pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement.

  



  

(c) The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in the Disclosure Schedules is
not intended and shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment of
the materiality of such amounts or items, nor shall the same be used in any
dispute or controversy between the parties to determine whether any
obligation, item or matter (whether or not described herein or included in any
schedule) is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the
parties hereto covenant and agree that no amount shall be (or is intended to
be) included, in whole or in part (either as an increase or a reduction), more
than once in the calculation of (including any component of) the Merger
Consideration or any of the Adjustments, or any other calculated amount
pursuant to this Agreement if the effect of such additional inclusion (either
as an increase or a reduction) would be to cause such amount to be over or
under counted for purposes of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

12.11 _Assignment_. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval
of the other parties. Subject to the first sentence of this Section 12.11,
this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

  



  

99

  



     

12.12 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended at any time prior to the
Effective Time by written agreement approved by the Company Board, the Merger
Sub Board and the Parent Board, subject to the provisions of Section 251(d) of
the DGCL. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument executed
in writing by each of the parties hereto.

  



  

12.13 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, any party
hereto may, to the extent legally allowed: (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto; (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made
to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto;
and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the
benefit of such party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party
hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. Delay in exercising any
right under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right.

  



  

12.14 _Joint Liability_. Each representation, warranty, covenant and
agreement made by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement shall be deemed a
joint representation, warranty, covenant and agreement made by Parent and
Merger Sub jointly and all liability and obligations relating thereto shall be
deemed a joint liability and obligation of Parent and Merger Sub.

  



  

12.15 _Exclusive Remedy; Affiliate Liability_. Each of the following is
herein referred to as a "Company Person": (i) any direct or indirect holder of
equity interests or securities in the Company (whether limited or general
partners, members, stockholders or otherwise) and (ii) any director, officer,
employee, representative or agent of (A) the Company, (B) any Company
Subsidiary or (C) any Person who controls the Company or is specified in
clause (i). No Company Person shall have any liability or obligation to Parent
or Merger Sub with respect to any claim arising under this Agreement or any of
the Transaction Documents, except to the extent any such Company Person is a
party to any Transaction Document and then only with respect to the express
obligations of such Company Person under such Transaction Document. Each
director, officer, employee, representative or agent of Parent or of any
Parent Subsidiary is herein referred to as a "Parent Person." No Parent Person
shall have any liability or obligation to the Company or to any Company Person
with respect to any claim arising under this Agreement or any of the
Transaction Documents. The parties acknowledge and agree that the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Parent Indemnified Parties for any and all Losses for
which a claim for indemnification could be asserted under Section 10.2 shall
be pursuant to the indemnification provisions in Article X. Notwithstanding
anything to contrary contained in this Section 12.15 or elsewhere in this
Agreement, any party to this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents
shall have the right to assert claims against any Person based on such
Persons actual fraud.

  



  

12.16 _Consequential Damages_. No party hereto shall be entitled to recover
from another party or its Affiliates or any Indemnified Parties, any indirect,
consequential, punitive or exemplary damages or damages for lost profits of
any kind arising under or in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to the preceding sentence, each
party on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its Indemnified
Parties waives any right to recover punitive, special, exemplary and
consequential damages, including damages for lost profits, arising in
connection with or with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Section
12.16 is intended

  



  

100

  



     

to limit or otherwise affect Parents right to seek indemnification under
Article X with respect to Indemnified Losses constituting indirect,
consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, or damages for lost profits,
assessed against Parent or the Surviving Corporation in any Third-Party
Action.

  



  

12.17 _Anti-Dilution Adjustments_. Wherever in this Agreement there is a
reference to a specific number of shares of Parent Common Stock or Warrants,
or a price per share or consideration received in respect of such shares or
Warrants, then, upon the occurrence of any subdivision, combination or
dividend of such shares or Warrants, the specific number of shares or Warrants
or the price so referenced in this Agreement shall automatically be
proportionately adjusted to reflect the effect on the outstanding shares or
Warrants of such subdivision, combination or dividend.

 _EXHIBIT A_

  



  

AMENDED AND RESTATED

  

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

  

OF

  

ASCENT ENERGY INC.

  



  

FIRST: The name of the corporation (the "Corporation") is:

  



  

 **Ascent Energy Inc.**

  



  

SECOND: The Corporations registered office in the State of Delaware is
located at 1209 Orange Street, in the City of Wilmington, County of New Castle
19801. The name of the Corporations registered agent in charge thereof is The
Corporation Trust Company.

  



  

THIRD: The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or
activity for which corporations may be organized under the Delaware General
Corporation Law ("DGCL").

  



  

FOURTH: The Corporation shall be authorized to issue one class of stock to be
designated as Common Stock. The total number of shares which the corporation
shall be authorized to issue is 5,000 having a par value of $.0001 per share.

  



  

FIFTH: The number of directors that will constitute the whole board of
directors (the "Board") shall be no more than three nor less than one. A
directors term of office shall be from the date such director is elected
until the next annual meeting of the Corporation at which time such directors
successor will be elected and qualified; subject, however, to the prior death,
resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal of such director from
office. Election of directors need not be by written ballot unless the bylaws
of the Corporation so provide.

  



  

SIXTH: In furtherance of, and not in limitation of, the powers conferred by
statute, the Board is expressly authorized to adopt, amend or repeal the
bylaws of the Corporation.

  

SEVENTH: A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the
Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary
duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the directors
duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or
omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a
knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the DGCL, or (iv) for any
transaction from which the director derived any improper personal benefit. If
the DGCL is amended after approval by the stockholders of this article to
authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal
liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation
shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as
so amended.

  



  

EIGHTH: The Corporation shall indemnify the following persons in the following
manner:

  



  

(a) The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative,
and whether external or internal to the

     

Corporation (other than a judicial action or suit brought by or in the right
of the Corporation), by reason of the fact that such person is or was a
director, officer, employee, trustee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee,
trustee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise (all such persons being referred to hereafter as an "Agent"),
against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts
paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the Agent in connection
with such action, suit or proceeding if the Agent acted in good faith and in a
manner the Agent reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the Corporation, and with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the Agents conduct was
unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment,
order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its
equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that (i) the Agent did
not act in good faith and in a manner which the Agent reasonably believed to
be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or (ii) with
respect to any criminal action or proceeding, that the Agent had reasonable
cause to believe that the Agents conduct was unlawful.

  



  

(b) The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or
is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed
judicial action or suit brought by or in the right of the Corporation to
procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or
was an Agent (as defined above) against expenses (including attorneys fees),
actually and reasonably incurred by the Agent in connection with the defense
or settlement of such action or suit if the Agent acted in good faith and in a
manner the Agent reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the Corporation, except that no indemnification shall be made in
respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which the Agent shall have been
adjudged to be liable for gross negligence or misconduct in the performance of
the Agents duty to the Corporation, unless and only to the extent that the
Court of Chancery, or the court in which such action or suit was brought,
shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability
but in view of all the circumstances of the case, the Agent is fairly and
reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery
or other such court shall deem proper.

  



  

(c) Any indemnification under Subsection (a) or (b) of this Section
(unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation unless a
determination is reasonably and promptly made (i) by the Board by a majority
vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such action,
suit or proceeding, or (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable or, even if
obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent
legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iii) by the stockholders, that either
(y) the Agent did not act in good faith and in a manner which the Agent
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation, or (z) with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, that
the Agent had reasonable cause to believe that the Agents conduct was
unlawful.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section, to the extent
that an Agent has been successful on the merits or otherwise, including the
dismissal of an action without prejudice or the settlement of an action
without admission of liability, in defense of any proceeding or in defense of
any claim, issue or matter therein, such Agent shall be indemnified against
all expenses incurred in connection therewith.

  



  

-2-

     

(e) Except as limited by this Subsection (e), expenses incurred in any
action, suit, proceeding or investigation shall be paid by the Corporation in
advance of the final disposition of such matter, if the Agent shall undertake
to repay such amount in the event that it is ultimately determined, as
provided herein, that the Agent is not entitled to indemnification.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no advance shall be made by the Corporation if
a determination is reasonably and promptly made by the Board by a majority
vote of a quorum of disinterested directors, or (if such a quorum is not
obtainable or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested-directors so
directs) by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, that, based upon
the facts known to the Board or counsel at the time such determination is
made, the Agent acted in bad faith and in a manner that the Agent did not
believe to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the Corporation, or,
with respect to any criminal proceeding, that Agent believed or had reasonable
cause to believe the Agents conduct was unlawful. In no event shall any
advance be made in instances where the Board or independent legal counsel
reasonably determines that the Agent deliberately breached the Agents duty to
the Corporation or its shareholders.

  



  

(f) Any indemnification or advance under Subsections (a), (b), (c), (d)
or (e) of this Section shall be made promptly, and in any event within ninety
(90) days, upon the written request of the Agent, unless with respect to
applications under Subsections (a), (b), (c) or (e) of this Section, a
determination is reasonably and promptly made by the Board by a majority vote
of a quorum of disinterested directors that such Agent acted in a manner set
forth in such Subsections as to justify the Corporation in not indemnifying or
making an advance to the Agent. In the event no quorum of disinterested
directors is obtainable, the Board shall promptly direct that independent
legal counsel shall decide whether the Agent acted in the manner set forth in
such Subsections as to justify the Corporation not indemnifying or making an
advance to the Agent. The right to indemnification or advances as granted by
this Section shall be enforceable by the Agent in any court of competent
jurisdiction, if the Board or independent legal counsel denies the claim, in
whole or in part, or if no disposition of such claim is made within ninety
(90) days. The Agents expenses incurred in connection with successfully
establishing the Agents right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any
such proceeding shall also be indemnified by the Corporation.

  



  

(g) The indemnification provided by this Section shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which an Agent seeking indemnification may be
entitled under any bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested
directors or otherwise, both as to action in the Agents official capacity and
as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue
as to a person who has ceased to be an Agent and shall inure to the benefit of
the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. All rights to
indemnification under this Section shall be deemed to be provided by a
contract between the Corporation and the Agent who serves in such capacity at
any time while this Certificate of Incorporation and the relevant provisions
of the DGCL and other applicable law, if any, are in effect, and to the extent
the relevant provisions of the DGCL are hereafter amended to permit more
expansive indemnification, an Agent shall be entitled to the benefit of the
more expansive indemnification so permitted. Any repeal or modification
thereof shall not affect any rights or obligations then existing.

  



  

(h) Upon resolution passed by the Board, the Corporation may purchase
and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was an Agent against
any liability asserted against such Agent and incurred by such Agent in any
such capacity, or arising out of the Agents

  



  

-3-

     

status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to
indemnify the Agent against such liability under the provisions of this
Section.

  



  

(i) For the purposes of this Section, references to "the Corporation"
include all constituent corporations absorbed in a consolidation or merger as
well as the resulting or surviving corporation, so that any person who is or
was a director, officer, employee, trustee or agent of such a constituent
corporation or is or was serving at the request of such constituent
corporation as a director, officer, employee, trustee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise shall stand
in the same position under the provisions of this Section with respect to the
resulting or surviving corporation as such person would if such person had
served the resulting or surviving corporation in the same capacity.

  



  

(j) For purposes of this Section, references to "other enterprises"
shall include employee benefit plans; references to "fines" shall include any
excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to any employee benefit plan;
and references to "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include
any service as a director, officer, employee, trustee or agent of the
Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director,
officer, employee, trustee or agent with respect to any employee benefit plan,
its participants, or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and
in a manner such person reasonable believed to be in the interest of the
participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to
have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation"
as referred to in this Section.

  



  

(k) If this Section or any portion thereof shall be invalidated on any
ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall
nevertheless indemnify each Agent as to expenses (including attorneys fees),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement with respect to any action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative,
and whether internal or external, including a grand jury proceeding and an
action or suit brought by or in the right of the Corporation, to the full
extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Section that shall not have
been invalidated, or by any other applicable agreement or law.

  



  

(l) The rights of indemnity created by this Section are and shall be at
all times subordinate to the right of prior payment of all obligations of the
Corporation for borrowed money to the extent they are due and payable at the
time any payment under this Section shall be due and payable.

  



  

NINTH. Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between this
Corporation and its creditors or any class of them and/or between this
Corporation and its stockholders or any class of them, any court of equitable
jurisdiction within the State of Delaware may, on the application in a summary
way of this Corporation or of any creditor or stockholder thereof or on the
application of any receiver or receivers appointed for this Corporation under
the provisions of Section 291 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code, or on the
application of trustees in dissolution or of any receiver or receivers
appointed for this Corporation under the provisions of Section 279 of Title 8
of the Delaware Code, order a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors,
and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of this Corporation, as
the case may be, to be summoned in such manner as the said court directs.  If
a majority in number representing three-fourths in value of the creditors or
class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of
this

  



  

-4-

     

Corporation, as the case may be, agree to any compromise or arrangement and to
any reorganization of this Corporation as a consequence of such compromise or
arrangement, the said compromise or arrangement and the said reorganization
shall, if sanctioned by the court to which the said application has been made,
be binding on all the creditors or class of creditors, and/or on all the
stockholders or class of stockholders, of this Corporation, as the case may
be, and also on this Corporation.

  



  

TENTH: The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal
any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation in the manner now
or hereinafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred on stockholders
herein are granted subject to this reservation.

  



  

ELEVENTH: The power to adopt, amend or repeal the bylaws is hereby conferred
upon the board of directors.

ARTICLE II

  

MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS

  

2.1 _Place of Meetings_. All meetings of the stockholders shall be held
at such time and place, either within or without the State of Delaware, as
shall be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors and stated in
the notice of the meeting or in a duly executed waiver of notice thereof.

  

2.2 _Annual Meetings_. The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held
on such date and at such time as may be fixed by the Board of Directors and
stated in the notice of the meeting, for the purpose of electing directors and
for the transaction of only such other business as is properly brought before
the meeting in accordance with these Bylaws (the "Bylaws"). Written notice of
an annual meeting stating the place, date and hour of the meeting, shall be
given to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting not less than ten
(10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the annual meeting. To
be properly brought before the annual meeting, business must be either (i)
specified in the notice of annual meeting (or any supplement or amendment
thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (ii)
otherwise brought before the annual meeting by or at the direction of the
Board of Directors, or (iii) otherwise properly brought before the annual
meeting by a stockholder. In addition to any other applicable requirements,
for business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder,
the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the
Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a stockholders notice must be
delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the
Corporation not less than sixty (60) days nor more than ninety (90) days prior
to the meeting; provided, however, that in the event that less than seventy

be received no later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day
following the day on which such notice of the date of

     

the annual meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made, whichever
first occurs. A stockholders notice to the Secretary shall set forth (a) as
to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting (i)
a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual
meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting,
and (ii) any material interest of the stockholder in such business, and (b) as
to the stockholder giving the notice (i) the name and record address of the
stockholder and (ii) the class, series and number of shares of capital stock
of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by the stockholder.
Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be
conducted at the annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set
forth in this Article II, Section 2. The officer of the Corporation presiding
at an annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the
annual meeting that business was not properly brought before the annual
meeting in accordance with the provisions of this Article II, Section 2, and
if such officer should so determine, such officer shall so declare to the
annual meeting and any such business not properly brought before the meeting
shall not be transacted.

  

2.3 _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the stockholders, for any
purpose or purposes, unless otherwise prescribed by statute or by the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation (the "Certificate of
Incorporation"), may only be called by a majority of the entire Board of
Directors, or the Chief Executive Officer, and shall be called by the
Secretary at the request in writing of stockholders owning a majority in
amount of the entire capital stock of the corporation issued and outstanding
and entitled to vote. Such request shall state the purpose or purposes of the
proposed meeting. Unless otherwise provided by law, written notice of a
special meeting of stockholders, stating the time, place and purpose or
purposes thereof, shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote at
such meeting, not less than ten (10) or more than sixty (60) days before the
date fixed for the meeting. Business transacted at any special meeting of
stockholders shall be limited to the purposes stated in the notice.

  

2.4 _Quorum_. The holders of a majority of the capital stock issued and
outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by
proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the
transaction of business except as otherwise provided by statute or by the
Certificate of Incorporation. If, however, such quorum shall not be present or
represented at any meeting of the stockholders, the holders of a majority of
the votes entitled to be cast by the stockholders entitled to vote thereat,
present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the
meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the
meeting, until a quorum shall be present or represented. At such adjourned
meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may
be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally
noticed. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the
adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of
the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote at
the meeting.

  

2.5 _Organization_. The Chairman of the Board of Directors shall act as
chairman of meetings of the stockholders. The Board of Directors may designate
any other officer or director of the Corporation to act as chairman of any
meeting in the absence of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, and the
Board of Directors may further provide for determining who shall act as
chairman of any stockholders meeting in the absence of the Chairman of the
Board of Directors and such designee. The Secretary of the Corporation shall
act as secretary of all

  



  

2

  



     

meetings of the stockholders, but in the absence of the Secretary the
presiding officer may appoint any other person to act as secretary of any
meeting.

  

2.6 _Voting_. Unless otherwise required by law, the Certificate of
Incorporation or these Bylaws, any question (other than the election of
directors) brought before any meeting of stockholders shall be decided by the
vote of the holders of a majority of the stock represented and entitled to
vote thereat. At all meetings of stockholders for the election of directors, a
plurality of the votes cast shall be sufficient to elect. Each stockholder
represented at a meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to cast one vote
for each share of the capital stock entitled to vote thereat held by such
stockholder, unless otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation.
Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express
consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may
authorize any person or persons to act for him by proxy. All proxies shall be
executed in writing and shall be filed with the Secretary of the Corporation
not later than the day on which exercised. No proxy shall be voted or acted
upon after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a
longer period. The Board of Directors, in its discretion, or the officer of
the Corporation presiding at a meeting of stockholders, in his discretion, may
require that any votes cast at such meeting shall be cast by written ballot.

  

2.7 _Action of Shareholders Without Meeting_. Unless otherwise provided
by the Certificate of Incorporation, any action required to be taken at any
annual or special meeting of stockholders, or any action which may be taken at
any annual or special meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a
meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing,
setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of
outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would
be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares
entitled to vote thereon were present and voted, and shall be delivered to the
Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its
principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having
custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are
recorded. Delivery made to the Corporations registered office shall be by
hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. Prompt
notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than
unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not
consented in writing.

  

2.8 _Voting List_. The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of
the corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every
meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote
at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, showing the address of each
stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each
stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder,
for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a
period of at least ten (10) days prior to the election, either at a place
within the city, town or village where the election is to be held, which place
shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not specified, at the
place where said meeting is to be held. The list shall be produced and kept
at the time and place of election during the whole time thereof, and may be
inspected by any stockholder of the Corporation who is present.

  



  

3

  



     

2.9 _Stock Ledger_. The stock ledger of the Corporation shall be the
only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the stock
ledger, the list required by Section 2.8 of these Bylaws or the books of the
Corporation, or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders.

  

2.10 _Adjournment_. Any meeting of the stockholders, including one at
which directors are to be elected, may be adjourned for such periods as the
presiding officer of the meeting or the stockholders present in person or by
proxy and entitled to vote shall direct.

  

2.11 _Ratification_. Any transaction questioned in any stockholders
derivative suit, or any other suit to enforce alleged rights of the
Corporation or any of its stockholders, on the ground of lack of authority,
defective or irregular execution, adverse interest of any director, officer or
stockholder, nondisclosure, miscomputation or the application of improper
principles or practices of accounting may be approved, ratified and confirmed
before or after judgment by the Board of Directors or by the holders of common
stock and, if so approved, ratified or confirmed, shall have the same force
and effect as if the questioned transaction had been originally duly
authorized, and said approval, ratification or confirmation shall be binding
upon the Corporation and all of its stockholders and shall constitute a
bar to any claim or execution of any judgment in respect of such questioned
transaction.

  

2.12 _Judges_. All votes by ballot at any meeting of stockholders shall
be conducted by two judges appointed for the purpose either by the directors
or by the meeting. The judges shall decide upon the qualifications of voters,
count the votes and declare the result.

  

ARTICLE III

  

DIRECTORS

  

3.1 _Powers; Number; Qualifications_. The business and affairs of the
Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of
Directors, except as may be otherwise provided by law or in the Certificate of
Incorporation. The number of directors which shall constitute the Board of
Directors shall be not less than one (1) nor more than three (3). The exact
number of directors shall be fixed from time to time, within the limits
specified in this Section 3.1 or in the Certificate of Incorporation, by the
Board of Directors. Directors need not be stockholders of the Corporation.

  

3.2 _Election; Term of Office; Resignation; Removal; Vacancies_. Each
director shall hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders at
which time such directors successor will be elected and qualified; subject,
however, to the prior death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or
removal of such director from office. Unless otherwise provided in the
Certificate of Incorporation, vacancies and newly created directorships
resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors or from any
other cause may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office,
although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director and each director
so chosen shall hold office until the next annual meeting and until such
directors successor shall be duly elected and shall qualify, or until such
directors earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal
from office.

3.3 _Nominations_. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of
Directors of the Corporation at a meeting of stockholders of the Corporation
may be made at such meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors,
by any committee or persons appointed by the Board of Directors or by any
stockholder of the Corporation entitled to vote for the election of directors
at the meeting who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this
Section 3.3. Such nominations by any stockholder shall be made pursuant to
timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a
stockholders notice shall be delivered to or mailed and received at the
principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than sixty (60) days
nor more than ninety (90) days prior to the meeting; provided however, that
in the event that less than seventy (70) days notice or prior public
disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to stockholders, notice
by the stockholder, to be timely, must be received no later than the close of
business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such notice of the
date of the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made, whichever
first occurs. Such stockholders notice to the Secretary shall set forth (i)
as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or
reelection as a director, (a) the name, age, business address and residence
address of the person, (b) the principal occupation or employment of the
person, (c) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation
which are beneficially owned by the person, and (d) any other information
relating to the person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations for
proxies for election of directors pursuant to the Rules and Regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission under Section 14 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and (ii) as to the stockholder giving the
notice (a) the name and record address of the stockholder and (b) the class
and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation which are
beneficially owned by the stockholder. The Corporation may require any
proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be
required by the Corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed
nominee to serve as a director of the Corporation. No person shall be eligible
for election as a director of the Corporation unless nominated in accordance
with the procedures set forth herein. The officer of the Corporation presiding
at an annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the
meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the foregoing
procedure, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting
and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.

  

3.4 _Meetings_. The Board of Directors of the Corporation may hold
meetings, both regular and special, either within or without the State of
Delaware. The first meeting of each newly elected Board of Directors shall be
held immediately after and at the same place as the meeting of the
stockholders at which it is elected and no notice of such meeting shall be
necessary to the newly elected directors in order to legally constitute the
meeting, provided a quorum shall be present. Regular meetings of the Board of
Directors may be held without notice at such time and place as shall from time
to time be determined by the Board of Directors. Special meetings of the Board
of Directors may be called by the Chief Executive Officer or a majority of the
entire Board of Directors. Notice thereof stating the place, date and hour of
the meeting shall be given to each director either by mail not less than
forty-eight (48) hours before the date of the meeting, by telephone, facsimile
or telegram on twenty-four (24) hours notice, or on such shorter notice as the
person or persons calling such meeting may deem necessary or appropriate in
the circumstances.

  

3.5 _Quorum_. Except as may be otherwise specifically provided by law,
the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, at all meetings of the Board
of Directors or any

  



  

5

  



     

committee thereof, a majority of the entire Board of Directors or such
committee, as the case may be, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction
of business and the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting
at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board of Directors. If a
quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any
committee thereof, a majority of the directors present thereat may adjourn the
meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the
meeting, until a quorum shall be present.

  

3.6 _Organization of Meetings_. The Board of Directors shall elect one
of its members to be Chairman of the Board of Directors. The Chairman of the
Board of Directors shall lead the Board of Directors in fulfilling its
responsibilities as set forth in these Bylaws, including its responsibility to
oversee the performance of the Corporation, and shall determine the agenda and
perform all other duties and exercise all other powers which are or from time
to time may be delegated to him or her by the Board of Directors. Meetings of
the Board of Directors shall be presided over by the Chairman of the Board of
Directors, or in his or her absence, by the Chief Executive Officer, or in the
absence of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive
Officer by such other person as the Board of Directors may designate or the
members present may select.

  

3.7 _Actions of Board of Directors Without Meeting_. Unless otherwise
restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, any action
required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or
of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting, if all members of the
Board of Directors or of such committee, as the case may be, consent thereto
in writing, and the writing or writings are filled with the minutes of
proceedings of the Board of Directors or committee.

  

3.8 _Removal of Directors by Stockholders_. The entire Board of
Directors or any individual Director may be removed from office with or
without cause by a majority vote of the holders of the outstanding shares then
entitled to vote at an election of directors. In case the Board of Directors
or any one or more Directors be so removed, new Directors may be elected at
the same time for the unexpired portion of the full term of the Director or
Directors so removed.

  

3.9 _Resignations_. Any Director may resign at any time by submitting
his written resignation to the Board of Directors or Secretary of the
Corporation. Such resignation shall take effect at the time of its receipt by
the Corporation unless another time be fixed in the resignation, in which case
it shall become effective at the time so fixed. The acceptance of a
resignation shall not be required to make it effective.

  

3.10 _Committees_. The Board of Directors may designate one or more
committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the
Corporation. In the absence or disqualification of a member of a committee,
the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from
voting, whether or not he or they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint
another member of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in the place of
any such absent or disqualified member. Any such committee, to the extent
provided by law and in the resolution of the Board of Directors establishing
such committee, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of
the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the
Corporation, and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to
all papers which may require it; but no such committee shall have the power or

  



  

6

  



     

authority in reference to amending the Certificate of Incorporation, adopting
an agreement of merger or consolidation, recommending to the stockholders the
sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the Corporations
property and assets, recommending to the stockholders a dissolution of the
Corporation or a revocation of a dissolution or amending the Bylaws of the
Corporation; and, unless the resolution expressly so provides, no such
committee shall have the power or authority to declare a dividend or to
authorize the issuance of stock or to adopt a certificate of ownership and
merger. Each committee shall keep regular minutes of its meetings and report
the same to the Board of Directors when required.

  

3.11 _Compensation_. The directors may be paid their expenses, if any, of
attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors and may be paid a fixed
amount (in cash or other form of consideration) for attendance at each meeting
of the Board of Directors or a stated salary as director. No such payment
shall preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity
and receiving compensation therefor. Members of special or standing committees
may be allowed like compensation for attending committee meetings.

  

3.12 _Interested Directors_. No contract or transaction between the
Corporation and one or more of its directors or officers, or between the
Corporation and any other corporation, partnership, association, or other
organization in which one or more of its directors or officers are directors
or officers, or have a financial interest, shall be void or voidable solely
for this reason, or solely because the director or officer is present at or
participates in the meeting of the Board of Directors or committee thereof
which authorizes the contract or transaction, or solely because his or their
votes are counted for such purpose, if (i) the material facts as to his or
their relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are
disclosed or are known to the Board of Directors or the committee, and the
Board of Directors or committee in good faith authorizes the contract or
transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority of the disinterested
directors, even though the disinterested directors be less than a quorum; or
(ii) the material facts as to his or their relationship or interest and as to
the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the stockholders
entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or transaction is specifically
approved in good faith by vote of the stockholders; or (iii) the contract or
transaction is fair as to the Corporation as of the time it is authorized,
approved or ratified, by the Board of Directors, a committee thereof or the
stockholders. Common or interested directors may be counted in determining the
presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Board of Directors or of a committee
which authorizes the contract or transaction.

  

3.13 _Meetings by Means of Conference Telephone_. Members of the Board of
Directors or any committee designed by the Board of Directors may participate
in a meeting of the Board of Directors or of a committee of the Board of
Directors by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment
by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each
other, and participation in a meeting pursuant to this subsection shall
constitute presence in person at such meeting.

  



  

3.14 _Related Party Transactions_. No contract or other transaction shall
be made or entered into between the Corporation and any "related party" (as
hereinafter defined) unless such contract or other transaction (i) is on terms
no less favorable to the Corporation than may reasonably be available to the
Corporation from an unaffiliated third party, and (ii) if material in amount,
is approved by vote of a majority of the Corporations disinterested (in such
contract or transaction)

  



  

7

  



     

directors. For purposes of this provision, the term "related party" means: (x)
any director or executive officer of the Corporation; (y) any person known by
the Corporation to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent (5%) of
any class of the Corporations voting securities; or (z) any immediate family
member of any director or executive officer, or of any person known by the
Corporation to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent (5%) of any
class of the Corporations voting securities.

Bylaws and to the direction of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive

office. Each Vice President shall perform such other duties and have such
other powers as the Board of Directors from time to time may prescribe. If
there be no Vice President, the Board of Directors shall designate the officer
of the Corporation who, in the absence of the Chief Executive Officer or in

to be given, notice of all meetings of the stockholders and special meetings
of the Board of Directors, and shall perform such other duties as may be
prescribed by the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer, under
whose supervision the Secretary shall be. If the Secretary shall be unable or
shall refuse to cause to be given notice of all meetings of the stockholders
and special meetings of the Board of Directors, then the Chief Executive
Officer or any Assistant Secretary shall perform such actions. If there be no
Assistant Secretary, then the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive
Officer may choose another officer to cause such notice to be given. The
Secretary shall have custody of the seal of the Corporation and the Secretary
or any Assistant Secretary, if there be one, shall have authority to affix the
same to any instrument requiring it and when so affixed, it may be attested by
the signature of the Secretary or by the signature of any such Assistant
Secretary. The Board of Directors may give general authority to any other
officer to affix the seal of the Corporation and to attest the affixing by his
signature. The Secretary shall see that all books, reports, statements,

filed are properly kept or filed, as the case may be.

by the Board of Directors. The Treasurer shall disburse the funds of the
Corporation as may be ordered by the Board of Directors, taking proper
vouchers for such disbursements, and shall render to the Chief Executive
Officer and the Board of Directors, at its regular meetings, or when the Board
of Directors so requires, an account of all his transactions as Treasurer and
of the financial condition of the Corporation. If required by the Board of
Directors, the Treasurer shall give the Corporation a bond in such sum and

Directors for the faithful performance of the duties of his office and for the
restoration to the Corporation, in case of his death, resignation, retirement
or removal from office, of all books, papers, vouchers, money and other
property of whatever kind in his possession or under his control belonging to
the Corporation.

shall not be required to make it effective.

approved by the Board of Directors, any officer of the Corporation may be

ARTICLE V

  

CAPITAL STOCK

  

5.1 _Form of Certificates_. Every holder of stock in the Corporation
shall be entitled to have a certificate signed, in the name of the Corporation
(i) by the Chief Executive Officer or a Vice President and (ii) by the
Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer, or the Secretary or an Assistant
Secretary of the Corporation, certifying the number of shares owned by him in
the Corporation.

  

5.2 _Signatures_. Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may
be a facsimile, including, but not limited to, signatures of officers of the
Corporation and countersignatures of a transfer agent or registrar. In case an
officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile
signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such
officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may
be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if he were such officer,
transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.

  

5.3 _Lost Certificates_. The Board of Directors may direct a new
certificate or certificates to be issued in place of any certificate or
certificates theretofore issued by the Corporation alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming the certificate of stock to be lost, stolen or destroyed. When
authorizing such issue of a new certificate, the Board of Directors may, in
its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require
the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or his legal
representative, to advertise the same in such manner as the Board of Directors
shall require and/or to give the Corporation a bond in such sum as it may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
the Corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

  

5.4 _Transfers_. Stock of the Corporation shall be transferable in the
manner prescribed by law and in these Bylaws. Transfers of stock shall be made
on the books of the Corporation only by the person named in the certificate or
by his attorney lawfully constituted in writing and upon the surrender of the
certificate therefor, which shall be canceled before a new certificate shall
be issued. Upon surrender to the Corporation or the transfer agent of the
Corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper
evidence of succession, assignment or authority to transfer, it shall be the
duty of the Corporation to issue a new certificate to the person entitled
thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the transactions upon its
books, unless the Corporation has a duty to inquire as to adverse claims with
respect to such transfer which has not been discharged. The Corporation shall
have no duty to inquire into adverse claims with respect to such transfer
unless (a) the Corporation has received a written notification of an adverse
claim at a time and in a manner which affords the Corporation a

  



  

11

  



     

reasonable opportunity to act on it prior to the issuance of a new, reissued
or re-registered share certificate and the notification identifies the
claimant, the registered owner and the issue of which the share or shares is a
part and provides an address for communications directed to the claimant; or
(b) the Corporation has required and obtained, with respect to a fiduciary, a
copy of a will, trust, indenture, articles of co-partnership, Bylaws or other
controlling instruments, for a purpose other than to obtain appropriate
evidence of the appointment or incumbency of the fiduciary, and such documents
indicate, upon reasonable inspection, the existence of an adverse claim. The
Corporation may discharge any duty of inquiry by any reasonable means,
including notifying an adverse claimant by registered or certified mail at the
address furnished by him or, if there be no such address, at his residence
or regular place of business that the security has been presented for
registration of transfer by a named person, and that the transfer will be
registered unless within thirty days from the date of mailing the
notification, either (a) an appropriate restraining order, injunction or other
process issues from a court of competent jurisdiction; or (b) an indemnity
bond, sufficient in the Corporations judgment to protect the Corporation and
any transfer agent, registrar or other agent of the Corporation involved from
any loss which it or they may suffer by complying with the adverse claim, is
filed with the Corporation.

  

5.5 _Fixing Record Date_. In order that the Corporation may determine
the stockholders entitled to notice or to vote at any meeting of stockholders
or any adjournment thereof, or to express consent to corporate action in
writing without a meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or
other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any
rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the
purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record
date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution
fixing the record is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date
shall not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date
of such meeting, nor more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date of action with a meeting is adopted by the
Board of Directors, nor more than sixty (60) days prior to any other action.
If no record date is fixed:

  

(a) The record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of
or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on
the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is
waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which
the meeting is held.

  

(b) The record date for determining stockholders entitled to express
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action
by the Board of Directors is necessary, shall be the first date on which a
signed written consent is delivered to the Corporation.

  

(c) The record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose
shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors
adopts the resolution relating thereto.

  



  

A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at
a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting;
provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for
the adjourned meeting.

  



  

12

  



     

5.6 _Registered Stockholders_. Prior to due presentment for transfer of
any share or shares, the Corporation shall treat the registered owner thereof
as the person exclusively entitled to vote, to receive notifications and to
all other benefits of ownership with respect to such share or shares, and
shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in
such share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall
have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws
of the State Delaware.

  

ARTICLE VI

  

NOTICES

  

6.1 _Form of Notice_. Notices to directors and stockholders other than
notices to directors of special meetings of the board of Directors which may
be given by any means stated in Article III, Section 4, shall be in writing
and delivered personally or mailed to the directors or stockholders at their
addresses appearing on the books of the corporation. Notice by mail shall be
deemed to be given at the time when the same shall be mailed. Notice to
directors may also be given by facsimile or by email in accordance with
instructions received from each director.

  

6.2 _Waiver of Notice_. Whenever any notice is required to be given
under the provisions of law or the Certificate of Incorporation or by these
Bylaws of the Corporation, a written waiver, signed by the person or persons
entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be
deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall
constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends
a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the
meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not
lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the
purpose of, any regular, or special meeting of the stockholders, Directors, or
members of a committee of Directors need be specified in any written waiver
of notice unless so required by the Certificate of Incorporation.

  

ARTICLE VII

  

INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

  



  

7.1 _Third Party Actions_ **.** The Corporation shall indemnify any
person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal or administrative, and whether external or internal to
the Corporation (other than a judicial action or suit brought by or in the
right of the Corporation), by reason of the fact that such person is or was a
director, officer, employee, trustee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee,
trustee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise (all such persons being referred to hereafter as an "Agent"),
against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts
paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the Agent in connection
with such action, suit or proceeding if the Agent acted in good faith and in a
manner the Agent reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the Corporation, and with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the Agents conduct was
unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment,
order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its
equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that (i) the Agent did
not act in good faith and in a manner which the Agent reasonably believed to
be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or (ii)

  



  

13

  



     

with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, that the Agent had
reasonable cause to believe that the Agents conduct was unlawful.

  



  

7.2 _Actions by the Corporation_ **.** The Corporation shall indemnify
any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any
threatened, pending or completed judicial action or suit brought by or in the
right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the
fact that such person is or was an Agent (as defined above) against expenses
(including attorneys fees), actually and reasonably incurred by the Agent in
connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if the Agent
acted in good faith and in a manner the Agent reasonably believed to be in or
not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, except that no
indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to
which the Agent shall have been adjudged to be liable for gross negligence or
misconduct in the performance of the Agents duty to the Corporation, unless
and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery, or the court in which such
action or suit was brought, shall determine upon application that, despite the
adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case,
the Agent is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses
which the Court of Chancery or other such court shall deem proper.

  



  

7.3 _Determination of Entitlement_ **.** Any indemnification under
Sections 7.1 or 7.2 (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the
Corporation unless a determination is reasonably and promptly made (i) by the
Board by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not
parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (ii) if such a quorum is not
obtainable or, even if obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested directors so
directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iii) by the
stockholders, that either (y) the Agent did not act in good faith and in a
manner which the Agent reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the Corporation, or (z) with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, that the Agent had reasonable cause to believe that the Agents
conduct was unlawful.

  



  

7.4 _Expenses_ **.** Notwithstanding the other provisions of this
Section, to the extent that an Agent has been successful on the merits or
otherwise, including the dismissal of an action without prejudice or the
settlement of an action without admission of liability, in defense of any
proceeding or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such Agent
shall be indemnified against all expenses incurred in connection therewith.

  



  

7.5 _Advancement of Expenses_ **.** Except as limited by this Section
7.5, expenses incurred in any action, suit, proceeding or investigation shall
be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such matter,
if the Agent shall undertake to repay such amount in the event that it is
ultimately determined, as provided herein, that the Agent is not entitled to
indemnification. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no advance shall be made by
the Corporation if a determination is reasonably and promptly made by the
Board by a majority vote of a quorum of disinterested directors, or (if such a
quorum is not obtainable or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested
directors so directs) by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, that,
based upon the facts known to the Board or counsel at the time such
determination is made, the Agent acted in bad faith and in a manner that the
Agent did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the
Corporation, or, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that Agent believed
or had reasonable cause to believe the Agents conduct was unlawful. In no
event shall any advance be

  



  

14

  



     

made in instances where the Board or independent legal counsel reasonably
determines that the Agent deliberately breached the Agents duty to the
Corporation or its shareholders.

  



  

7.6 _Payment_. Any indemnification or advance under this Article 7
shall be made promptly, and in any event within ninety (90) days, upon the
written request of the Agent, unless with respect to applications under
Sections 7.1, 7.2, 7.4 or 7.5, a determination is reasonably and promptly made
by the Board by a majority vote of a quorum of disinterested directors that
such Agent acted in a manner set forth in such Sections as to justify the
Corporation in not indemnifying or making an advance to the Agent. In the
event no quorum of disinterested directors is obtainable, the Board shall
promptly direct that independent legal counsel shall decide whether the Agent
acted in the manner set forth in such Sections as to justify the Corporation
not indemnifying or making an advance to the Agent. The right
to indemnification or advances as granted by this Article shall be
enforceable by the Agent in any court of competent jurisdiction, if the Board
or independent legal counsel denies the claim, in whole or in part, or if no
disposition of such claim is made within ninety (90) days. The Agents
expenses incurred in connection with successfully establishing the Agents
right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such proceeding shall
also be indemnified by the Corporation.

  



  

7.7 _Non-Exclusive_ **.** The indemnification provided by this Article
shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Agent seeking
indemnification may be entitled under any bylaws, agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in the
Agents official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding
such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be an Agent
and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of
such a person. All rights to indemnification under this Article shall be

Agent against such liability under the provisions of this Article.

 _EXHIBIT C_

  



  

 _ESCROW AGREEMENT_

  



  

This Escrow Agreement (this "Agreement"), dated _[Closing Date]_ is executed
and delivered by and among RAM Energy Resources, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("RAM"), FS Private Investments III LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
(the "Representative"), as the representative of the parties listed in Exhibit
A, attached hereto (the "Owners"), and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as escrow
agent (the "Escrow Agent").

  



  

A. RAM, Ascent Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly
owned subsidiary of RAM ("Merger Subsidiary"), and Ascent Energy Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("Ascent"), are parties to an Agreement and Plan of
Merger dated as of October ___, 2007 (the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to
which Merger Subsidiary has merged with and into Ascent so that Ascent has
become a wholly-owned subsidiary of RAM. The Escrow Agent is not a party to,
has not received and will not be responsible for the Merger Agreement.

  



  

B. Capitalized terms used herein which are not otherwise defined herein
shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.

  



  

C. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement (i) the Escrow Fund is
to be funded at the Closing by the delivery by RAM to the Escrow Agent of the
sum of $20,000,000 out of funds that otherwise would be paid to the Owners,
either in payment of Indebtedness or as Merger Consideration, and (ii) the
Escrow Agent is to hold, administer and distribute the Escrow Fund in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

D. The Representative has been designated pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, the Note Holder Payoff and Recapitalization Agreement and the
Representative Agreement to represent the Owners and to act on their behalf
for all purposes under this Agreement.

  



  

In consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants of the parties
contained herein and in the Merger Agreement, the parties agree as follows:

  



   

       

1.

  |  

_Deposit in Escrow; Escrow Fund; Investment_. 

---|--- 
 

  



  

(a) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, RAM will deliver
to the Escrow Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to be
held in escrow pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the sum of $20,000,000
(together with any additional payment made by RAM to the Escrow Agent under
Section 9.1(b)(i) of the Merger Agreement, the "Escrow Fund"). The period
during which the Escrow Agent holds any portion of the Escrow Fund in escrow
pursuant to this Agreement is referred to herein as the "Escrow Period."

  



  

(b) The Escrow Agent hereby agrees to act as escrow agent hereunder and
to hold, safeguard and disburse the Escrow Fund pursuant to the terms and
conditions

     

hereof. The Escrow Agents duties hereunder shall terminate upon its
distribution of the entire Escrow Fund in accordance with this Agreement.

  



  

(c) Until disposed of in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
the Escrow Fund shall be held and invested by the Escrow Agent in a JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. money market account, unless otherwise instructed in a joint
written notice to the Escrow Agent executed by both RAM and the Representative
(a "Joint Notice"). Interest earned from time to time on the Escrow Fund shall
become part of and be included in the Escrow Fund for all purposes. The Escrow
Agent shall have the right to liquidate any investments held in order to
provide funds necessary to make required payments under this Agreement. The
Escrow Agent shall have no liability for any loss sustained as a result of any
investment in an investment made pursuant to the terms of this contract or as
a result of any liquidation of any investment prior to its maturity or for
the failure of the parties to give the Escrow Agent instructions to invest or
reinvest the Escrow Fund.

  



  

2. _Authority and Responsibility of Representative to Allocate and Make Distributions to Owners_. The Representative hereby represents and warrants to RAM and to the Escrow Agent that the Owners have granted to the Representative the authority, pursuant to the terms of the Representative Agreement, the Note Holder Payoff and Recapitalization Agreement and the Merger Agreement (i) to represent the Owners in all matters arising under this Agreement, (ii) to receive directly from the Escrow Agent all amounts distributed out of the Escrow Fund for the benefit of the Owners, (iii) to allocate among the Owners in accordance with their entitlement thereto, determined pursuant to the terms of the Note Holder Payoff and Recapitalization Agreement and, with respect to those Owners who are holders of Company Preferred Stock just prior to the Merger, the Merger Agreement, all amounts distributed to the Representative for the benefit of the Owners out of the Escrow Fund, and (iv) to make distributions to the Owners of all amounts distributed out of the Escrow Fund to the Representative for the benefit of the Owners. Neither RAM (in executing and delivering to the Escrow Agent any Joint Notice that is also signed by the Representative), nor the Escrow Agent (in making any payment pursuant to the instructions set out in any Joint Notice signed by both RAM and the Representative) shall assume or incur any liability of any nature whatsoever to the Owners (or any of them) with respect to (y) the allocation among the Owners of amounts distributed out of the Escrow Fund for the benefit of the Owners (or any of them), or (z) the making of any payments to the Owners (or any of them) of any amounts distributed to the Representative for the benefit of the Owners out of the Escrow Fund. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Representative shall deposit, or direct the Escrow Agent to deposit, with RAMs transfer agent, all amounts distributable out of the Escrow Fund pursuant to the Note Holder Payoff and Recapitalization Agreement and the Merger Agreement to those Persons who, immediately prior to the Merger, were holders of Company Common Stock, which amounts shall be distributed by such transfer agent to such Persons pro rata based on the number of shares of Company Common Stock held by such Persons immediately prior to the Merger. ****

_Claims Against the Escrow Fund_. 

---|--- 
 

  



  

(a) RAM may make claims against the Escrow Fund (a "Claim") under any of
the following provisions: (i) Section 9.1(d) of the Merger Agreement (a
"Working

  



  

2

     

Capital Claim"); (ii) Section 12.6 of the Merger Agreement (each an "Expense
Claim"); or (iii) Article X of the Merger Agreement (each an "Indemnity
Claim"); provided, however, that any such claim pursuant to clause (ii) or
(iii) shall be made on or prior to 5:00 p.m. Central Time on _[first Business
Day that is 18 months after the Closing Date]_.

  



  

(b) A Claim shall be initiated by RAM giving written notice of such
Claim (a "Notice") within the time periods specified in Section 3(a) to the
Representative and to the Escrow Agent specifying (i) the nature of the Claim
(whether a Working Capital Claim, an Expense Claim or an Indemnity Claim),
(ii) the basis for such Claim, in reasonable detail, together with any
invoices or other documentary evidence in support of such Claim, (iii) the
amount of such Claim, estimated in good faith, and (iv) with respect to each
Indemnity Claim (A) the covenant, representation, warranty, agreement,
undertaking or obligation contained in the Merger Agreement which RAM asserts
has been breached or otherwise entitles RAM to indemnification, (B) whether
the Indemnity Claim results from a Third Party Claim, and (C) whether any
portion of such claim is reasonably likely to be covered by insurance policy
(in which event the provisions of Section 10.6 of the Merger Agreement shall
be applicable with respect to such Claim). Each Claim described in a Notice
shall constitute a "Pending Claim" until such time as RAM and the
Representative deliver to the Escrow Agent a Joint Notice advising the Escrow
Agent of the final disposition of such Claim. RAM and the Representative shall
cooperate in good faith in promptly delivering a Joint Notice describing the
disposition of each Pending Claim promptly after such disposition occurs. If
at any time after a Claim is initiated, RAM determines in good faith that the
amount of such Claim as estimated in the Notice is greater than or less than
the amount RAM reasonably believes will be necessary to dispose of such Claim,
RAM (y) may (in the event the estimated amount of the Claim as set out in the
Notice is believed to be significantly understated), or (z) shall promptly
(in the event the estimated amount of the Claim as set out in the Notice is
believed to be significantly overstated or payment is received under an
insurance policy with respect to such Claim), amend the Notice by providing an
Amended Notice to the Representative and the Escrow Agent, in which event the
amended estimated amount of the Claim shall constitute the amount of the
Pending Claim.

  



  

(c) In the event the Claim is a timely made Working Capital Claim and
the Notice includes as documentary evidence in support thereof an award of an
arbitrator certified by RAM and the Representative as being a final award
under Section 9.1(c) of the Merger Agreement, then such Claim shall be deemed
to be an Established Claim (as hereinafter defined) and shall not be subject
to a Counter Notice (as hereinafter defined).

  



  

(d) Except as otherwise provided in Section 3(c), if the Representative
shall give written notice (a "Counter Notice") to RAM within 20 days following
the date of receipt by the Representative of a timely delivered Notice,
disputing the Claim or whether the Claim is payable out of the Escrow Fund
under the terms of the Merger Agreement, RAM and the Representative shall
attempt to resolve such dispute by voluntary settlement as provided in Section
3(e) below. If no Counter Notice with respect to a Claim is received by RAM
within such 20-day period, the Claim shall be deemed to be an Established
Claim.

  



  

3

     

(e) If the Representative timely delivers a Counter Notice to RAM, RAM
and the Representative shall, during the 20-day period following the delivery
of such Counter Notice or such greater period of time as the parties may agree
to in writing, attempt to resolve the dispute with respect to which the
Counter Notice was given. If RAM and the Representative shall reach a
settlement with respect to any such dispute, then such Claim shall be deemed
to be an Established Claim for the agreed amount. If RAM and the
Representative shall be unable to reach a settlement with respect to a dispute
regarding a Claim, such dispute shall be resolved by subsequent agreement or
by litigation pursuant to Section 3(f) below.

  



  

(f) If RAM and the Representative cannot resolve a dispute prior to
expiration of the 20-day period referred to in Section 3(e) above (or such
longer period as the parties may have agreed to in writing), then either party
may, upon five (5) business days prior written notice to the other party,
file a declaratory judgment action or such other action as the filing party
shall deem appropriate to obtain judicial determination of such dispute, which
lawsuit shall be filed in a court specified in Section 8(b) hereof. Within two
(2) business days after the expiration of such 20-day period (as so extended),
the parties shall exchange in writing final settlement offers stating the
amount each such party believes is the appropriate amount, if any, of the
disputed Claim. Each such final settlement offer must be in the form of an
offer to settle the disputed matter and must remain open and subject to
acceptance by the other party for a period of two (2) business days after
receipt by the such other party. Neither such final settlement offers nor the
existence thereof shall be admissible in the trial of the matter; however,
such final settlement offers shall be admissible to determine the identity of
the prevailing party after final judgment has been rendered. The prevailing
party in any litigation filed to determine the validity or amount of any Claim
under this Agreement shall be entitled to reimbursement from the non-
prevailing party of all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys
fees, incurred by the prevailing party in connection with such litigation. In
making such determination, the prevailing party shall be the party whose pre-
trial final settlement offer exchanged with the other party is the closest to
the amount of the Claim determined by judgment of the Court in such
action, without regard to any award in such judgment of costs, attorneys
fees or interest from and after the date the action is filed.

  



  

(g) As used in this Agreement (and subject to the final sentence of
Section 4(c) hereof), "Established Claim" means: (i) any timely made Working
Capital Claim determined in accordance with the Merger Agreement and deemed
established pursuant to Section 3(c); (ii) any timely made Claim deemed
established pursuant to the last sentence of Section 3(d); (iii) any timely
made Claim resolved by agreement pursuant to Section 3(e) resulting in an
agreed amount payable to RAM; (iv) any timely made Claim established by a
final, unappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to
Section 3(f); or (v) any other timely made Claim that RAM and the
Representative agree upon in accordance with the provisions of the Merger
Agreement.

  



  

(h) For purposes of avoiding doubt, the parties expressly acknowledge
and agree that the Escrow Agent shall not be involved in or have any
obligation or

  



  

4

     

responsibility with respect to the procedures described herein for asserting,
determining, resolving and establishing Claims, or otherwise with respect to
the Claim process, other than the payment of Claims pursuant to and in
accordance with the terms of a Joint Notice.

  |  

_Payment of Established Claims to RAM_. 

---|---|--- 
 

  



  

(a) Promptly after a Working Capital Claim or an Expense Claim becomes
an Established Claim, RAM and the Representative shall deliver a Joint Notice
to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to pay to RAM, and the Escrow
Agent promptly shall pay to RAM out of the Escrow Fund, an amount equal to the
aggregate dollar amount of the Claim described in the Joint Notice (or, if at
such time there remains in the Escrow Fund less than the full amount so
payable, the full amount remaining in the Escrow Fund).

  



  

(b) Promptly after an Indemnity Claim based on the incurrence by Parent
Indemnified Parties of Indemnified Losses resulting from (i) breach of
covenant by the Company under the Merger Agreement, as provided in Section
10.2(i) of the Merger Agreement, (ii) a claim asserted against the Surviving
Corporation or any Company Subsidiary by a Note Holder or holder of Company
Preferred Stock, as provided in Section 10.2(ii) of the Merger Agreement,
(iii) a claim asserted against the Surviving Corporation or any Company
Subsidiary arising out of or relating to the SLPH Stock Split, as provided in
Section 10.2(iii) of the Merger Agreement, or (iv) breach of representation or
warranty by the Company under Section 2.15 of the Merger Agreement, becomes an
Established Claim, RAM and the Representative shall deliver a Joint Notice to
the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to pay to RAM, and the Escrow
Agent promptly shall pay to RAM out of the Escrow Fund, an amount equal to the
aggregate dollar amount of the Claim described in the Joint Notice (or, if at
such time there remains in the Escrow Fund less than the full amount so
payable, the full amount remaining in the Escrow Fund).

  



  

(c) If, after any Indemnity Claim based on the incurrence by Parent
Indemnified Parties of Indemnified Losses resulting from breach of
representation or warranty by the Company under the Merger Agreement (except
claims for inaccuracy of representation or breach of warranty under Section
2.15 of the Merger Agreement) becomes an Established Claim, the sum of such
Established Claim and all other such Indemnity Claims that have become
Established Claims exceeds $2,000,000, then RAM and the Representative
promptly shall deliver a Joint Notice directing the Escrow Agent to pay to
RAM, and the Escrow Agent promptly shall pay to RAM out of the Escrow Fund, an
amount equal to the aggregate amount of such Established Claims, less the
$2,000,000 Basket (or, if at such time there remains in the Escrow Fund less
than the full amount so payable, the full amount remaining in the Escrow
Fund). If, subsequent to any payment out of the Escrow Fund pursuant to the
preceding sentence, any other such Indemnity Claim becomes an Established
Claim, then RAM and the Representative promptly shall deliver a Joint Notice
directing the Escrow Agent to pay to RAM, and the Escrow Agent promptly shall
pay to RAM out of the Escrow Fund, an amount equal to

  



  

5

     

the amount of such Established Claim (or, if at such time there remains in the
Escrow Fund less than the full amount so payable, the full amount remaining in
the Escrow Fund). If, after all Indemnity Claims based on inaccuracy of
representation or breach of warranty by the Company under the Merger Agreement
(except claims for inaccuracy of representation or breach of warranty under
Section 2.15 of the Merger Agreement) are resolved by agreement or litigation
(pursuant to Section 3(f) of this Agreement), the sum of all such Claims that
have become Established Claims is $2,000,000 or less, then RAM shall have no
claim against the Escrow Fund with respect to such Indemnity Claims and any
such claims that theretofore have become Established Claims shall not
thereafter constitute Established Claims.

(a) In the event RAM does not, prior to 12:00 noon (Central Standard or
Daylight Time, whichever is applicable) on _[the day that is the first
business day after the day that is 90 days after the Closing Date]_ (the
"True-Up Date"), deliver to the Representative and the Escrow Agent a Notice
of a Working Capital Claim, then on such date RAM and the Representative shall
furnish to the Escrow Agent a Joint Notice directing the Escrow Agent to pay

resolved (whether by agreement or arbitration), RAM and the Representative
shall furnish to the Escrow Agent a Joint Notice advising the Escrow Agent to
pay out of the Escrow Fund (i) to RAM, the amount of any Established Claim
resulting from such resolution (or, if at such time there remains in the
Escrow Fund less than the amount of such Established Claim, the full amount
remaining in the Escrow Fund), and (ii) to the Representative for the benefit
of the Owners, an amount equal to the positive difference, if any, between
(A) $5,000,000, and (B) the amount of such Established Claim paid by the
Escrow Agent to RAM pursuant to clause (i) (or, if after payment of such
Established Claim there remains in the Escrow Fund less than the amount that
otherwise would be paid to the Representative for the benefit of the Owners,

(c) On _[the first business day that is 18 months after the Closing
Date]_ (the "Termination Date"), RAM and the Representative shall furnish to

(d) If, on the first Business Day of each calendar quarter after the
Termination Date, the balance remaining in the Escrow Fund exceeds the sum of
(i) the amount of any Established Claims that remain unpaid, and (ii) the
amount of all Pending Claims, then promptly after such determination is made,
RAM and the Representative shall furnish to the Escrow Agent a Joint Notice
directing the Escrow Agent to pay to the Representative for the benefit of the
Owners out of the Escrow Fund the amount of such excess, which procedure shall
continue until the full amount of the Escrow Fund is paid to RAM or
distributed to the Representative for the benefit of the Owners. As used
herein, the term "Business Day" shall mean any day other than a Saturday,
Sunday or any other day on which the Escrow Agent located at the notice
address set forth in Section 8 hereof is authorized or required by law or
executive order to remain closed.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5(d), if at any time after
the Termination Date all Established Claims have been paid and there are no
Pending Claims outstanding, RAM and the Representative promptly shall furnish
to the Escrow Agent a Joint Notice directing the Escrow Agent to pay to the
Representative for the benefit of the Owners the balance remaining in the
Escrow Fund.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5, the
Representative shall direct the Escrow Agent to distribute to RAMs transfer
agent any amounts distributable to the Representative pursuant to this Section
5 that are payable to the former holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to

Agreement, which amounts shall be distributed by such transfer agent to such
Persons pro rata based on the number of shares of Company Common Stock held by
such Persons immediately prior to the Merger. ****

_Effect of Merger Agreement; Cooperation_. 

---|---|--- 
 

  



  

(a) As between RAM and the Representative, acting for and on behalf of
the Owners, the purpose of this Agreement is to effect the agreement of the
parties to the Merger Agreement with respect to the matters contemplated
hereby. This Agreement is not intended to contradict or be in conflict with
the Merger Agreement, and in the event of any such conflict, the terms of the
Merger Agreement shall control.

  



  

(b) RAM and the Representative shall cooperate with one another in good
faith in the calculation of any amounts determined to be payable to RAM or the
Representative for the benefit of the Owners out of the Escrow Fund in
accordance with this Agreement and the Merger Agreement and in implementing
the procedures necessary to effect such payments.

_Escrow Agent; Rights, Powers and Duties_. 

---|---|--- 
 

  



  

(a) The Escrow Agent undertakes to perform under this Agreement only
such duties as are expressly set forth herein.

  



  

7

     

(b) Subject to the provisions of Section 7(j), Escrow Agent shall not be
liable for any action taken or omitted by it in good faith and in the exercise
of its own best judgment, and may rely conclusively and shall be protected in
acting upon any order, notice, demand, certificate, opinion or advice of
counsel (including counsel chosen by the Escrow Agent), statement, instrument,
report or other paper or document (not only as to its due execution and the
validity and effectiveness of its provisions, but also as to the truth and
acceptability of any information therein contained) which is believed by the
Escrow Agent to be genuine and to be signed or presented by the proper person
or persons. The Escrow Agent shall not be bound by any notice or demand, or
any waiver, modification, termination or rescission of this Agreement unless
evidenced by a writing delivered to the Escrow Agent signed by the proper
party or parties and, if the duties or rights of the Escrow Agent are
affected, unless it shall have given its prior written consent thereto. The
Escrow Agent shall not be liable to RAM or the Representative for losses due
to the Escrow Agents inability to perform its obligations under the terms of
this Agreement in a timely manner because of, acts of God, fire, war,
terrorism, floods, strikes, electrical outages, equipment or transmission
failure, or other causes reasonably beyond its control. The parties hereto
other than the Escrow Agent agree to pursue any redress or recourse in
connection with any dispute without making the Escrow Agent a party to the
same. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event
shall the Escrow Agent be liable for special, indirect or consequential loss
or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits),
even if the Escrow Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or
damage and regardless of the form of action. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Escrow Agent shall have no liability with respect to any provisions of this
Agreement which set forth obligations or limitations of liability that the
other parties to this Agreement have to each other, without regard to any
action to be taken by or refrained from by the Escrow Agent, subject to
Section 7(j). The Escrow Agent shall have no obligation to investigate,
inquire, examine or assist in any manner whatsoever the other parties
compliance with the terms of this Agreement that incorporate by reference
provisions of the Merger Agreement or that apply to the other parties
obligations or limitations of liability to each other and that do not relate
to obligations of the Escrow Agent under this Agreement. The Escrow Agent may
execute any of its powers and perform any of its duties hereunder directly or
through agents or attorneys (and shall be liable only for the careful
selection of any such agent or attorney) and may consult with counsel,
accountants and other skilled persons to be selected and retained by it. The
Escrow Agent shall not be liable for anything done, suffered or omitted in
good faith by it in accordance with the advice or opinion of any such counsel,
accountants or other skilled persons.

  



  

(c) The Escrow Agents sole responsibility with respect to payments out
of the Escrow Fund shall be to make such payments in accordance with the
instructions set out in any Joint Notice or, if applicable, as directed by a
court order reasonably believed by the Escrow Agent to be a final,
unappealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction with respect to the
subject matter thereof.

  



  

(d) Each Joint Notice directing payment by the Escrow Agent out of the
Escrow Fund (i) to RAM shall include the amount of the payment to be made to
RAM

and wire transfer instructions for the making of such payment, or (ii) to the
Representative for the benefit of the Owners (or, at the direction of the
Representative, to RAMs transfer agent for the benefit of the former holders
of Company Common Stock) shall include the amount of the payment to be made to
the Representative (or the transfer agent) and wire transfer instructions for
the making of such payment.

  



  

(e) The Escrow Agent may resign at any time and be discharged from its
duties as escrow agent hereunder (subject to Section 7(j)) by its giving the
other parties hereto written notice of resignation and such resignation shall
become effective as hereinafter provided. Such resignation shall become
effective at such time that the Escrow Agent shall turn over the Escrow Fund
to a successor escrow agent appointed jointly by RAM and the Representative.
The Escrow Agent shall have the right to withhold an amount equal to any
amount due and owing to the Escrow Agent, plus any costs and expenses the
Escrow Agent shall reasonably believe may be incurred by the Escrow Agent in
connection with such resignation. If no new escrow agent is so appointed
within the 60-day period following the giving of such notice of resignation,
the Escrow Agent may commence an action in the nature of interpleader in an
appropriate state or federal court situated in Dallas County, Texas, to
determine the ownership or disposition of the Escrow Fund and shall, upon
depositing the Escrow Fund with the clerk of such court and giving of notice
of such action to RAM and the Representative, be relieved of any further
liability with respect to the Escrow Fund or otherwise hereunder.

  



  

(f) In the event of a dispute between RAM and the Representative as to
the proper disposition of the Escrow Fund, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled
(but not required) to commence an action in the nature of interpleader in an
appropriate state or federal court situated in Dallas County, Texas, to
determine the ownership or disposition of the Escrow Fund and shall, upon
depositing the Escrow Fund with the clerk of such court and giving of notice
of such action to RAM and the Representative, be relieved of any further
liability with respect to the Escrow Fund or otherwise hereunder.

  



  

(g) RAM and Representative shall jointly and severally indemnify, defend
and save harmless the Escrow Agent and its directors, officers, agents and
employees (the "indemnitees") from and against any and all loss, liability or
expense (including the fees and expenses of in house or outside counsel and
experts and their staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and
shipment) arising out of or relating to (i) any claim against any indemnitee
arising out of or relating to the Escrow Agents execution and performance of
this Agreement, except in the case of any indemnitee to the extent that such
loss, liability or expense is finally adjudicated to have been primarily
caused by the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Escrow
Agent or other indemnitee, or (ii) the performance by the Escrow Agent of the
action specified in any Joint Notice; provided, however, that solely as
between RAM and the Representative, the foregoing joint and several
indemnification obligation shall in no way modify, supersede or amend the
provisions of Section 2 hereof with respect to the Representatives sole
responsibility (except as qualified by the last sentence of Section 2) for (y)
the allocation among the Owners of amounts distributed out of the Escrow Fund
for the benefit of the Owners (or any of them), or (z) the making of any
payments to the Owners (or any of

  



  

9

     

them) of any amounts distributed to the Representative for the benefit of the
Owners out of the Escrow Fund. RAM and Representative hereto acknowledge that
the foregoing indemnities shall survive the resignation or removal of the
Escrow Agent or the termination of this Agreement. RAM and Representative
hereby grant the Escrow Agent a lien on, right of set-off against and security
interest in the Escrow Fund for the payment of any amount due the Escrow Agent
hereunder for indemnification, compensation, expenses and otherwise.

  



  

(h) The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to reasonable compensation for
all services rendered by it hereunder ("Fees") as noted on Exhibit B hereto,
together with reimbursement for all expenses paid or incurred by it in the
administration of its duties hereunder including, but not limited to, all
reasonable counsel, advisors and agents fees and other disbursements
("Expenses"). RAM and the Representative hereby expressly authorize the Escrow
Agent to withdraw from the Escrow Fund from time to time such amounts as may
be necessary to pay such Fees and reimburse such Expenses.

  



  

(i) From time to time on and after the date hereof, RAM and the
Representative shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Escrow Agent such
further documents and instruments and shall do or cause to be done such
further acts as the Escrow Agent shall reasonably request to carry out more
effectively the provisions and purposes of this Agreement, to evidence
compliance herewith or to assure itself that it is protected in acting
hereunder.

  



  

(j) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Escrow Agent
shall not be relieved from liability hereunder for its own bad faith, its own
gross negligence or its own willful misconduct.

  



  

(k) This Agreement expressly sets forth all the duties of the Escrow
Agent with respect to any and all matters pertinent hereto. No implied duties
or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Escrow Agent. The
Escrow Agent shall not be bound by the provisions of any agreement among the
parties hereto except this Agreement and shall have no duty to inquire into
the terms and conditions of any agreement made or entered into in connection
with this Agreement, including, without limitation, the Merger Agreement.

(d) This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all parties
need not sign the same counterpart. Delivery by facsimile to counsel for the
other party of a counterpart executed by a party shall be deemed to meet the
requirements of the previous sentence.

  



  

(e) As between RAM and the Representative on the one hand, and the
Escrow Agent on the other hand, this Agreement constitutes the entire
agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and is
not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder.

  



  

12

     

(f) In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

  



  

(g) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein
expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such
party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy.

  



  

(h) Any party hereto may, to the extent legally allowed (i) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
parties hereto, and (ii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any agreement on
the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only
if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. Delay
in exercising any right under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of
such right.

  



  

(i) All notices delivered to the Escrow Agent shall refer to the
provision of this Agreement under which such notice is being delivered and, if
applicable, shall clearly specify the aggregate dollar amount due and payable
hereunder.

  



  

(j) Funds transfer instructions to the Escrow Agent under this
Agreement shall be given by Joint Notice executed by both RAM and the
Representative. Each time a Joint Notice is given, the Escrow Agent shall be
authorized to seek confirmation of such Joint Notice by telephone call-back to
the person or persons designated by each of RAM and the Representative on
Exhibit C hereto, and in the case of each of RAM and the Representative, the
Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be the
person or persons so designated by such party. Each Joint Notice shall be
signed on behalf of RAM by an authorized signatory of RAM, and on behalf of
the Representative by an authorized signatory of the Representative, in each
case as set forth on Exhibit C. Each of RAM and the Representative represents
to the Escrow Agent that the Person executing this Agreement on its behalf is
authorized to certify that the signatories on Exhibit C are authorized
signatories with respect to it. The persons and telephone numbers for call-
backs may be changed only in a writing actually received and acknowledged by
the Escrow Agent. If the Escrow Agent is unable to contact any of the
authorized representatives of a party as identified in Exhibit C, the Escrow
Agent is hereby authorized to seek confirmation of such partys execution of
the Joint Notice, or of any of the instructions contained therein, by
telephone call-back to any one or more of such partys executive officers
("Executive Officers," which shall include the titles (i) President, Chief
Financial Officer or Senior Vice President, with respect to RAM, and (ii)
Managing Member, President or Chief Financial Officer, with respect to the

  



  

13

     

Representative) as the Escrow Agent may select. Each such Executive Officer
shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, upon request, a fully executed incumbency
certificate certifying that such Person holds the office such Person purports
to hold, and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation of anyone
purporting to be any such Executive Officer. The Escrow Agent and the
receiving partys bank in any funds transfer may rely solely upon any account
numbers or similar identifying numbers provided by RAM and the Representative
in the Joint Notice to identify (i) the receiving party, (ii) the receiving
partys bank, or (iii) an intermediary bank. The Escrow Agent may make payment
out of the Escrow Fund using such identifying numbers, even when its use may
result in a person other than one of the receiving parties hereto being paid,
or the transfer of funds to a bank other than RAMs, RAMs transfer agents
or the Representatives bank or an intermediary bank so designated. The
parties to this Escrow Agreement acknowledge that these security procedures
are commercially reasonable. RAM and Representative agree that repetitive or
standing settlement instructions will be effective as the funds transfer
instructions of RAM and Representative, whether or not authorized, if such
settlement instructions are verified pursuant to the security procedure
provided herein or such other security procedure to which the Escrow Agent,
RAM and Representative may agree.

  



  

(k) In the event portion of the Escrow Fund shall be attached, garnished
or levied upon by any court order, or the delivery thereof shall be stayed or
enjoined by an order of a court, or any order, judgment or decree shall be
made or entered by any court order affecting the Escrow Fund, the Escrow Agent
is hereby expressly authorized, in its sole discretion, to obey and comply
with all writs, orders or decrees so entered or issued, which it is advised by
legal counsel of its own choosing to be final and binding upon the Escrow
Agent, and in the event that the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such
writ, order or decree it shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or
to any other person, firm or corporation, by reason of such compliance with
such writ, order or decree.

  



  

(l) RAM and the Representative hereby acknowledge that in order to
assist the federal government in stopping the funding of terrorism and money
laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to
obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens
an account. Accordingly, upon creating the account to be maintained under this
Agreement, the Escrow Agent will ask for, and RAM and the Representative agree
to provide, information that will allow the Escrow Agent to identify the
relevant parties.

_Tax Matters_. 

---|---|--- 
 

  



  

(a) For federal and state income tax purposes, RAM shall be treated as
the owner of the Escrow Fund held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to this Escrow
Agreement, and thus shall take into account in filing its income tax returns
all items of income, gain, loss and deduction with respect to the Escrow Fund,
in accordance with Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.468B-8(c). The
Escrow Agent shall report the income on the Escrow Fund on Internal Revenue
Service Form 1099 or any other required information return or reporting form
showing the Escrow Agent as payor and RAM as payee, in accordance with
Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.468B-8(g).

  



  

14

     

Neither RAM nor the Representative shall take any position for federal or
state income tax purposes that is inconsistent with the provisions of this
Section 9.

  



  

(b) RAM and Representative have provided the Escrow Agent with their
respective fully executed Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") Form W-8, or W-9
and/or other required documentation. RAM and Representative each represent
that its correct TIN assigned by the IRS, or any other taxing authority, is
set forth in the delivered forms, as well as in the Substitute IRS Form W-9
set forth on the signature page of this Agreement.

  



  

(c) RAM and the Representative will provide to the Escrow Agent prior to
each disbursement from the Escrow Fund a schedule setting forth the allocation
of the disbursement amount between (i) principal to be reported on IRS Form
1099-B (ii) imputed interest to be reported on IRS Form 1099-INT or 1042S or
(iii) Original Issue Discount ("OID) to be reported on IRS Form 1099  OID
along with the relevant payee tax information, documentation and appropriate
interest thereof. Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on such schedule and
shall not be responsible for and shall be indemnified by Ram and
Representative for any additional tax, interest or penalty arising from the
inaccuracy or late receipt of such schedule. RAM and Representative shall
calculate imputed interest based on the short-term applicable federal rate,
as prescribed by Section 1274 of the Code, effective for the Closing Date.

  



  

(d) All tax returns relating to interest paid or income earned on the
Escrow Fund required by applicable law to be filed by RAM or the
Representative will be prepared and filed by RAM or the Representative with
the IRS and any other taxing authority, including but not limited to any
applicable reporting or withholding pursuant to the Foreign Investment in Real
Property Tax Act ("FIRPTA"). RAM and the Representative acknowledge and agree
that Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility for the preparation and/or
filing of any tax return or any applicable FIRPTA reporting or withholding
with respect to the Escrow Fund or any income earned by the Escrow Fund. In
the absence of written direction from the RAM and Representative, all proceeds
of the Escrow Fund shall be retained in the Escrow Fund and reinvested from
time to time by the Escrow Agent as provided in this Agreement. Escrow Agent
shall withhold any taxes it deems appropriate, including but not limited to
amounts required to be withheld in the absence of proper tax documentation,
and shall remit such taxes to the appropriate authorities.

Party Securityholder shall be entitled to receive in exchange for its shares
of Preferred Stock (i) such holders Pro Rata Share of the RAME Common Stock
(if any) and RAME Warrants (if any) and (ii) the Merger Consideration payable
to such holder pursuant to the Merger Agreement, all in accordance with the
Merger Agreement. The Preferred Stock Accrued Dividend Payoff Amount and the
Merger Consideration payable to the Preferred Stockholders and the Non-
Investor Party Securityholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement will be paid
and delivered to the Preferred Stockholders and the Non-Investor Party
Securityholders pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement.

  

(b) Each Preferred Stockholder hereby agrees that the Preferred Stock
Accrued Dividend Payoff Amount, together with the Merger Consideration payable
to the holders of Preferred Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement, shall
constitute full satisfaction by the Company of all obligations of the Company
with respect to all shares of Preferred Stock outstanding and owned of record
by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, whether
pursuant to the Certificate of Designations or otherwise. Each Preferred
Stockholder hereby waives compliance by the Company with any term, covenant,
default, event of default, provision or condition of the Certificate of
Designations that would conflict with, be violated by or occur by reason of
the consummation of the Merger, the SLPH Merger, the Recapitalization or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Merger Agreement. Each
Preferred Stockholder further agrees that each share of Company Preferred
Stock redeemed by the Company after the date hereof and prior to the
Recapitalization Closing shall be entitled to receive only the Preferred Stock
Accrued Dividend Payoff Amount and the Merger Consideration, in each case
payable with respect to such share of Company Preferred Stock.

  

(c) As soon as practicable after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the Company will deliver to each record holder of Preferred Stock a
letter of transmittal and instructions for effecting the surrender of such
shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger Agreement
and a certification of non-foreign status which meets the requirements of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(b)(2) (a " _Non-Foreign Affidavit_ ").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Certificate of Designations,
dividends will cease to accrue on the Preferred Stock as of the date
immediately preceding the Recapitalization Closing if the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated.

  

(d) The Company and each Common Warrantholder hereby agrees to execute
and deliver to the Company, promptly following the execution and delivery of
the Merger Agreement by the parties thereto, an amendment to the Common Stock
Warrant Agreement in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit E_ providing for the
conversion of the Common Stock Warrants and the termination of the Common
Stock Warrant Agreement in connection with the Merger (the " _Common Stock
Warrant Agreement Amendment_ "). The Company and the Common Warrantholders
agree to seek the consent of the Warrant Agent to the Common Stock Warrant
Agreement Amendment. Each Common Warrantholder hereby waives compliance by the
Company with any term, covenant, default, event of default, provision
or condition of the Common Stock Warrant Agreement that would conflict with,
be violated by or occur by reason of the consummation of the Merger, the SLPH
Merger, the Recapitalization or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Merger Agreement.

(e) Each Preferred Stockholder hereby agrees to execute and deliver to
the Company, promptly following the execution and delivery of the Merger
Agreement by the parties thereto, a written consent of Preferred Stockholders,
in accordance with Section 228 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, (i)
adopting the Merger Agreement and (ii) adopting an amendment to the
Certificate of Designations in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit F_
providing that, among other things, the provisions of Section 8 and Section 9
of the Certificate of Designations do not apply to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Merger Agreement (the " _Certificate
Amendment_ ").

  

(f) SLPH, in its capacity as the holder of not less than a majority of
the outstanding shares of Common Stock, hereby agrees to execute and deliver
to the Company, promptly following the execution and delivery of the Merger
Agreement by the parties thereto, a written consent of the holders of Common
Stock, in accordance with Section 228 of the Delaware General Corporation Law,
adopting the Merger Agreement and the Certificate Amendment.

  

(g) In furtherance of the foregoing, each of the Preferred Stockholders,
each of the Common Warrantholders and SLPH irrevocably makes, constitutes and
appoints Terry W. Carter and Stuart B. Katz, acting individually or
collectively, as its true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact, with full
power of substitution and full power and authority in its name, place and
stead, to make, execute, sign, acknowledge, swear to and record the
stockholder consents described in this Section 2.3 and the Common Stock
Warrant Agreement Amendment, as applicable. With respect to each of the
Preferred Stockholders, each of the Common Warrantholders and SLPH, the
foregoing power of attorney (i) is coupled with an interest, shall be
irrevocable and shall survive the incapacity or bankruptcy of such Preferred
Stockholder, Common Warrantholder or SLPH and (ii) shall survive the
disposition by such Preferred Stockholder, Common Warrantholder or SLPH of all
or any portion of the equity securities of the Company held by such Preferred
Stockholder, Common Warrantholder or SLPH, as the case may be.

  

(h) Each Preferred Stockholder that is also a Senior Note Holder or a
Senior Subordinated Note Holder will, if such holder so qualifies, furnish to
RAME at or prior to the Recapitalization Closing a Non-Foreign Affidavit. With
respect to any such Preferred Stockholder that does not furnish to RAME a Non-
Foreign Affidavit at or prior to the Recapitalization Closing (a " _Non-
Certifying Holder_ "), at the Closing under the Merger Agreement RAME will
withhold for Federal income tax purposes an amount of cash equal to 10% of the
sum of (i) any cash, and (ii) the value (determined pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement) of the RAME Common Stock and RAME Warrants to be received by
such Non-Certifying Holder with respect to Preferred Stock pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement or the Merger Agreement. The amount so withheld may
be deducted from any cash payment due such Non-Certifying Holder, whether as
payment under the Senior Notes, the Senior Subordinated Notes or with respect
to Preferred Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, RAME may treat as a Non-
Certifying Holder any holder who furnishes a Non-Foreign Affidavit which RAME
knows or reasonably believes, based upon receipt of notice pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-4, to be false.

2.4 _Restrictions on Transfer_. Prior to any proposed transfer (whether
by sale, assignment, pledge or otherwise) of debt or equity securities of the
Company at any time prior to the Recapitalization Closing and as long as this
Agreement has not been terminated, the proposed transferor (the "Transferor")
will give written notice to the Company of its intention to effect such
transfer. Each such notice shall describe the manner and circumstances of the
proposed transfer in sufficient detail and shall be accompanied by a written
opinion of legal counsel who shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company,
addressed to the Company, to the effect that the proposed transfer of the
securities in question may be effected without registration under the
Securities Act. Any such legal opinion must be reasonably satisfactory to the
Company and must state that it may also be relied upon by the Company and any
transfer agent or stock exchange. As a condition to the transfer, the Company
may also require a certificate of the Transferor that certifies as to matters
that assist the Company in establishing compliance with securities laws at the
time of the proposed transfer and at the Recapitalization Closing. Upon
compliance with the terms of this Section 2.4 to the satisfaction of the
Company, the Transferor shall be entitled to transfer such securities in
accordance with the terms of the notice delivered by the Transferor to the
Company; _provided, however,_ that the Transferor shall, prior to any
transfer, cause any transferee of the Companys debt or equity securities to
enter into an agreement with the Company that the transferee will take and
hold such securities subject to the provisions and upon the conditions
specified in this Agreement. Each certificate or book-entry notation
evidencing the Companys debt or equity securities so transferred shall bear
or be subject to an appropriate restrictive legend reasonably deemed
appropriate by the Company, including any appropriate legend relating to the
restrictions and obligations hereunder. Without limiting the generality of any
other provision hereof, the provisions of this Section 2.4 and Section 2.6
shall be binding on successive transferees. Any sale or transfer, or purported
sale or transfer, of the Companys debt or equity securities shall be null and
void, and the Company shall have no obligation to effect any transfer, unless
the terms, conditions and provisions of this Section 2.4 are strictly observed
and followed or are waived by the Company. The Company may issue stop transfer
instructions to any transfer agent or registrar for the Companys debt or
equity securities in order to implement any restriction on transfer
contemplated hereby.

  

2.5 _Support of the Recapitalization and Merger_. As long as the Merger
Agreement has not been terminated, no Party hereto will (i) object to or
otherwise commence any proceeding to oppose or alter any of the documents to
be executed or implemented in connection with the Recapitalization in any way
inconsistent with this Agreement, or (ii) take any other action not required
by law that is inconsistent with, or that would materially delay the
commencement or consummation of the Merger or any of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement or consummation of any portion of the
Recapitalization; _provided, however_ , that nothing in this Section 2.5 shall
prevent any Party from exercising its rights under any provision of this
Agreement.

  

2.6 _Appointment of Nominees_. Effective immediately prior to the
record date of the SLPH Reverse Stock Split, each Investor Party that owns
beneficially or of record shares of common stock, $.001 par value per share,

Stock held beneficially or of record by such Investor Party and its affiliates
in accordance with this Section 2.6. SLPH and the Company shall be entitled to

delivered to the Senior Subordinated Note Holders at the Recapitalization
Closing pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger Agreement is less than the

(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, but
only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed by the Company,
the holders of not less than a majority of the outstanding Senior Notes and
the holders of not less than a majority of the outstanding Senior Subordinated

  |  

6.5

  |  

_Expenses_. 

---|---|--- 
 

  

(a) Each Party will assume and bear all expenses, costs and fees
incurred or assumed by it in the preparation and execution of this Agreement
and compliance with the agreements and covenants contained in this Agreement,
whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated;
_provided, however,_ subject to the provisions of Section 6.5(b), the Company
will assume and bear all such expenses, costs and fees (including all
reasonable attorneys fees of counsel to the Investor Parties) incurred or
assumed by the Investor Parties (unless the failure to consummate such
transactions results from the breach by an Investor Party or Investor Parties
of the covenants and agreements contained herein, in which event the breaching
Party or Parties will assume and bear all such expenses, costs and fees).

  

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.5(a), in the event the
Recapitalization Closing occurs, neither the Company (which for this purpose
shall include the Surviving Corporation) nor any Company Subsidiary shall have
any obligation to bear, pay or reimburse any costs or expenses of any nature
whatsoever incurred by the Investor Parties under this Agreement, the Senior
Notes, the Senior Note Purchase Agreement, the Senior Subordinated Notes, the
Indenture or under any other agreement between any of the Parties hereto
(including any agreement between the Investor Parties or any of them and the
Company Subsidiaries or any of them) except to the extent set out in the
Settlement Statement.

  

(c) Without duplication, the Company (or any paying agent authorized by
either of them) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
the Companys securities such amounts as may be required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax law or any other applicable legal

  



     

       



  |  

20 

---|--- 
 

     

requirement. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the former holder of the
Companys securities in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

  

(d) In the event of any litigation brought to enforce or interpret this
Agreement, or arising out of its negotiation, performance or subject matter,
the Party to this contract who prevails shall be entitled to recover its
attorneys fees and costs, including those incurred at trial, in any
bankruptcy or other proceeding, on appeal and in enforcing any judgment.

  

6.6 _Successors and Assigns_. The provisions of this Agreement will be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns; _provided that_ , except as
otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, no Party may assign, delegate
or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement
without the prior written consent the Company.

  

6.7 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except for the representations and
warranties of the Investor Parties pursuant to Section 3.2, which are made in
part for the benefit of RAME, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the
Parties hereto and their permitted assigns, and nothing herein expressed or
implied will give or be construed to give to any person or entity, other than
the Parties hereto and such permitted assigns any legal or equitable rights
hereunder.

  

6.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement will be governed by, and construed
in accordance with, the law of the State of New York, without regard to the
conflict of laws rules of that State.

  

6.9 _Jurisdiction_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of,
or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby may be brought in any court of competent
jurisdiction in the County of New York (including the Federal District Court
for the Southern District of New York) and each of the Parties hereby consents
to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding
which is brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any Party
anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such
court. Without limiting the foregoing, each Party agrees that service of
process on such Party as provided in Section 6.3 will be deemed effective
service of process on such Party.

  

6.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be signed in any number of
counterparts, each of which will be an original, with the same effect as if
the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. One or more
counterparts of this Agreement may be delivered by facsimile with the intent
that delivery by such means shall have the same effect as delivery of an
original counterpart of this Agreement.

  



     

       



  |  

21 

---|--- 
 

     

6.11 _Headings_. The headings in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and will not control or affect the meaning or construction of
any provisions hereof.

  

6.12 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Schedules, Annexes
and Exhibits hereto) constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with
respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, it being understood and
agreed by the Parties that the payment of cash and the delivery of RAME Common
Stock and RAME Warrants contemplated hereby will be effected pursuant to the
Merger Agreement. This Agreement (including the Schedules, Annexes and
Exhibits hereto) supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both oral
and written, among the Parties hereto with respect to the subject matter of
this Agreement.

  

6.13 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any person, entity or circumstance is
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect
any other provision of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be reformed,
construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provision or portion of any provision had never been contained
herein and there had been contained herein instead such valid, legal and
enforceable provisions as would most nearly accomplish the intent and purpose
of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision.

  

6.14 _Further Assurances_. The Parties will take such further action and
deliver or cause to be delivered to each other on the Recapitalization Closing
Date and at such other times thereafter as will be reasonably agreed such
additional agreements, instruments or other documents as any of them may
reasonably request for the purpose of carrying out this Agreement. Each of the
Parties hereto will use its reasonable efforts to cause each of the conditions
contained in this Agreement to the obligations of the Parties hereto to be
satisfied.

  

6.15 _Representation by Counsel; Strict Construction_. Each Party hereto
acknowledges that it has been represented by counsel, to the extent such Party
deemed necessary, in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and that the Company has not retained legal or
financial advisors on behalf of any Investor Party and that Vinson and Elkins
L.L.P. has acted as counsel solely to the Company and SLPH and not to any of
the Investor Parties in their capacities as securityholders. Accordingly, any
rule of law or any legal decision that would provide any Party hereto with a
defense to the enforcement of the terms of this Agreement against such Party
based upon lack of legal counsel, shall have no application and is expressly
waived. The language used in this Agreement will be deemed to be the language
chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict
construction will be applied against any Party.

  

6.16 _Specific Performance_. It is understood and agreed by each of the
Parties hereto that monetary damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any
breach of this Agreement by any Party and each non-breaching Party shall be
entitled, in addition to any other remedies, to the remedy of specific
performance and injunctive or other equitable relief as a remedy for any such
breach, without the necessity of securing or posting a bond or other security
in connection with such equitable relief.

  



     

       



  |  

22 

---|--- 
 

     

6.17 _Adjustments for Stock Splits, etc_. Wherever in this Agreement
there is a reference or implication to a specific number or percentage of
shares of capital stock, or a price per share of such capital stock, or
consideration received in respect of such capital stock, then, upon the
occurrence of any subdivision, combination, stock split or stock dividend of
such capital stock, the specific number or percentage of shares or the price
so referenced in or implicated by this Agreement shall automatically be
proportionally adjusted to reflect the effect on the outstanding shares of
such capital stock by such subdivision, combination, stock split or stock
dividend.

SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT

  

3.1 _Shelf Registration Statement_. Promptly, and in any event within
ninety (90) days after the Merger Effective Date, the Company shall file with
the Commission a shelf registration statement pursuant to Rule 415 of the
Securities Act (the " _Shelf Registration Statement_ ") on Form S-3 (or any
successor form thereto, or, if unavailable, any other form available for use
by the Company to register the Registrable Securities), with respect to the
resale, from time to time, of all of the Registrable Securities issued or
issuable to the Holders. At the election of the Company, and in its sole
discretion, the Warrants and/or the Warrant Shares may be registered either in
the Shelf Registration Statement required by this Section 3.1 or as a post-
effective amendment to that certain Registration Statement filed with the
Commission (File No. 333-113583) (the " _2006 Registration Statement_ ").

  

3.2 _Effective Shelf Registration Statement_. The Company shall
promptly cause the Shelf Registration Statement to become effective (but in
any event not later than one hundred fifty (150) days after the Merger
Effective Date), and shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep the Shelf
Registration Statement continuously effective under the Securities Act,
subject to the provisions of Section 6.3, until the later of (i) the date on
which no Holder is an Affiliate of the Company or (ii) the first anniversary
of the Merger Effective Date (the " _Shelf Registration Period_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have the right, in its sole
discretion, to keep the Shelf Registration Statement effective for such longer
period as it deems appropriate.

  



  

-5-

     

The Company shall be deemed not to have used its reasonable best efforts to
keep the Shelf Registration Statement effective during the Shelf Registration
Period (as it may be extended pursuant to the preceding sentence) if it
voluntarily takes any action that would result in the Holders of Registrable
Securities covered thereby not being able to offer and sell such Registrable
Securities pursuant to such effective Shelf Registration Statement during the
Shelf Registration Period, unless such action is required by applicable law,
provided that, in the event that such action is required, the Shelf
Registration Period shall be automatically extended for a number of days equal
to the number of days during which such Holders were not so able to offer and
sell such Registrable Securities. Following the first anniversary of the
Merger Effective Date, the Companys obligations under clause (i) of
this Section 3.2 shall only apply if (x) the Shelf Registration Statement is
on a Form S-3 or (y) the Company then qualifies to file with the Commission a
registration statement on Form S-3 (or any successor form thereto).

3.3

_Registration Default_. 

---|---|--- 
 

  

(a) Cash payments (" _Registration Penalties_ ") shall accrue as follows
if any of the following events occur (each such event in clauses (i) through
(iv) below being herein called a " _Registration Default_ "):

  

(i) the Shelf Registration Statement required by this Agreement is not
filed with the Commission on or prior to ninety (90) days after the Merger
Effective Date;

  

(ii) the Shelf Registration Statement required by this Agreement is not
declared effective by the Commission on or prior to one hundred fifty (150)
days after the Merger Effective Date;

  

(iii) if not registered by the Shelf Registration Statement, the Warrants
and/or Warrant Shares are not registered under the 2006 Registration
Statement, and any post-effective amendment thereto is not effective, within
the time periods set forth in (i) and (ii) above; or

  

(iv) if after the Shelf Registration Statement (or the post-effective
amendment to the 2006 Registration Statement, if the Warrants and/or Warrant
Shares are registered thereunder) required by this Agreement has been declared
effective by the Commission but (A) such Shelf Registration Statement (or the
post-effective amendment to the 2006 Registration Statement, if the Warrants
and/or Warrant Shares are registered thereunder) thereafter ceases to be
effective or (B) the Shelf Registration Statement (or the post-effective
amendment to the 2006 Registration Statement, if the Warrants and/or Warrant
Shares are registered thereunder) or the related prospectus ceases to be
usable in connection with resales of Registrable Securities during the period
ending on the first anniversary of the Merger Effective Date (including,
without limitation, because of a failure to keep such Shelf Registration
Statement (or the post-effective amendment to the 2006 Registration Statement,
if the Warrants and/or Warrant Shares are registered thereunder) effective, a
failure to disclose such information as is necessary for sales to be made
pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement (or the post-effective amendment
to the 2006 Registration Statement, if the Warrants and/or Warrant Shares are
registered thereunder) or a failure to register sufficient Registrable
Securities).

  



  

-6-

     

Each of the foregoing will constitute a Registration Default whatever the
reason for any such event and whether it is voluntary or involuntary or is
beyond the control of the Company or pursuant to operation of law or as a
result of any action or inaction by the Commission.

  

Registration Penalties shall accrue from and including the date on which any
such Registration Default shall occur to but excluding the date on which all
such Registration Defaults have been cured, at a rate of $0.0025 per
Registrable Security which is the subject of the Registration Default.

  

A Registration Default referred to in Section 3.3(a)(iv) hereof shall be
deemed not to have occurred and be continuing in relation to the Shelf
Registration Statement (or the post-effective amendment to the 2006
Registration Statement, if the Warrants and/or Warrant Shares are registered
thereunder) or the related prospectus if such Registration Default has
occurred solely as a result of the filing of a post-effective amendment to the
Shelf Registration Statement (or the post-effective amendment to the 2006
Registration Statement, if the Warrants and/or Warrant Shares are registered
thereunder) to incorporate annual audited financial information with respect
to the Company where such post-effective amendment is not yet effective and
needs to be declared effective to permit Holders to use the related
prospectus; provided, however, that in any case if the Shelf Registration
Statement (or the post-effective amendment to the 2006 Registration
Statement, if the Warrants and/or Warrant Shares are registered thereunder) or
the related prospectus shall not be usable for a continuous period in excess
of 30 days, a Registration Default shall be deemed to have occurred effective
as of the first day the Shelf Registration Statement (or the post-effective
amendment to the 2006 Registration Statement, if the Warrants and/or Warrant
Shares are registered thereunder) or the related prospectus shall cease to be
usable and the Registration Penalties shall be payable in accordance with the
above paragraph from such day that the Registration Default shall be deemed to
have occurred until such Registration Default is cured.

  

(b) Any accrued and unpaid amounts of Registration Penalties due
pursuant to Section 3.3(a) will be payable on the due date of the Companys
next following quarterly or annual report (whichever may first occur) to the
Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act. The amount of the Registration
Penalties will be determined by multiplying $0.0025 by the number of
outstanding Registrable Securities subject to the Registration Default, and
further multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
such Registration Default was applicable during such period, and the
denominator of which is 90.

  

3.4 _Expenses_. The Company shall pay all Registration Expenses in
connection with a Shelf Registration Statement (or the post-effective
amendment to the 2006 Registration Statement, if the Warrants and/or Warrant
Shares are registered thereunder) , whether or not such Shelf Registration
Statement becomes effective.

  

3.5 _Selection of Underwriters_. At the election of a Designated Holder
or Designated Holders who individually or collectively (as applicable) hold
more than 50% of all Registrable Securities at such time, any distribution of
Registrable Securities under the Shelf Registration Statement may be in the
form of an underwritten offering. The Designated Holders engaging in any such
underwritten offering holding a majority of the Registrable Securities subject
to the underwritten offering shall select and obtain an Approved Underwriter;
_provided_ , _however_ , that

  



  

-7-

     

the Approved Underwriter shall, in any case, also be approved by the Company,
such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

  

ARTICLE IV

  



  

 _DEMAND REGISTRATION_

  

4.1 _Request for Demand Registration_. Subject to Section 4.2, at any
time and from time to time commencing after the Merger Effective Date, any
Designated Holder or Designated Holders who individually or collectively (as
applicable) hold more than 50% of all Registrable Securities at such time may
request to the Company to register, and the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to register, under the Securities Act (other than pursuant to a
Registration Statement on Form S-4 or S-8 or any successor thereto) (a "
_Demand Registration_ "), the number of Registrable Securities stated in such
request (any such Designated Holder, an " _Initiating Holder_ "). The
Designated Holders will not be entitled to require the Company to effect more
than a total of two (2) Demand Registrations; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
Demand Registration may be requested after the day that is twenty-four (24)
months after the Merger Effective Date.

  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Company shall
have the right to postpone the filing of a Registration Statement and to
suspend the use of any such Registration Statement for a reasonable period of
time (not exceeding sixty (60) days) if the Company furnishes to the
Designated Holders a certificate signed by the Chairman of the Board or the
President of the Company stating that the Company has determined in good faith
that filing such Registration Statement or the use of such Registration
Statement, as the case may be, at such time would materially adversely affect
a material financing, acquisition, disposition of assets or stock, merger or
other comparable transaction or would require the Company to make public
disclosure of information, the public disclosure of which would have a
material adverse effect on the Company (a " _Valid Business Reason_ "). The
Company shall give written notice of its determination to postpone or suspend
the use of a Registration Statement (and the Valid Business Reason for such
postponement or suspension) and of the fact that the Valid Business Reason for
such postponement or suspension no longer exists, in each case, promptly after
the occurrence thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, the Company may not postpone or withdraw a filing due to a Valid
Business Reason under this Section 4.1 or Section 5.3 more than twice in any
twelve (12) month period. In addition, the Company shall not be required to
file any Registration Statement pursuant to this Article IV within ninety (90)
days after the effective date of any other Registration Statement of the
Company if (i) the other Registration Statement was not for the account of the
Initiating Holders but the Initiating Holders had the opportunity to include
all of the Registrable Securities they requested to include in such
registration pursuant to Article V or (ii) the Registration Statement was
filed pursuant to this Article IV. Each request for a Demand Registration by
the Initiating Holders shall state the amount of the Registrable Securities
proposed to be sold and the intended method of disposition thereof.

  

4.2 _Minimum Number of Registrable Securities_. Notwithstanding the
provisions of Section 4.1, the Company may elect not to effect a Demand
Registration if the amount of the estimated offering price of Registrable
Securities stated in the Demand Registration is less than $10.0 million.

  



  

-8-

     

4.3 _Incidental or "Piggy-Back" Rights with Respect to a Demand
Registration_. Each of the Designated Holders (other than the Initiating
Holders) may offer its or his Registrable Securities under any Demand
Registration pursuant to this Section 4.3. Within five (5) Business Days after
the receipt of a request for a Demand Registration from an Initiating Holder,
the Company shall (i) give written notice thereof to all of the Designated
Holders (other than the Initiating Holders) and (ii) subject to Section 4.6,
include in such registration all of the Registrable Securities held by such
Designated Holders from whom the Company has received a written request for
inclusion therein within ten (10) Business Days of the giving by the Company
of the written notice referred to in clause (i) above. Each such request by
such Designated Holders shall specify the number of Registrable Securities
proposed to be registered. The failure of any such Designated Holder to
respond within such 10-Business Day period referred to in clause (ii) above
shall be deemed to be a waiver of such Designated Holders rights under this
Article IV with respect to such Demand Registration. Any such Designated
Holder may waive its rights under this Article IV prior to the expiration of
such 10-Business Day period by giving written notice to the Company, with a
copy to the Initiating Holders.

  

4.4 _Effective Demand Registration_. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause any such Demand Registration to become and
remain effective not later than seventy-five (75) days after it receives a
request under Section 4.1 hereof. A registration shall not constitute a Demand
Registration until it has become effective and remains continuously effective
for the lesser of, subject to the provisions of Section 6.3, (i) the period
during which all Registrable Securities registered in the Demand Registration
are sold or otherwise disposed of (but not before the Warrants so registered
shall have been exercised or shall have expired) and (ii) one hundred eighty
(180) days; _provided_ , _however_ , that a registration shall not constitute
a Demand Registration if (w) after such Demand Registration has become
effective, such registration or the related offer, sale or distribution of
Registrable Securities thereunder is interfered with by any stop order,
injunction or other order or requirement of the Commission or other
governmental agency or court for any reason not attributable to the Initiating
Holders and such interference is not eliminated within thirty (30) days after
such interference first occurs, (x) the conditions specified in the
underwriting agreement, if any, entered into in connection with such Demand
Registration are not satisfied or waived, other than by reason of a failure by
the Initiating Holders, (y) such Demand Registration does not become effective
within the seventy-five (75) day period referred to in the first sentence of
this Section 4.4 and the Initiating Holders holding a majority of the
Registrable Securities held by all of the Initiating Holders request the
Company to withdraw such Demand Registration, or (z) the Initiating Holders
holding a majority of the Registrable Securities held by all of the Initiating
Holders request the Company to withdraw such Demand Registration prior to the
effectiveness of such Demand Registration for marketing reasons or because of
a material adverse change in the business, financial condition or prospects of
the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that a Demand Registration that is
requested to be withdrawn under clause (y) or clause (z) above shall
constitute a Demand Registration if the Designated Holders shall not have paid
to the Company the Reimbursable Expenses within sixty (60) days after receipt
by the Holder Representative of a certificate of an executive officer of the
Company specifying in reasonable detail such Reimbursable Expenses, together
with reasonable documentation to support such Reimbursable Expenses.

  



  

-9-

     

4.5 _Expenses_. Subject to Section 4.4, the Company shall pay all
Registration Expenses in connection with a Demand Registration, whether or not
such Demand Registration becomes effective.

  

4.6 _Underwriting Procedures_. If the Initiating Holders holding a
majority of the Registrable Securities held by all of the Initiating Holders
so elect, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such
Demand Registration to be, subject to Section 4.7, in the form of a firm
commitment underwritten offering and the managing underwriter or underwriters
selected for such offering shall be the Approved Underwriter selected in
accordance with Section 4.7. In connection with any Demand Registration under
this Article IV involving an underwritten offering, none of the Registrable
Securities held by any Designated Holder making a request for inclusion of
such Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 4.3 hereof shall be included
in such underwritten offering unless such Designated Holder accepts the terms
of the offering as agreed upon by the Company (subject to Section 6.1(g)), the
Initiating Holders and the Approved Underwriter, and then only in such
quantity as will not, in the opinion of the Approved Underwriter, jeopardize
the success of such offering by the Initiating Holders. If the Approved
Underwriter advises the Company and the Holders of the Registrable Securities
to be registered in writing that in its opinion the number of Registrable
Securities proposed to be sold in any registration under this Article IV and
any other securities of the Company requested or proposed to be included in
such registration exceeds the number (the " _Maximum Number of Shares (Demand
Registration)"_ ) that can be sold in such registration without (A) creating a
substantial risk that the proceeds or price per share that will be derived
from such registration will be materially reduced or that the number
of Registrable Securities to be registered is too large a number to be
reasonably sold, or (B) materially and adversely affecting such registration
in any other respect, then the Company will include in such registration (x)
_first_ , such number of Registrable Securities of the Initiating Holders and
any Designated Holder participating in the offering pursuant to this Article
IV, which Registrable Securities shall be allocated among such Initiating
Holders and Designated Holders as they may agree or, failing such agreement,
_pro_ _rata_ among them based on the number of Registrable Securities
requested to be included in such offering by each such Initiating Holder and
Designated Holder regardless of the number of Registrable Securities actually
held by such Initiating Holder and such Designated Holder, (y) _second_ , to
the extent that the Maximum Number of Shares (Demand Registration) has not
been reached under the foregoing clause (x), the shares of Common Stock or
other securities that the Company desires to sell that can be sold without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares (Demand Registration), and (z) _third_
, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Shares (Demand Registration) has
not been reached under the foregoing clauses (x) and (y), the shares of Common
Stock, if any, as to which registration has been requested pursuant to written
contractual piggy-back registration rights of security holders.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no employee of the Company or any subsidiary
thereof will be entitled to participate in any such registration to the extent
the Approved Underwriter determines in good faith that the participation of
such employee in such registration would materially adversely affect
the marketability or offering price of the Registrable Securities subject to
such registration.

  

4.7 _Selection of Underwriters_. If any Demand Registration of
Registrable Securities is in the form of an underwritten offering, the
Initiating Holders holding a majority of the Registrable Securities held by
all of the Initiating Holders shall select and obtain an Approved __
Underwriter; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Approved Underwriter shall, in
any case, also be

  



  

-10-

     

approved by the Company, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned.

  

ARTICLE V

  



  

 _INCIDENTAL OR "PIGGY-BACK" REGISTRATION_

  

5.1 _Request for Incidental Registration_. At any time commencing after
the date hereof, but prior to the day that is twenty-four (24) months after
the Merger Effective Date, if the Company proposes to file a Registration
Statement with respect to an offering by the Company for its own account
(other than a Registration Statement on Form S-4 or S-8 or any successor
thereto) or for the account of any stockholder of the Company other than any
Designated Holders, then the Company shall give written notice of such
proposed filing to each of the Designated Holders at least twenty (20) days
before the anticipated filing date, and such notice shall describe the
proposed registration and distribution and offer such Designated Holders the
opportunity to register the number of Registrable Securities as each such
Designated Holder may request (an " _Incidental Registration_ "). The Company,
subject to the remaining provisions of this Section 5.1, shall use its
reasonable best efforts (within twenty (20) days of the notice by the
Designated Holders provided for below in this sentence) to cause the managing
underwriter or underwriters in the case of a proposed underwritten offering
(the " _Company Underwriter_ ") to permit each of the Designated Holders that
have requested the Company in writing within ten (10) Business Days of the
giving of the notice by the Company to participate in the Incidental
Registration to include its, his or her Registrable Securities in such
offering on the same terms and conditions as the securities of the Company or
such other stockholder, as the case may be, included therein. In connection
with any Incidental Registration under this Section 5.1 involving an
underwritten offering, the Company shall not be required to include any
Registrable Securities in such underwritten offering unless the Designated
Holders thereof accept the terms of the underwritten offering as agreed upon
between the Company, such other stockholders, if any, and the Company
Underwriter. If the Company Underwriter advises the Company and the Designated
Holders in writing that in its opinion the number of Registrable Securities
proposed to be sold in any registration under this Article V and any other
securities of the Company requested or proposed to be included in such
registration exceeds the number (the " _Maximum Number of Shares (Incidental
Registration)_ ") that can be sold in such registration without (A) creating a
substantial risk that the proceeds or price per share that will be derived
from such registration will be materially reduced or that the number of
Registrable Securities to be registered is too large a number to be
reasonably sold, or (B) materially and adversely affecting such registration
in any other respect, then the Company shall be required to include in such
Incidental Registration: (i) if the Incidental Registration is an underwritten
registration on behalf of the Company, (x) _first_ , all of the securities to
be offered for the account of the Company, that can be sold without exceeding
the Maximum Number of Shares (Incidental Registration) and (y) _second_ , to
the extent that the Maximum Number of Shares (Incidental Registration) has not
been reached under the foregoing clause (x), the shares of Common Stock and
other securities of the Company, if any, including the Registrable Securities,
as to which registration has been requested pursuant to written contractual
piggy-back registration rights of security holders (pro rata in accordance
with the number of shares of Common Stock or other securities (determined on
an as-converted to Common Stock basis) which each requesting Person has
actually requested to be included in such Incidental Registration, regardless
of the number of shares of Common

  



  

-11-

     

Stock or other securities with respect to which such Person has the right to
request such inclusion that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number
of Shares (Incidental Registration), or (ii) if the Incidental Registration
does not include an underwritten registration on behalf of the Company, but
does include an underwritten registration demanded by any Person (other than a
Designated Holder) that has the right to demand such registration pursuant to
any contractual right granted by the Company, (I) _first_ , the shares of
Common Stock or other securities of the Company for the account of the
demanding Person(s) that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Shares (Incidental Registration), (II) _second_ , to the extent that the
Maximum Number of Shares (Incidental Registration) has not been reached under
the foregoing clause (I), the shares of Common Stock or other securities of
the Company that the Company desires to sell that can be sold without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares (Incidental Registration), and (III)
_third_ , to the extent that the Maximum Number of Shares (Incidental
Registration) has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (I) and (II),
the shares of Common Stock and other securities of the Company, if any,
including the Registrable Securities, as to which registration has been
requested pursuant to written contractual piggy-back registration rights of
security holders ( _pro_ _rata_ in accordance with the number of shares of
Common Stock or other securities (determined on an as-converted to Common
Stock basis) which each requesting Person has actually requested to be
included in such Incidental Registration, regardless of the number of shares
of Common Stock or other securities with respect to which such Person has the
right to request such inclusion) that can be sold without exceeding the
Maximum Number of Shares (Incidental Registration).

  

5.2 _Right to Terminate Registration_. The Company shall have the right
to terminate or withdraw any registration initiated by it under Section 5.1
prior to the effectiveness of such registration whether or not any Designated
Holder has elected to include Registrable Securities in such registration.

  

5.3 _Expenses_. The Company shall bear all Registration Expenses in
connection with any Incidental Registration pursuant to this Article V,
whether or not such Incidental Registration becomes effective.

  

ARTICLE VI

  



  

 _REGISTRATION PROCEDURES_

  

6.1 _Obligations of the Company_. Whenever registration of Registrable
Securities has been requested pursuant to Article III, Article IV or Article V
of this Agreement, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to effect
the registration and sale of such Registrable Securities in accordance with
the intended method of distribution thereof as quickly as practicable, and in
connection with any such request, the Company shall, as expeditiously as
possible:

  

(a) prepare and file with the Commission a Registration Statement on any
form for which the Company then qualifies or which counsel for the Company
shall deem appropriate and which form shall be available for the sale of such
Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method of distribution
thereof, and use all reasonable best efforts to cause such Registration
Statement to become effective; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) before

  



  

-12-

     

filing a Registration Statement or prospectus or any amendments or supplements
thereto, the Company shall provide Holders Counsel with an adequate and
appropriate opportunity to review and comment on such Registration Statement
and each prospectus included therein (and each amendment or supplement
thereto) to be filed with the Commission, subject to such documents being
under the Companys control, and (y) the Company shall notify the Holders
Counsel and each seller of Registrable Securities of any stop order issued or
threatened by the Commission and use all reasonable efforts to prevent the
entry of such stop order or to remove it if entered; provided that, in the
case of this Section 6.1(a) and Section 6.1(b) below, the Company will not
file any Registration Statement or amendment or supplement thereto to which
the Holders Counsel has reasonably objected in writing on the grounds that
such proposed filing does not comply in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act.

  

(b) prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and supplements
to such Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith
as may be reasonably necessary to keep such Registration Statement effective
for the period specified in such Article, or if not so specified, the lesser
of (x) one hundred eighty (180) days and (y) such shorter period which will
terminate when all Registrable Securities covered by such Registration
Statement have been sold (but not before the Warrants covered thereby shall
have been exercised or shall have expired) and shall comply with the
provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all
securities covered by such Registration Statement during such period in
accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the sellers thereof set
forth in such Registration Statement;

  

(c) furnish to each seller of Registrable Securities, prior to filing a
Registration Statement, at least one copy of such Registration Statement as is
proposed to be filed, and thereafter such number of copies of such
Registration Statement, each amendment and supplement thereto (in each case
including all exhibits thereto), the prospectus included in such Registration
Statement (including each preliminary prospectus) and any prospectus filed
under Rule 424 under the Securities Act as each such seller may reasonably
request in order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities
owned by such seller;

  

(d) register or qualify such Registrable Securities under such other
securities or "blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions as any seller of
Registrable Securities may reasonably request, and continue such registration
or qualification in effect in such jurisdiction for as long as permissible
pursuant to the laws of such jurisdiction, or for as long as any such seller
reasonably requests or until all of such Registrable Securities are sold (but
not before the Warrants included in such Registrable Securities shall have
been exercised or shall have expired), whichever is shortest, and do any and
all other acts and things which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to
enable any such seller to consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of
the Registrable Securities owned by such seller; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company shall not be required to (x) qualify generally to do business in
any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for
this Section 6.1(d), (y) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction
or (z) consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction;

  

(e) notify each seller of Registrable Securities (and, in the case of
clauses (iii), (iv) and (v) below, the Approved Underwriter, if any, and the
Holders Counsel): (i) when a prospectus, any prospectus supplement, a
Registration Statement or a post-effective amendment

  



  

-13-

     

to a Registration Statement has been filed with the Commission, and, with
respect to a Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment, when the
same has become effective; (ii) of any request by the Commission or any other
federal or state governmental authority for amendments or supplements to a
Registration Statement or related prospectus or for additional information;
(iii) of the issuance by the Commission or any other federal or state
governmental authority of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of a
Registration Statement or the initiation or threatening of any proceedings for
that purpose; (iv) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with
respect to the suspension of the qualification or exemption from qualification
of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the
initiation or threatening of any proceedings for such purpose; (v) of the
existence of any fact or happening of any event of which the Company has
Knowledge which makes any statement of a material fact in such Registration
Statement or related prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be
incorporated therein by reference untrue or which would require the making of
any changes in the Registration Statement or prospectus in order that, in the
case of the Registration Statement, it will not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and that
in the case of such prospectus, it will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading; and (vi) determination by counsel
of the Company that a post-effective amendment to a Registration Statement
is advisable;

  

(f) upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by Section 6.1(e)(v),
as promptly as practicable, prepare a supplement or amendment to such
Registration Statement or related prospectus and furnish to each seller of
Registrable Securities a reasonable number of copies of such supplement to or
amendment of such Registration Statement or prospectus as may be necessary so
that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such Registrable
Securities, in the case of the Registration Statement, it will not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, and that in the case of such prospectus, it will not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;

  

(g) enter into and perform customary agreements (including an
underwriting agreement in customary form with the Approved Underwriter or
Company Underwriter, if any, selected as provided in Articles III, IV or V, as
the case may be) and take such other actions as are prudent and reasonably
required in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such
Registrable Securities, including causing its officers to participate in no
more than a total of two (2) "road shows" related to underwritten offerings
pursuant to Article III (but only if such an underwritten offering is
commenced prior to the first anniversary of the Merger Effective Date) or
Article IV and other information meetings organized by the Approved
Underwriter or Company Underwriter, if applicable;

  

(h) make available at reasonable times for inspection by any seller of
Registrable Securities, any managing underwriter participating in any
disposition of such Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration
Statement, Holders Counsel and any attorney,

  



  

-14-

     

accountant or other agent retained by any such seller or any managing
underwriter (each, an " _Inspector_ " and collectively, the " _Inspectors_ "),
all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties
of the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Records_ ") as shall
be reasonably necessary to enable them to exercise their due diligence
responsibility, and cause the Companys and its subsidiaries officers,
directors and employees, and the independent public accountants of the
Company, to supply all information reasonably requested by any such Inspector
in connection with such Registration Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Records and other information that the Company determines, in good faith, to
be confidential and which it notifies the Inspectors are confidential shall
not be disclosed by the Inspectors or used for any purpose other than as
necessary or appropriate for the purpose of such inspection (and the
Inspectors shall confirm their agreement in writing in advance to the Company
if the Company shall so request) unless (x) the disclosure of such Records is
necessary, in the Companys reasonable judgment, to avoid or correct a
misstatement or omission in the Registration Statement, (y) the release of
such Records is ordered pursuant to a subpoena or other order from a court of
competent jurisdiction after exhaustion of all appeals therefrom or (z) the
information in such Records was known to the Inspectors on a non-confidential
basis prior to its disclosure by the Company or has been made generally
available to the public. Each seller of Registrable Securities agrees that it
shall, upon learning that disclosure of such Records is sought in a court of
competent jurisdiction, give notice to the Company and allow the Company, at
the Companys expense, to undertake appropriate action to prevent disclosure
of the Records deemed confidential;

  

(i) if such sale is pursuant to an underwritten offering, obtain
"comfort" letters dated the effective date of the Registration Statement and
the date of the closing under the underwriting agreement from the Companys
independent public accountants in customary form and covering such matters of
the type customarily covered by "comfort" letters as Holders Counsel or the
managing underwriter reasonably requests;

  

(j) furnish, at the request of any seller of Registrable Securities on
the date such securities are delivered to the underwriters for sale pursuant
to such registration or, if such securities are not being sold through
underwriters, on the date the Registration Statement with respect to such
securities becomes effective, an opinion and negative assurance letter, each
dated such date, of counsel representing the Company for the purposes of such
registration, addressed to the underwriters, if any, and to the seller making
such request, covering such legal matters with respect to the registration in
respect of which such opinion and letter is being given as the underwriters,
if any, and such seller may reasonably request and are customarily included in
such opinions and letters;

  

(k) comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the Commission,
and make generally available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably
practicable but no later than fifteen (15) months after the effective date of
the Registration Statement, an earnings statement covering a period of twelve
(12) months beginning after the effective date of the Registration Statement,
in a manner which satisfies the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities
Act and Rule 158 thereunder;

  

(l) cause all such Registrable Securities to be listed on the Nasdaq
Stock Market and such other securities exchange or automated quotation system
on which similar

  



  

-15-

     

securities issued by the Company are then listed or traded; _provided_ , that
the applicable listing requirements are satisfied;

  

(m) keep Holders Counsel advised in writing as to the initiation and
progress of any registration under Article III, Article IV or Article V
hereunder; _provided_ , __ that the Company shall provide Holders Counsel
with all correspondence with the Commission in connection with any
Registration Statement filed hereunder to the extent that such Registration
Statement has not been declared effective on or prior to the date required
hereunder;

  

(n) provide reasonable cooperation to each seller of Registrable
Securities and each underwriter participating in the disposition of such
Registrable Securities and their respective counsel in connection with any
filings required to be made with the NASD;

  

(o) furnish to each seller of Registrable Securities and the Approved
Underwriter, if any, without charge, at least one manually-signed copy of the
Registration Statement and any post-effective amendments thereto, including
financial statements and schedules, all documents incorporated therein by
reference and all exhibits (including those deemed to be incorporated by
reference);

  

(p) cooperate with the sellers of Registrable Securities and the
Approved Underwriter, if any, to facilitate the timely preparation and
delivery of certificates not bearing any restrictive legends representing the
Registrable Securities to be sold, and cause such Registrable Securities to be
issued in such denominations and registered in such names in accordance with
the underwriting agreement prior to any sale of Registrable Securities to the
underwriters or, if not an underwritten offering, in accordance with the
instructions of the seller of Registrable Securities at least three Business
Days prior to any sale of Registrable Securities; and

  

(q) take all other steps reasonably necessary to effect the registration
of the Registrable Securities contemplated hereby.

  

The Company agrees not to file or make any amendment to any Registration
Statement with respect to any Registrable Securities, or any amendment of or
supplement to the prospectus used in connection therewith, that refers to any
Holder covered thereby by name, or otherwise identifies such Holder as the
holder of any securities of the Company, without the consent of such Holder,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, unless and to the extent such
disclosure is required by law. If any Registration Statement or comparable
statement under "blue sky" laws refers to any Holder by name or otherwise as
the holder of any securities of the Company, then such Holder shall have the
right to require the insertion therein of language, in form and substance
satisfactory to such Holder and the Company, to the effect that the holding by
such Holder of such securities is not to be construed as a recommendation by
such Holder of the investment quality of the Companys securities covered
thereby and that such holding does not imply that such Holder will assist in
meeting any future financial requirements of the Company.

  

The Company represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior consent of
the Designated Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities included by
them in a Registration Statement,

  



  

-16-

     

it will not make any offer relating to Registrable Securities that would
constitute a "free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 433 under the
Securities Act (an " _Issuer Free Writing Prospectus_ "), or that would
otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 405 under
the Securities Act, required to be filed with the Commission. The Company may
require a comparable agreement from each Holder as a condition to permitting
such Holder to include Registrable Securities in such Registration Statement.
The Company represents that any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus will not
include any information that conflicts with the information contained in the
Registration Statement or prospectus and that any Issuer Free Writing
Prospectus, when taken together with the information in the Registration
Statement and the prospectus, will not include any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.

  

6.2 _Seller Information_. The Company may require each seller of
Registrable Securities as to which any registration is being effected to
furnish, and such seller shall furnish, to the Company such information
regarding the distribution of such securities as the Company may from time to
time reasonably request in writing. The furnishing of such information shall
be a condition to the inclusion of the sellers shares in such registration.

  

6.3 _Notice to Discontinue_. Each Holder agrees that, upon receipt of
any notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind
described in Section 6.1(e)(v), such Holder shall forthwith discontinue
disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement
covering such Registrable Securities until such Holders receipt of the copies
of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by Section 6.1(f) and,
if so directed by the Company, such Holder shall deliver to the Company (at
the Companys expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies then in
such Holders possession, of the prospectus covering such Registrable
Securities which is current at the time of receipt of such notice. If the
Company shall give any such notice, the Company shall extend the period
during which such Registration Statement shall be maintained effective
pursuant to this Agreement (including, without limitation, the period referred
to in Section 6.1(b)) by the number of days during the period from and
including the date of the giving of such notice pursuant to Section 6.1(e)(v)
to and including the date when sellers of such Registrable Securities under
such Registration Statement shall have received the copies of the supplemented
or amended prospectus contemplated by, and meeting the requirements of,
Section 6.1(f).

  

6.4 _Registration Expenses_. Subject to Section 4.4, the Company shall
pay all expenses arising from or incident to its performance of, or compliance
with, this Agreement, including, without limitation, (i) Commission, Nasdaq
Stock Market and other stock exchange and automated quotation system and NASD
registration and filing fees, (ii) all fees and expenses incurred in complying
with securities or "blue sky" laws (including reasonable fees, charges and
disbursements of counsel to any underwriter incurred in connection with "blue
sky" qualifications of the Registrable Securities as may be set forth in any
underwriting agreement), (iii) all printing (including printing certificates
and printing of prospectuses), messenger, delivery and telephone
expenses, (iv) the fees, charges and expenses of counsel to the Company and
of its independent public accountants and any other accounting fees, charges
and expenses incurred by the Company (including, without limitation, any
expenses arising from any "cold comfort" letters or any special audits
incident to or required by any registration or qualification) and any

  



  

-17-

     

reasonable legal fees, charges and expenses of Holders Counsel, (v) all
application and filing fees in connection with listing on a national
securities exchange or automated quotation system pursuant to the requirements
hereof, (vi) all internal expenses of the Company (including without
limitation, all salaries and expenses of its officers and employees performing
legal or accounting duties), the expenses of any annual audit and the fees and
expenses of any person, including special experts, retained by the Company and
(vii) the fees and disbursements of underwriters (excluding discounts and
commissions). All of the expenses described in the preceding sentence of this
Section 6.4 are referred to herein as " _Registration Expenses_." The Holders
of Registrable Securities sold pursuant to a Registration Statement shall bear
the expense of any brokers commission or underwriters discount or
commission relating to registration and sale of such Holders Registrable
Securities and, subject to clause (iv) above, shall bear the fees and expenses
of their own counsel.

  

ARTICLE VII

  



  

 _INDEMNIFICATION; CONTRIBUTION_

  

7.1 _Indemnification by the Company_. The Company agrees to indemnify
and hold harmless each Holder, its general or limited partners, members,
shareholders, managers, directors, officers, Affiliates and each Person who
controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act) any of the
foregoing from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities
and expenses (including reasonable costs of investigation) (each, a "
_Liability_ " and collectively, " _Liabilities_ "), (i) arising out of or
based upon any untrue, or allegedly untrue, statement of a material fact
contained in any Registration Statement, prospectus or preliminary, final or
summary prospectus, Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or notification or
application (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished
any amendments or supplements thereto) or a document incorporated by reference
into any of the foregoing, (ii) arising out of or based upon any omission or
alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of
the circumstances under which such statements were made, except insofar as
such Liability arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission contained in such
Registration Statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, Issuer Free
Writing Prospectus, notification or application or incorporated document in
reliance and in conformity with information concerning such Holder furnished
in writing to the Company by such Holder specifically for use therein;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing indemnity with respect to any
preliminary prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Indemnified
Person from whom the Person asserting such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, expenses and judgments purchased securities if such untrue
statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in such
preliminary prospectus is eliminated or remedied in the prospectus and a copy
of the prospectus shall not have been furnished to such Person in a timely
manner due to the action or inaction of such Indemnified Person, whether as a
result of negligence or otherwise, or (iii) any violation by the Company of
any rule or regulation promulgated under the Securities Act or any state
securities laws applicable to the Company and relating to action or inaction
required of the Company in connection with any such registration, and the
Company will pay and reimburse such Holder and each such other Indemnified
Party (as defined below) for any legal or any other reasonable expenses
actually and reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating,
defending or settling any such loss, claim, liability, action or proceeding.
The Company shall

  



  

-18-

     

also provide customary indemnities to any underwriters of the Registrable
Securities, their officers, directors and employees and each Person who
controls such underwriters (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities
Act) to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification
of the Holders.

  

7.2 _Indemnification by Holders_. In connection with any Registration
Statement in which a Holder is participating pursuant to Article III, Article
IV or Article V hereof, each such Holder shall promptly furnish to the Company
in writing such information with respect to such Holder as the Company may
reasonably request or as may be required by law for use in connection with any
such Registration Statement or prospectus and all information required to be
disclosed in order to make the information previously furnished to the Company
by such Holder not materially misleading or necessary to cause such
Registration Statement or prospectus not to omit a material fact with respect
to such Holder necessary in order to make the statements therein not
misleading. Each Holder agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and
hold harmless the Company, its directors, officers, Affiliates, any
underwriter retained by the Company and each Person who controls the Company
or such underwriter (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act)
to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to the Holders,
but only if such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or
alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with information
with respect to such Holder furnished in writing to the Company by such Holder
specifically for use in such Registration Statement or preliminary, final or
summary prospectus or amendment or supplement, or a document incorporated by
reference into any of the foregoing; _provided_ , _however_ , that the total
amount to be indemnified by such Holder pursuant to this Section 7.2 shall be
limited to the net proceeds (after deducting the underwriters discounts and
commissions) received by such Holder from the sale of Registrable Securities
in the offering to which the Registration Statement or prospectus relates.

  

7.3 _Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings_. Any Person entitled to
indemnification hereunder (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") agrees to give prompt
written notice to the indemnifying party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") after
the receipt by the Indemnified Party of any written notice of the commencement
of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation or threat thereof made in
writing for which the Indemnified Party intends to claim indemnification or
contribution pursuant to this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of any Liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party hereunder
(except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced or
otherwise forfeits substantive rights or defenses by reason of such failure).
If notice of commencement of any such action is given to the Indemnifying
Party as above provided, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to
participate in and, to the extent it may wish, jointly with any other
Indemnifying Party similarly notified, to assume the defense of such action at
its own expense, with counsel chosen by it and reasonably satisfactory to such
Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ
separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof,
but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be paid by the Indemnified
Party unless (i) the Indemnifying Party agrees to pay the same, (ii) the
Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense of such action with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party or (iii) the named parties
to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and the Indemnified Party has
been advised by such counsel that either (x) representation of such

  



  

-19-

     

Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party by the same counsel would be
inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct or (y) there
may be one or more legal defenses available to the Indemnified Party which are
different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party. In
any of such cases, the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume
the defense of such action on behalf of such Indemnified Party, it being
understood, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for the
fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to
any local counsel) for all Indemnified Parties. No Indemnifying Party shall be
liable for any settlement entered into without its written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. No
Indemnifying Party shall, without the consent of such Indemnified
Party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in
respect of which such Indemnified Party is a party and indemnity has been
sought hereunder by such Indemnified Party, unless such settlement includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability for claims
that are the subject matter of such proceeding.

7.4

  |  

_Contribution_. 

---|---|--- 
 

   (a) If the indemnification provided for in this Article VII from
the Indemnifying Party is unavailable to an Indemnified Party hereunder in
respect of any Liabilities referred to herein, then the Indemnifying Party, in
lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount
paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such Liabilities in
such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the
Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party in connection with the actions which
resulted in such Liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative faults of such Indemnifying Party and Indemnified
Party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any
action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has
been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such Indemnifying Party
or Indemnified Party, and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. The amount paid
or payable by a party as a result of the Liabilities referred to above shall
be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 7.1 and
7.2, any legal or other fees, charges or expenses reasonably incurred by such
party in connection with any investigation or proceeding; _provided_ , that
the total amount to be contributed by a Holder shall be limited to the net
proceeds (after deducting the underwriters discounts and commissions and less
the aggregate amount which such Holder has otherwise been required to pay in
respect of such Liabilities) received by such Holder from the sale of
Registrable Securities in the offering.  

(b) The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this Section 7.4 were determined by pro rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of
the equitable considerations referred to in Section 7.4(a). No Person guilty
of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the
Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not
guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

ARTICLE VIII

  



  

 _COVENANTS_

  

8.1 _Rule 144_. The Company shall use its best efforts to file the
reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act in a timely manner and, if at any time the Company is not required to file
such reports, it will, upon the request of any Holder of Registrable
Securities, make publicly available other information so long as necessary to
permit sales of their securities pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities
Act, as such rule may be amended from time to time. The Company covenants that
it will take such further action as any Holder of Registrable Securities may
reasonably request (including providing any information necessary to comply
with Rule 144 under the Securities Act), all to the extent required from time
to time to enable such Holder to sell Registrable Securities without
registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions
provided by Rule 144 under the Securities Act, as such rule may be amended
from time to time, or any similar rules or regulations hereafter adopted by
the Commission. The Company will provide a copy of this Agreement to
prospective purchasers of Registrable Securities identified to the Company by
the Holders upon request. Upon the request of any Holder of Registrable
Securities, the Company shall deliver to such Holder a written statement as to
whether it has complied with such requirements. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in this Section 8.1 shall be deemed to require the Company to register
any of its securities pursuant to the Exchange Act.

  

ARTICLE IX

  



  

MISCELLANEOUS

  

9.1 _Recapitalizations, Exchanges, etc_. The provisions of this
Agreement shall apply to the full extent set forth herein with respect to (i)
the Common Shares, (ii) the Warrants, (iii) the Warrant Shares, and (iv) any
and all equity securities of the Company or any successor or assign of the
Company (whether by merger, consolidation, sale of assets or otherwise) which
may be issued in respect of, in conversion of, in exchange for or in
substitution of, the Common Shares, the Warrants or the Warrant Shares. The
Company shall cause any successor or assign (whether by merger, consolidation,
sale of assets or otherwise) to enter into a new registration rights agreement
with the Designated Holders on terms substantially the same as this Agreement
as a condition of any such transaction.

  

9.2 _No Inconsistent Agreements_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 9.2_
, the Company represents and warrants that it has not granted to any Person
the right to request or require the Company to register any securities issued
by the Company, other than the rights granted to the Holders herein.

  

9.3 _Remedies_. The Holders, in addition to being entitled to exercise
all rights granted under this Agreement or by law, including recovery of
damages, shall be entitled to specific performance of their rights under this
Agreement. The Company agrees that monetary damages would not be adequate
compensation for any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of the
provisions of this Agreement and hereby agrees to waive in any action for
specific performance the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate.

Holders, such Designated Holders consent in writing shall be required.

  

9.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which
when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. The parties hereto
confirm that any facsimile copy of another partys executed counterpart of
this Agreement (or its signature page thereof) will be deemed to be an
executed original thereof.

---|---|--- 
 

  

(a) Each Designated Holder hereby irrevocably appoints FS Private

successor appointed pursuant to the terms hereof, the " _Holder
Representative_ ") to receive all notices and other communications to be given
by the Company to such Designated Holder pursuant to Section 4.3 or Section
5.1 hereof. In the event that the Holder Representative receives any notice or
other communication referred to in the immediately preceding sentence, the
Holder Representative shall give notice thereof to the applicable Designated
Holder as soon as reasonably practicable after such receipt. Anything in this
Section 9.16 or elsewhere in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding,
the Holder Representative shall not have any duty or responsibility except
those expressly set forth in the immediately two preceding sentences of this
Section 9.16(a), nor shall the Holder Representative have or be deemed to have
any fiduciary relationship with any

  



  

-25-

     

Designated Holder or the Company, and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this
Agreement or otherwise exist against the Holder Representative.

  

(b) In connection with the discharge of its duties as set forth in
Section 9.16(a), the Holder Representative shall be entitled to rely on the
notice information for any Designated Holder that is set forth on such
Designated Holders signature page hereto or that is contained in an Accession
Agreement delivered to the Holder Representative pursuant to Section 9.5
hereof (as applicable), or any other notice information for such Designated
Holder provided to the Holder Representative in compliance with Section 9.4
hereof. The Holder Representative shall not be under any obligation to
ascertain or inquire as to the accuracy of any such notice information or the
power or authority of any Person providing the Holder Representative with any
such notice information, and may rely conclusively upon and shall be fully
protected in acting upon such information.

  

(c) Neither the Holder Representative nor any of its officers,
directors, employees, agents or affiliates shall be liable to any Designated
Holder or the Company for any loss, damage, liability or expense that any
Designated Holder or the Company may suffer or incur in any way relating to or
arising out of the duties or responsibilities of the Holder Representative
hereunder, or the performance or non-performance thereof, except to the extent
that any such loss, damage, liability or expense results from the applicable
Persons gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith, as determined by a
non-appealable decision by a court of competent jurisdiction.

  

(d) Each of the Designated Holders agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
the Holder Representative and its officers, directors, employees, agents and
affiliates, _pro_ _rata_ (based on each such Designated Holders ownership
percentage of the Registrable Securities as of the time indemnification is
demanded), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements of any kind whatsoever (including reasonable attorneys fees)
which may at any time be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the
Holder Representative or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents or
affiliates in any way relating to or arising out of the duties or
responsibilities of the Holder Representative hereunder, or the performance
or non-performance thereof, except to the extent that any thereof result from
the applicable Persons gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith, as
determined by a non-appealable decision by a court of competent jurisdiction.

  

(e) The Holder Representative may be replaced at any time for any reason
with a successor selected by the Designated Holders holding a majority of the
Registrable Securities held by all of the Designated Holders as of such time.
Any successor Holder Representative so selected shall become the Holder
Representative hereunder by signing a counterpart signature page to this
Agreement. In addition, the Holder Representative may resign from its position
as Holder Representative at any time by giving notice of such resignation to
the Company and the Designated Holders. Upon any such notice of resignation of
the Holder Representative, the Designated Holders holding a majority of the
Registrable Securities held by all of the Designated Holders shall appoint a
successor Holder Representative. Any resignation of a Holder Representative
shall take effect upon the acceptance by a successor Holder

Representative appointed as hereinabove provided. After a Holder
Representative has been replaced or resigned, the provisions of this Section
9.16 shall continue to inure to its benefit as to any matters relating to the

 **[Form of Lock-Up Letter]**

  

RAM Energy Resources, Inc.,

  

5100 E. Skelly Drive, Suite 650

  

Tulsa, OK 74135

  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  

The undersigned understands that RAM Energy Resources, Inc. ("RAM") has
entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated October __, 2007 (the
"Merger Agreement") providing for the merger of RAMs wholly owned subsidiary
Ascent Acquisition Corp. with and into Ascent Energy Inc. (the "Company") with
the Company surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of RAM (the "Merger"). The
undersigned will receive shares of the common stock of RAM, par value $0.0001
(the "Common Stock"), as part of the consideration delivered pursuant to the
terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement and the Note Payoff and
Recapitalization Agreement. Capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise
defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger
Agreement.

  

In consideration of, and as a condition to, the closing of the Merger
Agreement and the consummation of the Merger by RAM, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the undersigned hereby irrevocably agrees that,
without the prior written consent of RAM, the undersigned will not, during the
period commencing at the Effective Time and ending 180 days thereafter (the
"Lock-Up Period"), directly or indirectly sell, offer or contract to sell or
offer, grant any option or warrant for the sale of, assign, transfer or
otherwise dispose of (or enter into any transaction or device that is designed
to, or could be expected to, result in the disposition by any person at any
time in the future of), more than 50% of the total shares of Common Stock
issued to the undersigned at the Closing pursuant to the Merger Agreement and
the Note Payoff and Recapitalization Agreement (the "Restricted Securities");
provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall prohibit (i) the
exercise of warrants for the purchase of Common Stock (including the Warrants)
or other acquisitions of Common Stock, and (ii) the disposition of Restricted
Securities (A) by way of bona fide gifts, (B) to the direct and indirect
partners, members or stockholders of the undersigned in a manner that does not
constitute a "distribution" within the meaning of the Securities Act, or (C)
to immediate family members of the undersigned or a trust, partnership or
limited liability company for the benefit of the undersigned and/or such
family members; provided, however, that in each such case in this clause (ii)
it shall be a condition to such disposition that the transferee or transferees
execute an agreement stating that it or they are receiving and holding such
Restricted Securities subject to the provisions of this Lock-Up Letter
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the foregoing
restrictions on disposition shall not apply to the Warrants or to any shares
of Common Stock held or acquired by the undersigned, including shares of
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants, other than the Restricted
Securities. The certificates evidencing the Restricted Securities shall bear
an appropriate legend indicating that the transfer of the Restricted
Securities is restricted pursuant to the terms of this Lock-Up Letter
Agreement. The restrictions and obligations contained in this Lock-Up Letter
Agreement shall remain applicable to any Restricted Securities that are
transferred pursuant to RAMs written consent.

     

In furtherance of the foregoing, RAM and its transfer agent are hereby
authorized to decline to make any transfer of Restricted Securities if such
transfer would constitute a violation or breach of this Lock-Up Letter
Agreement.

  

ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS LOCK-UP LETTER AGREEMENT
SHALL BE BROUGHT IN ANY DELAWARE STATE COURT HAVING JURISDICTION OR IN THE
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE. EACH OF RAM (BY
ACCEPTING THIS LOCK-UP LETTER AGREEMENT) AND THE UNDERSIGNED (BY EXECUTION AND
DELIVERY OF THIS LOCK-UP LETTER AGREEMENT) IRREVOCABLY ACCEPTS AND SUBMITS
ITSELF TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY OBJECTION THAT IT MAY NOW OR
HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE JURISDICTION OR LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUCH LITIGATION
BROUGHT IN THE COURTS REFERENCED ABOVE AND ANY CLAIM THAT ANY SUCH LITIGATION
HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.

  

The undersigned understands that RAM will proceed with the Merger in reliance
on this Lock-Up Letter Agreement. This Lock-Up Letter Agreement will terminate
upon any valid termination of the Merger Agreement prior to the Effective
Time.

  

The undersigned hereby represents and warrants that the undersigned has full
power and authority to enter into this Lock-Up Letter Agreement and that, upon
request, the undersigned will execute any additional documents reasonably
necessary in connection with the enforcement hereof. Any obligations of the
undersigned shall be binding upon the heirs, personal representatives,
successors and assigns of the undersigned.

  

This Lock-Up Letter Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with laws of the State of Delaware without regard to the law that might
otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law.
