                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

         This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this "Agreement") is made and
entered into as of October 15, 2000, by and among CORIXA CORPORATION, a Delaware
corporation ("Corixa"), CLEARWATER ACQUISITIONS CORPORATION, a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Corixa ("Merger Sub"), and COULTER
PHARMACEUTICAL, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Coulter").

                                    RECITALS

         A. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and
in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law ("Delaware Law"),
Corixa, Merger Sub and Coulter intend to enter into a business combination
transaction pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into Coulter (the
"Merger").

         B. The Board of Directors of Coulter has (i) determined that the Merger
is advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Coulter and its
stockholders and has approved this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) recommended the approval of
this Agreement by the stockholders of Coulter.

         C. The Board of Directors of Corixa has (i) determined that the Merger
is advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Corixa and its
stockholders and has approved this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) recommended the approval of
the issuance of the shares of Corixa Common Stock (as defined below) in the
Merger by the stockholders of Corixa. The Board of Directors of Merger Sub has
determined that the Merger is advisable and fair to, and in the best interests
of, Merger Sub and its sole stockholder and has approved this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The sole
stockholder of Merger Sub has approved this Agreement.

         D. Coulter, Merger Sub and Corixa each desire to make certain
representations and warranties and other agreements in connection with the
Merger.

         E. The parties intend, by executing this Agreement (i) to adopt a plan
of reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), (ii) to cause the Merger to qualify as a
reorganization under the provisions of Section 368 of the Code, and (iii) that
the Merger be accounted for as a purchase for financial reporting purposes.

         F. In order to induce Corixa to enter into this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, concurrently with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, certain holders of voting capital
stock of Coulter are entering into voting agreements and proxies with Corixa
(the "Coulter Voting Agreements").

         G. In order to induce Coulter to enter into this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, concurrently with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, certain holders of voting capital
stock of Corixa are entering into voting agreements and proxies with Coulter
(the "Corixa Voting Agreements").

                                    AGREEMENT

         The parties hereby agree as follows:

                                   SECTION ONE

         1. THE MERGER.

         1.1 THE MERGER. At the Effective Time (as defined below) and subject to
and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger
attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Certificate of Merger") and the applicable
provisions of Delaware Law, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Coulter,
the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Coulter shall
continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger. Coulter as the surviving
corporation after the Merger is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the
"Surviving Corporation."

         1.2 CLOSING; EFFECTIVE TIME. The closing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place as soon as
practicable, and in no event later than three (3) business days, after the
satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in Section 6 or at
such other time as the parties agree (the "Closing Date"). In connection with
the Closing, the parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing the
Certificate of Merger, together with any required officers' certificates, with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "Delaware Secretary"), in
accordance with the relevant provisions of Delaware Law (the time of such filing
being the "Effective Time"). The Closing shall take place at the offices of
Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, 701 Fifth Avenue, Suite 6500, Seattle,
Washington 98104-7043, or at such other location as the parties agree. If the
Delaware Secretary requires any changes in the Certificate of Merger as a
condition to filing or issuing a certificate to the effect that the Merger is
effective, Corixa, Merger Sub and Coulter will execute any necessary revisions
incorporating such changes, provided such changes are not inconsistent with and
do not result in any material change in the terms of this Agreement.

         1.3 EFFECT OF THE MERGER. At the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the
applicable provisions of Delaware Law. At the Effective Time, all the property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Merger Sub shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of Merger Sub shall
become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

         1.4 CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION; BYLAWS.

               (a) At the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of
Merger Sub (the "Certificate of Incorporation"), as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time,

                                      -2-
<PAGE>   10
shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended as provided by Delaware Law and such Certificate of
Incorporation.

               (b) At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by Delaware Law, the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such Bylaws.

         1.5 DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. At the Effective Time, the directors and
officers of Coulter shall resign and the directors of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation,
and the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

         1.6 EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK. By virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Corixa, Coulter or Merger Sub or any of their respective
stockholders, the following shall occur at the Effective Time:

               (a) Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock. Each share of Common
Stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into one share of Common Stock of the Surviving
Corporation (the "Surviving Corporation Common Stock").

               (b) Conversion of Coulter Common Stock. Each share of Common
Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Coulter (the "Coulter Common Stock")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 1.6(c)) shall be automatically
converted into 1.003 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of
Corixa (the "Corixa Common Stock") (the "Exchange Ratio"). All shares of Coulter
Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder
of a certificate representing any such shares of Coulter Common Stock shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
shares of Corixa Common Stock therefor upon the surrender of such certificate in
accordance with Section 1.7, without interest.

               (c) Cancellation of Coulter Common Stock Owned by Corixa or
Coulter. At the Effective Time, all shares of Coulter Common Stock that are
owned by Coulter as treasury stock and all shares of Coulter Common Stock owned
by Corixa or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Corixa or of
Coulter immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof.

               (d) Coulter Stock Options.

                  (i) All options to purchase Coulter Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time under the Coulter 1995
Equity Incentive Plan (the "1995 Plan") and the Coulter 1996 Equity Incentive
Plan (the "1996 Plan," and, together with the 1995 Plan, the "Coulter Stock
Option Plans"), and the Coulter Stock Option

                                      -3-
<PAGE>   11
Plans, shall be assumed by Corixa at the Effective Time (the options being
assumed being referred to as the "Assumed Options"), and all commitments to
issue shares of Coulter Common Stock described in Section 2.8 of the Coulter
Disclosure Schedule (the "BLA Bonus Shares") shall be assumed by Corixa (and
shall be converted into commitments to issue a number of shares of Corixa Common
Stock equal to the number of shares of Coulter Common Stock covered thereby
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, with cash being paid for any fractional share
(with respect to the BLA Bonus Shares) based upon the average of the last
reported sales prices of the Corixa Common Stock for the twenty (20) consecutive
trading days ending on the trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date)
(it being understood that notwithstanding the assumption of the Assumed Options
and the commitments to issue the BLA Bonus Shares, Corixa shall not be required
to issue more shares pursuant to the exercise of the Assumed Options and the
performance of the commitments to issue the BLA Shares than are currently
reserved under the Coulter Stock Option Plans, as such reserve shall be adjusted
based on the Exchange Ratio).

                  (ii) At the Effective Time, the Assumed Options shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any further action at such time on the part of
Coulter or the holder thereof, be assumed by Corixa in accordance with this
Section 1.6(d). Each such Assumed Option shall continue to have, and be subject
to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the respective Coulter Stock
Option Plan and any applicable stock option agreement immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except that (A) such Assumed Option will be exercisable for that
number of whole shares of Corixa Common Stock equal to the product of the number
of shares of Coulter Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such
Assumed Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio and rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Corixa
Common Stock and (B) the per share exercise price for the shares of Corixa
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Assumed Option will be equal to the
quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Coulter Common
Stock at which such Assumed Option was exercisable immediately prior to the
Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

                  (iii) It is the intention of the parties that, to the extent
practicable, the Assumed Options shall qualify following the Effective Time as
incentive stock options as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the extent such
Assumed Options qualified as incentive stock options immediately prior to the
Effective Time. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Corixa will
issue to each person who, immediately prior to the Effective Time was a holder
of an Assumed Option, a written document evidencing the foregoing assumption of
such Assumed Option by Corixa pursuant to this Section 1.6(d).

               (e) Employee Stock Purchase Plan. At the Effective Time, in
accordance with the terms of the Coulter 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
"Coulter ESPP" and, together with the Coulter Stock Option Plans, the "Coulter
Equity Plans"), all rights to purchase shares of Coulter Common Stock under the
Coulter ESPP ("Purchase Rights") shall be converted (in accordance with the
Exchange Ratio) into rights to purchase shares of Corixa Common Stock and all
such converted Purchase Rights shall be assumed by Corixa and the offering
periods in effect under the Coulter ESPP immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall

                                      -4-
<PAGE>   12
be continued substantially in accordance with the terms of the Coulter ESPP
until the end of the offering periods in effect as of the Effective Time (it
being understood that notwithstanding the assumption of the Coulter ESPP, Corixa
shall not be required to issue more shares under the Coulter ESPP than are
currently reserved and available for issuance thereunder, as such reserve and
available share number shall be adjusted based on the Exchange Ratio).

               (f) Adjustments. The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect
fully the effect of any forward stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend
(including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Corixa
Common Stock or Coulter Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other
like change with respect to Corixa Common Stock or Coulter Common Stock
occurring or having a record date after the date of this Agreement and prior to
the Effective Time.

               (g) Fractional Shares. No fraction of a share of Corixa Common
Stock will be issued, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of Coulter
Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Corixa
Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Corixa Common Stock to
be received by such holder) shall receive from Corixa an amount of cash (rounded
to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) such fraction, multiplied
by (ii) the average of the last reported sales prices of the Corixa Common Stock
for the twenty (20) consecutive trading days ending on the trading day
immediately preceding the Closing Date.

               (h) Unvested Shares. If any shares of Coulter Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject
to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition under any
applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with Coulter,
then the shares of Corixa Common Stock issued in exchange for such shares of
Coulter Common Stock will also be unvested and subject to the same repurchase
option, risk of forfeiture or other condition and the certificates representing
such shares of Corixa Common Stock may accordingly be marked with appropriate
legends.

         1.7 SURRENDER OF CERTIFICATES.

               (a) Exchange Agent. ComputerShare Investor Services, LLC shall
act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") in the Merger.


               (b) Corixa to Provide Common Stock and Cash. Promptly after the
Effective Time, Corixa shall make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange
in accordance with this Section 1, through such reasonable procedures as Corixa
may adopt, (i) the shares of Corixa Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section
1.6(b) and (ii) cash in an amount sufficient to permit payment of cash in lieu
of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(g).

               (c) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates (the "Certificates") that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Coulter Common Stock, the
shares of which were converted into shares of Corixa Common Stock (and cash in
lieu of fractional shares) pursuant to Section 1.6, (i) a letter

                                      -5-
<PAGE>   13
of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon receipt of the
Certificates by the Exchange Agent, and shall be in such customary form and have
such other customary provisions as Corixa may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange
for certificates representing shares of Corixa Common Stock (and cash in lieu of
fractional shares). Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Corixa,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing the
number of whole shares of Corixa Common Stock and payment in lieu of fractional
shares that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.6, and
the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Until so
surrendered, each Certificate will be deemed from and after the Effective Time,
for all corporate purposes, to evidence the ownership of the number of full
shares of Corixa Common Stock into which such shares of Coulter Common Stock
shall have been so converted and the right to receive an amount in cash in lieu
of the issuance of any fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.6.

               (d) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 1.7, none of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or any
party hereto shall be liable to any person for any amount properly paid to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.

               (e) Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No
dividends or other distributions with respect to Corixa Common Stock with a
record date on or after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Corixa Common Stock
represented thereby until the holder of record of such Certificate shall
surrender such Certificate. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of
any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the
certificate representing whole shares of Corixa Common Stock issued in exchange
therefor, without interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount of any
such dividends or other distributions with a record date on or after the
Effective Time, payable (but for the provisions of this Section 1.7(e)) with
respect to such shares of Corixa Common Stock.

               (f) Transfers of Ownership. If any certificate for shares of
Corixa Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a
condition of such issuance that the Certificate so surrendered will be properly
endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person
requesting such exchange will have paid to Corixa or any agent designated by it
any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate
for shares of Corixa Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of
Corixa or any agent designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not
payable.

         1.8 NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN COULTER COMMON STOCK. All shares of
Corixa Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Coulter
Common

                                      -6-
<PAGE>   14
Stock in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid in lieu of
fractional shares) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such shares of Coulter Common Stock, and there shall be
no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation
of shares of Coulter Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Section 1.

         1.9 TAX CONSEQUENCES. It is intended by the parties that the Merger
shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code.
The parties hereto adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the
meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States Income Tax
Regulations. Each party hereto and its affiliates agree to treat the Merger as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code. Each party has
consulted with its own tax advisors with regard to the tax consequences of the
Merger.

         1.10 ACCOUNTING TREATMENT. For accounting purposes, the business
combination to be affected by the Merger is intended to be treated as a
purchase.

         1.11 TAKING OF NECESSARY ACTION; FURTHER ACTION. If at any time after
the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of Coulter, Coulter agrees that the officers and directors of
Coulter are fully authorized in the name of Coulter or otherwise to take, and
will take, all such lawful and necessary action, so long as such action is not
inconsistent with this Agreement.

         1.12 WITHHOLDING. Corixa shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
shares of Coulter Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
provision of applicable state, local or foreign tax laws. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by Corixa, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such holder in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation.

         1.13 LOST, STOLEN OR DESTROYED CERTIFICATES. In the event any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of Corixa
Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares) as may be required pursuant
to Section 1.6; provided, however, that Corixa may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to such issuance, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as Corixa may reasonably
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Corixa or the
Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

            Except as disclosed with appropriate Section references in a
document dated as of the date of this Agreement and delivered by Coulter to
Corixa prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the "Coulter
Disclosure Schedule"), each of which exceptions shall be deemed to relate to and

or any Subsidiary of Coulter to issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any such securities.

               (c) Neither Coulter nor any Subsidiary of Coulter directly or
indirectly owns any equity or similar interest in, or any interest convertible
into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any equity or similar interest in, any

               (b) All outstanding shares of Coulter Common Stock are duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and are free of any
liens or encumbrances other than any liens or encumbrances created by or imposed
upon the holders thereof, and are not subject to preemptive rights or rights of
first refusal created by statute, the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws

               (d) Coulter has not taken any action that would result in the
accelerated vesting, exercisability or payment of any options to purchase

the transactions contemplated by, this Agreement. The Merger will not accelerate
the vesting, exercisability or payment of Assumed Options or the shares of

agreements thereunder have been made available to Corixa and such Coulter Stock
Option Plans and agreements have not been amended, modified or supplemented, and

general as from time to time in effect or (b) the exercise by courts of equity
powers.

         2.5 NO CONFLICTS; REQUIRED FILINGS AND CONSENTS.

               (a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Coulter does
not, and the consummation by Coulter of the transactions contemplated hereby
will not, conflict with, or result in a violation of, any provision of the
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of Coulter or any Subsidiary of Coulter,
as amended to date and as currently in full force and effect. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Coulter does not, and the consummation by Coulter
of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, conflict with, or result in a
material violation of, or material default under (with or without notice or
lapse of time, or both), or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration of any obligation or loss of any material benefit under, any
material mortgage, indenture, lease, contract or other material agreement or

laws, regulations, policies, procedures and specifications with respect to the
development, design, manufacture, labeling, testing and inspection of the
Products and the operation of manufacturing facilities promulgated by the Food
and Drug Administration (the "FDA"). Since January 1, 1998, there have been no

         2.11 TITLE TO PROPERTY.

               (a) Coulter and each Subsidiary has good and marketable title to
all of its respective material properties, material interests in properties and
material assets, real and personal, reflected in the Coulter Balance Sheet or
acquired after the Coulter Balance Sheet Date (except properties, interests in
properties and assets sold or otherwise disposed of since the Coulter Balance
Sheet Date in the ordinary course of business), or with respect to leased
properties and assets, valid leasehold interests in such leased properties and
assets, free and clear of all mortgages, liens, pledges, charges or encumbrances
of any kind or character, except (i) liens related to current taxes not yet due
and payable, (ii) such imperfections of title, liens and easements as do not and
will not detract from or interfere with the use of the properties subject
thereto or affected thereby, or otherwise impair business operations involving
such properties, and (iii) liens securing debt that is reflected on the Coulter
Balance Sheet. The plants, property and equipment of Coulter and its
Subsidiaries that are used in the operations of their businesses are in good
operating condition and repair. All properties used in the operations of Coulter
and its Subsidiaries are reflected in the Coulter Balance Sheet to the extent
GAAP require the same to be reflected. Section 2.11(a) of the Coulter Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a true, correct and complete list of all real property owned
or leased by Coulter and by each Subsidiary of Coulter. Such leases are in good
standing and are valid and effective in accordance with their respective terms
(except as enforcement thereof may be limited by (X) bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and similar laws, both state and federal, affecting
the enforcement of creditors' rights or remedies in general as from time to time
in effect or (Y) the exercise by courts of equity powers), and there is not
under any such leases any existing material default or material event of default
(or event that with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a
material default).

               (b) All material equipment owned or leased by Coulter and its
Subsidiaries is, taken as a whole, (i) adequate for the conduct of Coulter's
business, consistent with its past practice, and (ii) in good operating
condition (except for ordinary wear and tear).

         2.12 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

               (a) Coulter and each of its Subsidiaries owns all right, title
and interest in and to, or is licensed to use or otherwise possesses the rights
under, all patents, patent rights, trademarks, trademark rights, trade names,
trade name rights, domain names, service marks, copyrights and any applications
for any of the foregoing, net lists, schematics, industrial models, inventions,
technology, know-how, trade secrets, ideas, algorithms, processes, computer
software programs or applications (in both source code and object code form),
and other intangible proprietary information or material ("Intellectual
Property") that are used in the business of Coulter or any Subsidiary of Coulter
as currently conducted by Coulter or any Subsidiary of Coulter (the "Coulter
Intellectual Property").

               (b) Section 2.12 of the Coulter Disclosure Schedule lists (i) all
material patents and patent applications and all material registered and
unregistered trademarks, trade names and service marks, and registered
copyrights and domain names, included in the Coulter Intellectual Property that
are owned or purported to be owned by Coulter or any Subsidiary of

                                      -16-
<PAGE>   24
Coulter, including the jurisdictions in which each such Coulter Intellectual
Property right has been issued or registered or in which any application for
such issuance and registration has been filed, (ii) all material licenses,
sublicenses and other agreements as to which Coulter or any Subsidiary of
Coulter is a party and pursuant to which any person is authorized to use any
material Coulter Intellectual Property, and (iii) all material licenses,
sublicenses and other agreements as to which Coulter or any Subsidiary of
Coulter is a party and pursuant to which Coulter or any Subsidiary of Coulter is
authorized to use any third-party patents, trademarks or copyrights, including
software (third-party patents, trademarks and copyrights, including software,
being used by Coulter or any Subsidiary of Coulter being referred to in this
Agreement as "Coulter Third-Party Intellectual Property Rights"). Neither
Coulter nor any Subsidiary of Coulter nor, to the knowledge of Coulter, any
third party is in material violation of any license, sublicense or agreement
described in Section 2.12 of the Coulter Disclosure Schedule. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Coulter and the consummation by Coulter of the
transactions contemplated hereby will neither cause Coulter or any Subsidiary of
Coulter to be in material violation or material default under any such license,
sublicense or agreement, nor entitle any other party to any such license,
sublicense or agreement to terminate or modify such license, sublicense or
agreement. To the knowledge of Coulter, Coulter is the sole and exclusive owner
of, with all right, title and interest in and to (free and clear of any liens),
the Coulter Intellectual Property purported to be owned by Coulter, and, subject
to any license agreements to which Coulter is a party and pursuant to which
Coulter licenses others to use any such Coulter Intellectual Property, has sole
and exclusive rights (and is not contractually obligated to pay any compensation
to any third party in respect thereof) to the use thereof or the material
covered thereby in connection with the services or products in respect of which
such Coulter Intellectual Property is being used.

               (c) To the knowledge of Coulter, there is no unauthorized use,
disclosure, infringement or misappropriation of any Coulter Intellectual
Property rights, by any third party, including any employee or former employee
of Coulter or any Subsidiary of Coulter. Neither Coulter nor any Subsidiary of
Coulter has entered into any agreement to indemnify any other person against any
charge of infringement of any Intellectual Property, other than indemnification
provisions contained in purchase orders or agreements for the sale, license or
distribution of any Coulter Intellectual Property or products containing Coulter
Intellectual Property arising in the ordinary course of business.

               (d) Except as disclosed in Section 2.5 of the Coulter Disclosure
Schedule with respect to third party consents, neither Coulter nor any
Subsidiary of Coulter is or will be, as a result of the execution and delivery
of this Agreement or the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, in
breach of any license, sublicense or other agreement relating to the Coulter
Intellectual Property.

               (e) All patents, registered trademarks, service marks and
copyrights held by Coulter or any Subsidiary of Coulter are valid and subsisting
and there is no assertion or claim pending challenging the validity of any
Coulter Intellectual Property owned by Coulter or a Subsidiary of Coulter.
Coulter is not being sued in any suit, action or proceeding that involves a
claim of infringement of any patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights or
violation of any

                                      -17-
<PAGE>   25
trade secret or other proprietary right of any third party, nor, to the
knowledge of Coulter, is any such suit, action or proceeding being threatened
against Coulter or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither the conduct of the business
of Coulter and each Subsidiary of Coulter as currently conducted nor the
development, manufacture, sale, licensing or use of any of the products of
Coulter or any Subsidiary of Coulter as now developed, manufactured, sold,
licensed or used infringes on, in any way, any license, trademark, trademark
right, trade name, trade name right, valid patent, valid patent right,
industrial model, invention, service mark, domain name or copyright of any third
party. No third party is challenging the ownership by Coulter or any Subsidiary
of Coulter, or the validity or effectiveness of, any of the Coulter Intellectual
Property owned by Coulter or a Subsidiary of Coulter. Neither Coulter nor any
Subsidiary of Coulter is bringing any action, suit or proceeding for
infringement of Coulter Intellectual Property or breach of any license or
agreement involving Intellectual Property against any third party. There are no
pending or threatened interference, re-examinations, oppositions or nullities
involving any patents, patent rights or applications therefor of Coulter or any
Subsidiary of Coulter, except such as may have been commenced by Coulter or any
Subsidiary of Coulter.

               (f) Each Coulter Participating Developer (as defined below) has
signed an intellectual property assignment agreement that legally, fully and
effectively transfers to Coulter any and all right, title and interest which the
named Coulter Participating Developer may have or acquire in and to the Coulter
Intellectual Property. "Coulter Participating Developer" means any employee or
consultant of Coulter who contributed and/or is contributing to the creation or
development of material Coulter Intellectual Property.

               (g) Coulter has taken all commercially reasonable steps to
protect and preserve the confidentiality of all Coulter Intellectual Property
not otherwise protected by patents, patent applications or copyright ("Coulter
Confidential Information"). Each of Coulter and its Subsidiaries has a policy
requiring each employee, consultant and independent contractor to execute
proprietary information and confidentiality agreements substantially in
Coulter's standard forms.

payment of amounts referred to in Clause (A) as a result of being a member of
any affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group, or (C) any liability

                  (ii) The term "Returns" shall mean all reports, estimates,
declarations of estimated tax, information statements and returns, including any

               (b) All Returns required to be filed by or on behalf of Coulter
or any Subsidiary of Coulter have been duly filed on a timely basis (including
any extensions of due dates) and such Returns are true, complete and correct in
all material respects. All Taxes shown to be payable on such Returns or on
subsequent assessments with respect thereto, and all payments of estimated Taxes
required to be made by or on behalf of Coulter or any Subsidiary of Coulter
under Section 6655 of the Code or comparable provisions of state, local or
foreign law, have been paid in full on a timely basis, and no other Taxes are

accruals for Taxes reflected on the Coulter Financials, and the Coulter
Financials properly accrue, in accordance with GAAP, all liabilities for Taxes
of Coulter and its Subsidiaries payable after the date of the Coulter Financials
attributable to transactions and events occurring prior to such date. No

                                      -20-
<PAGE>   28

ordinary course of business.

               (d) Coulter has furnished or made available to Corixa true and
complete copies of (i) relevant portions of income tax audit reports, statements
of deficiencies, closing or other agreements received by or on behalf of Coulter
or any Subsidiary of Coulter relating to Taxes and (ii) all federal, state and
foreign income or franchise tax returns and state sales and use tax Returns for
or including Coulter and its Subsidiaries for all periods since January 1, 1998.

set forth in Section 2.14 of the Coulter Disclosure Schedule.

               (e) No audit of the Returns of or including Coulter and its
Subsidiaries by a Governmental Entity or taxing authority is in process, or, to
the knowledge of Coulter, threatened (either in writing or verbally, formally or
informally). No deficiencies exist or are being asserted (either in writing or
verbally, formally or informally) or are expected to be asserted with respect to
Taxes of Coulter or any of its Subsidiaries and, since January 1, 1998, Coulter
has not received written notice nor does it expect to receive any such notice
that it or any of its Subsidiaries has not filed a Return or paid Taxes required
to be filed or paid. Neither Coulter nor any Subsidiary of Coulter is a party to
any action or proceeding for assessment or collection of Taxes nor has such
event been asserted or threatened (either in writing or verbally)against
Coulter, any Subsidiary of Coulter or any of their respective assets. No waiver
or extension of any statute of limitations is in effect with respect to Taxes or
Returns of Coulter or any Subsidiary of Coulter. There are no Tax rulings,
requests for rulings or closing agreements relating to Coulter or any Subsidiary
of Coulter that would reasonably be expected to affect the liability for Taxes
or the amount of taxable income of Coulter or any Subsidiary of Coulter for any
period (or portion of a period) after the date hereof. Coulter and each
Subsidiary of Coulter has disclosed on its federal and state income and
franchise tax returns all positions taken therein that could give rise to a
substantial understatement penalty within the meaning of Section 6662 of the
Code or comparable provisions of applicable state tax laws. Any adjustment of
Taxes of Coulter or any Subsidiary of Coulter made by the Internal Revenue
Service (the "IRS") in any examination that is required to be reported to the
appropriate state, local or foreign taxing authorities has been reported, and
any additional Taxes due with respect thereto have been paid.

               (f) Coulter and its Subsidiaries are not (nor have they ever

<PAGE>   30
With respect to each Coulter Employee Plan that is not in writing, Coulter has
provided a summary of such plan's material terms. Each Coulter Employee Plan
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has either obtained
from the IRS a favorable determination letter as to its qualified status under
the Code, including all amendments to the Code effected by the Tax Reform Act of
1986 and subsequent legislation, or has applied to the IRS for such a
determination letter with respect to which the requisite period under applicable
Treasury Regulations or IRS pronouncements in which to apply for such
determination letter and to make any amendments necessary to obtain a favorable
determination has expired. Coulter has also furnished or made available to
Corixa the most recent IRS determination letter issued with respect to each such
Coulter Employee Plan, and nothing has occurred since the issuance of each such
letter that could reasonably be expected to cause the loss of the tax-qualified
status of any Coulter Employee Plan subject to Section 401(a) of the Code.

retiree medical or other retiree welfare or life insurance benefits to any

Employee Plan; (iii) each Coulter Employee Plan has been administered in all
material respects in accordance with its terms and in compliance in all material
respects with the requirements prescribed by any and all statutes, rules and

Coulter or ERISA Affiliate have performed in all material respects all
obligations required to be performed by them under, and are not in material
default under or in material violation of, any of the Coulter Employee Plans;

to any material liability or material penalty under Sections 4976 through 4980
of the Code or Title I of ERISA with respect to any of the Coulter Employee
Plans; (v) all contributions required to be made by Coulter or any Subsidiary of
Coulter or ERISA Affiliate to any Coulter Employee Plan have been made on or
before their due dates and a reasonable amount has been accrued for
contributions to each Coulter Employee Plan for the current plan years; (vi)
with respect to each Coulter Employee Plan, no "reportable event" within the
meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA (excluding any such event for which the thirty
(30) day notice requirement has been waived under the regulations to Section
4043 of ERISA) or any event described in Section 4062, 4063 or 4041 of ERISA has
occurred; (vii) no Coulter Employee Plan is covered by, and neither Coulter nor
any Subsidiary of Coulter or ERISA Affiliate has incurred or expects to incur
any direct or indirect liability under, arising out of or by operation of, Title
IV of ERISA in connection with the termination of, or an employer's withdrawal
from, any Coulter Employee Plan or other retirement plan or arrangement, or
under Section 412 of the Code; (viii) Coulter and its Subsidiaries have not
incurred any liability under, and have complied in all respects with, the Worker
Adjustment Retraining Notification Act (the "WARN Act") and, to the knowledge of
Coulter, no fact or event exists as of the date of this Agreement that would
reasonably be expected to give rise to liability under the WARN Act; and (ix) no
compensation paid or payable to any employee of Coulter or any Subsidiary of
Coulter has been, or will be, nondeductible by reason of application of Section
162(m) of the Code. With respect to each Coulter Employee Plan subject to ERISA
as either an employee pension plan within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA
or an employee welfare benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA,
Coulter has prepared in all

                                      -23-

reports (which were true and correct as of the date filed) and has properly and
timely filed and distributed or posted all notices and reports to employees
required to be filed, distributed or posted with respect to each such Coulter
Employee Plan. No suit, administrative proceeding, action or other litigation is
being brought or, to the knowledge of Coulter, is threatened against, or with
respect to, any such Coulter Employee Plan, including any audit or inquiry by
the IRS or United States Department of Labor. Neither Coulter nor any Subsidiary
or other ERISA Affiliate is a party to, or has made any contribution to or
otherwise incurred any obligation under, any "multiemployer plan" as defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA.

of 1993 and the regulations thereunder, and (iii) the applicable notice
requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of

severance benefits or any other payment, except as expressly provided in this
Agreement, or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting of any such
benefits (except as required under Section 411(d)(3) of the Code), or increase
the amount of compensation due any such employee or service provider.

               (e) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or
announcement (whether or not written) by Coulter, any Subsidiary of Coulter or
other ERISA Affiliate relating to, or change in participation or coverage under,
any Coulter Employee Plan that would increase the expense of maintaining such
Coulter Employee Plan above the level of expense incurred with respect to that
Coulter Employee Plan for the most recent fiscal year included in the Coulter
Financials.

               (f) Neither Coulter nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
obligations under COBRA with respect to any former employees or their related
qualifying beneficiaries.

               (b) Section 3.12 of the Corixa Disclosure Schedule lists (i) all
material patents and patent applications and all material registered and
unregistered trademarks, trade names and service marks, and registered
copyrights and domain names, included in the Corixa Intellectual Property that
are owned or purported to be owned by Corixa or any Subsidiary of Corixa,
including the jurisdictions in which each such Corixa Intellectual Property
right has been issued or registered or in which any application for such
issuance and registration has been filed, (ii) all material licenses,
sublicenses and other agreements as to which Corixa or any Subsidiary of Corixa
is a party and pursuant to which any person is authorized to use any material
Corixa Intellectual Property, and (iii) all material licenses, sublicenses and
other agreements as to which Corixa or any Subsidiary of Corixa is a party and
pursuant to which Corixa or any Subsidiary of Corixa is authorized to use any
third-party patents, trademarks or copyrights, including software (third-party
patents, trademarks and copyrights, including software, being used by Corixa or
any Subsidiary of Corixa being referred to in this Agreement as "Corixa
Third-Party Intellectual Property Rights"). Neither Corixa nor any Subsidiary of
Corixa nor, to the knowledge of Corixa, any third party is in material violation
of any license, sublicense or agreement described in Section 3.12 of the Corixa
Disclosure Schedule. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Corixa and
the consummation by Corixa of the transactions contemplated hereby will neither
cause Corixa or any Subsidiary of Corixa to be in material violation or material
default under any such license, sublicense or agreement, nor entitle any other
party to any such license, sublicense or agreement to terminate or modify such
license, sublicense or agreement. To the knowledge of Corixa, Corixa is the sole
and exclusive owner of, with all right, title and interest in and to (free and
clear of any liens), the Corixa Intellectual Property purported to be owned by
Corixa, and, subject to any license agreements to which Corixa is a party and
pursuant to which Corixa licenses others to use any such Corixa Intellectual
Property, has sole and exclusive rights (and is not contractually obligated to
pay any compensation to any third party in respect thereof) to the use thereof
or the material covered thereby in connection with the services or products in
respect of which such Corixa Intellectual Property is being used.

               (c) To the knowledge of Corixa, there is no unauthorized use,
disclosure, infringement or misappropriation of any Corixa Intellectual Property

Corixa. Neither Corixa nor any Subsidiary of Corixa has entered into any
agreement to indemnify any other person against any charge of infringement of
any Intellectual Property, other than indemnification provisions contained in
purchase orders or agreements for the sale, license or distribution of any
Corixa Intellectual Property or products containing Corixa Intellectual Property
arising in the ordinary course of business.

               (d) Except as disclosed in Section 3.5 of the Corixa Disclosure
Schedule with respect to third party consents, neither Corixa nor any Subsidiary
of Corixa is or will be, as a result of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, in breach
of any license, sublicense or other agreement relating to the Corixa
Intellectual Property.

               (e) All patents, registered trademarks, service marks and
copyrights held by Corixa or any Subsidiary of Corixa are valid and subsisting
and there is no assertion or claim

                                      -36-
<PAGE>   44
pending challenging the validity of any Corixa Intellectual Property owned by
Corixa or a Subsidiary of Corixa. Corixa has is not being sued in any suit,
action or proceeding that involves a claim of infringement of any patents,
trademarks, service marks, copyrights or violation of any trade secret or other
proprietary right of any third party, nor, to the knowledge of Corixa, is any
such suit, action or proceeding being threatened against Corixa or any of its
Subsidiaries. Neither the conduct of the business of Corixa and each Subsidiary
of Corixa as currently conducted nor the development, manufacture, sale,
licensing or use of any of the products of Corixa or any Subsidiary of Corixa as
now developed, manufactured, sold, licensed or used infringes on, in any way,
any license, trademark, trademark right, trade name, trade name right, valid
patent, valid patent right, industrial model, invention, service mark, domain
name or copyright of any third party. No third party is challenging the
ownership by Corixa or any Subsidiary of Corixa, or the validity or
effectiveness of, any of the Corixa Intellectual Property owned by Corixa or a
Subsidiary of Corixa. Neither Corixa nor any Subsidiary of Corixa is bringing
any action, suit or proceeding for infringement of Corixa Intellectual Property
or breach of any license or agreement involving Intellectual Property against
any third party. There are no pending or threatened interference,
re-examinations, oppositions or nullities involving any patents, patent rights
or applications therefor of Corixa or any Subsidiary of Corixa, except such as
may have been commenced by Corixa or any Subsidiary of Corixa.

               (f) Each Corixa Participating Developer (as defined below) has
signed an intellectual property assignment agreement that legally, fully and
effectively transfers to Corixa any and all right, title and interest which the
named Corixa Participating Developer may have or acquire in and to the Corixa
Intellectual Property. "Corixa Participating Developer" means any employee or
consultant who contributed and/or is contributing to the creation or development
of material Corixa Intellectual Property.

               (g) Corixa has taken all commercially reasonable steps to protect
and preserve the confidentiality of all Corixa Intellectual Property not
otherwise protected by patents, patent applications or copyright ("Corixa
Confidential Information"). Each of Corixa and its Subsidiaries has a policy
requiring each employee, consultant and independent contractor to execute
proprietary information and confidentiality agreements substantially in Corixa's
standard forms.

any Subsidiary of Corixa have been duly filed on a timely basis (including any

material respects. All Taxes shown to be payable on such Returns or on
subsequent assessments with respect thereto, and all payments of estimated Taxes
required to be made by or on behalf of Corixa or any Subsidiary of Corixa under
Section 6655 of the Code or comparable provisions of state, local or foreign
law, have been paid in full on a timely basis, and no other Taxes are payable by
Corixa or any Subsidiary of Corixa with respect to items or periods covered by
such Returns (whether or not shown on or reportable on such Returns). Corixa and
each Subsidiary of Corixa has withheld and paid over all Taxes required to have
been withheld and paid over, and complied in all material respects with all
information reporting and backup withholding in connection with amounts paid or
owing to any employee, creditor, independent contractor or other third party.

Agreement other than in the ordinary course of business.

               (c) No audit of the Returns of or including Corixa and its
Subsidiaries by a Governmental Entity or taxing authority is in process, or, to
the knowledge of Corixa, threatened (either in writing or verbally, formally or
informally). No deficiencies exist or are being asserted (either in writing or
verbally, formally or informally) or are expected to be asserted with respect to
Taxes of Corixa or any of its Subsidiaries, and, since January 1, 1998, Corixa
has not received written notice nor does it expect to receive any such notice

         3.15 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

               (a) "Corixa Employee Plans" means all of the following that are
in effect or under which there are remaining obligations of Corixa or any
Subsidiary of Corixa as of the date of this Agreement with respect to Corixa,

                                      -39-
<PAGE>   47
compensation in excess of $100,000 and all severance agreements with any of the
directors, officers or employees of Corixa or its Subsidiaries (other than, in
each case, any such contract or agreement that is terminable by Corixa or any
Subsidiary of Corixa at will or without penalty or other adverse consequence),
(iv) all bonus, pension, profit-sharing, savings, deferred compensation or

or any Subsidiary of Corixa of greater than $500,000 remain for the benefit of,
or relating to, any present or former employee, consultant or director of Corixa
or any Subsidiary of Corixa. Each Corixa Employee Plan intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code has either obtained from the IRS a favorable
determination letter as to its qualified status under the Code, including all
amendments to the Code effected by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and subsequent
legislation, or has applied to the IRS for such a determination letter with
respect to which the requisite period under applicable Treasury Regulations or
IRS pronouncements in which to apply for such determination letter and to make
any amendments necessary to obtain a favorable determination has expired.

               (b) Each Corixa Employee Plan has been administered in all
material respects in accordance with its terms and in compliance in all material
respects with the requirements prescribed by any and all statutes, rules and
regulations (including ERISA and the Code), and Corixa and each Subsidiary of
Corixa or ERISA Affiliate have performed in all material respects all
obligations required to be performed by them under, are not in material default
under or in material violation of, any of the Corixa Employee Plans. Neither
Corixa nor any Subsidiary of Corixa or ERISA Affiliate is subject to any
material liability or material penalty under Sections 4976 through 4980 of the
Code or Title I of ERISA with respect to any of the Corixa Employee Plans. All
contributions required to be made by Corixa or any Subsidiary of Corixa or ERISA
Affiliate to any Corixa Employee Plan have been made on or before their due
dates and a reasonable amount has been accrued for contributions to each Corixa
Employee Plan for the current plan years. With respect to each Corixa Employee
Plan, no "reportable event" within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA
(excluding any such event for which the thirty (30) day notice requirement has
been waived under the regulations to Section 4043 of ERISA) or any event
described in Section 4062, 4063 or 4041 of ERISA has occurred. No Corixa
Employee Plan is covered by, and neither Corixa nor any Subsidiary of Corixa or
ERISA Affiliate has incurred or expects to incur any direct or indirect
liability under, arising out of or by operation of, Title IV of ERISA in
connection with the termination of, or an employee's withdrawal from, any Corixa
Employee Plan or other retirement plan or arrangement, or under Section 412 of
the Code. With respect to each Corixa Employee Plan subject to ERISA as either
an employee pension plan within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA or an
employee welfare benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA,
Corixa has prepared in all material respects in good faith and timely filed all
requisite governmental reports (which were true and correct as of the date
filed) and has properly and timely filed and distributed or posted all notices
and reports to employees required to be filed, distributed or posted with
respect to each such Corixa

                                      -40-
<PAGE>   48
Employee Plan. No suit, administrative proceeding, action or other litigation is
being brought or, to the knowledge of Corixa, is threatened against, or with
respect to, any such Corixa Employee Plan, including any audit or inquiry by the
IRS or United States Department of Labor. Neither Corixa nor any Subsidiary or
other ERISA Affiliate is a party to, or has made any contribution to or
otherwise incurred any obligation under, any "multiemployer plan" as defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA.

               (c) With respect to each Corixa Employee Plan, Corixa and each
Subsidiary has complied in all material respects with (i) the applicable
health-care continuation and notice provisions of the COBRA and the proposed
regulations thereunder, (ii) the applicable requirements of the Family and
Medical Leave Act of 1993 and the regulations thereunder, and (iii) the

in any unfair labor practice. There are no material pending claims against
Corixa or any of its Subsidiaries under any workers compensation plan or policy
or for long-term disability. There is no pending strike, lockout, work slowdown
or work stoppage involving Corixa or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their

labor union or other group to organize any such employees.

Disclosure Schedule pursuant to clauses (a) through (h) above or pursuant to
Section 3.12 (any such agreement, contract or commitment, a "Corixa Contract")

obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

               (c) Corixa shall give prompt notice to Coulter of any

Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or any failure
of Corixa or Merger Sub to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any

         5.2 CONSENTS; COOPERATION.

               (a) Each of Corixa, Merger Sub and Coulter shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to promptly (i) obtain from any Governmental
Entity any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or
orders required to be obtained or made by Corixa, Merger Sub or Coulter or any
of their respective subsidiaries in connection with the authorization, execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereunder, including those required under the HSR Act, and (ii)
make all necessary filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions,
with respect to this Agreement and the Merger required under the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act and any other applicable federal, state or foreign

               (b) Each of Corixa, Merger Sub and Coulter shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be
asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended,
the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and
any other federal, state or foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders or
decrees that are designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the
purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively,

action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging
any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust
Law, each of Corixa, Merger Sub and Coulter shall cooperate and use all
commercially reasonable efforts vigorously to contest and resist any such action
or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent
(each an "Order"), that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the Merger or any such other transactions, unless by mutual
agreement Corixa and Coulter decide that litigation is not in their respective
best interests. The parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one another,
and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any

proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection

required to cause the expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act or

third-party consent, waiver or approval described in this Section 5.2(d), it
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, and shall take any such actions
reasonably requested by the other party, to minimize any adverse effect on
Corixa and Coulter, their respective subsidiaries and their respective
businesses resulting (or that could reasonably be expected to result after the
Effective Time) from the failure to obtain such consent, waiver or approval.

               (e) Each of Corixa and Coulter will, and will cause their
respective Subsidiaries to, take all reasonable actions necessary to comply
promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on them with respect to

connection with any such requirements imposed on such other party in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
will take all reasonable actions necessary to obtain (and will cooperate with
the other parties hereto in obtaining) any consent, approval, order or
authorization of, or any registration, declaration or filing with, any
Governmental Entity or other person required to be obtained or made in
connection with the taking of any action contemplated by this Agreement.

product development efforts), properties, results of operation and personnel
(including information relating to all current and former employees' names,
compensation rates, terminations and citizenship and immigration status) of its

modify any representation or warranty of Coulter or Corixa, respectively,
contained herein or the conditions to the obligations of the parties to
consummate the Merger. In the event Corixa or Coulter obtains any such
information that makes any representation or warranty of the other party
contained herein materially untrue such that the conditions set forth in Section
6.2 or 6.3 would not be satisfied, then such party shall so notify the other
party.

         5.4 CONFIDENTIALITY. The parties acknowledge that Corixa and Coulter

Coulter and Corixa will prepare and file with the SEC the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and Corixa will file with the SEC the Registration
Statement in which the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be included as a
prospectus. Each of Coulter and Corixa will respond to any comments of the SEC,
and Corixa will use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Registration
Statement declared effective under the Securities Act, as promptly as
practicable after such filing. Each of Coulter and Corixa will cause the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to its respective stockholders at the
earliest practicable time after the Registration Statement is declared effective
by the SEC. As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, each of
Coulter and Corixa will prepare and file any other filings required to be filed
by it under the Exchange Act, the Securities Act or any other federal, foreign
or Blue Sky or related laws relating to the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the "Other Filings"). Each of Coulter and Corixa
will notify the other promptly upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or
its staff or any other government officials and of any request by the SEC or its
staff or any other government officials for amendments or supplements to the
Registration Statement, the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any Other Filing

correspondence between such party or any of its representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC, or its staff or any other government officials, on the other
hand, with respect to the Registration Statement, the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, the Merger or any Other Filing. Each of Coulter and Corixa
will cause all documents that it is responsible for filing with the SEC or other
regulatory authorities under this Section 5.5(a) to comply in all material


                                      -51-
<PAGE>   59
respects with all applicable requirements of law and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder. Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the
Registration Statement or any Other Filing, Coulter or Corixa, as the case may
be, will promptly inform the other of such occurrence and cooperate in filing
with the SEC or its staff or any other government officials, and/or mailing to

Section 7.1(f), Coulter's obligation to call, give notice of, convene and hold
the Coulter Stockholders' Meeting in accordance with this Section 5.5 (a) shall

Corixa's obligation to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Corixa

               (a) Promptly after the date hereof, Coulter shall take all action
necessary in accordance with Delaware Law and its Certificate of Incorporation
and Bylaws to convene the Coulter Stockholders' Meeting to be held as promptly
as practicable after the declaration of effectiveness of the Registration
Statement. Unless the Coulter Board of Directors shall have withheld, withdrawn,
amended or modified in a manner adverse to Corixa its unanimous recommendation
in favor of the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with Section 5.6(c),
Coulter shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from its
stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Coulter may adjourn or
postpone the Coulter Stockholders' Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure
that any necessary supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus is provided to Coulter's stockholders in advance of a vote
with respect to adoption of this Agreement or, if as of the time for which
Coulter Stockholders' Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus ) there are insufficient shares of Coulter Common
Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the Coulter Stockholders' Meeting. Coulter
shall ensure that the Coulter Stockholders' Meeting is called, noticed,
convened, held and conducted, and subject to Section 5.6(c), that all proxies
solicited by Coulter in connection with the Coulter Stockholders' Meeting are

stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement at the

                                      -52-
<PAGE>   60
Coulter Stockholders' Meeting; and (iii) neither the Coulter Board of Directors
nor any committee thereof shall withdraw, amend or modify, or propose or resolve
to withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Corixa, the unanimous
recommendation of the Coulter Board of Directors that Coulter's stockholders
vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement.

               (c) Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Coulter Board of
Directors from withholding, withdrawing, amending or modifying its unanimous
recommendation in favor of the adoption of this Agreement if (i) a Coulter
Superior Offer is made to Coulter or its stockholders and is not withdrawn, and
(ii) the Coulter Board of Directors or any committee thereof concludes in good
faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that, in light of such
Coulter Superior Offer, the withholding, withdrawal, amendment or modification
of such recommendation is required in order for the Coulter Board of Directors
or any committee thereof to comply with its fiduciary obligations to Coulter's
stockholders under applicable law. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Coulter Superior Offer" shall mean an unsolicited, bona fide written offer made
by a third party to consummate any of the following transactions: (1) a merger,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution
or similar transaction involving Coulter pursuant to which the stockholders of
Coulter immediately preceding such transaction hold less than fifty percent
(50%) of the equity interest in the surviving or resulting entity of such
transaction, (2) a sale or other disposition by Coulter of assets (excluding
inventory and used equipment sold in the ordinary course of business)
representing in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the fair market value of
Coulter's business immediately prior to such sale or disposition, or (3) the
acquisition by any person (including by way of a tender or exchange offer or
issuance by Coulter), directly or indirectly, of beneficial ownership or a right
to acquire beneficial ownership of shares representing in excess of fifty
percent (50%) of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of capital
stock of Coulter, in each case on terms that the Coulter Board of Directors
determines, in its judgment consistent with applicable corporate law, after
consultation with the Coulter Financial Advisor, is reasonably likely to be
financially superior to Coulter's stockholders than the terms of the Merger.

         5.7 NO SOLICITATION.

of the Effective Time or termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7,

of Corixa Common Stock in the Merger.

               (c) Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Corixa Board of
Directors from withholding, withdrawing, amending or modifying its unanimous
recommendation in favor of the issuance of the shares of Corixa Common Stock in
the Merger if (i) a Corixa Superior Offer is made to Corixa or its stockholders
and is not withdrawn, and (ii) the Corixa Board of Directors or any committee
thereof concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel,
that, in light of such Corixa Superior Offer, the withholding, withdrawal,
amendment or modification of such recommendation is required in order for the
Corixa Board of Directors or any committee thereof to comply with its fiduciary
obligations to Corixa's stockholders under applicable law. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Corixa Superior Offer" shall mean an unsolicited, bona fide
written offer made by a third party to consummate any of the following
transactions: (1) a merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
Corixa pursuant to which the stockholders of Corixa immediately preceding such
transaction hold less than fifty percent (50%) of the equity interest in the
surviving or resulting entity of such transaction, (2) a sale or other
disposition by Corixa of assets (excluding inventory and used

                                      -57-
<PAGE>   65
equipment sold in the ordinary course of business) representing in excess of
fifty percent (50%) of the fair market value of Corixa's business immediately
prior to such sale or disposition or (3) the acquisition by any person
(including by way of a tender or exchange offer or issuance by Corixa), directly
or indirectly, of beneficial ownership or a right to acquire beneficial
ownership of shares representing in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the voting
power of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of Corixa, in each case on
terms that the Corixa Board of Directors determines, in its judgment consistent
with applicable corporate law, after consultation with Corixa's financial
advisor, is reasonably likely to result in a more favorable transaction to
Corixa's stockholders than the terms of the Merger.

         5.9 PUBLIC DISCLOSURE. Unless otherwise permitted by this Agreement,
Corixa and Coulter shall consult with each other before issuing any press
release or otherwise making any public statement or making any other public (or
nonconfidential) disclosure (whether or not in response to an inquiry) regarding
the terms of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and the
occurrence of a Coulter Material Adverse Drug Development, and neither shall
issue any such press release or make any such statement or disclosure without
the prior written approval of the other (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld), except as may be required by law or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or with
NASD.

         5.10 STATE STATUTES. If any state takeover law shall become applicable
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, unless the Coulter Board of
Directors recommends a Superior Offer in accordance with Section 5.6(c) or
Section 5.7(a), Corixa and its Board of Directors or Coulter and its Board of
Directors, as the case may be, shall grant such approvals and take such actions
as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such state
takeover law on the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         5.11 LISTING OF ADDITIONAL SHARES. Prior to the Effective Time, Corixa
shall file with Nasdaq a Notification Form for Listing of Additional Shares with
respect to the shares of Corixa Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the
Coulter Common Stock in the Merger and upon exercise of the Assumed Options and
assumed Purchase Rights.

         5.12 COULTER AFFILIATE AGREEMENTS. Set forth in Section 5.12 of the
Coulter Disclosure Schedule is a list of those persons who may be deemed to be,
in Coulter's reasonable judgment, affiliates of Coulter within the meaning of
Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act (each a "Coulter Affiliate").
Coulter will provide Corixa with such information and documents as Corixa
reasonably requests for purposes of reviewing such list. Coulter will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered to Corixa,
as promptly as practicable on or immediately following the date hereof, from
each Coulter Affiliate an executed Affiliate Agreement in substantially the form
of Exhibit B (the "Affiliate Agreement"), which will be in full force and effect
as of the Effective Time.

         5.13 INDEMNIFICATION.

               (a) From and after the Effective Time, (i) Corixa will cause the
Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of
Coulter pursuant to any indemnification agreements between Coulter and any
person who is a director or officer of Coulter or any of its Subsidiaries at any
time between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time (collectively,
the "Indemnified Parties") and any indemnification provisions under Coulter's
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws as in effect on the date hereof and (ii)
Corixa will indemnify and hold harmless each of the Indemnified Parties against
and from any costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), settlement
payments, claims, demands, judgments, fines, penalties, losses, damages or
liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, suit, action or proceeding
that arises from or relates to the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to exculpation
and indemnification that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as
those contained in the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Coulter as in
effect on the date hereof, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees or
agents of Coulter, unless such modification is required by law.

               (b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time,
Corixa will cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect, if available,
directors' and officers' liability insurance covering those persons who are
covered by Coulter's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy as of
the date hereof on terms comparable to those applicable to the current directors
and officers of Coulter; provided, however, that in no event will the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend in excess of one hundred seventy-five percent
(175%) of the annual premium currently paid by Coulter for such coverage (or
such coverage as is available for such one hundred seventy-five percent (175%)
of such annual premium).

               (c) This Section 5.13 is intended to benefit, and may be enforced
by, the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs, representatives,
successors and assigns and, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of
Corixa and the Surviving Corporation. Corixa and the Surviving Corporation
jointly and severally agree to pay all fees and expenses, including attorneys'
fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party who is the prevailing party
in an action seeking to enforce the indemnity and other obligations provided for
in this Section 5.13.

         5.14 FILING OF FORM S-8. As soon as practicable (but in no event later
than five (5) calendar days) following the Effective Time, Corixa shall file a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate form)
with respect to the shares of Corixa Common Stock subject to Assumed Options and
Purchase Rights pursuant to Section 1.6 and any shares of Corixa Common Stock to
be issued in respect of the BLA Bonus Shares, and shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement
(and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained
therein) for so long as such Assumed Options or Purchase Rights remain
outstanding.

         5.15 EMPLOYMENT MATTERS.


               (a) Corixa agrees that all employees of Coulter who continue
employment with Corixa or the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time
(the "Continuing Employees") shall be eligible to (i) continue to participate in
the Corixa or Surviving Corporation's health, vacation and other non-equity
based employee benefit plans; provided, however, that (A) nothing in this
Section 5.15 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall limit the right of Corixa or
the Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate any such health, vacation or
other employee benefit plan at any time, and (B) if Corixa or the Surviving
Corporation terminates any such health, vacation or other employee benefit plan,
then, (1) subject to any necessary transition period, each Continuing Employee
(as defined below) who immediately prior to the termination of such plan
participated in such plan shall be eligible to participate in Corixa's health,
vacation and other non-equity based employee benefit plans, to substantially the
same extent as employees of Corixa in similar positions and at similar grade
levels, (2) Corixa shall credit each such Continuing Employee's service with
Coulter, to the same extent as such service was credited under the similar
employee benefit plans of Coulter immediately prior to the Effective Time, for
purposes of determining eligibility to participate in and vesting (but not
benefit accrual) under, and for purposes of calculating the benefits under, such
employee benefit plan of Corixa, and (3) to the extent permitted or required by
such employee benefit plan of Corixa and applicable law, Corixa shall waive any
pre-existing condition limitations, waiting periods or similar limitations under
such employee benefit plan of Corixa and shall provide each such Continuing
Employee with credit for any co-payments previously made and any deductibles
previously satisfied, and (ii) participate in Corixa's equity-based plans to the
same extent as similarly situated employees of Corixa. Nothing in this Section
5.15 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to create a right in any
employee to employment with Corixa or the Surviving Corporation and, subject to
any other binding agreement between an employee and Corixa or the Surviving
Corporation, the employment with each Continuing Employee shall be "at will"
employment.

               (b) To the extent applicable, Corixa and Coulter shall each take
such reasonable steps as are required to cause the disposition and acquisition
of equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to Section 1 in
connection with the consummation of the Merger by each individual who is an
officer or director of Coulter to qualify for exemption from Section 16(b) of
the Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

               (c) Prior to the Closing, Coulter shall execute the employment
agreements substantially in the forms of Exhibit C.

         5.16 BOARD OF DIRECTORS. On the Closing Date, the Board of Directors of
Corixa shall consist of eight persons, four designated by Corixa, one of whom
shall be Steven Gillis, and four designated by Coulter, one of whom shall be
Michael Bigham (it being understood, however, that Corixa and Coulter may
mutually agree on a different number of directors in their discretion). If any
person designated as a director pursuant to the preceding sentence is not able
to serve as a director of Corixa as of the Closing Date, the party who
designated such person shall designate a replacement.

any of the foregoing (which is reasonably likely to succeed) be pending; nor
shall there be any statute, rule, regulation or order enacted, entered, enforced

been made after the date of this Agreement shall be disregarded) and (ii) Corixa

Agreement under this Section 7.1(k) for thirty (30) days after delivery of
written notice from Coulter to Corixa of such breach; provided further, however,
that Corixa continues to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cure such
breach (it being understood that Coulter may not terminate this Agreement

Agreement or if such breach by Corixa is cured during such thirty (30) day
period);

               (l) by Corixa, upon a breach of any representation, warranty,

Corixa shall make a nonrefundable cash payment to Coulter, in immediately

shall make a $15,000,000 loan to Coulter, on the terms set forth in the
promissory note attached to this Agreement as Exhibit D (it being understood
that (A) the termination pursuant to Section 7.1(j) shall not be effective until
the $15,000,000 loan, in immediately available funds, has been provided to
Coulter by Corixa, and (B) Corixa's right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 7.1(j) shall cease if the $15,000,000 loan, in immediately available
funds, has not been provided to Coulter on or before the tenth day following the
date on which Corixa becomes aware that a Coulter Material Adverse Drug
Development shall have occurred).

                  (iv) Corixa acknowledges and agrees that the agreements
contained in this Section 7.3(c) are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Coulter
would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Corixa fails promptly to
pay the amounts due pursuant to this Section 7.3(c), then (i) Corixa shall
reimburse Coulter for all costs and expenses (including fees and disbursements
of counsel) incurred in connection with the collection of such overdue amount
and the enforcement by Coulter of its rights under this Section 7.3(c), and (ii)

by the parties hereto at any time by execution of an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of Corixa and Coulter.

               (b) Any reference to a party's "knowledge" or "Knowledge" means
such party's actual knowledge after due and diligent inquiry of officers,
directors and other employees of such party reasonably believed to have
knowledge of the matter in question.

               (c) The words "include," "includes" and "including" when used

taken individually or together with all other adverse events, changes and
effects, is or is reasonably likely to be materially adverse to the financial
condition, business or results of operations of such entity and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or to prevent or materially delay consummation
of the Merger or otherwise to prevent such entity and its subsidiaries from
performing their obligations under this Agreement in any material manner;
provided, however, that (a) "Material Adverse Effect" shall not include changes
in the trading price of such entity's common stock; and (b) none of the
following shall be deemed to constitute a "Material Adverse Effect" with respect

               (g) The term "person" as used in this Agreement shall be
construed broadly to include any individual, entity, "group" (within the meaning
of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) or Governmental Entity.

               (h) For purposes of this Agreement, an entity shall be deemed to

securities of other interests in such entity that is sufficient to enable such
person to elect at least a majority of the members of such entity's board of
directors or other governing body, or (b) at least 50% of the outstanding equity
or financial interests or such entity.

               (i) All references in this Agreement to "unanimous" with respect

board of director matters relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

               (j) The table of contents and headings contained in this

Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements specifically
referred to herein or delivered pursuant hereto, including the Exhibits, the
Coulter Disclosure Schedule and the Corixa Disclosure Schedule, (a) constitute
the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, except for the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect and
shall survive any termination of this Agreement or the Closing in accordance
with its terms; (b) are not intended to confer upon any other person any rights
or remedies hereunder; and (c) shall not be assigned by operation of law or
otherwise except as otherwise specifically provided.

         8.6 SEVERABILITY. If one or more provisions of this Agreement are held
to be unenforceable under applicable law, the parties agree to renegotiate such
provision in good faith in order to maintain the economic position enjoyed by
each party as close as possible to that in the provision rendered unenforceable.
In the event that the parties cannot reach a mutually agreeable and enforceable
replacement for such provision, then (a) such provision shall be excluded from
this Agreement, (b) the balance of this Agreement shall be interpreted as if
such provision were so excluded, and (c) the balance of this Agreement shall be
enforceable in accordance with its terms.

all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative
