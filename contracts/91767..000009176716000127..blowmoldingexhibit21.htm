(i)Revised Closing Statement Preparation and Review. Within one hundred twenty
(120) days after the Closing Date, Buyer will prepare and deliver to Sonoco US
a statement (the "Revised Closing Statement") setting forth in reasonable
detail Buyer's determination and calculation of the Actual Working Capital
(stated separately for Sonoco US and Sonoco Canada) prepared in a manner
consistent with the Sellers' accounting policies, principles and procedures
used in the Business at Closing, in each case determined in accordance with

Revised Closing Statement shall be prepared based on the books and records of
the Business. If Sonoco US does not object to the Revised Closing Statement
within thirty (30) days after receipt thereof, or Sonoco US accepts such
statement in writing during such thirty (30) day period, the Revised Closing
Statement prepared by Buyer shall become final and binding upon the Parties on
the thirty-first (31st) day following receipt thereof by Sonoco US and payment
will be made in accordance with Section 2.7(b). If Sonoco US objects to the
Revised Closing Statement, Sonoco US will notify Buyer in writing of such
objection (the "Notice of Objection") prior to such thirty-first (31st) day
(such notice setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such objection).
All items in the Revised Closing Statement to which Sonoco US does not object

have been accepted by Sonoco US.

(ii)Revised Closing Statement Dispute Resolution. During the thirty (30) day
period immediately following Buyer's receipt of any Notice of Objection, Buyer
and Sonoco US will negotiate in good faith to resolve all disputed items. If
Buyer and Sonoco US are unable to resolve all of such disputes within thirty
(30) days of Buyer's receipt of the Notice of Objection, the items in dispute
may be referred by any Party for determination as promptly as practicable to
the Independent Accounting Firm, which will be jointly engaged by Buyer, on
the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, pursuant to an engagement letter
in customary form which each of Buyer and Sellers will execute. The Parties
will direct the Independent Accounting Firm to prescribe procedures for
resolving the disputed items and to make a written determination, with respect
to such disputed items only, whether and to what extent, if any, the
accompanying calculations of the Actual Working Capital require adjustment
based on the terms and conditions of this Agreement (the "Determination"). The
Determination will be based solely on presentations with respect to such
disputed items by Buyer and Sonoco US to the Independent Accounting Firm and
not on the Independent Accounting Firm's independent review; provided that
such presentations will be deemed to include any written reports, work


 

--- 
| | 

|

| 

 

NYC#: 148660.21 



papers, records, accounts or similar materials delivered to the Independent
Accounting Firm by Buyer and Sonoco US in connection with such presentations
and any materials delivered to the Independent Accounting Firm in response to
requests by the Independent Accounting Firm. Each of Buyer and Sonoco US shall
contemporaneously provide the other with a copy of all items submitted to the
Independent Accounting Firm for purposes of the Determination. In the absence
of fraud or manifest error, the Determination will be conclusive and binding
upon the Parties. The Parties agree that, if the Independent Accounting Firm
assigns to any item a value greater than the greatest value for such item
claimed by either Buyer or Sonoco US (the "Upper Limit") or less than the
smallest value for such item claimed by Buyer or Sonoco US (the "Lower
Limit"), the Determination for such item shall be adjusted to the Upper Limit
or the Lower Limit, as applicable. All fees and expenses of the Independent
Accounting Firm (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) will be
borne by the Parties based on the percentage which the portion of the
contested amount not awarded to each Party bears to the amount actually
contested by such Party.

(b)Adjustment to Purchase Price.

(i)The Working Capital amount determined as of the close of business on the
Closing Date in accordance with Section 2.7(a) (the "Actual Working Capital")
will be used to calculate the Final Purchase Price. Actual Working Capital
shall be calculated separately for Sonoco US and Sonoco Canada.

(ii)If the Final Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price, then
Buyer shall pay to the Sellers an amount equal to such excess. Such payment
shall be paid to Sonoco US or Sonoco Canada as appropriate based on Actual
Working Capital and Target Working Capital for each of Sonoco US and Sonoco
Canada.

(iii)If the Estimated Purchase Price exceeds the Final Purchase Price, then
Sellers shall pay to the Buyer an amount equal to such excess. Such payment
shall be paid by Sonoco US or Sonoco Canada as appropriate based on Actual
Working Capital and Target Working Capital for each of Sonoco US and Sonoco
Canada; provided, that the foregoing shall in no way affect the joint and
several liability of Sellers pursuant to Section 9.16.

(iv)All payments to be made to either Buyer or the Sellers pursuant to this
Section 2.7(b) will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the Sellers' respective accounts or Buyer's account, as applicable, within
five (5) Business Days after the date on which the Actual Working Capital is
finally determined pursuant to Section 2.7(a).

2.8Form of Payment. All cash payments hereunder will be made by delivery to
the recipient by depositing, by bank wire transfer, the required amount (in
immediately available funds) in an account of the recipient, which account

prior to the date of the required payment. All payments shall be in US
Dollars.

provide written notice to Sellers of its proposed allocation of the Purchase

|

| 

 

NYC#: 148660.21 



among the Purchased Assets as provided in accordance with Section 1060 of the
Code, which such allocation shall with respect to the Sonoco US and SDI assets
be based on independent third party appraisals obtained by Buyer for purposes
of its financial reporting. Sonoco US shall have 15 days to object to such
allocation. If Sonoco US does not object in writing within such 15-day period,
Buyer's allocations shall be final. If Sonoco US does timely object, the
allocation will be determined by the Independent Accounting Firm under the
procedures set out in Section 2.7(a)(ii). The allocation as finally determined
under this Section 2.9 shall be the "Purchase Price Allocation". The Parties
hereby agree to (i) be bound by the Purchase Price Allocation in the filing of
any Tax Return; (ii) cooperate in connection with the preparation and filing
of any Tax Return (including the filing of IRS Form 8594 and any other
corresponding IRS forms or Canadian Tax election, Tax Return or form) and
(iii) take no position inconsistent with the Purchase Price Allocation on a
Tax Return unless required to do so under applicable Law.

2.10Non-assignable Assets.

(a)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, and subject to
the provisions of this Section 2.10, to the extent that the sale, assignment,
transfer, conveyance or delivery, or attempted sale, assignment, transfer,
conveyance or delivery, to Buyer of any Purchased Asset would result in a
violation of applicable Law, or would require the consent, authorization,
approval or waiver of a Person who is not a Party or an Affiliate of a Party
(including any Governmental Authority), and such consent, authorization,
approval or waiver shall not have been obtained prior to the Closing, this
Agreement shall not constitute a sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or
delivery, or an attempted sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery.
Following the Closing, Sellers and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts, and shall cooperate with each other, to obtain any such required
consent, authorization, approval or waiver, or any release, substitution or
amendment required to novate all liabilities, obligations, rights and benefits
under any and all Assigned Contracts or other liabilities that constitute
Assumed Liabilities or other assets that constitute Purchased Assets or to
obtain in writing the unconditional release of all parties to such
arrangements, so that, in any case, Buyer shall be solely responsible for such
liabilities and obligations after the Closing and shall have the benefit of
all such Purchased Assets after the Closing; provided, however, that neither
Sellers nor Buyer shall be required to pay any consideration therefor. Once
such consent, authorization, approval, waiver, release, substitution or
amendment is obtained, Sellers shall sell, assign, transfer, convey and
deliver to Buyer the relevant Purchased Asset to which such consent,
authorization, approval, waiver, release, substitution or amendment relates
for no additional consideration. Applicable sales, transfer and other similar
Taxes in connection with such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or
license shall be paid in accordance with Section 6.9.

(b)To the extent that any Purchased Asset and/or Assumed Liability cannot be
transferred to Buyer at or following the Closing pursuant to this Section
2.10, Buyer and Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enter
into such arrangements (such as subleasing, sublicensing or subcontracting) to
provide the economic and, to the extent permitted under applicable Law,
operational equivalent of the transfer of such Purchased Asset and/or Assumed
Liability to Buyer as of the Closing and the exercise by Buyer of its rights
and the

|

| 

 

NYC#: 148660.21 



performance by Buyer of its obligations with respect thereto. Buyer shall, as
agent or subcontractor for Sellers pay, perform and discharge fully the
liabilities and obligations of Sellers thereunder from and after the Closing
Date. To the extent permitted under applicable Law, Sellers shall, at Buyer's
expense, (i) hold in trust for and pay to Buyer promptly upon receipt thereof,
such Purchased Asset and all income, proceeds and other monies received by
Sellers to the extent related to such Purchased Asset in connection with the
arrangements under this Section 2.10 and (ii) if requested by Buyer, enforce
all rights of Sellers against the other party to such Purchased Asset. Sellers
shall be permitted to set off against such amounts all direct out-of-pocket
costs associated with the retention and maintenance of such Purchased Assets.

(c)Nothing in this Section 2.10, including any arrangement for Buyer to be
provided with any of the benefits of such Purchased Asset, shall constitute a
waiver of Buyer's right to insist on the conditions to Closing set forth in
Section 3.2 being satisfied in their entirety or a waiver of Buyer's right to
seek indemnification pursuant to ARTICLE VIII.

consolidation entries and adjustments made from the underlying management
accounts. The Financial Statements reflect a fair allocation to the Business
of expenses incurred by Parent and its consolidated Affiliates. The Financial
Statements do not contain any extraordinary items or items of special or
nonrecurring income or any other income not earned in the Ordinary Course of
Business, except as expressly specified therein. The Financial Statements
reflect all of the costs incurred in the operation of the Business. The books
of account of the Business, all of which have been made available to the
Buyer, are up-to-date, have been maintained in accordance with applicable Law
and contain correct and complete records of all matters required to be dealt
with by such books, represent actual, bona fide transactions and have been

are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in
accordance with GAAP and to maintain accountability for the respective assets
and liabilities of such Seller; and (iii) any unauthorized acquisition,
disposition or use of assets is prevented or timely detected. There has not

or employee of any Seller who has a role in such Seller's internal controls
over financial reporting.

and shall not engage in any communications or enter into any negotiations,
commitments or agreements with any Antitrust Authority or Governmental
Authority with respect to the Antitrust Approvals without the prior written
consent of the Buyer. Sellers shall not take any action that will have the
effect of delaying, impairing, or impeding the receipt of the Antitrust

to applicable Laws, provide the other Party (or its external counsel in
respect of competitively-sensitive, privileged or confidential matters) with

counsel in respect of competitively-sensitive, privileged or confidential
matters) prior to participating in any substantive meeting or discussion with
any Antitrust Authority in respect of the Antitrust Approvals in respect of
the transactions contemplated herein and give the other Party (or its external
counsel in respect of competitively-

sensitive, privileged or confidential matters) the opportunity to attend and

6.6Employees and Employee Benefits.

(a)Buyer shall, or shall cause an Affiliate of Buyer to, offer employment
effective on the Closing Date, to all persons actively employed by Sellers who
worked exclusively for the Business immediately prior to Closing and who are
listed on Schedule 6.6(a) (the "Employees"), including Employees who are
absent due to vacation or military leave, (the Employees who accept such
employment and commence employment on the Closing Date shall be referred to as
"Transferred Employees"). With respect to Employees who are absent due to
family leave, other non-military leave, or short-term disability as set out on
Schedule 6.6(a), if such Employee is released to return to work within six (6)
months after the Closing Date, then Buyer or its Affiliate shall offer
employment to such Employee and for the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall have
no obligation to offer employment to any such Employee who is not released to
return to work within six (6) months after the Closing Date. Buyer shall have
no obligation to offer employment to (i) any persons other than those listed
on Schedule 6.6(a) or (ii) any person who is on long-term disability
immediately prior to Closing. Following acceptance of such offer, such an
Employee shall become a Transferred Employee.

(b)During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the date
which is 12 months from the Closing (or if earlier, the date of the
Transferred Employee's termination of employment with Buyer or an Affiliate of
Buyer), Buyer shall, or shall cause an Affiliate of Buyer to, provide each
Transferred Employee with: (i) base salary or hourly wages which are no less
than the base salary or hourly wages provided by Sellers immediately prior to
the Closing; and (ii) target bonus opportunities (excluding equity-based
compensation), retirement, severance, and welfare benefits that are
substantially similar in the aggregate to those provided to similarly-situated
employees of Buyer.

(c)With respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by Buyer or an
Affiliate of Buyer for the benefit of any Transferred Employee, Buyer shall,
or shall cause its Affiliate to, as of the relevant transfer date, recognize
all service of the Transferred Employees with Sellers, as if such service were
with Buyer, for vesting and eligibility purposes; provided, however, such
service shall not be recognized to the extent that (x) such recognition would
result in a duplication of benefits or (y) such service was not recognized
under the corresponding Benefit Plan.

(d)Effective as of the Closing, except as provided in the Transition Services
Agreement, the Transferred Employees shall cease active participation in the
Benefit Plans. Sellers shall remain liable for all eligible claims for
benefits under the Benefit Plans that are incurred by the Employees on or
prior to the Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement, the following
claims shall be deemed to be incurred as follows: (i) life, accidental death
and dismemberment, short-term disability, and workers' compensation insurance
benefits, on the date of the event giving rise to such benefits; (ii) medical,
vision, dental, and prescription drug benefits, on the date the applicable
services, materials or supplies were provided; (iii) long-term


 

--- 
| | 

|

- 45-

| 

 

NYC#: 148660.21 



disability benefits, on the eligibility date determined by the long-term
disability insurance carrier for the plan in which the applicable Employee
participates and (iv) with respect to any benefits specified in the Transition
Services Agreement, as provided in the Transition Services Agreement.

(e)Sellers shall be solely responsible for any (i) transaction bonuses, "stay
pay" bonuses, change in control payments, severance payments, or similar
bonuses or payments and (ii) any other bonuses or payments earned or accrued
with respect to the period ending on the Closing Date (including, in each
case, all Taxes and benefit plan contributions associated therewith) due to
any Employees, notwithstanding that any such Employee is a Transferred
Employee.

(f)Sellers shall fully vest all Transferred Employees in their accounts under
the Sonoco Retirement and Savings Plan (the "Seller 401(k) Plan") and the
Sonoco Pension Plan. All contributions, including all employer contributions
and employee salary reduction contributions, that are due under the Seller
401(k) Plan have been made within the time periods prescribed by ERISA and the
Code, and all contributions with respect to the period on or before the
Closing Date that are not yet due will be made to the Seller 401(k) Plan as
soon as possible following Closing, including the applicable prorated amount
of any annual contributions, without application of any hours or "last day"
requirement in the Seller 401(k) Plan. Sellers will permit Transferred
Employees to roll over their Seller 401(k) Plan accounts, including loan
balances, to a defined contribution plan of Buyer. Buyer's defined
contribution plan will accept such rollovers, including loan balances, as soon
as administratively practicable, provided that Buyer receives reasonable
assurance that the Seller 401(k) Plan is in compliance with all applicable
laws, and has received a current IRS determination letter.

(g)No assets or liabilities of any Benefit Plan will transfer to Buyer, and
all such assets and liabilities will remain with Sellers.

(h)At or prior to Closing, Sellers shall make a cash payment to each
Transferred Employee that would receive benefits under any non-qualified
deferred compensation plan (regardless of whether such plan is subject to
Section 409A of the Code) or any outstanding award under any equity-based plan
or arrangement (including any stock option, stock purchase, stock ownership,
stock appreciation or restricted stock plan) if such benefits or awards were
fully vested at Closing, in an amount equal to the value of such vesting.

(i)This Section 6.6 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each of the Parties, and nothing in this Section 6.6, express or implied,
shall confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 6.6. Nothing contained herein,
express or implied, shall be construed to establish, amend or modify any
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that the terms set forth in this Section 6.6 shall not create any right
in any Transferred Employee or any other Person to any continued employment
with Buyer or any of its Affiliates or compensation or benefits of any nature
or kind whatsoever.

periods prior to the Closing in a manner reasonably consistent with Buyer's

relate to the Business and its operations for periods prior to the Closing in
a manner reasonably consistent with the prior practices of Sellers; and

to such books and records.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers may dispose of such books and records
prior to the 7th anniversary of Closing if they give Buyer not less than 30
days' notice of their intent to dispose of such books and records and offer
Buyer the opportunity, at Buyer's expense, to have such records delivered to
Buyer.

(c)Neither Buyer nor Sellers shall be obligated to provide the other Party
with access to any books or records (including personnel files) pursuant to
this Section 6.7 where such access would violate any Law, breach any
agreement, cause the loss of any privilege or is in connection with any
dispute or Action between Buyer and Sellers.

prescribed by subsection 167(1.1) of the ETA. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Sonoco

(h)any failure to comply with any "bulk sales" Laws.

For purposes of determining whether there has been any misrepresentation or
breach of any representation or warranty of the Sellers in this Agreement and
the amount of Losses resulting from such misrepresentation or breach, such
representation and warranty shall be read without regard and without giving
effect to the term "material," "Material Adverse Effect" or similar
qualifiers, exceptions or phrases contained therein (as if such word(s) were
deleted therefrom).

8.3Indemnification by the Buyer. Subject to the terms of this ARTICLE VIII,
Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold the Sellers, their Affiliates, their
successors and assigns, and the respective Representatives of all of the
foregoing harmless from and against all Losses suffered or incurred by such
Persons arising out of:

(a)claims for personal injury (including death) or property damage arising out
of any products manufactured and sold to third parties after the Closing Date;

(b)claims for improper services rendered or omissions made in services
rendered to third parties, after the Closing Date;

(c)any misrepresentation, or breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer
contained in this Agreement, in the Exhibits, in any other Transaction
Document or in any certificate or other instrument furnished or to be
furnished by Buyer at Closing hereunder;

(d)any breach of any covenant of Buyer contained in this Agreement, in the
Exhibits attached hereto, in any other Transaction Document or in any

(f)except as otherwise indemnifiable under Section 8.2, any Action of any kind

Purchased Assets after the Closing Date (other than with respect to an
Excluded Liability) or any debt, obligation or liability of the Buyer existing
or accrued after the Closing Date (other than with respect to any Excluded
Liability).

8.4Defense of Claims.

(a)Third Party Claims.

(i)If any Person entitled to indemnification under this Agreement (an
"Indemnitee") receives notice of the assertion of any claim or of the
commencement of any Action by any Person who is not a Party or an Affiliate of
a Party (a "Third Party Claim") against such Indemnitee, against which a Party
is obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement (an "Indemnifying
Party"), the Indemnitee will give such Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt
written notice thereof (a "Third Party Claim Notice"), but in any event no
later than fifteen (15) calendar days after receipt of such notice of such
Third Party Claim (the


 

--- 
| | 

|

- 53-

| 

 

NYC#: 148660.21 



"Third Party Claim Notice Period"); provided, that the failure to provide a
Third Party Claim Notice within the Third Party Claim Notice Period shall not
impair the Indemnitee's rights hereunder or relieve the Indemnifying Party of
its obligations hereunder except to the extent such failure materially
prejudices the Indemnifying Party. The Third Party Claim Notice will describe
the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail, and will indicate the estimated
amount and methodology for determining such amount, if reasonably practicable,
of the indemnifiable Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnitee
and the provision or provisions under this Agreement or any document executed
and delivered pursuant hereto upon which such Third Party Claim is based. The
Indemnifying Party will have the right to participate in or, by giving written
notice to the Indemnitee no later than thirty (30) calendar days after receipt
of the Third Party Claim Notice, subject to Section 8.4(a)(ii), to elect to
assume, conduct and control the defense of (if it agrees in writing that, to
the extent such Third Party Claim is adversely determined, the Indemnifying
Party has an obligation to provide indemnification to the Indemnitee in
respect thereof) any Third Party Claim at such Indemnifying Party's own
expense and by such Indemnifying Party's counsel of its choosing (subject to
the approval of the Indemnitee, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), and the Indemnitee will cooperate in good
faith in such defense, including furnishing such records, information and
testimony and attending such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party in
connection therewith, and all costs or expenses incurred by the Indemnitee at
the request of the Indemnifying Party shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party.
The Indemnitee will have the right (x) at the Indemnifying Party's cost and
expense, at any time to prevent default or to protect its interests, to file
any pleadings or take any other action that the Indemnitee reasonably believes
to be necessary or appropriate and (y) to participate in the defense of any
Third Party Claim assisted by counsel of its own choosing and at its own
expense, subject to the Indemnifying Party's right to control the defense of
such Third Party Claim; provided, that the Indemnitee shall not, without the
written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which written consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), pay, compromise or settle any
such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitee shall
have the right to pay, settle or compromise any such Third Party Claim without
such consent, provided, that in such event, the Indemnitee shall waive any
right to indemnity hereunder unless such consent is unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnitee has not
received written notice within such thirty (30) calendar day period that the
Indemnifying Party has elected to assume the defense of such Third Party
Claim, the Indemnitee may, at its option, elect to settle or assume such
defense, assisted by counsel of its own choosing, and the Indemnifying Party
will be liable for all Losses paid or incurred in connection therewith,
provided, however, that the subject matter of such Third Party Claim is
ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise agreed
by the Parties to have been a Loss for which Indemnitee was properly entitled
to seek indemnification from the Indemnifying Party pursuant to the terms of
this ARTICLE VIII.

(ii)Without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee, the Indemnifying
Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement of any Third Party Claim or cease to defend against such Third
Party Claim, if pursuant to or as a result of such entry, settlement or
cessation, injunctive or other equitable relief would be


 

--- 
| | 

|

- 54-

| 

 

NYC#: 148660.21 



imposed against the Indemnitee. Without the prior written consent of the
Indemnitee, the Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement of any Third Party Claim that does not
include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or
plaintiff to each Indemnitee of a release from all liability in respect of
such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to
control, and the Indemnitee shall be entitled to have sole control over, the
defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim to the extent that (A) such
Third Party Claim seeks an order against the Indemnitee which, if successful,
would be reasonably likely to adversely interfere in any material respect with
the business, operations, reputation, assets, condition (financial or
otherwise) or prospects of the Indemnitee, (B) such Third Party Claim relates
to or arises in connection with any criminal or quasi-criminal Action,
indictment or allegation; (C) such Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or
other equitable relief against the Indemnitee; (D) the Indemnitee has been
advised by outside counsel that such Third Party Claim involves a reasonable
likelihood of a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnitee that makes representation of both parties inappropriate; (E) the
Indemnifying Party failed or is failing to vigorously defend such Third Party
Claim, or (F) such Third Party Claim has or could reasonably be expected to
result in Losses in excess of the amounts that the Indemnitee is entitled to
recover pursuant to Section 8.6 (and the cost of such defense shall constitute
an amount for which the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification hereunder
provided that such Third Party Claim is ultimately determined to have been
properly within the scope of such Indemnifying Party's indemnification
obligations under this Article VIII). If the Indemnifying Party elects to
direct the defense of any Third Party Claim pursuant to Section 8.4(a)(i), the
Indemnitee shall not pay, or permit to be paid, any part of such Third Party
Claim unless the Indemnifying Party consents in writing to such payment or
unless the Indemnifying Party withdraws from the defense of such Third Party
Claim or unless a final judgment from which no appeal may be taken by or on
behalf of the Indemnifying Party is entered against the Indemnitee for such
Third Party Claim. If the Indemnitee assumes the defense of any Third Party
Claim pursuant to this Section 8.4(a)(ii) and proposes to settle such Third
Party Claim, then the Indemnitee shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt
written notice thereof and the Indemnitee shall not settle such claim unless
the Indemnifying Party consents in writing to such settlement, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, provided the
Indemnitee may settle any such Third Party Claim without Indemnifying Party's
prior written consent and in such case it shall waive any right to indemnity
hereunder unless such consent is unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned
by the Indemnifying Party.

(iii)Each Party who has assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim shall use
all reasonable effort to diligently defend such claim.

(iv)Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, with respect to
any Third Party Claim that relates to Taxes, (i) Buyer will have the right to
assume control of any such Third Party Claim unless it solely relates to Taxes
(A) attributable to the Purchased Assets or the Business with respect to any
taxable period that ends on or prior to the Closing Date or (B) imposed on
Sellers and (ii) Sellers shall not consent to any settlement or entry of any
judgment of such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of Buyer,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

NYC#: 148660.21 



(b)Direct Claims. In the event any Indemnitee has a claim under this ARTICLE
VIII against any Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnitee shall promptly give written notice (the "Indemnity Notice")
describing the claim in reasonable detail, indicating the estimated amount and
methodology for determining such amount, if reasonably practicable, of the
indemnifiable Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnitee and the
provision or provisions under this Agreement or any document executed and
delivered pursuant hereto upon which such claim is based, including copies of
all relevant information and documents to the Indemnifying Party within a
period of thirty (30) days following the discovery of the claim by the
Indemnitee (the "Claim Notice Period"). The failure by any Indemnitee to give
the Indemnity Notice within the Claim Notice Period shall not impair the
Indemnitee's rights hereunder or relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations hereunder except to the extent that an Indemnifying Party
demonstrates that it has been prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party will
notify the Indemnitee within a period of thirty (30) days after the receipt of
the Indemnity Notice by the Indemnifying Party (the "Indemnity Response
Period") whether the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the
Indemnitee under this ARTICLE VIII with respect to such claim. If the
Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnitee within the Indemnity Response
Period that the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability with respect to such
claim, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnitee will proceed in good faith to
negotiate a resolution of such dispute, and if not resolved through
negotiations within a period of sixty (60) days from the date of such notice
from the Indemnifying Party, such dispute shall be resolved pursuant to
applicable Law and the amount of indemnification to which an Indemnitee shall
be entitled under this ARTICLE VIII shall be determined upon the entry of a
final non-appealable judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction
or as otherwise agreed by the Parties in writing.

8.5Continued Liability for Indemnity Claims. The liability of any Indemnifying
Party hereunder with respect to claims hereunder shall continue for so long as
any claims for indemnification may be made hereunder and, with respect to any
such indemnification claims duly and timely made, thereafter until the
Indemnifying Party's liability therefore is finally determined and satisfied.

8.6Limitations on Indemnification.

(a)Time Limits on Claims. Except as provided herein, all claims for indemnity
for a breach of a representation or warranty under Section 8.2(c) or 8.3(c)
must be brought (by delivery of notice to the Indemnifying Party of such claim
pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII) during the Survival Period for the
representation or warranty which is the subject of the breach.

(b)Threshold Amount. No amount of indemnity shall be payable by any
Indemnifying Party in the case of a claim by any Indemnitee under Section
8.2(c) or 8.3(c) unless and until such Indemnitee (and in the case of a claim
under Section 8.2(c), all other Indemnitees under Section 8.2(c) and in the
case of a claim under Section 8.3(c), all other Indemnitees under Section
8.3(c)) has suffered or incurred Losses aggregating in excess of 0.5% of the
Base Purchase Price (the "Threshold Amount") as a result of or arising out of
the matters


 

--- 
| | 

|

- 56-

| 

 

NYC#: 148660.21 



described in Section 8.2(c) or 8.3(c), as the case may be, whereupon such
Indemnitee shall be entitled to claim indemnification for the full amount of
its Losses, including the Threshold Amount; provided, however, any Indemnitee
will not be entitled to indemnification under Section 8.2(c) or 8.3(c) with
respect to individual Losses of less than Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000)
each, except for breaches with respect to which the final sentence of Section
8.2 does not apply (the "Per Claim Limit"), and such Losses will not be
counted toward the Threshold Amount; provided, further, that (i) for purposes
of determining whether a Loss exceeds the Per Claim Limit, all Losses arising
out of or related to the same event or circumstance or a series of related
events or circumstances will be treated as one Loss and (ii) the limitations
described in this Section 8.6(b) with respect to the Threshold Amount and the
Per Claim Limit shall not apply with respect to any breach of, or any
inaccuracy in, any Fundamental Representation or any representation contained
in Section 4.14 or 4.16 or any claim based upon fraud or knowing breach.

(c)Limitation on Recovery.

(i)In connection with any indemnification claim by Buyer under this Agreement
for a breach of a Fundamental Representation, Sellers shall not be liable for
any amounts which, if added to all other amounts paid by Sellers as
indemnification payments, would exceed the Base Purchase Price. The Buyer has
taken out a policy of representation and warranty indemnity insurance with
respect to Sellers' representations and warranties which are not Fundamental
Representations (the "Warranty Insurance") with Ambridge Partners LLC (the
"Warranty Insurer"); provided, that Buyer shall not be required to seek
recovery under the Warranty Insurance in connection with any Losses that are
subject to indemnification hereunder. Other than with respect to breaches of
Fundamental Representations, Sellers will not be liable for any amount for the
breach of representations and warranties under Section 8.2(c) in excess of
1.0% of the Base Purchase Price. For the avoidance of doubt, and
notwithstanding anything in this ARTICLE VIII to the contrary, the Sellers
shall have no right to assume, conduct or control the defense of any Third
Party Claim or to consent to any settlement thereof if the Warranty Insurer
would have liability under the Warranty Insurance with respect to such Third
Party Claim.

(ii)In connection with any indemnification claim by Sellers under this
Agreement for a breach of a Fundamental Representation, Buyer shall not be
liable for any amounts which, if added to all other amounts paid by Buyer as
indemnification payments, would exceed the Base Purchase Price. Other than
with respect to breaches of Fundamental Representations, Buyer will not be
liable for any amount for the breach of representations and warranties under
Section 8.3(c) in excess of 1.0% of the Base Purchase Price.

(d)Exclusive Remedy. Except with respect to fraud or knowing breach or as may
be required to specifically enforce this Agreement prior to the Closing or to
specifically enforce post-Closing covenants hereunder, the indemnification
rights set forth in this ARTICLE VIII are and shall be the sole and exclusive
remedies of Buyer and Sellers with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

waiver. No failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any right, remedy,
