of such Certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash
amount equal to the product of (A) the applicable Per Share Price _minus_ the
applicable Per Share Pro Rata Escrow Amount and (B) the number of shares of
Target Capital Stock represented by such Certificate, and (ii) the Certificate

shares of Target Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares) will be deemed

receive the Per Share Price for each of such shares (subject to the
provisions of this Agreement relating to the Escrow Fund). If, after the

foregoing, if any Certificate will not have been issued with respect to any

record holder of such Certificate the consideration into which the shares of
Target Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate have been
converted pursuant to Section 2.6, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by such record holder and the delivery by such record holder of an
agreement to indemnify the Exchange Agent, Acquiror and the Surviving

Certificate.

is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the payment of such
consideration under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "
_Code_ "), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or under any
provision of any other Tax Law. For administrative convenience, Exchange
Agent may tender payment with respect to any Target Common Stock or Target
Stock Options to Targets payroll provider to be paid to the applicable holder
net of any applicable withholding. 

  

(b) To the extent that amounts are properly withheld from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to Section 2.6 of 2.7(a) to any Former Stakeholder
as provided in this Section 2.10, such withheld amounts will be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such Former
Stakeholder. 

   

2.11 _Appraisal Rights_. 

  

(a) As soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, Target
shall take all steps necessary to comply with Section 262 of the DGCL. All
notices delivered to the shareholders of Target relating to Section 262 of
the DGCL shall be subject to the prior review and approval of Acquiror, which
approval shall not be unreasonably delayed. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, any share of Target Common Stock or
Target Preferred Stock that, as of the Effective Time, is held by a holder
who has, as of the Effective Time, preserved appraisal rights under Section
262 of the DGCL with respect to such share (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") will not
be converted into or represent the right to receive Merger consideration, and
the holder of such share will be entitled only to such rights as may be
granted to such holder pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided,
however,_ that if such appraisal rights will not be perfected or the holder
of such share will otherwise lose such holders appraisal rights with respect
to such share, then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the time of the
failure to perfect such status or the loss of such rights, such share will
cease to constitute Dissenting Shares and will automatically be converted
into and will represent only the right to receive (upon the surrender of the
certificate or certificates representing such shares or the completion of the
process described in Section 2.9) the Merger consideration,
without interest. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) Target will give Acquiror (i) prompt notice of any written demand received
by Target prior to the Effective Time to require Target to purchase shares of

DGCL and of any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to Target prior
to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL, and (ii) the opportunity
to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such
demand, notice or instrument. Target will not make any payment or settlement
offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such demand unless
Acquiror will have consented in writing to such payment or settlement offer,
which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. 

  

2.12 _Taking of Further Action_. If at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and
possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of Target and Merger Sub, from and after the Effective Time Acquiror and the

(C) the Target Current Liabilities, (D) the Target Statutory Liabilities and
(E) the Closing Adjustment. In the event that the Final Closing Adjustment
(as defined below) is a positive number, Acquiror shall pay the amount of the
Closing Adjustment to the Stakeholders Agent (or as directed by the
Stakeholders Agent) in cash via wire transfer of immediately available funds
within five (5) Business Days of the final determination of the Closing
Adjustment; provided, that in no event shall any positive Closing Adjustment
be greater than Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000). In the event the
Final Closing Adjustment is a negative number, then Acquiror will be
entitled to withdraw such amount from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the
provisions of the Escrow Agreement. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(b) _Access; Review; Disputes_. 

  

(i) If the Stakeholders Agent disputes Acquirors determination of the
Closing Adjustment, then, during the 60-day period commencing upon delivery
to the Stakeholders Agent of Acquirors determination of the Closing
Adjustment (the _"Review Period"_ ), the Stakeholders Agent will deliver a
written notice setting forth the bases for the Stakeholders Agent dispute of
such calculation (a _"Dispute Notice"_ ) to Acquiror and the Escrow Agent. 

  

(ii) If Acquiror does not receive a Dispute Notice from the Stakeholders
Agent prior to the expiration of the Review Period, then the calculation of
the Closing Adjustment determined by Acquiror will be deemed final and
binding on Acquiror, the Stakeholders Agent and the Former Stakeholders for
all purposes and will be deemed to be the _"Final Closing Adjustment."_  

  

(iii) If Acquiror receives a Dispute Notice from the Stakeholders Agent prior

Acquiror will use commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the
Closing Adjustment. If the Stakeholders Agent and Acquiror are unable to
reach agreement on the Closing Adjustment within twenty (20) days after
the end of the Review Period, either Party will have the right to refer such
dispute to the Bethesda, Maryland, office of BDO (such firm, or any successor
to such firm, the _"Designated Accounting Firm"_ ). In connection with the

Acquiror and the Stakeholders Agent will have a reasonable opportunity to
meet with the Designated Accounting Firm to provide its views as to any
disputed issues with respect to the calculation of the Closing Adjustment;
(ii) the Designated Accounting Firm will determine the Closing Adjustment
within thirty (30) days of the referral of such dispute to the
Designated Accounting Firm; (iii) upon making its final determination of the
Closing Adjustment, the Designated Accounting Firm will deliver a copy of its
calculations (the _"Expert Calculations"_ ) to the Stakeholders Agent and
Acquiror; and (iv) the determination of the Closing Adjustment made by the
Designated Accounting Firm will be final and binding on Acquiror, the
Stakeholders Agent and the Former Stakeholders for all purposes and will be
deemed to be the Final Closing Adjustment. The Expert Calculations will
reflect and explain in detail the differences, if any, between the Final
Closing Adjustment reflected therein and the Closing Adjustment as initially
determined by Acquiror. 

  

(iv) The fees and expenses of the Designated Accounting Firm will be borne
equally by Acquiror and the Former Stakeholders. All such fees and expenses
payable by the Former Stakeholders (including any portion of the fees and
expenses of the Designated Accounting Firm borne by the Stakeholders Agent
on behalf of the Former Stakeholders) will be reimbursable to or payable by
the Stakeholders Agent (solely on behalf of the Former Stakeholders and in
its capacity as the Stakeholders Agent, not in its individual capacity)
directly from the Stakeholders Agent Escrow Amount of the Escrow Fund.

(v) From and after the Effective Time, Acquiror will cause the Surviving
Corporation (A) to provide the Stakeholders Agent, and any accountants or

Surviving Corporation relating to the determination of the Closing Adjustment
and to personnel of the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries and (B) to
reasonably cooperate (at the Surviving Corporations expense), and cause the
personnel and outside accountants of the Surviving Corporation and the
Subsidiaries to reasonably cooperate (at the Surviving
Corporations expense), with the Stakeholders Agent and any accountants or
advisors retained by the Stakeholders Agent, in connection with any
proceedings involving the Designated Accounting Firm as described in clause

2.14 _Specified Transactional Expenses_. At least five (5) days prior to the
Closing Date, Target will deliver to Acquiror a notice setting forth the

paid by Target as of the Closing. Acquiror will be entitled to reduce the
Aggregate Closing Merger Consideration by the amount of unpaid
Specified Transactional Expenses set forth in such notice as described in
Section 1.1 of this Agreement, and such amounts will be paid at the Closing
by Acquiror directly to the parties listed on such notice. With respect to
any such Specified Transactional Expense that is a Transaction Bonus, such
amount shall be paid net of the amounts that Target is required to withhold
with respect to the payment of such compensation under the Code and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, or under any provision of any other
Tax Law and shall be paid net of the Transaction Bonus Pro Rata Escrow Amount
applicable to such Transaction Bonus.

3.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_. Target and each of its Subsidiaries is

its incorporation or formation. Target and its Subsidiaries have the
corporate or limited liability company power and authority to own or
use their properties and assets and to carry on their business (collectively,
the " _Target Business_ "). Target and each of its Subsidiaries is duly

such qualification. Target has delivered, or made available for review in a
data room, to Acquiror or its advisors true and correct copies of the

Subsidiaries, each as in effect as of the date of this Agreement. Neither

The Board of Directors of Target has unanimously (a) adopted this Agreement
and approved its execution and delivery and the consummation of the Merger;
and (b) determined and declared that the Merger is advisable and in the
best interests of the stockholders of Target and is on terms that are fair to
such stockholders. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
Target and, assuming this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of the other Parties to this Agreement, this Agreement constitutes
a valid and binding obligation of Target, enforceable against Target in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting or
relating to creditors rights generally and general principles of
equity, regardless of whether asserted in a proceeding in equity or at Law.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Target does not constitute,

effect on Acquiror or Target or such Subsidiary(ies), nor will such execution
and delivery by Target result in the imposition of any Encumbrance other than
Permitted Encumbrances. No material consent, approval, order or authorization
of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any court, administrative
agency or commission or other governmental authority or
instrumentality (each, a " _Governmental Entity_ ") is required to be
obtained or made by Target or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective

and authorizations are in full force and effect, except to the extent any
failure thereof would not have a Target Material Adverse Effect.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the representations set forth in this Section
3.3 will be deemed not to include any federal, state, county, local

transactions are recorded as necessary (1) to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP, and (2) to maintain accountability for
assets, (c) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with
managements general or specific authorization, and (d) the recorded
accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable
intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any significant

have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
Targets or any of its Subsidiaries internal control over financial
reporting; (II) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the

is or at any relevant time was treated as a single employer with Target

to have, individually or in the aggregate, any material liability or
obligation (collectively, the " _Target Employee Plans_ "). 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) _Documents_. Target has delivered to Acquiror or its advisors (or made
available in a data room for review by Acquiror or its advisors) true and

employee communications relating to each Target Employee Plan concerning the
benefits offered thereunder. With respect to each Target Employee Plan that
is subject to ERISA reporting requirements, Target has made available in a
data room for review by Acquiror or its advisors copies of the Form
5500 reports filed for the last three plan years. Target has made available
in a data room for review by Acquiror or its advisors the most recent
Internal Revenue Service determination or opinion letter issued with respect
to each such Target Employee Plan, and to Targets knowledge, nothing has
occurred since the issuance of each such letter that would reasonably be
expected to cause the loss of the tax-qualified status of any Target Employee
Plan subject to Code Section 401(a). 

  

(c) _Compliance_. Each Target Employee Plan is being, and has been,
administered in accordance with its terms and in material compliance with the
requirements prescribed by any and all Laws (including ERISA and the Code).
Target and each ERISA Affiliate are not in material default under or material
violation of, and have no knowledge of any material default or
material violation by any other party to, any of the Target Employee Plans.
Any Target Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code has either obtained from the Internal Revenue Service a favorable
determination letter as to its qualified status under the Code, including all
currently effective amendments to the Code, or has time remaining to apply
under applicable Treasury Regulations or Internal Revenue Service
pronouncements for a determination or opinion letter or to make any
amendments necessary to obtain a favorable determination or opinion letter.
None of the Target Employee Plans promises or provides retiree medical or
other retiree welfare benefits to any person other than the provision of
severance or termination pay or the continuation of benefits through the end
of the month of termination of employment or as otherwise required by Law.
Target has not engaged in, or participated in, any transaction which would
be considered a non-exempt "prohibited transaction," as such term is defined
in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, and to Targets
knowledge, no other third-party fiduciary and/or party-in-interest has
engaged in any such "prohibited transaction" with respect to any
Target Employee Plan. Neither Target nor any ERISA Affiliate is subject to
any liability or penalty under Sections 4976 through 4980 of the Code or
Title I of ERISA with respect to any Target Employee Plan. All contributions
required to be made by Target or any ERISA Affiliate to any Target Employee
Plan have been paid or accrued. With respect to each Target Employee Plan, no
"reportable event" within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA (excluding any
such event for which the thirty (30) day notice requirement has been waived
under the regulations to Section 4043 of ERISA) has occurred, nor has any
event described in Section 4062, 4063 or 4041 or ERISA occurred. Each
Target Employee Plan subject to ERISA has prepared in good faith and timely
filed all requisite governmental reports, which were true and correct in all
material respects as of the date filed, and, has properly and timely filed
and distributed or posted all notices and reports to employees required to be
filed, distributed or posted with respect to each such Target Employee Plan.
No suit, administrative proceeding or action has been brought, or to the
knowledge of Target is threatened in communications with Target, against or
with respect to any such Target Employee Plan, including any audit or inquiry
by the Internal Revenue Service or the United States Department of Labor and
other than routine claims for benefits thereunder. There has been
no amendment to, or written interpretation or announcement by Target or any
ERISA Affiliate regarding any Target Employee Plan that would materially
increase the expense of maintaining such Target Employee Plan above the level
of expense incurred with respect to that Plan for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2009. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(d) _No Title IV or Multiemployer Plan_. Neither Target nor any ERISA
Affiliate has ever maintained, established, sponsored, participated in or
contributed to, or is obligated to materially contribute to, or otherwise
incurred any obligation or liability (including any contingent liability)
under, any "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA) or
any "pension plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) subject to Title IV
of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. Neither Target nor any ERISA Affiliate
has any actual or potential withdrawal liability (including any contingent
liability) for any complete or partial withdrawal (as defined in Sections
4203 and 4205 of ERISA) from any multiemployer plan. 

  

(e) _No Self-Insured Plans_. Neither Target nor any ERISA Affiliate has
ever maintained, established, sponsored, participated in or contributed to
any self-insured plan that is governed by ERISA and that provides benefits to
employees (including any such plan pursuant to which a stop-loss policy or
contract applies), other than a health care reimbursement plan or a severance
or termination pay arrangement. 

  

(f) _COBRA, FMLA, HIPAA, Cancer Rights_. With respect to each Target Employee
Plan, Target is in material compliance with (i) the applicable health care
continuation and notice provisions of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985 (" _COBRA_ ") and the regulations thereunder or
any Law governing health care coverage extension or continuation to
its current or former employees; (ii) the applicable requirements of the
Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 and the regulations thereunder; (iii)
the applicable requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996, as may be amended, modified, revised or replaced
or interpreted by any Governmental Entity or court as well as the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to such statute and any Law coordinating
provisions (" _HIPAA_ "); and (iv) the applicable requirements of the Cancer
Rights Act of 1998. Target has no material unsatisfied obligations to any
employees, former employees or qualified beneficiaries pursuant to COBRA,
HIPAA or any Law governing health care coverage extension or continuation. 

  

(g) _Effect of Transaction_. Except as provided in Section 3.16(g) of the
Target Disclosure Schedule, or as set forth in this Agreement, the
consummation of the Merger will not (i) entitle any current or former
employee or other service provider of Target or any ERISA Affiliate to
severance benefits or any other payment (including unemployment compensation,
golden parachute, bonus or benefits under any Target Employee Plan), except
as expressly provided in this Agreement; or (ii) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting of any such benefits or increase the amount of
compensation due any such employee or service provider. No benefit payable or
that may become payable by Target pursuant to any Target Employee Plan as a
result of or arising under this Agreement will constitute an "excess parachute
payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code) subject to the
imposition of an excise Tax under Section 4999 of the Code or the deduction
for which would be disallowed by reason of Section 280G of the Code. Each
Target Employee Plan can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued
after the Effective Time in accordance with its terms, without material
liability to Acquiror or Target other than ordinary administration expenses
typically incurred in a termination event. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(h) Neither Target nor its Subsidiaries are a party to any contract,
agreement, plan or arrangement, including but not limited to the provisions
of this Agreement, covering any employee or former employee of Target or its
Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to give rise to the payment of any material amount that would be
subject to the deductibility limits of Section 404 of the Code. 

  

(i) Each Target Employee Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" (within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) has been
operated in material compliance with Section 409A of the Code, IRS Notice
2005-1, Treasury Regulations issued under Section 409A of the Code, and any
subsequent guidance relating thereto.

discrimination based on race, national origin, age, sex, sexual orientation,
religion, disability, or similar tortious conduct, breach of
contract, wrongful termination, defamation, intentional or negligent
infliction of emotional distress, interference with contract or interference
with actual or prospective economic disadvantage. There are no formal claims

all material respects with the terms of such binders, policies and bonds.

fully and finally resolved without further liability to Target or its
Subsidiaries (whether or not Target and its Subsidiaries have received

regulate its operations, activities or services and any Governmental Orders

Subsidiaries is in violation of any Health Care Law or Governmental Order,
except in either case, for such violation that would not have a materially

Subsidiaries has received any notice, citation, suspension, revocation,
limitation, warning, or request for repayment or refund issued by a
Governmental Entity which alleges or asserts that Target or any of its
Subsidiaries has violated any Health Care Laws or which requires, seeks or
calls attention to the necessity of any adjustment, modification or alteration
in Targets or any its Subsidiarys operations, activities, services or
financial condition that has not been fully and finally resolved to the
Governmental Entitys satisfaction without further liability to Target and
its Subsidiaries. There are no restrictions imposed by any Governmental
Authority upon the Target Business, activities or services of any of Target
or any of its Subsidiaries. Each of the Regulated Subsidiaries is in
compliance with all deposit, reserve, capital, net worth and other financial
requirements, including statutory and risk-based capital requirements,
applicable to such Regulated Subsidiary.

applicable to the management, administration and other services furnished by
the Management Sub to the Practice Entity. The Practice Entity is in
compliance with those Health Care Laws applicable to the Practice Entitys
medical practice and its usage of the premises in which the Practice Entity
has located its medical practice. The relationship between the Management Sub
and the Practice Entity does not violate any Law, including the corporate
practice of medicine doctrine or prohibitions against fee-splitting or
referrals to the Practice Entity or its employed or independently-contracted
health care professionals, as applied in the State of Maryland or
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, as the case may be. To Targets knowledge,
there is no threatened enforcement action by any Governmental Entity over the
Practice Entity or its medical practice, including, without limitation, any
outstanding fines, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties, investigations
or suspensions involving the Practice Entity. Each health care
professional employed by or contracted with the Practice Entity who is
required by applicable Health Care Laws to possess a License to deliver
health care services to patients of the Practice Entity (including the
performance of diagnostic services such as x-ray or lab services) possesses
such License and is performing only those services which are permitted by the
scope of such License. The practitioners of the Practice Entity are eligible
for reimbursement under any Program and are not debarred or excluded from any
Program. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) _Licenses_. Section 3.25(b) of the Target Disclosure Schedule sets forth
a list and summary description of the Licenses issued respectively to the
Regulated Subsidiaries, the Management Sub and the Practice Entity under the
Health Care Laws. The Licenses identified on Section 3.25(b) of the Target
Disclosure Schedule are valid and in full force and there are no pending or,
to Targets knowledge, threatened audits, investigations or proceedings which
reasonably would be expected to result in the termination or revocation or
any Licenses material to the operations of the person holding the License or
result in any limitation, restriction or impairment thereof. Neither Target,
any of the Regulated Subsidiaries nor the Practice Entity has received any
communications from Governmental Entities indicating a reasonable likelihood
that any Licenses of any of the Regulated Subsidiaries, the Management Sub or
the Practice Entity will be revoked or suspended. The Licenses identified on
Section 3.25(b) of the Target Disclosure Schedule as belonging to the
Regulated Subsidiaries, Management Sub or the Practice Entity are sufficient
for the Regulated Subsidiaries, Management Sub and the Practice Entity, as
the case may be, to lawfully conduct their respective businesses as currently
conducted. 

  

(c) _Program Participation and Medicare Benefit Offerings_. Each of the
Regulated Subsidiaries meets the requirements for participation in, and
receipt of payment from, the Programs in which each of the Regulated
Subsidiaries currently participates and is a party to one or more valid
agreements with CMS authorizing its participation as a Medicare Advantage
Program contractor. None of the Regulated Subsidiaries has received any
notice of any pending or threatened investigations that reasonably would
result in the termination of its contract(s) with CMS or its exclusion or
debarment from any Program and there is no civil, criminal, administrative or
other action, suit, demand, claim, hearing or notice of violation pending,
received or threatened that could reasonably be expected to result in a
Regulated Subsidiarys exclusion or debarment from participation in any of
the Programs in which it currently participates. The Practice Entity meets in
all material respects the requirements for participation in, and receipt of
payment from, the Programs in which the Practice Entity currently
participates. 

  

(d) _Producers, Producer Contracts and Commissions_. Each sales agent
employed with a Regulated Subsidiary is and each Producer contracted with the
Regulated Subsidiaries is, properly licensed and appointed to sell the MA
Plans. The commissions payable by the Regulated Subsidiaries to their
employed and contracted Producers comply with applicable Health Care Laws.
None of the Producers has violated Laws applicable to the marketing or
enrollment of the MA Plans. Section 3.25(d) of the Target Disclosure Schedule
sets forth a list of each non-employee Producer which, in calendar year 2009,
was paid more than one percent (1%) of the total commissions paid by
the Regulated Subsidiaries to all non-employee Producers in 2009 (the "
_Material Producers_ "). Target has delivered to Acquiror true and correct
copies of all forms of contracts currently used by the respective Regulated
Subsidiaries with their non-employee Producers and copies of the
Contracts entered into by the respective Regulated Subsidiaries with their
Material Producers. All of the Contracts with Producers are in writing and
signed, were entered into in the ordinary course of business and constitute
valid, binding and enforceable agreements of the parties thereto. Except in
the ordinary course of business, no past due amounts are owing by any of the
Regulated Subsidiaries under any Contracts with Producers and there are no
outstanding written claims made by a Producer that a Regulated Subsidiary has
failed to perform a material monetary or nonmonetary obligation arising under
its Contract. All forms of the Contracts with Producers which are currently
in use by the Regulated Subsidiaries conform to the requirements of applicable
Laws. Except as set forth in Section 3.25(d) of the Target Disclosure
Schedules, no consent or approval is required to be obtained, and no notice
required to be given, under any Contract with a Material Producer in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To
Targets knowledge, there are no circumstances, including the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which are likely to result
in the termination, cancellation or nonrenewal of a Contract with a Material
Producer, or the cessation of business being transacted between a Regulated
Subsidiary and a Material Producer. Section 3.25(d) of the Target Disclosure
Schedule sets forth all pending written cancellation, termination or
nonrenewal notices furnished to any of the Regulated Subsidiaries by a
Material Producer. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(e) _Providers and Provider Contracts_. Section 3.25(e) of the Target
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of the following Providers (" _Material
Health Care Providers_ "): (i) the top 20 hospitals, based on the total of
all hospital payments made by the Regulated Subsidiaries in calendar year
2009; (ii) the top 20 physician and physician groups, based on the total of
all physician payments made by the Regulated Subsidiaries in calendar year
2009, and any other primary care physician or physician group who or which is
assigned MA Plan Members that constitute greater than one percent (1.0%) of
the Regulated Subsidiaries total MA Plan Membership as of December 31, 2009;
(iii) the top 20 ancillary or specialty Providers, based on the total of all
ancillary and specialty Provider payments made by the Regulated Subsidiaries
in calendar year 2009; and (iv) the top 20 pharmacies or pharmacy companies,
based on the total of all payments made by the Regulated Subsidiaries to
pharmacies in calendar year 2009. Except in the ordinary course of business,
no past due amounts are owing by any of the Regulated Subsidiaries under any
Contracts with Material Health Care Providers and none of the Regulated
Subsidiaries is aware of any outstanding written claim made by a Material
Health Care Provider that such Regulated Subsidiary has failed to perform a
material monetary or nonmonetary obligation arising under its contract. All of
the contracts with Material Health Care Providers are in writing and signed,
were entered into in the ordinary course of business and constitute valid,
binding and enforceable agreements of the parties thereto. All forms of the
contracts with Providers which are currently in use by Regulated
Subsidiaries conform to the requirements of applicable Laws. Except as set
forth in Section 3.25(e) of the Target Disclosure Schedule, no consent or
approval is required to be obtained, and no notice required to be given,
under any contract with a Material Health Care Provider in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To Targets knowledge,
there are no circumstances, including the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, which are likely to result in the
termination, cancellation or nonrenewal of a contract with a Material Health
Care Provider or the cessation of business being transacted between a
Regulated Subsidiary and a Material Health Care Provider. Section 3.25(e) of
the Target Disclosure Schedule sets forth all pending cancellation,
termination or nonrenewal notices furnished to the Regulated Subsidiaries by
a Material Health Care Provider. 

  

3.26 _IBNR Report_. The historical claims paid data contained in each of the
categories (including Medicaid and Medicare) of Targets and/or its
Subsidiaries lag models as of July 31, 2010, which have been provided to
Acquiror, reflect substantially all claims paid by Target and/or its
Subsidiaries with respect to each such category as of the date(s)
referenced therein. Targets Loss Reserves reflected in the Target Balance
Sheet are adequate in all material respects.

4. _Representations and Warranties of Acquiror and Merger Sub_. Acquiror and Merger Sub represent and warrant to Target that: 

  

4.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of Acquiror and Merger Sub is
a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing, if
applicable, under the Laws of the state in which it was incorporated. There
is no pending or, to the knowledge of Acquiror or Merger Sub, threatened,

and Merger Sub, and no other authorization or consent of Acquiror, Merger Sub
or their respective stockholders is necessary. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by Acquiror and Merger Sub, and, assuming this
Agreement constitutes the valid and binding obligation of Target, this
Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each of Acquiror and
Merger Sub, enforceable against each of Acquiror and Merger Sub in accordance
with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting or relating to
creditors rights generally and general principles of equity, regardless of
whether asserted in a proceeding in equity or at Law. No consent, approval,
order or authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any
Governmental Entity or federal, state or local regulatory authority is
required to be obtained or made by Acquiror or Merger Sub at or prior to the
Effective Time in order for Acquiror or Merger Sub to execute and deliver this

or bylaws of Acquiror or the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Merger
Sub;

and information with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as

declaration, filing, permit, order, authorization, consent or approval which
if not made or obtained would not reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on Acquirors or Merger Subs ability to consummate the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby (an " _Acquiror
Material Adverse Effect_ "); 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(c) conflict with, result in a breach of, constitute (with or without due
notice or lapse of time or both) a default under, result in the acceleration
of obligations under, create in any party any right to terminate or modify,

bound, except for (i) any conflict, breach, default, acceleration or right to
terminate or modify that would not reasonably be expected to result in an
Acquiror Material Adverse Effect or (ii) any notice, consent or waiver the
failure of which to make or obtain would not reasonably be expected to result
in an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect;

any Governmental Entity or, to the knowledge of Acquiror, threatened in

properties or any of their respective officers or directors (in their
capacities as such) that would reasonably be expected to result in an
Acquiror Material Adverse Effect. 

  

(b) There is no judgment, decree or order against Acquiror or Merger Sub or,
to the knowledge of Acquiror and Merger Sub, against any of their respective
directors or officers (in their capacities as such) that specifically names
Acquiror or its Subsidiaries or such directors or officers and that would
reasonably be expected to result in an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect. 

  

4.5 _Merger Sub_. Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, has engaged in no other
business activities and has conducted its operations only as contemplated by
this Agreement. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

4.6 _Adequacy of Funds_. Acquiror has delivered to Target a true and complete
copy of the Commitment Letter (other than any Fee Letters relating solely to
the payment of fees and that do not affect the terms and conditions under
which the financing that is the subject of the Commitment Letter would be

the Commitment Letter has been redacted with respect to confidential
information contained therein relating to fee amounts. As of the date of this
Agreement, (i) the Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified, and
(ii) the commitments contained in the Commitment Letter have not been
withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. As of the date of this Agreement, no
event or circumstance has occurred or exists that would reasonably be
expected to constitute a default or breach or an incurable failure to satisfy
a condition precedent under the terms and conditions of the Commitment
Letter. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies, side
agreements or other arrangements or understandings (excluding the redacted
portions of the Commitment Letter) related to the funding of the Financing or
the terms thereof, other than as set forth in the Commitment Letter in the
forms delivered to Target. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
the Commitment Letter, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement, the aggregate proceeds contemplated by the Commitment Letter,
together with the available cash on hand of Acquiror, will be sufficient for
Acquiror to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby upon the terms
contemplated by this Agreement. Acquiror has fully paid (or has caused to be
fully paid) any and all commitment fees that have been incurred and are due
and payable in connection with the Commitment Letter prior to the date of
this Agreement and has otherwise satisfied (or caused to be satisfied) all
other terms and conditions required to be satisfied pursuant to the terms of
the Commitment Letter on or before the date hereof.

commitments, records, facilities, personnel, accountants, counsel, providers
and other Representatives, and (ii) other information concerning the
business, properties and personnel of Target as Acquiror may
reasonably request, for purposes of planning post-merger integration,

announcement does not disclose any of the terms of the Merger or the other

A Filings as promptly as practicable. Target and the Regulated Subsidiaries,

and assistance in connection with the Form A Filings. Acquiror, on the one
hand, and Target and the applicable Regulated Subsidiaries, on the other

violate the competitive standard in the applicable States insurance holding
company system Laws (the "Form E Filings"). The Regulated Subsidiaries,
if applicable, shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to have the
Form E Filings deemed approved as promptly as practicable. Acquiror shall
promptly provide the Regulated Subsidiaries with its full cooperation and
assistance in connection with the Form E Filings. The Regulated Subsidiaries,
on the one hand, and Acquiror, on the other hand, agree to respond, as
promptly as practicable, to any requests for information, inquiries or
comment letters issued by the applicable Insurance Commissioners.
Furthermore, Acquiror and the Regulated Subsidiaries respectively agree to
respond, as promptly as practicable, to any proposed undertakings or
commitments sought by Insurance Commissioners from the Acquiror, the
Surviving Corporation, the Regulated Subsidiaries or Target in connection
with the Form E Filings. 

  

(d) In addition to the foregoing obligations of the Parties in this Section
6.3, Acquiror and Target will use commercially reasonable efforts to
effectuate the Merger and make effective the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each
Party to this Agreement will: (i) make any filings and give any notices
required to be made or given by such Party in connection with the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any consent required to be obtained (pursuant to
any applicable legal requirement, contract or otherwise) by such Party in
connection with the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including accepting or entering into undertakings or
commitments sought by Governmental Entities that are usual, customary and
reasonable for transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement; and
(iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to lift any restraint, injunction or
other legal bar to the Merger. In no event, however, shall Acquiror be
required to take or refrain from taking any action pursuant to this Section
6.3 or otherwise that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse

schedules prepared by a party, such party shall promptly deliver to the other
Party a supplement to such schedules specifying such change. In addition,
during the Pre-Closing Period, Target or Acquiror, as the case may be, shall
promptly notify the other party of the occurrence of any material breach of

disqualified individual (as such term is defined in Section 280G(c) of the
Code) that would give rise to any excess parachute payment as that term

each such disqualified individual to conditionally waive the smallest portion
necessary under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations
thereunder of any such payments that are not so approved, such that
after giving effect to such vote and all related waivers and other
agreements, if the requisite number of affirmative votes are obtained, such
payments, awards and benefits will qualify for the exemption provided under
Section 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) of the Code and will not be subject to any excise
tax pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

6.9 _Indemnification of Officers and Directors of Target and its
Subsidiaries_. 

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Acquiror will cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to fulfill and honor in all respects the
obligations of Target and its Subsidiaries pursuant to any indemnification
provisions under the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Target and
the equivalent organization documents of its Subsidiaries as each is in
effect on the date of this Agreement (the persons entitled to be indemnified
pursuant to such provisions, and all other current and former directors and
officers of Target and its Subsidiaries, collectively, the " _Indemnified
Parties_ "). Acquiror will cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws
of Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions not less
favorable with respect to indemnification and exculpation from liability as
set forth in Targets certificate of incorporation and bylaws on the date of
this Agreement, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect
the rights of any Indemnified Party under such certificate of incorporation
or bylaws. 

  

(b) During the period ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
Acquiror will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Party against and from any costs
or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains to (i)
any action or omission or alleged action or omission in such Indemnified
Partys capacity as a director, officer or employee of Target or any of its
Subsidiaries (regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged
action or omission, occurred prior to, on or after the Closing Date) or (ii)
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided, however_
, that if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
any Indemnified Party delivers to the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary
a written notice asserting a claim for indemnification under this Section
6.9(b), then the claim asserted in such notice will survive the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time until the earlier of (i) such time as such
claim is fully and finally resolved or (ii) a reasonable person familiar with
such matters would determine that such claim has been fully and finally
abandoned or waived by the Third Party asserting the claim. In the event of
any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (i) the
Surviving Corporation or the Subsidiary, as applicable, will have the right
to control the defense of such matter after the Effective Time (it being
understood that, by electing to control the defense, the Surviving
Corporation or the Subsidiary, as applicable, will be deemed to have waived
any right to object to the Indemnified Parties entitlement to
indemnification under this Agreement with respect to such matter), (ii) if
the Surviving Corporation or the Subsidiary, as applicable, does not elect to
assume the defense of the matter, any counsel retained by the Indemnified
Parties with respect to the defense of such matter for any period after the
Effective Time must be reasonably satisfactory to Acquiror, and (iii) if the
Surviving Corporation or the Subsidiary does not elect to assume the defense
of the matter, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or
the Subsidiary, as applicable, will pay the reasonable fees and expenses of
such counsel, promptly after statements therefor are received (provided that
the Surviving Corporation or the Subsidiary shall not be required to pay the
fees and expenses of such counsel in the event of a final non-appealable
judicial determination that any Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification under this Agreement or the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and the equivalent organization documents
of the Subsidiaries, and any amounts advanced on his or her behalf will be
remitted to the Surviving Corporation); _provided_ , _however_ , that neither
Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation nor any Subsidiary, nor any Indemnified
Party, will be liable for any settlement 

 

    ##### 

  

   

effected without its, his or her express written consent, which consent will
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Indemnified Parties
as a group may retain only one law firm at the Surviving Corporations
expense (in addition to local counsel) to represent them with respect to any
single action unless counsel for any Indemnified Party determines in good
faith that, under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict
exists or is reasonably likely to arise on any material issue between the
positions of any two or more Indemnified Parties. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Section 6.9(b) or elsewhere in this Agreement,
the Surviving Corporation or the Subsidiary, as applicable, will not settle
or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek
termination with respect to any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation for which indemnification may be sought under this Section 6.9
unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an
unconditional release of all Indemnified Parties from all liability arising
out of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. 

  

(c) This Section 6.9 will survive the consummation of the Merger and the
Effective Time, is intended to benefit and may be enforced by the Indemnified
Parties, and will be binding on all successors and assigns of Acquiror and
the Surviving Corporation. 

  

6.10 _Directors  and Officers Insurance_. After the Effective Time and for a
period of six years after the Effective Time, Acquiror will cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the primary directors and
officers liability insurance "tail" policy purchased by Target in connection
with and prior to the Merger. 

  

6.11 _Target 401(k) Plan_. Target shall take all action necessary in
accordance with applicable Law to terminate the Target 401(k) plan (the "
_Target_ _401(k)_ _Plan_ ") effective no later than the day immediately prior
to the Closing Date and in connection therewith Target shall fully vest all
accounts of all participants in the Target 401(k) Plan and provide for the
distribution of all such accounts pursuant to applicable Law. Target shall
deliver to Acquiror at Closing duly executed resolutions of the Board of
Directors of Target reflecting the termination of the Target 401(k) Plan. 

  

6.12 _List of Stakeholders_. Prior to Closing, Target shall deliver to
Acquiror and the Stakeholders Agent a correct and complete schedule that
sets forth as of the Effective Time (i) the number of shares of Target
Capital Stock that each current stockholder of Target holds of record, (ii)
the number of shares of Target Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the
Unexercised Options and the name of each Target Option holder and Exercise
Price of each Unexercised Option, and (iii) the name of each person who will
receive a bonus, change of control or other similar payment from Target in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the gross
amount to be paid by Target to each such person (such bonuses and payments are
referred to as the " _Transaction Bonuses_ "). 

  

6.13 _Cancellation of Target Warrants_. Target shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to cause all
warrants to purchase shares of Target Capital Stock to be exercised or
canceled prior to the Closing Date. Target shall keep Acquiror informed on
a timely basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to cause
such warrants to be exercised or canceled. Target shall give Acquiror prompt
notice if it becomes aware of any event or circumstance that makes it
reasonably unlikely that such warrants will be exercised or canceled prior to
the Closing Date.

their respective covenants in this Agreement such that the condition set forth
in Section 7.3(b) would not be satisfied, (ii) Target will have delivered to
Acquiror a written notice of such inaccuracy or breach, and (iii) at least
thirty (30) days will have elapsed since the delivery of such notice without
such inaccuracy or breach having been cured; 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(e) without limiting the right of either Acquiror or Target to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b), by Acquiror if (i) there is an
inaccuracy in any of the representations or warranties of Target in this
Agreement such that the condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) would not be
satisfied, or there has been a breach by Target of any of its covenants in
this Agreement such that the condition set forth in Section 7.2(b) would not
be satisfied, (ii) Acquiror will have delivered to Target a written notice of
such inaccuracy or breach, and (iii) at least thirty (30) days will have
elapsed since the delivery of such notice without such inaccuracy or breach
having been cured; or 

  

(f) by either Acquiror or Target in the event that a Governmental Entity has
unappealably and finally denied or refused to furnish a Required Regulatory
Approval or issued an order seeking to enjoin the Merger or the change of
control of one or more of the Regulated Subsidiaries or requiring one or more
of the Regulated Subsidiaries to cease and desist doing business such
that, in any case, the condition set forth in Section 7.1(c) shall become
incapable of being satisfied. 

  

8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement as
provided in Section 8.1, except as set forth in Section 8.3 below, this
Agreement will be of no further force or effect, and there will be no
liability on the part of Acquiror, Target, Merger Sub or their respective
officers, directors or stockholders, except to the extent that such
liability results from the willful material breach by a Party of any of its
covenants set forth in this Agreement; _provided, however,_ that the
provisions of Section 10 (and the Confidentiality Agreement) will remain in
full force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement. 

  

8.3 _Termination By Target Because of Failure of Financing_. In the event that
all of the other conditions to Closing described in Sections 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3
(other than conditions that will be satisfied at the Closing) are satisfied,
the Closing cannot occur on the Termination Date solely as a result of
Acquirors failure satisfy the condition in Section 7.2(k) and
Target terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b), Acquiror shall
deliver by wire transfer to Target within five (5) Business Days following
Acquirors receipt of Targets notice of the termination of this Agreement
Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) in cash (the _"Termination Fee"_ ). The
Parties acknowledge and agree that it would be impracticable or extremely
difficult for any Party to determine the actual damages resulting from any
such breach or failure to perform by Acquiror hereunder and, therefore, the
Parties have agreed upon the foregoing remedy as liquidated damages which
shall not be deemed to be in the nature of a penalty. In the event Target
terminates this Agreement and Acquiror pays the Termination Fee to Target as
described in this Section 8.3, Target shall retain the Termination Fee as
liquidated damages and all further rights and obligations of the Parties
under this Agreement will terminate except with respect to the provisions of
Section 10 (and the Confidentiality Agreement), which will remain in full
force and effect; provided, that if the condition to Closing in Section
7.2(k) is not satisfied because Acquiror has willfully breached its covenants
contained in Section 6.7(b), then Target shall be entitled to pursue any
available remedy for such breach and pursue damages in excess of
the Termination Fee. Except in a circumstance where Acquiror is found to have
willfully breached its covenants contained in Section 6.7(b), Targets right
to receive payment of the Termination Fee from Acquiror shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of Target against Acquiror, the Lenders, Merger Sub or any
of their respective former, current or future directors, officers, employees,
agents, stockholders, representatives, affiliates or assignees or any former,
current or future director, officer, employee, agent, general or limited
partner, manager, member, stockholder, representative, affiliate or assignee
of any of the foregoing (collectively, the _"_ _Related Persons_ _"_ ) for
any loss or damage suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be
consummated or for a breach or failure to perform under this Agreement or
otherwise. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

9\. _Escrow and Indemnification_  

   

9.1 _Escrow Fund_. 

  

(a) At the Closing, Acquiror will deposit with the Escrow Agent an amount
equal to the sum of (a) Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) (the "
_Stakeholders  Agent Escrow Amount_"), _plus_ (b) Fifty Five Million Dollars
($55,000,000) (the " _Indemnity Escrow Amount_ " and collectively with
the Stakeholders Agent Escrow Amount, the " _Escrow Fund_ "). The Escrow
Fund will be governed by the terms set forth in the Escrow Agreement. The
Indemnity Escrow Amount will be available (i) to indemnify Acquiror pursuant
to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Section 9, and (ii) to
make any payment on behalf of the Former Stakeholders to Acquiror pursuant to
Section 2.13. The Stakeholders Agent Escrow Amount will be available,
without the requirement of any consent or approval by Acquiror, to indemnify
and hold the Stakeholders Agent harmless against any liability, loss,
damage, penalty, fine, cost or expense incurred by the Stakeholders Agent
without gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the
Stakeholders Agent and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance
or administration of its duties under this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement, and in no event will any of such liabilities, losses,
damages, penalties, fines, costs or expenses payable to the Stakeholders
Agent be paid from the Indemnity Escrow Amount. 

  

(b) On the first Business Day following the Initial Claim Termination Date,
Acquiror and the Stakeholders Agent will be obligated to instruct the Escrow
Agent to pay to each Former Stakeholder, in immediately available funds from
the Indemnity Escrow Amount of the Escrow Fund, a dollar amount equal to each
such Former Stakeholders Pro Rata Portion of the difference between (i) the
aggregate amount then held in the Indemnity Escrow Amount of the Escrow Fund
and (ii) the sum of (A) Twenty Three Million Dollars ($23,000,000) (the
_"Three Year Escrow Amount"_ ) and (B) a reserve amount equal to the estimate
of Damages set forth in the Claims Notices relating to all pending and
unresolved Claims. On the first Business Day following the Final Claim
Termination Date, Acquiror and the Stakeholders Agent will be obligated to
instruct the Escrow Agent to pay to each Former Stakeholder, in immediately
available funds from the Indemnity Escrow Amount of the Escrow Fund, a dollar
amount equal to each such Former Stakeholders Pro Rata Portion of
the difference between (i) the aggregate amount then held in the Indemnity
Escrow Amount of the Escrow Fund and (ii) a reserve amount equal to the
estimate of Damages set forth in the Claims Notices relating to all pending
and unresolved Claims. Any reserve amounts held in the Indemnity
Escrow Amount of the Escrow Fund following the Final Claim Termination Date
that are not expended in resolving a Claim shall be disbursed to the Former
Stakeholders upon final resolution of the Claim to which it relates or if a
reasonable person familiar with such matters would determine that such claim
has been fully and finally abandoned or waived by the Third Party asserting
the claim. Following the resolution of all Claims, the Stakeholders Agent
Amount shall be disbursed to the Former Stakeholders as set forth in the
Escrow Agreement. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

9.2 _Indemnification_. 

  

(a) _Expiration of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. Acquirors
right to indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2 will expire on the date
eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date (the " _Initial Claim Termination
Date_ "); _provided, however,_ that Acquirors right to indemnification
pursuant to Sections 9.2(b)(iii) and 9.2(b)(v) will expire on the third
anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Final Claim Termination Date_ ")
(except with respect to any Claims pending on that date); and _provided,
further,_ that if at any time prior to the Initial Claim Termination Date or
the Final Claim Termination Date, as applicable, Acquiror delivers to the
Stakeholders Agent a notice (a _"Claim Notice"_ ) stating (i) the existence
of an inaccuracy in any of the representations and warranties made by Target
or a breach of a covenant made by Target (and setting forth in reasonable
detail the basis for Acquirors determination that such an inaccuracy or
breach exists and the amount of the Damages incurred or Acquirors good faith
estimate of the Damages to be incurred by Acquiror as a result of such
inaccuracy or breach) or (ii) a set of facts that have been alleged by a
Third Party that is reasonably believed to be true and, if ultimately
determined to be true, would constitute an inaccuracy in any of the
representations and warranties made by Target or the breach of a covenant
made by Target (and setting forth in reasonable detail Acquirors good faith
estimate of the Damages to be incurred by Acquiror as a result of
such inaccuracy or breach) and asserting a claim for recovery under this
Section 9.2 based on such inaccuracy or breach, then the claim asserted in
such notice will survive the Initial Claim Termination Date or the Final
Claim Termination Date, as applicable, until the earlier of such time as (i)
such claim is fully and finally resolved or (ii) a reasonable person familiar
with such matters would determine that such claim has been fully and finally
abandoned or waived by the Third Party asserting the claim. All obligations
of the Parties under the covenants contained in this Agreement (including the
covenants set forth in Sections 5 and 6) will expire at the Effective Time,
except to the extent that any such covenant expressly specifies that it is to
be (or is otherwise required by this Agreement to be) performed after the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _further, however_ , that notwithstanding the
expiration of the Parties obligations under such covenants, claims for
breaches of any covenants of Target prior to their expiration, other than
relating to Section 9.2(b)(iii) and 9.2(b)(v) may be brought after the
Effective Time and until the Initial Claim Termination Date. The Parties
acknowledge that the time periods set forth in this Section 9 and elsewhere
in this Agreement for the assertion of claims and notices under this Agreement
are the result of arms-length negotiation among the Parties and that they
intend for the time periods to be enforced as agreed by the Parties. The
Parties further acknowledge that the time periods set forth in this Section 9
and elsewhere in the Agreement may be shorter than otherwise provided
by Law. 

  

    ##### 

  

  

(b) _Indemnification_. Subject to the limitations set forth in Sections
9.2(a) and 9.2(c) and the other limitations set forth in this Agreement, from
and after the Effective Time Acquiror will be entitled to be indemnified,
solely from the Indemnity Escrow Amount of the Escrow Fund, against any
Damages arising from or in connection with (i) any inaccuracy in
any representation or warranty of Target set forth in Section 3 or any Target
Closing Certificate, (ii) the breach of any covenant of Target in this
Agreement, (iii) any amounts owed by Target or its Subsidiaries to any
Governmental Entity or third party arising out of overpayments to Target or
its Subsidiaries relating to periods of service prior to the Closing Date,
whether such overpayments are determined as a result of any adjustment to
premiums, audit, investigation or other similar process, (iv) any penalties
and interest owed by Target or the Subsidiaries relating to Taxes arising out
of or relating to adjustments to Targets Loss Reserve as of the Closing Date
on the balance sheet of Target as of the day immediately following the
Effective Time, and (v) any Damages relating to any Covered Matter
(notwithstanding the disclosure of any Covered Matter prior to Closing) in
excess of the accruals included in the Target Current Liabilities or the
Target Statutory Liabilities specifically relating to any Covered Matter. For
purposes of this Section 9, " _Damages_ " will mean any liabilities, losses,
damages, penalties, fines, costs or expenses, including reasonable legal,
expert and consultant fees and expenses, but excluding any exemplary or
punitive damages, other than awards of exemplary or punitive damages paid or
payable to a third party under a third party claim. In determining the amount
of Damages pursuant to this Section 9, Damages shall include only the amounts
in excess of reserves or accruals included in the Target Current Liabilities
or the Target Statutory Liabilities with respect to the specific claim from
which the Damages result. 

   

(c) _Limitations of Liability_. 

  

(i) The right of Acquiror to be indemnified from the Indemnity Escrow Amount
of the Escrow Fund pursuant to this Section 9 will be the sole and exclusive
remedy with respect to any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of
Target contained in, or any other breach by Target of this Agreement or
otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Subject
to Section 9.2(c)(iii), no current or former stockholder, director, officer,
employee, affiliate or advisor of Target will have any personal or individual
liability of any nature to Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation or any
affiliate of Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation with respect to
any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in, or any other
breach of, this Agreement or otherwise in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby. 

  

(ii) Without limiting the effect of any other limitation contained in this
Section 9, the indemnification provided for in Section 9.2(b)(i) or (ii) will
not apply, and Acquiror will not be entitled to exercise any indemnification
rights under this Agreement, except to the extent that the aggregate amount
of the Damages against which Acquiror would otherwise be entitled to
be indemnified under Section 9.2(b)(i) or (ii) exceeds One Million Dollars
$1,000,000 (the " _Indemnification Threshold_ "). If the aggregate amount of
such Damages exceeds the Indemnification Threshold, then Acquiror will,
subject to the other limitations contained in this Agreement, be entitled to
be indemnified from the Indemnity Escrow Amount of the Escrow Fund only
against the portion of such Damages in excess of the Indemnification
Threshold. The Indemnification Threshold shall not apply to the
indemnification provided for in Section 9.2(b)(iii), Section 9.2(b)(iv)
or Section 9.2(b)(v), and amounts indemnifiable pursuant to Section
9.2(b)(iii), Section 9.2(b)(iv) or Section 9.2(b)(v) will not be counted
toward the Indemnification Threshold. However, in no event shall the
aggregate indemnification payments to be made pursuant to this Section 9
exceed Fifty Five Million Dollars ($55,000,000) (the " _Indemnification Cap_
"). 

  

(iii) Nothing in this Agreement will limit any remedy Acquiror may have
against any person for fraud in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby under applicable Laws. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(d) _Defense of Third-Party Claims_. 

  

(i) Promptly after receipt by a Party purporting to be entitled to
indemnification under Section 9.2 (the _"Indemnitee"_ ) of notice of the
commencement of any Action against it, such Indemnitee will, if a Claim is to
be made against a Party obligated to indemnify under such Section (the
_"Indemnitor"_ ), give notice to the Indemnitor (which, in the case of
indemnification payable from the Indemnity Escrow Amount of the Escrow Fund
shall be the Stakeholders Agent) of the commencement of such Action, but the
failure to notify the Indemnitor will not relieve the Indemnitor of any
liability that it may have to any Indemnitee, except to the extent that (i)
the defense of such Action is materially prejudiced by the Indemnitees
failure to give such notice or (ii) the Indemnitee fails to notify the
Indemnitor of the Action prior to the Initial Claim Termination Date as
described in Section 9.2(a). Each such notice shall specify in
reasonable detail the basis for Indemnitees Claim. 

  

(ii) If any Action is brought against an Indemnitee and it gives notice to the
Indemnitor of the commencement of such Action, the Indemnitor will be
entitled to participate in such Action and, to the extent that it wishes
(unless the Indemnitor is also a party to such Action and the Indemnitee
reasonably determines in good faith that joint representation of both parties
by the same counsel would be materially adverse to the Indemnitee or counsel
for the Indemnitee determines in good faith that, under applicable standards
of professional conduct, a conflict exists or is reasonably likely to arise
on any material issue between the positions of Indemnitor and Indemnitee (any
refusal of such assumption by the Indemnitee is referred to herein as a "
_Permitted Defense Assumption Refusal_ ")) to assume the defense of such
Action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee and, after
notice from the Indemnitor to the Indemnitee of its election to assume the
defense of such Action, the Indemnitor will not, as long as it diligently
conducts such defense, be liable to the Indemnitee under this Section 9 for
any fees or expenses of any other counsel or any other expenses with respect
to the defense of such Action, in each case incurred by or on behalf of the
Indemnitee, including any such fees or expenses incurred prior to
the Indemnitors delivery of notice of assumption of the defense to the
Indemnitee; provided, however, that the Indemnitee may, prior to the date on
which it receives such notice of assumption of the defense, (I) retain
counsel, whose reasonable fees and expenses shall (subject to the remainder
of this Section 9.2(d)(ii)) be at the expense of the Indemnitor, (II) file
any motion, answer or other pleading and (III) take such other action that it
reasonably shall deem necessary to protect its interests (without prejudicing
the interests of the Indemnitor) or those of the Indemnitor until the date on
which the Indemnitee receives such notice from the Indemnitor. If the
Indemnitor assumes the defense of an Action, (A) it will be conclusively
established for purposes of this Agreement that the claims made in that
Action are within the scope of and subject to indemnification under this
Agreement, and (B) the Indemnitor, so long as it diligently conducts such
defense, shall have full and exclusive control of the conduct of such defense
and the compromise and/or settlement of such Action; provided, however, that
no compromise or settlement of such Action may be effected by the Indemnitor
without the Indemnitees consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). If the Indemnitor assumes the defense of
an Action, or if the Indemnitor elects to assume such defense but Indemnitee
effects a Permitted Defense Assumption Refusal, then the Indemnitor will have
no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such Action
effected without its consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). If notice is given to an Indemnitor of the
commencement of any Action and the Indemnitor does not, within ten Business
Days after the Indemnitees notice is given, give notice to the Indemnitee of
its election to assume the defense of such Action, the Indemnitor will be
bound by any determination made in such Action or any compromise or
settlement effected by the Indemnitee (subject to the Indemnification
Threshold and Indemnification Cap). 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(iii) In addition to any rights of Acquiror with respect to Permitted Defense
Assumption Refusals described above, if any Action is brought against
Acquiror, Target or the Subsidiaries by any Governmental Entity, Acquiror
shall have the right, by notice to the Stakeholders Agent, to assume and
control the conduct, compromise or settlement of the defense of such Action;
provided, however, that (a) Acquiror shall keep the Stakeholders Agent
reasonably apprised of the status of the defense of such Action, (b) the
Stakeholders Agent shall have the right to participate in the defense of
such Action, (c) the Former Stakeholders shall have no liability with respect
to any compromise or settlement of such Action effected without the consent
of the Stakeholders Agent (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), and (d) all fees or expenses of the Stakeholders
Agents counsel or any other expenses with respect to the Stakeholders
Agents participation in the defense of such Action shall be paid exclusively
out of the Stakeholders Agent Escrow Amount or by the Former Stakeholders
directly. 

  

(iv) In connection with the defense of any Action as described in this Section
9, Target and the Subsidiaries will afford Indemnitor and its Representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours with reasonable prior notice
to Targets and the Subsidiaries records and other documents that are
reasonably necessary for the defense of such Action by the Indemnitor, and
shall cooperate with Indemnitor and its Representatives in the defense of any
such Action as reasonably requested by Indemnitor. Prior to the disclosure of
any of Targets or the Subsidiaries records or other documents, the Target
and its Representatives shall enter into a confidentiality agreement with
Acquiror in a form reasonably acceptable to Acquiror. 

  

(e) _Subrogation_. To the extent that Acquiror is entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this Section 9, the Stakeholders Agent will be entitled to
exercise for the benefit of the Former Stakeholders, and will be subrogated
to, any rights and remedies (including rights of indemnity, rights of
contribution and other rights of recovery) that Acquiror or any of
Acquirors Subsidiaries or other affiliates may have against any other person
with respect to any Damages, circumstances or matter to which such
indemnification is directly or indirectly related. Acquiror will permit the
Stakeholders Agent to use the name of Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation or
their respective affiliates in any transaction or in any proceeding or other
matter involving any of such rights or remedies, and Acquiror will take such
actions as the Stakeholders Agent may reasonably request for the purpose of
enabling the Stakeholders Agent to perfect or exercise the right
of subrogation of the Stakeholders Agent under this Section 9.2(e). 

 

    ##### 

  

   

9.3 _Stakeholders  Agent_. 

  

(a) By virtue of the approval of this Agreement by Targets stockholders, the
consummation of the Merger, and the Former Stakeholders participation
in and receipt of consideration in the Merger, and without further action of
any Former Stakeholder, each Former Stakeholder will be deemed to have
irrevocably constituted and appointed the Stakeholders Agent (and by
execution of this Agreement it hereby accepts such appointment) as agent and
attorney-in-fact for and on behalf of the Former Stakeholders, with full power
of substitution, to act in the name, place and stead of each Former
Stakeholder with respect to this Section 9 and the Escrow Agreement and the
taking by the Stakeholders Agent of any and all actions and the making of
any decisions required or permitted to be taken by the Stakeholders Agent
under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, including the exercise of the
power to: (i) give and receive notices and communications under this Section
9 or the Escrow Agreement; (ii) participate on behalf of the Former
Stakeholders in the resolution of any dispute relating to the
Closing Adjustment; (iii) authorize delivery to Acquiror of cash from the
Indemnity Escrow Amount of the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims for
indemnification made by Acquiror under this Section 9; (iv) object to claims
for indemnification made by Acquiror under this Section 9; (v) agree
to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and comply with
orders of courts with respect to claims for indemnification made by Acquiror
under this Section 9; (vi) take all actions necessary or appropriate in the
good faith judgment of the Stakeholders Agent for the accomplishment of the
foregoing; and (vii) obtain reimbursement for all out-of-pocket expenses
in connection with its duties under this Agreement from the Stakeholders
Agent Escrow Amount. The power of attorney granted in this Section 9.3 is
coupled with an interest and is irrevocable, may be delegated by the
Stakeholders Agent and will survive the dissolution, death or incapacity
of any Former Stakeholder. If the Stakeholders Agent shall be dissolved,
die, be removed, become disabled, resign or otherwise be unable to fulfill
its responsibilities hereunder, the Former Stakeholders shall (by consent of
at least three of Salix Ventures, New Enterprise Associates, Frazier
Healthcare and Technology Ventures and CCP Equity Partners, within ten days
after such dissolution, death, removal, disability, resignation or inability,
appoint a successor to the Stakeholders Agent and immediately thereafter
notify Acquiror of the identity of such successor. Any such successor shall
succeed the former Stakeholders Agent as the Stakeholders Agent hereunder.
If for any reason there is no Stakeholders Agent at any time, all references
herein to the Stakeholders Agent shall be deemed to refer to the Former
Stakeholders. No bond will be required of the Stakeholders Agent. Each
Former Stakeholder hereby agrees to receive correspondence from the
Stakeholders Agent, including in electronic form. 

  

(b) The Stakeholders Agent will not be liable for any liability, loss,
damage, penalty, fine, cost or expense incurred without gross negligence by
the Stakeholders Agent while acting in good faith and arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of its duties under this
Agreement; _it being understood_ that any act done or omitted pursuant to the
advice of counsel will be conclusive evidence of such good faith). The Former
Stakeholders shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Stakeholders
Agent and its successors and assigns from and against any and all claims,
demands, suits, actions, causes of action, losses, damages, obligations,
liabilities, costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and court costs)
arising as a result of or incurred in connection with any actions taken or
omitted to be taken by the Stakeholders Agent pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, except to the extend it is finally adjudicated that the
Stakeholders Agent was grossly negligent or engaged in willful misconduct.
If not paid directly to the Stakeholders Agent by the Former Stakeholders or
from the 

 

    ##### 

  

   

Stakeholders Agent Escrow Amount, any such losses, liabilities or expenses
may be recovered by the Stakeholders Agent from amounts to be disbursed to
the Former Stakeholders from the Indemnity Escrow Amount following the final
release of the Escrow Fund pursuant to the terms hereof; provided, that this
does not relieve the Former Stakeholders from their obligation to promptly
pay such losses, liabilities or expenses, nor does it prevent the
Stakeholders Agent from seeking any remedies available to it at law or
otherwise. The Stakeholders Agent will be entitled to recover any out-of-
pocket costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the Stakeholders Agent
in connection with actions taken by the Stakeholders Agent pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement (including the hiring of
legal counsel and the incurring of legal fees and costs) from the
Stakeholders Agent Escrow Amount of the Escrow Fund, without the requirement
of any consent or approval by Acquiror, to the extent not reimbursable from
the Indemnity Escrow Amount. 

  

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Acquiror will cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide the Stakeholders Agent with reasonable access to
information about the Surviving Corporation and the reasonable assistance of
the officers and employees of Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation for
purposes of performing its duties and exercising its rights under
this Agreement, provided that the Stakeholders Agent will treat
confidentially any nonpublic information it receives from Acquiror regarding
the Surviving Corporation (except in connection with the performance by the
Stakeholders Agent of its duties or the exercise of its rights under this
Agreement). 

  

9.4 _Actions of the Stakeholders  Agent_. From and after the Effective Time,
a decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stakeholders Agent will
constitute a decision of all Former Stakeholders and will be final, binding
and conclusive upon each Former Stakeholder, and the Escrow Agent and
Acquiror may rely upon any decision, act, consent or instruction of
the Stakeholders Agent as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of
each Former Stakeholder. Acquiror and Surviving Corporation are hereby
relieved from any liability to any person for any acts done by Stakeholders
Agent and any acts done by Acquiror or Surviving Corporation in accordance
with any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stakeholders
Agent. 

  

9.5 _Tax Matters_. The Parties agree that (i) any amounts released to Acquiror
from the Indemnity Escrow Amount of the Escrow Fund pursuant to this
Agreement will be treated as a reduction in the aggregate consideration paid
in connection with the Merger for federal income tax purposes; (ii) amounts
paid to the holders of Target stock from the Escrow Fund or pursuant
to Section 2.13 hereof will be treated as an increase in the aggregate
consideration paid in connection with the Merger for federal income tax
purposes; and (iii) amounts described in clause (ii) will be reported on the
installment method of tax reporting (unless a particular Target stockholder
elects otherwise). All interest and other income earned on the Escrow Fund
(net of any losses and expenses) will be retained by the Escrow Agent and
added to and become part of the Escrow Fund; provided, that on a quarterly
basis the Escrow Agent shall, without the requirement of any consent or
approval by the Stakeholders Agent, pay to Acquiror an amount equal to 40% of
the interest and other income earned on the Escrow Fund during the preceding
quarter. The Parties hereto agree that all income, gain, loss and deductions
derived from the investment of the Escrow Fund will be taken into account for
income tax purposes by the Acquiror. Acquiror will be responsible for
advising and assisting the Escrow Agent with any Tax reporting required in
connection with reporting taxable income earned from investment of the Escrow
Fund and disbursements from the Escrow Fund, subject to the prior review and
approval of the Stakeholders Agent.

accounting, investment banking or other fees or expenses incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (D)

means the actual knowledge of Jeffrey Folick, Scott Tabakin, Frances

more of them of the officers of the Target and the Subsidiaries who are

(d) In this Agreement, "person" means any individual or entity. 

  

10.3 _Target Disclosure Schedule_. The Target Disclosure Schedule will be
arranged to correspond to the representations and warranties in Section 3 of
this Agreement, and the disclosure in any portion of the Target Disclosure

provision of Section 3 to which it is reasonably apparent on its face
that such disclosure relates. 

  

10.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which will be considered one and the same agreement, and
will become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being understood that
all Parties need not sign the same counterpart. 

  

10.5 _Entire Agreement; Nonassignability; Parties in Interest_. This Agreement
and the documents and instruments delivered pursuant to this Agreement,
including the exhibits to this Agreement, the Target Disclosure Schedule and
the other schedules to this Agreement: (a) together constitute the entire
agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter of
this Agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter of
this Agreement, except for the Confidentiality Agreement, which will continue
in full force and effect in accordance with its terms and will survive any
termination of this Agreement; (b) are not intended to confer upon any other
person any rights or remedies hereunder, except as provided in the last
sentence of Section 8.3 (which is intended to be enforceable by the persons
specified therein to the extent applicable), the last sentence of Section
10.8 (which is intended to be enforceable by the Lenders and
their Representatives) and the final sentence of this Section 10.5; and (c)

Target, on the other hand (by operation of law or otherwise), without the
written consent of each of the Parties to this Agreement, except
that Acquiror shall be entitled to freely assign its rights and obligations
hereunder to one of its affiliates (provided that such affiliate is of
similar creditworthiness and such assignment does not affect the Acquirors
(or its assignees) ability to obtain the Financing on a less
timely basis. Acquiror may collaterally assign its rights hereunder to any
financial institution providing financing in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, provided that no such assignment or
delegation will relieve Acquiror from any of its obligations
hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement (but without limiting any of the rights of the Stakeholders Agent
hereunder), if the Merger is consummated, (i) the Former Stakeholders and the
persons who held, immediately prior to the Effective Time, options to
purchase Target Capital Stock will be third party beneficiaries of the
provisions set forth in Section 2, (ii) the Former Stakeholders will be third
party beneficiaries of the provisions set forth in Section 9.1(b), and (iii)
the Indemnified Parties will be third party beneficiaries of the provisions
set forth in Section 6.10.

10.6 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or
the application of any provision of this Agreement, becomes, or is declared
by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable,
the remainder of this Agreement, and the application of such provision to
other persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is determined
to be illegal, void or unenforceable, will not be impaired or otherwise
affected and will continue in full force and effect and be enforceable to the
fullest extent permitted by Law. 

  

10.7 _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided in Section 9.2(c),
Section 8.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement, any and all remedies in this
Agreement expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with,
and not exclusive of, any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity
upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy. 

  

10.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
parties residing in the State of Delaware, without regard to applicable
principles of conflicts of Law. Each of the Parties irrevocably waives the
right to trial by jury in connection with any matter based upon or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of the
Parties agrees that it will bring any action, cause of action, claim, cross-
claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or
in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise against any other
Party or any of their Representatives in any way relating to this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement solely in any
Federal or state court having jurisdiction and located in a state other than
the States of Maryland or Tennessee. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, each of the Parties also agrees that it will not
bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-
party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether
in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Lenders or any of
their Representatives in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including but not limited to any
dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Commitment Letter or the
performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State
of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof). 

 

    ##### 

  

   

10.9 _Rules of Construction_. 

  

(a) The Parties to this Agreement agree that they have been represented by
counsel during the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any Law or rule of construction
providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be
construed against the Party drafting such agreement or document. 

  

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires: the
singular number will include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine gender
will include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender will
include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender will include
the masculine and feminine genders. 

  

(c) As used in this Agreement, the words "include" and "including," and
variations of those words, will not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but
rather will be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." 

  

(d) Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement to
"Sections," "Schedules" and "Exhibits" are intended to refer to Sections of
this Agreement and Schedules and Exhibits to this Agreement. 

  

10.10 _Time is of the Essence; Enforcement_. Time is of the essence of this
Agreement. Each of the Parties to this Agreement agrees that irreparable
damage would occur and that the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at
Law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties will be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or
in equity. 

  

10.11 _Amendment; Waiver_. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties to this
Agreement. Any waiver of any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement
must be in writing and must be duly executed by or on behalf of the Party to
be charged with such waiver. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement,
the failure of a Party to exercise any of its rights hereunder or to insist
upon strict adherence to any term or condition of this Agreement on any one
occasion will not be construed as a waiver or deprive that Party of the right
thereafter to insist upon strict adherence to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement at a later date. Further, no waiver of any of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement will be deemed to or will constitute a waiver of
any other term of condition of this Agreement (whether or not similar). 

 

    ##### 

  

  

10.12 _Attorney-Client Privileged Communications_. Acquiror hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally acknowledges and agrees not to, solely in any post-
closing dispute or Action between the parties, (a) claim a waiver of the
attorney-client privilege regarding any privileged communications between
Target and Cooley, LLP to the extent relating to the
negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and closing under, or any
dispute or Action arising under or in connection with, this Agreement, or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, the " _Transaction
Representation_ ") based on the fact that Acquiror has succeeded to
the business of Target (or ownership of the Target and its Subsidiaries) or
(b) claim ownership or otherwise use any such privileged communications
(i.e., those relating to the Transaction Representation). The foregoing shall
not (i) excuse a waiver of the attorney-client privilege on any other
grounds, including the inadvertent or other non-confidential disclosure of any
such communications, and (ii) in any event limit the Targets ownership (and
Acquirors indirect ownership) of such information for any other purpose,
including in respect of the defense or investigation of any Action involving
a third party for which the Stakeholders Agent has not exercised its right
(or for which Acquiror has expressly exercised its right) to assume the
defense of any such Action or are otherwise not eligible to assume the
defense of any such Action, in each case pursuant to the terms of _Section
9.2_.
