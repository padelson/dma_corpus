With respect to each Target Employee Plan that is subject to ERISA reporting requirements, Target
has made available in a data room for review by Acquiror or its advisors copies of the Form&nbsp;5500

default under or material violation of, and have no knowledge of any material default or material
violation by any other party to, any of the Target Employee Plans. Any Target Employee Plan
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has either obtained from the Internal
Revenue Service a favorable determination letter as to its qualified status under the Code,
including all currently effective amendments to the Code, or has time remaining to apply under
applicable Treasury Regulations or Internal Revenue Service pronouncements for a determination or
opinion letter or to make any amendments necessary to obtain a favorable determination or opinion
letter. None of the Target Employee Plans promises or provides retiree medical or other retiree
welfare benefits to any person other than the provision of severance or termination pay or the
continuation of benefits through the end of the month of termination of employment or as otherwise
required by Law. Target has not engaged in, or participated in, any transaction which would be
considered a non-exempt &#147;prohibited transaction,&#148; as such term is defined in Section&nbsp;406 of ERISA

party-in-interest has engaged in any such &#147;prohibited transaction&#148; with respect to any Target
Employee Plan. Neither Target nor any ERISA Affiliate is subject to any liability or penalty under
Sections&nbsp;4976 through 4980 of the Code or Title I of ERISA with respect to any Target Employee
Plan. All contributions required to be made by Target or any ERISA Affiliate to any Target
Employee Plan have been paid or accrued. With respect to each Target Employee Plan, no &#147;reportable
event&#148; within the meaning of Section&nbsp;4043 of ERISA (excluding any such event for which the thirty
(30)&nbsp;day notice requirement has been waived under the regulations to Section&nbsp;4043 of ERISA) has
occurred, nor has any event described in Section&nbsp;4062, 4063 or 4041 or ERISA occurred. Each Target
Employee Plan subject to ERISA has prepared in good faith and timely filed all requisite
governmental reports, which were true and correct in all material respects as of the date
filed, and, has properly and timely filed and distributed or posted all notices and reports to
employees required to be filed, distributed or posted with respect to each such Target Employee
Plan. No suit, administrative proceeding or action has been brought, or to the knowledge of Target
is threatened in communications with Target, against or with respect to any such Target Employee
Plan, including any audit or inquiry by the Internal Revenue Service or the United States
Department of Labor and other than routine claims for benefits thereunder. There has been no
amendment to, or written interpretation or announcement by Target or any ERISA Affiliate regarding
any Target Employee Plan that would materially increase the expense of maintaining such Target
Employee Plan above the level of expense incurred with respect to that Plan for the fiscal year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2009.
