             Section 1.8 Intercompany Accounts. On or prior to the Closing Date,

             Section 1.9 Certain Distributions; Purchase Price Adjustments.

             (a) The parties agree that Seller and Savannah shall have the
right, at or prior to the Closing and subject to the terms of Section
4.1(c)(viii) hereof, to cause any Company to distribute cash and accounts

to the terms of Section 4.1(c)(viii) hereof, shall cause the Companies to
transfer all accounts receivable, inventory and other current assets and all
current liabilities to the extent related to the Excluded Sugar Business (in

practicable) to Seller, Savannah or their affiliates, by one or more dividends,
repurchases of existing stock and/or other distributions. Seller shall indemnify
and hold harmless Buyer from, against and in respect of any liabilities or
obligations, whether known or unknown, contingent or otherwise, without regard
for any indemnity limitation set forth in Article VII hereof, associated with
the ownership or operation of the Excluded Sugar Business and the sale or
transfer effected under this Section 1.9(a), including without limitation any
liability or obligation in respect of Taxes.

             (b) Exhibit E to this Agreement sets forth the components of
combined, consolidated Working Capital (as defined below) as of June 30, 2002.

             (c) Within 30 calendar days following the Closing:

                 (i)  Seller shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver
     to Buyer a combined consolidated schedule of components of Working Capital
     as of the Closing Date in a manner consistent with Exhibit E (the "Closing
     Date Working Capital Schedule") and a statement (the "Closing Statement")
     reflecting the calculation of any adjustment to the Purchase Price under
     Section 1.9(c), accompanied by a certificate of the chief financial officer
     or principal accounting officer of Seller to the effect that such statement
     has, to his or her knowledge, been prepared in accordance with the terms of
     this Agreement. In connection with the preparation of the Closing Date
     Working Capital Schedule, on or no later than three business days after the
     Closing Date, Seller shall conduct a physical inventory for purposes of
     determining the amount of inventory of the DCB Business on the Closing Date
     to be included in such Closing Date Working Capital Schedule. Seller shall
     permit Buyer and its representatives to observe the conduct of such
     inventory and Buyer shall permit Seller access to its property as necessary
     to conduct such inventory.

                 (ii) The Closing Date Working Capital Schedule shall reflect
     Working Capital consistent with financial reporting policies and procedures
     used by the DCB Business prior to the Closing, which policies and
     procedures are set forth in Exhibit E to

                                       4

<PAGE>

                                                                  Execution Copy

     this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, "Working Capital" means the
     amount of current assets of the DCB Business (excluding current assets
     relating to the Excluded Sugar Business transferred in accordance with
     Section 1.9(a), employee loans, income taxes and intercompany accounts)
     minus the amount of the components of current liabilities of the DCB
     Business (excluding all current liabilities relating to the Excluded Sugar
     Business to be transferred in accordance with Section 1.9(a), income taxes
     and intercompany accounts), each as of the Closing Date determined in
     accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
     States ("GAAP") and calculated in a manner consistent with Exhibit E.

          (iii) Buyer shall have a period of 30 calendar days after delivery of
     the Closing Date Working Capital Schedule and the Closing Statement to
     review (and cause Buyer's auditors to review) such documents and make any
     objections it may have in writing to Seller. Seller will make the work
     papers and back-up materials used in preparing the Closing Date Working
     Capital Schedule and the Closing Statement available to Buyer and Buyer's
     auditors at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice during such 30-day
     period in order to facilitate the resolution by the parties of any
     objections to the Closing Date Working Capital Schedule and the Closing
     Statement. If written objections are delivered to Seller by Buyer within
     such 30-day period, then Buyer and Seller shall attempt to resolve the
     matter or matters in dispute. If no written objections are made by Buyer
     within such 30-day period, then the Closing Date Working Capital Schedule
     and the Closing Statement shall be final and binding on the parties. If
     disputes with respect to the Closing Date Working Capital Schedule or the
     Closing Statement cannot be resolved by Buyer and Seller within 30 calendar
     days after timely delivery of any objections thereto, then, at the request
     of Buyer or Seller, the specific matters in dispute shall be submitted to
     KPMG LLP (the "Auditors") or such other independent accounting firm as may
     be approved by Seller and Buyer, which firm shall render its opinion as to
     such specific matters. If no such referral is made within 45 days after the
     delivery of the objections, then the Closing Date Working Capital Schedule
     and the Closing Statement shall be final and binding on the parties. Based
     on such opinion, such independent accounting firm will then send to Seller
     and Buyer its determination of the specified matters in dispute, which
     determination shall be final and binding on the parties hereto. The fees
     and expenses of the Auditors shall be borne one-half by Seller and one-half
     by Buyer.

          (iv)  If the Working Capital reflected on the Closing Date Working

of the Assignment Agreement and the License Agreement will, as of Closing, have
been duly and validly executed and delivered by Ragus, and, assuming the
Assignment Agreement and the License Agreement have been duly authorized,
executed and delivered by Buyer, will constitute a valid and binding agreement
of Ragus, enforceable against Ragus in accordance with its terms, except that
(a) such enforcement may be subject to any bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or other laws, now or hereafter

                (viii) incur any indebtedness for borrowed money, issue any debt
         securities or assume, guarantee or endorse the obligations of any other
         persons other than endorsements for collection in the ordinary course
         of business;

                (ix)   take any action that would render, or which reasonably
         may be expected to render, any representation or warranty made by
         Seller in this Agreement untrue at the Closing, including any actions
         referred to in Section 2.8;

                (x)    cancel or terminate its current insurance policies or
         allow any of the coverage thereunder to lapse, unless simultaneously
         with such termination, cancellation or lapse replacement policies
         providing coverage equal to or greater than the coverage under the
         canceled, terminated or lapsed policies for substantially similar
         premiums are in full force and effect; or

                (xi)   with respect to Taxes, except as set forth in Section
         4.1(c)(xi) of the Seller Disclosure Letter: (A) make or rescind any
         express or deemed election or take any other discretionary position
         without the consent of Buyer (which consent will not be unreasonably
         withheld or delayed), (B) amend any return, (C) settle or compromise
         any Litigation, or (D) change any of its methods of reporting income or
         deductions for federal or state income Tax purposes from those employed

         returns.

           Section 4.2 Access to Information; Confidentiality.

           (a) From the date of this Agreement to the Closing, Seller will cause
the Companies to (i) give Buyer and its authorized representatives reasonable
access to all books, business and financial records, personnel, technology,
processes, business plans, budgets and projections, offices and other facilities
and properties of the Companies and their accountants, (ii) permit Buyer to make
such copies and inspections thereof as Buyer may reasonably request, and (iii)
cause the Companies' officers, as applicable, to furnish Buyer with such
financial and operating data and other information with respect to the business
and properties of the Companies as Buyer may from time to time reasonably
request; provided, however, that any such access shall be conducted at Buyer's
risk and expense, at a reasonable time, under the supervision of Seller,
Savannah or the Companies' personnel and in such a manner as to maintain the
confidentiality of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and not to interfere unreasonably with the operation of the businesses
of Seller, Savannah or the Companies. Buyer will not contact any suppliers,
customers and prospective customers of the Companies in regard to the DCB
Business without Seller's prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld and which consent shall be granted no later than five
business days prior to the Closing. When such consent is granted, Seller will
cause each of the Companies, and their officers and employees, to cooperate
fully (including providing introductions where necessary) with Buyer to enable
Buyer to contact third parties, including suppliers, customers and prospective
customers of the Companies. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.2 to the
contrary, Seller shall not be required to provide, or to cause any of the
Companies to provide, any information under this Section 4.2(a) that is subject
to attorney-client privilege or subject to a confidentiality agreement with a
third party (such information, "Privileged Information"); provided, however,
that with respect to any information that Seller claims is Privileged
Information (i) Seller agrees to provide to Buyer a brief description of the
subject matter of the Privileged Information and (ii) Seller and Buyer agree to
cooperate with each other and to enter into arrangements reasonably acceptable
to each party to provide as much detail concerning the Privileged Information as
possible while still protecting the privileged and confidential nature of such
Privileged Information (a "Privilege Arrangement"); provided further, that Buyer
shall not be required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in the event Buyer reasonably determines either: (x) that any
Privileged Information being withheld from Buyer is material to an understanding
of the business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations of the
DCB Business or (y) that any Privilege Arrangement with respect to such
Privileged Information is not sufficient to allow Buyer to evaluate the impact
of the Privileged Information on the business, prospects, financial condition or
results of operations of the DCB Business (collectively, the "Privilege Closing
Conditions").

           (b) All such information and access provided or granted pursuant to
Section 4.2(a) shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the letter
agreement (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), between Buyer and Seller, dated
October 29, 2002. The Confidentiality Agreement will terminate effective as of
the Closing.

           (c) Seller will, and will cause its affiliates to, keep confidential
and protect, and will not divulge, allow access to or use in any way, (i) the
DCB Intellectual Property (except to the extent subject to and in accordance
with the License Agreement), (ii) any and all

                                       31

                                                                  Execution Copy

information of Seller, Savannah or the Companies concerning the DCB Business and
(iii) any and all notes, analyses, compilations, studies, summaries and other
material containing or based, in whole or in part, on any information of Seller,
Savannah or the Companies included in the foregoing ("Confidential
Information"). Seller acknowledges that such Confidential Information
constitutes a unique and valuable asset, and that any disclosure or other use of
such Confidential Information in breach of this Section 4.2 would be wrongful
and would cause irreparable harm to Buyer. The foregoing obligations of
confidentiality will not apply to any Confidential Information (i) that is now
or subsequently becomes generally publicly known, other than as a direct or
indirect result of the breach of this Agreement by Seller or any of its
affiliates or (ii) that Seller or any of its affiliates receives from a third
party without obligation of confidentiality or (iii) that Seller or any of its
affiliates independently develops after the Closing.

           (d) Seller agrees that the provisions and restrictions contained in
Section 4.2(c) hereof are necessary to protect the legitimate continuing
interests of Buyer in acquiring the DCB Business and entering into this
Agreement, that agreements contained in Section 4.2(c) have been specifically
bargained for, that any violation or breach of such provisions and restrictions
will result in irreparable injury to Buyer for which a remedy at law would be
inadequate and that, in addition to any relief at law which may be available to
Buyer for such violation or breach and regardless of any other provision
contained in this Agreement, Buyer will be entitled to injunctive and other
equitable relief restraining such violation or breach (without any requirement
that Buyer provide any bond or other security).

           (e) In the event that Seller is requested or required (by oral
question or request for information or documents in any legal proceeding,
interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to
disclose any Confidential Information, Seller shall notify Buyer promptly of the
request or requirement so that Buyer may seek an appropriate protective order or
waive compliance with the provisions of Section 4.2(c). If, in the absence of a
protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, Seller is, on the advice
of counsel, compelled to disclose any Confidential Information to any tribunal
or else stand liable for contempt, Seller may disclose the Confidential
Information to the tribunal; provided, however, that Seller will use its best
efforts to obtain, at the request of Buyer, an order or other assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded to such portion of the Confidential
Information required to be disclosed as Buyer designates.

           (f) Effective upon the Closing, Seller shall assign to Buyer all of
Seller's right, title and interest in and to any confidentiality agreements to
which Seller or any agent of Seller may be a party relating to the
confidentiality of information of the DCB Business, or, if a confidentiality
agreement applies also to confidential information retained by Seller or any
affiliate, the Seller shall assign its rights, title and interest to the extent
the confidentiality agreement relates to confidential information that is not
retained.

           Section 4.3 Consents; Cooperation.

           (a) Each of Seller and Buyer shall cooperate, and use its
commercially reasonable efforts, to make all filings and obtain all licenses,
permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders of
governmental authorities and other third parties necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however,

                                       32

                                                                  Execution Copy

that, notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the actions of Seller and Buyer with
respect to filings, approvals and other matters pursuant to the HSR Act and any
local, state, federal (other than the HSR Act) or foreign antitrust statute,
antitrust law, antitrust regulation or antitrust rule applicable to Seller,
Savannah, the Companies or Buyer ("Other Antitrust Regulations") shall be
governed by subsections (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this Section 4.3, (ii) Seller
will obtain, or will cause Savannah and each the Companies to obtain, all
licenses, permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and
orders required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement listed on Exhibit F (the "Closing Condition Consents") and (iii)
Seller will use its best efforts to obtain all consents and approvals required
from its lenders in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, all of which consents and approvals are listed on Exhibit G (the
"Seller Lender Approvals"), other than the consents and approvals of General
Electric Capital Corporation and of Harris Trust and Savings Bank and other
associated lenders under Seller's credit facilities, which consents and
approvals have been obtained as of the date hereof.

           (b) Seller and Buyer shall file with (i) the United States Federal
Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the United States Department of Justice (the
"DOJ"), the notification and report form required for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and any supplemental information requested in
connection with such notification and report form pursuant to the HSR Act and
(ii) any other applicable governmental or regulatory entity, all filings,
reports, information and documentation required for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to the Other Antitrust
Regulations. Each of Seller and Buyer shall furnish to each other's counsel such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other party may request
in connection with its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary
under the HSR Act and Other Antitrust Regulations. Each of Seller and Buyer
shall consult with each other as to the appropriate time of making such filings
and submissions and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make such
filings and submissions at the agreed upon time.

           (c) Each of Seller and Buyer shall keep each other apprised of the
status of any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional
information from, the FTC and the DOJ and other governmental or regulatory
entities and shall comply promptly with any such inquiry or request.

           (d) Buyer and Seller shall, and Seller shall cause Savannah and the
Companies to, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an early termination
of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act and Other Antitrust
Regulations; provided, that Buyer will not be required to dispose of, hold
separately or make any change in, any portion of its business or assets (or the
business or assets of the Companies) or incur any other material burden.

           (e) With respect to any agreements for which any required consent or
approval is not obtained prior to the Closing (other than a Closing Condition
Consent which Seller shall obtain or cause to be obtained prior to Closing),
Seller and Buyer will each use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
such consent or approval after the Closing Date until such consent or approval
has been obtained and Seller will provide Buyer or any Company with the same
benefits arising under such agreements, including performance by either Seller
or

                                       33

                                                                  Execution Copy

Savannah as agent, if legally and commercially feasible, provided that Buyer
will provide or cause the Companies to provide Seller with such access to the
premises, books and records and personnel as is necessary to enable Seller to
perform its obligations under such agreements and Buyer and the Companies shall
pay or satisfy the corresponding liabilities for the enjoyment of such benefits
to the extent Buyer or any Company would have been responsible therefor if such
consent or approval had been obtained.

           (f) With respect to any agreements that relate primarily to the DCB
Business to which Seller or any of its affiliates is a party and to which any of
the Companies is not a party, prior to or at the Closing (or if requested by
Buyer, after the Closing), Seller shall, and shall cause each such affiliate to,
cause each such agreement to be assigned to Brands or such other of the
Companies designated by Buyer.

           (g) With respect to the software licenses and other rights to use
software noted in Section 2.16(a)(3) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, after the
Closing Seller shall use its best efforts to, and shall cause each affiliate of
Seller to use its best efforts to, at Seller's expense, obtain an assignment to
Brands or such other of the Companies designated by Buyer of, or the right of
Brands or such other of the Companies designated by Buyer to use, each such
license and right. Until such assignment has been completed, Seller will provide
Buyer or any Company with the benefits of such software licenses and other
software rights, and Buyer and the Companies shall pay or satisfy the
corresponding liabilities for the enjoyment of such benefits to the extent Buyer
or any Company would have been responsible therefor if such assignment had
occurred. Buyer will provide such assistance as Seller may reasonably request in
connection with obtaining the assignment of or the right to use any such
software licenses or other rights to use software.

           Section 4.4 Commercially Reasonable Efforts. Each of Seller and Buyer
shall cooperate, and use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

           Section 4.5 Public Announcements. Prior to the Closing, except as
otherwise agreed to by the parties, the parties shall not issue any report,
statement or press release or otherwise make any public statements with respect
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as
in the reasonable judgment of the party may be required by Law or in connection
with its obligations as a publicly held, exchange-listed or Nasdaq-quoted
company, in which case the parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to
reach mutual agreement as to the language of any such report, statement or press
release. Upon the Closing, Seller and Buyer will consult with each other with
respect to the issuance of a joint report, statement or press release with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

           Section 4.6 Tax Matters.

           (a) Tax Treatment. Seller and Buyer hereby agree that an election
under Section 338 of the Code (or any similar provision of the law of any
country or taxing jurisdiction) will not be made with respect to the sale of the
Shares under this Agreement.

           (b) Indemnification.

               (i)   Seller's Indemnification of Buyer. Seller shall indemnify
     Buyer from, against and in respect of any Taxes (as defined in Section
     4.6(m) of this Agreement) imposed on any Company with respect to any
     taxable period, or portion thereof, ending on or before the Closing Date.
     Seller shall indemnify Buyer from, against and in respect of any Taxes (as
     defined in Section 4.6(m) of this Agreement) which may be imposed on the
     Companies because of the matters listed at Section 2.13(a) of the Seller
     Disclosure Letter. Seller shall indemnify Buyer for any liability of any of
     the Companies for Taxes of any person other than any of the Companies, (A)
     under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of
     state, local or foreign law) and (B) as a result of an express or implied
     obligation to indemnify any other person, provided, however, in each case
     such Taxes are attributable to a taxable period ending on or before the
     Closing Date.

               (ii)  Buyer's Indemnification of Seller. Buyer shall indemnify
     Seller from, against and in respect of any liability of Seller or its
     subsidiaries for (A) any Taxes imposed on any Company with respect to any
     taxable period, or portion thereof, beginning on or after the Closing Date
     and (B) any Transfer Taxes for which Buyer is liable under Section 4.6(g)
     of this Agreement.

           (c) Computation of Tax Liabilities.

               (i)   Proration of Taxes and Earnings and Profits. To the extent
     permitted by law or administrative practice, the taxable years of the
     Companies shall end on and include the Closing Date. Whenever it is
     necessary to determine the liability for Taxes, or the earnings and
     profits, of any Company for a portion of a taxable year or period that
     begins before and ends after the Closing Date, the determination of the
     Taxes or the earnings and profits for the portion of the year or period
     ending on, and the portion of the year or period beginning after, the
     Closing Date shall be determined by assuming that the taxable year or
     period ended on and included the Closing Date, except that exemptions,
     allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis shall be
     prorated on the basis of the number of days in the annual period elapsed
     through the Closing Date as compared to the number of days in the annual
     period elapsing after the Closing Date.

               (ii)  Standalone Basis. Whenever it is necessary to determine the
     liability of any Company for Taxes, such liability shall be computed as if
     the Company was not a member of Seller's consolidated, affiliated, combined
     or unitary group for Tax purposes.

           (d) Tax Sharing Agreements. All tax sharing agreements or similar
agreements to which any of the Companies is a party will terminate on or prior
to the Closing Date, and none of the Companies will have any liabilities under,
or otherwise be bound by, such agreements after the Closing Date.

           (e) Tax Returns.

               (i)   Seller shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file or
     cause to be filed when due Tax Returns with respect to the Companies for
     any taxable period, or portion thereof, ending on or before the Closing
     Date which are required or permitted by law or administrative practice to
     be filed with respect to a taxable period, or portion thereof, ending on or
     before the Closing Date, and will provide Buyer with a copy of such
     applicable final draft federal income and state income Tax Returns
     (excluding payroll taxes) and necessary supporting schedules with respect
     to each Company at least five days before filing such Tax Returns. If (x)
     Buyer objects to a position taken on any such draft Tax Return, (y) Buyer
     notifies Seller of such objection within three days of receiving such draft
     Tax Return from Seller, and (z) Buyer and Seller cannot reach agreement on
     how to report such disputed position on such Tax Return, then the position
     that is to be taken on the final Tax Return shall be resolved in accordance
     with Section 4.6(i). If a resolution cannot be made pursuant to Section
     4.6(i) prior to the due date of such Tax Return, Seller shall seek an
     extension to file such Tax Return. If an extension is not available, Seller
     shall file such Tax Return reporting the disputed issue consistent with
     Seller's position and Seller shall agree to file an amended return if the
     resolution process of Section 4.6(i) determines that a position different
     from that taken on the filed Tax Return should have been taken.

               (ii)  Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file or
     cause to be filed when due all other Tax Returns with respect to the
     Companies required to be filed with respect to a taxable period, or portion
     thereof, ending after the Closing Date.

               (iii) If either Buyer or Seller may be liable for any material
     portion of the Tax payable in connection with any Tax Return to be filed by
     the other, the party responsible under this Agreement for filing such
     return (the "Preparer") shall prepare and deliver to the other party (the
     "Payor") a copy of such return and any schedules, work papers and other
     documentation then available that are relevant to the preparation of the
     portion of such return for which the Payor is or may be liable under this
     Agreement not later than 20 days before the Due Date (as defined in Section
     4.6(a) of this Agreement). The Preparer shall not file such return until
     the earlier of either the receipt of written notice from the Payor
     indicating the Payor's consent thereto, or the Due Date.

           The Payor shall have the option of providing to the Preparer, at any
     time at least 15 days prior to the Due Date, written instructions as to how
     the Payor wants any, or all, of the items for which it may be liable
     reflected on such Tax Return. The Preparer shall, in preparing such return,
     cause the items for which the Payor is liable under this Agreement to be
     reflected in accordance with the Payor's instructions (unless, in the
     opinion of a partner of a nationally recognized law firm retained by the
     Preparer, complying with the Payor's instructions would likely subject the
     Preparer to any criminal penalty or to civil penalties under sections 6662
     through 6664 of the Code or similar provisions of applicable state, local
     or foreign laws) and, in the absence of having received such instructions,
     in accordance with past practice.

                                                                  Execution Copy

          If the Preparer fails to satisfy its obligations under this Section
     4.6(d), the Payor shall have no obligation to indemnify the Preparer for
     any Taxes which are reflected on any such return or any related Loss, and
     shall retain any and all remedies it may otherwise have which arise out of
     such failure.

          (f)  Contest Provisions.

               (i)  Notification of Contests. Each of Buyer, on the one hand,
     and Seller, on the other hand (the "Recipient"), shall notify the chief tax
     officer of Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, in writing within 15 days
     of receipt by the Recipient of written notice of any pending or threatened
     audits, adjustments or assessments (a "Tax Audit") which are likely to
     affect the liability for Taxes of such other party. If the Recipient fails
     to give such prompt notice to the other party, it shall not be entitled to
     indemnification for any Taxes arising in connection with such Tax Audit if
     such failure to give notice adversely affects the other party's right to
     participate in the Tax Audit.

               (ii) Which Party Controls.

          (A)  Seller's Items. If such Tax Audit relates to any taxable period,
     or portion thereof, ending on or before the Closing Date or for any Taxes
     for which Seller are liable in full under this Agreement, Seller shall, at
     its expense, control the defense and settlement of such Tax Audit.

          (B)  Termination of Defense and Settlement. Notwithstanding any other
     provision to the contrary, Buyer in its sole and absolute discretion, may
     notify Seller at any time that any such defense and settlement of such Tax
     Audit, relating to Taxes for which Seller is required to indemnify the
     Buyer pursuant to Section 4.6(b)(i), must be immediately terminated in
     which case any obligation with respect to Seller to make indemnification
     payments to the Buyer with respect to such Tax Audit shall thereupon
     terminate.

          (C)  Buyer's Items. If such Tax Audit relates to any taxable period,
     or portion thereof, beginning on or after the Closing Date or for any Taxes
     for which Buyer is liable in full under this Agreement, Buyer shall, at its
     expense, control the defense and settlement of such Tax Audit.

          (D)  Combined and Mixed Items. If such Tax Audit relates to Taxes for
     which both Seller and Buyer are liable under this Agreement, to the extent
     practicable such Tax Items (as defined in Section 4.6(a) of this Agreement)
     will be distinguished and each party will control the defense and
     settlement of those Taxes for which it is so liable.

          If such Tax Audit relates to a taxable period, or portion thereof,
     beginning before and ending after the Closing Date and any Tax Item cannot
     be identified as being a liability of only one party or cannot be separated
     from a Tax Item for which the other party is liable, the party which has
     the greater potential liability for those Tax Items that cannot be so
     attributed or separated (or both) shall control the defense and settlement
     of the Tax Audit, provided that such party defends the items as reported on
     the relevant Tax Return.

                                       37

                                                                  Execution Copy

             (E) Participation Rights. Any party whose liability for Taxes may
     be affected by a Tax Audit shall be entitled to participate at its expense
     in such defense and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense.

             (g) Transfer Taxes. All excise, sales, use, transfer (including
real property transfer or gains), stamp, documentary, filing, recordation and
other similar taxes, together with any interest, additions or penalties with
respect thereto and any interest in respect of such additions or penalties,
resulting directly from the sale and transfer by Seller to Buyer of the Shares
(the "Transfer Taxes"), shall be borne fully by Buyer. Notwithstanding Section
4.6(d) of this Agreement, which shall not apply to Tax Returns relating to
Transfer Taxes, any Tax Returns that must be filed in connection with Transfer
Taxes shall be prepared and filed when due by the party primarily or customarily
responsible under the applicable local law for filing such Tax Returns, and such
party will use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide such Tax Returns
to the other party at least 10 days prior to the Due Date for such Tax Returns.

             (h) Buyer's Claiming, Receiving or Using of Refunds and
Overpayments. If, after the Closing, Buyer or any Company (A) receives any
refund or (B) utilizes the benefit of any overpayment of Taxes which, in each
case (A) and (B), (x) relates to Taxes paid by Seller, Savannah or any Company
with respect to a taxable period, or portion thereof, ending on or before the
Closing Date, or (y) is the subject of indemnification by Seller under this
Agreement, Buyer shall promptly transfer, or cause to be transferred, to Seller
the entire amount of the refund or overpayment (including interest) resolved or
utilized by Buyer or any Company. Buyer agrees to notify Seller within 15 days
following the discovery of a right to claim any such refund or overpayment and
the receipt of any such refund or utilization of any such overpayment. Buyer
agrees to claim any such refund or to utilize any such overpayment as soon as
possible and to furnish to Seller all information, records and assistance
necessary to verify the amount of the refund or overpayment.

             (i) Resolution of All Tax-Related Disputes. In the event that
Seller and Buyer cannot agree on the calculation of any amount relating to Taxes
or the interpretation or application of any provision of this Agreement relating
to Taxes, such dispute shall be resolved by a partner at a nationally recognized
law firm mutually acceptable to Seller and Buyer, whose decision shall be final
and binding upon all persons involved and whose expenses shall be shared equally
by Seller and Buyer.

             (j) Post-Closing Actions Which Affect A Party's Liability for
Taxes.

                 (i)  Buyer shall not permit any Company to take any action on
         or after the Closing Date which could materially increase Seller or
         Savannah's liability for Taxes (including any liability of Seller to
         indemnify Buyer for Taxes under this Agreement).

                 (ii) Except as set forth in Section 4.6(j)(ii) of the Seller
         Disclosure Letter, Seller shall not take any action on or after the
         Closing Date which could materially increase the Buyer's liability for
         Taxes without the written approval of the Buyer (including any
         liability of Buyer to indemnify Seller for Taxes under this Agreement).
         Such action includes any settlement agreement entered into with respect
         to a Tax Audit under Section 4.6(f)(ii)(A) if any portion of such
         settlement agreement

         with respect to tax years beginning on or after the Closing Date.

                 (iii) Except to the extent required by law, neither Buyer, any
         Company nor any affiliate of any of them shall, without the prior
         written consent of Seller, amend any Tax Return (with respect to any
         Tax Item of any Company) filed by, or with respect to, any Company or
         any of their subsidiaries for any taxable period, or portion thereof,
         beginning before the Closing Date.

           (k)   Assistance and Cooperation. The parties agree that, after the
Closing Date:

                 (i)   Each party shall assist (and cause their respective
         affiliates to assist) the other party in preparing any Tax Returns
         which such other party is responsible for preparing and filing;

                 (ii)  The parties shall cooperate fully in preparing for any
         Tax Audits, or disputes with taxing authorities, relating to any Tax
         Returns or Taxes of any Company, including providing access to relevant
         books and records relating to Taxes at issue;

                 (iii) The parties shall make available to each other and to any
         taxing authority as reasonably requested all relevant books and records
         relating to Taxes;

                 (iv)  Each party shall promptly furnish the other party with
         copies of all relevant correspondence received from any taxing
         authority in connection with any Tax Audit or information request
         relating to Taxes for which such other party may have an
         indemnification obligation under this Agreement; and

                 (v)   Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the party
         requesting assistance or cooperation shall bear the other party's
         out-of-pocket expenses in complying with such request to the extent
         that those expenses are attributable to fees and other costs of
         unaffiliated third-party service providers.

           (l)   This Section 4.6 alone shall govern the procedure for all Tax
indemnification claims, notwithstanding any provision of Article VII.

           (m)   For purposes of this Agreement, "Tax" or "Taxes" shall mean

                                                                  Execution Copy

mean, with respect to Taxes, any item of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit

            Section 4.7 Buyer's Knowledge of Breach. If, after signing but prior
to the Closing, any of the officers of Buyer listed below shall have actual
knowledge of a breach of a representation and warranty of Seller that
constitutes a Seller Material Adverse Effect, Buyer shall promptly notify Seller
of its knowledge, in reasonable detail, including the amount which Buyer
believes, based on the facts actually known by it and to the extent that such
amount may reasonably be determined, would be payable by Seller under the
indemnification provisions of this Agreement without reference to any
indemnification limitations set forth in Section 7.3 of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any notice provided under this Section 4.7 shall
not limit or restrict (i) any right Buyer may have hereunder not to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby arising from such breach of representation
or warranty or (ii) any right Buyer may have hereunder in respect of the
obligation of Seller to indemnify Buyer Indemnitees for such breach of
representation or warranty. For purposes of this Section 4.7, the officers of
Buyer shall be Michael J. McCoy, Mahlon C. Schneider and Gary C. Paxton.

            Section 4.8 Employees; Employee Benefits.

            (a) With the exception of the CBU Plan, the DSLT Supplemental
Executive Retirement Plan and the DSLT Top Management Plan (collectively, the
"Continued Plans"), the Companies shall cease to be (and Buyer shall not become)
a sponsor and cease to be a contributing employer under all benefit plans
maintained in whole or in part by Seller, Savannah or any Company prior to
Closing. To the extent necessary, if one or more of the Companies is the sole
sponsor of any such Company Plans, Seller shall cause such Company Plans to be
terminated by the Companies effective not later than the Closing Date (or, if
the plan is a defined benefit plan, one day before the Closing Date). If one or
more of the Companies is a sponsor but is not the sole sponsor of any such
Company Plans, Seller shall cause such action as may be necessary to be taken to
completely sever the Companies' sponsorship of such Company Plans, effective not
later than the Closing Date (or, if the plan is a defined benefit plan, one day
before the Closing Date). If the plan is a plan subject to Section 204(h) of
ERISA, Seller shall take all further actions that may be required to cease
permanently the accrual of any further benefits under the plan including,
without limitation, the issuance of any notices in advance of such cessation.
With the exception of the Continued Plans, from and after the Closing, neither
Buyer nor any Company shall adopt, continue, contribute to or in any other
manner accept or continue responsibility for the administration or funding of
any benefit plan that was maintained prior to Closing by Company for the benefit
of employees. There shall be no spin-off of either liabilities or assets from
any Company Plan prior to Closing to any plan covering employees on and after
Closing. On and after the Closing, until at least the first anniversary of the
Closing, Buyer shall cause the Companies to provide the employees of the
Companies with salary and benefit plans, programs and arrangements no less
favorable in the aggregate than those currently provided by the applicable
Company.

            (b) If, within the first year after Closing, any employee of a
Company becomes a participant in any employee benefit plan of Buyer or any of
its affiliates, such employee shall be given credit under such plan for the last
continuous period of service with such Company or any predecessor employer (to
the extent such credit was given by the

                                       40

<PAGE>

                                                                  Execution Copy

Company or such predecessor) prior to and after the Closing ("Service Credit")
for purposes of determining eligibility to participate and vesting in benefits
but for no other purpose (including, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the accrual of benefits). Employees of the Company shall also receive
Service Credit for purposes of determining benefits under any vacation policy or
severance plan or arrangement maintained for the benefit of employees of the
Company.

           (c) In the event that any person who is an employee of any Company
immediately prior to the Closing (an "Affected Employee") is discharged by Buyer
or any Company after the Closing, then Buyer shall be responsible for (i)
severance costs for such Affected Employee, in an amount equal to not less than
one week of pay for every year of Service Credit of the Affected Employee as of
the date of termination if such employee would be entitled to severance under
the plans and programs generally applicable to similarly situated employees of
Buyer in connection with such discharge, if such termination occurs on or before
the first anniversary of the Closing, or (ii) if such termination of employment
occurs after the first anniversary of the Closing, severance costs if and to the
extent that any severance plan established for the benefit of employees of the
Companies after the Closing Date provides any benefits to such Affected
Employee. Buyer shall be responsible and assume all liability for all notices or
payments due to any Affected Employees, and all notices, payments, fines or
assessments due to any governmental authority, under any applicable Law with
respect to the employment, discharge or layoff of employees by any Company after
the Closing, including but not limited to, the WARN Act and any rules or
regulations as have been issued in connection with the foregoing.

           (d) Buyer agrees that, effective as of 12:01 a.m. on the day
following the Closing Date, each Affected Employee shall be immediately eligible
to participate, without any waiting time, in a group health plan (as defined in
Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code) which credits such Affected Employee towards the
deductibles, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions imposed under such
group health plan, for the calendar year during which the Closing Date occurs,
with any applicable expenses already incurred during the portion of the year
preceding the Closing Date under the applicable group health plans of Seller;
provided, however, such obligation of Buyer is contingent on Seller furnishing
sufficient information in sufficiently usable form to enable Buyer to reasonably
administer its plan.

           (e) Buyer agrees to provide group health plan continuation coverage
which meets the requirements of Section 4980B of the Code to each Affected
Employee, each former employee of the Companies and each of their respective
beneficiaries and dependents (A) who, immediately prior to the Closing, is
receiving group health plan continuation coverage under Section 4980B of the
Code under a group health plan of Seller, or (B) who otherwise constitutes an
"M&A Qualified Beneficiary" of the Companies with respect to the transactions
described in this Agreement within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
55.4980B-9.

           (f) With respect to former employees of the Companies (determined as
of Closing), Seller shall be responsible and assume all liability for
obligations relating to post-retirement welfare plans covering the employees or
former employees of the Companies, all of which obligations are summarized in
Section 4.8(f) of the Seller Disclosure Letter.

           (g) Prior to, but effective as of and contingent upon, the Closing,
Seller shall transfer, and Brands shall assume, sponsorship of the CBU Plan.
Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, Seller agrees to administer
the CBU Plan, or to cause Brands to administer the CBU Plan, in all material
respects in accordance with the provisions of ERISA and the Code. Seller shall
be responsible for filing all annual reports or similar governmental reports
that may be due with respect to any plan year that ends prior to or coincident
with Closing. To the extent reasonably requested by Buyer, Seller will cooperate
fully with Buyer in filing all annual reports and other similar governmental
reports that may be due with respect to the plan year ending after Closing. At
or prior to Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer the pertinent records
relating to the CBU Plan, including records relating to participants who were
not former employees of the Companies.

           (h) Seller and Buyer shall cooperate and take all steps reasonably
necessary or appropriate so that, as soon as practicable following the Closing
Date, the Affected Employees who are participants in the Imperial Sugar Company
401(k) Savings Plan are permitted to take a distribution or to rollover their
benefits under that plan to one or more defined contribution plans sponsored by
Buyer or its affiliates (collectively, the "Transferee Savings Plan"). From and
after any such rollover, Buyer and the Transferee Savings Plan shall be solely
responsible for all liabilities with respect to the transferred benefits of the
Affected Employees.

           (i) Buyer acknowledges that, at the Closing, the participation by the
Companies in all employee benefit plans other than the Continued Plans shall
terminate, and Buyer shall be solely responsible for providing or causing the
Companies to provide any successor or alternate plans.

           (j) Buyer shall cause the Companies to honor the collective
bargaining agreement identified on Section 2.12 of the Seller Disclosure Letter.

           (k) After the Closing Date, Buyer shall be responsible for, and shall
indemnify and hold harmless, (i) Seller, (ii) Savannah, (iii) the individuals
who were, prior to the Closing Date, officers, directors, employees, affiliates
and agents of either Seller or Savannah, and (iv) individuals who were, prior to
the Closing Date, the fiduciaries (including plan administrators) of the
Continued Plans, from and against, any and all claims, losses, damages, costs
and expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and expenses) and
other liabilities and obligations relating to or arising out of (x) all
salaries, commissions, post-Closing bonuses and vacation entitlements accrued on
the Closing Date Working Capital Statement but unpaid as of the Closing to any
Affected Employee, and (y) any claims of, or damages or penalties sought by, any
Affected Employee or any governmental entity on behalf of or concerning any
Affected Employee, with respect to any act or failure to act by Buyer to the
extent arising after the Closing Date from the employment, discharge, layoff or
termination after Closing of any Affected Employee who, after the Closing Date
either becomes an employee of Buyer or continues as an employee of any Company.

           (l) On or before the Closing, Seller shall have caused the employment
of employees of Imperial set forth in Exhibit H (the "Designated Employees") to
be transferred to Holdings.

           (m) Seller acknowledges that Buyer intends to offer Walter Lehneis
employment with the DCB Business commencing immediately following the Closing,
and Seller agrees that Buyer may make such offer of employment. Seller agrees
that it shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify Buyer and the Companies
and hold each of them harmless for, any costs, liabilities or obligations
associated with Walter Lehneis' employment with Seller prior to the Closing
Date, including any costs, liabilities and obligations related to any employment
arrangement between Seller and Walter Lehneis, including costs, liabilities and
obligations arising under that certain employment agreement, dated October 1,
2000, between Seller and Walter Lehneis.

           Section 4.9 Noncompete.

           (a) Except as otherwise agreed to in writing by Seller and Buyer, for
a period of the greater of (i) five years and (ii) the duration of the Supply
Agreement, commencing on the Closing Date, Seller agrees that neither Seller nor
any of its affiliates, directly or indirectly, will sell or cause the sale of
any DCB Non-Sugar Product or any product that is substantially similar to any
DCB Non-Sugar Product in the United States of America ("Seller DCB Non-Sugar
Restricted Business"). For purposes of this Agreement, "DCB Non-Sugar Product"
means any of the Products that do not contain sugar as an ingredient.

           (b) Except for the Excluded Sugar Business or as otherwise agreed to
in writing by Seller and Buyer, for a period of five years commencing on the
Closing Date, Seller agrees that neither Seller nor any of its affiliates,
directly or indirectly, will sell or cause the sale of any DCB Sugar Product or
any product that is substantially similar to any DCB Sugar Product in the United
States of America ("Seller DCB Sugar Restricted Business" and together with
Seller DCB Non-Sugar Restricted Business "Seller Restricted Business"). For
purposes of this Agreement "DCB Sugar Product" means any of the Products that
contain sugar as an ingredient.

           (c) The restrictions set forth in Sections 4.9(a) and (b) shall not
prohibit the ownership by Seller of up to one percent of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of a publicly held entity carrying on a Seller
Restricted Business, so long as Seller does not participate in the control or
take an active part in the management or direction thereof and does not in any
way render services thereto.

           (d) Except as provided in the Co-Pack Agreement or as otherwise
agreed to in writing by Seller and Buyer, for a period of five years commencing
on the Closing Date, Buyer agrees that neither Buyer nor any of its affiliates,
directly or indirectly, will sell or cause the sale of any sugar products that
are part of the Excluded Sugar Business or that are substantially similar to
such products in the United States of America other than DCB Sugar Products and
products developed by Buyer or its affiliates that are substantially similar to
DCB Sugar Products ("Buyer Restricted Business").

           (e) The restrictions set forth in Section 4.9(d) shall not prohibit
the ownership by Buyer of up to one percent of the issued and outstanding
capital stock of a publicly held entity carrying on a Buyer Restricted Business,
so long as Buyer does not participate in the control or

take an active part in the management or direction thereof and does not in any
way render services thereto.

           (f) The parties intend that each of the covenants contained in this
Section 4.9 shall be construed as a series of separate covenants, one for each
state of the United States and each county of each state of the United States.
Except for geographic coverage, each such separate covenant shall be deemed
identical in terms to the covenant contained in the preceding subsections of
this Section 4.9. If, in any judicial proceeding, a court shall refuse to
enforce any of the separate covenants (or any part thereof) deemed included in
those subsections, then such unenforceable covenant (or such part) shall be
deemed eliminated from this Agreement for the purpose of those proceedings to
the extent necessary to permit the remaining separate covenants (or portions
thereof) to be enforced. In the event that the provisions of this Section 4.9
should ever be deemed to exceed the time or geographic limitations, or the scope
of this covenant, permitted by applicable law, then such provisions shall be
reformed to the maximum time or geographic limitations, as the case may be,
permitted by applicable laws. The unenforceability of any covenant in this
Section 4.9 shall not preclude the enforcement of any other of said covenants or
provisions or of any other obligation of Seller or Buyer hereunder, and the
existence of any claim or cause of action of Seller or Buyer against the other
whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a
defense to the enforcement by Seller or Buyer of any of said covenants

           (g) It is understood and agreed that damages will be an inadequate
remedy in the event of a breach or intended or threatened breach by Seller,
Buyer or any of their respective affiliates of any of the covenants of Seller or
Buyer, as applicable, in this Section 4.9, and that any such breach will cause
Seller or Buyer, as applicable, irreparable injury and damage. Accordingly,
Seller and Buyer each agree that the other shall be entitled, without waiving
any additional rights or remedies otherwise available to Seller or Buyer, as
applicable, to injunctive and other such equitable relief in the event of a
breach or intended or threatened breach of any of said covenants by Seller,
Buyer or any of their respective affiliates.

Transition Services Agreement, the License Agreement, the Supplier Agreement and
the Co-Pack Agreement, the "Ancillary Agreements") at or prior to the Closing.

           Section 4.11 Real Property Matters. Seller has caused Stewart Title
(the "Title Company") to deliver a title insurance commitment (each, a "Title
Commitment" and, collectively, the "Title Commitments") and Bock & Clark's
National Surveyor's Network to deliver a survey as to each Real Property site.
The Title Commitments have been marked by hand to show the changes that Buyer
requires to be made by the Title Company at or before Closing (the Title
Commitments, as so changed and as attached hereto as Exhibit L, the "Title
Policies"). Seller shall, at its expense, cause the Title Company to deliver the
Title Policies to Buyer within five (5) business days after the Closing (but to
be dated as of the Closing), and acknowledges and agrees that there remain
certain imperfections in the titles and/or to the Real Property as identified on
attached Exhibit M ("Title Imperfections"). Seller agrees to reimburse,
indemnify and hold harmless Buyer for, from and against (i) all expenses
reasonably incurred by Buyer and the Companies in attempting to cure the Title
Imperfections after the Closing (including bringing any quiet title or similar
actions, so long as any such action is commenced within six months after the
Closing and is thereafter diligently pursued), provided, however, that Buyer
shall consult with Seller with respect to all such actions taken, and (ii) all
claims made against Buyer or the Companies as a result of the assertion by any
other person or entity of rights under or relating to any of the Title
Imperfections, and all expenses reasonably incurred by Buyer or the Companies,
including reasonable attorney and consulting fees, in defending against any such
claims. If, notwithstanding Buyer's reasonable efforts to cure any Title
Imperfection, Buyer has been unable to cure such Title Imperfection as of the
date that is six months after the Closing, Seller shall pay to Buyer that amount
which compensates Buyer for the diminution in value of the affected Real
Property caused by the impact of the Title Imperfection on (A) marketability of
title to the affected Real Property for the use of the affected Real Property in
the DCB Business as conducted immediately prior to Closing and/or (B) the
usefulness of the affected Real Property for the use of the affected Property in
the DCB Business as conducted immediately prior to Closing.

           Section 4.12 Post-Closing Access. After the Closing Date, each of
Seller and Buyer will afford, and will cause their affiliates to afford, to the
other party, its accountants and counsel, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable request, reasonable access to the books and records pertaining to
each of the Companies.

           Section 4.13 Litigation Support and Idaho Fresh-Pak Litigation.

           (a) In the event that and for so long as Seller, Savannah, Buyer or

litigation or arbitration in connection with any fact, situation, circumstance,
status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident,
action, failure to act or transaction existing or occurring on or prior to the
Closing Date involving any of the Companies (the "Requesting Party"), Seller or
Buyer, as applicable, will cooperate and will cause its affiliates to cooperate
in the contest or defense, make available its personnel and provide such
testimony and access to its books and records as may be necessary in connection
with the contest or defense, all at the sole cost and expense of the Requesting
Party (unless and to the extent the Requesting Party is entitled to
indemnification therefor under Article VII).

         (b) Notwithstanding any representation or warranty of Seller contained
in this Agreement or any information or materials provided to Buyer or it

demand, claim, action or cause of action, assessment, loss, damage, cost and
expense (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses), including any damages or costs in settlement, without regard for any
indemnity limitation set forth in Article VII hereof, that arise out of or
relate to the Fresh-Pak Litigation and the Dixon Claim. For purposes of this
Section 4.13(b), the provisions of Section 7.4 shall apply; provided that Seller
shall be deemed to have received notice of the Fresh-Pak Litigation and the
Dixon Claim as a Claim thereunder and assumed the defense thereof.

         Section 4.14 Disposed Businesses. Notwithstanding any representation or
warranty of Seller contained in this Agreement or any information or materials
provided to Buyer or it representatives or disclosed in the Seller Disclosure
Letter, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer from, against and in
respect of any liability or obligation (including in respect of Taxes or under
any Environmental Law), whether known or unknown, contingent or otherwise,
demand, claim, action or cause of action, assessment, loss, damage, cost and
expense (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses), including any damages or costs in settlement, without regard for any

         (d) by Seller, if

             (i) Buyer has breached any representation, warranty or agreement
     contained in this Agreement in any material respect; or

             (ii) any of the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 have become
     impossible to satisfy;

          Section 7.2  Seller's Agreement to Indemnify.

          (a)  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement,
from and after the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause all of its
subsidiaries to (except to the extent the ownership of any such subsidiary is
sold or transferred after the date hereof) indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and
its directors, officers, employees, affiliates, controlling persons, agents and
representatives and their successors and assigns (collectively, the "Buyer
Indemnitees") from and against all liability, demands, claims, actions or causes
of action, assessments, losses, damages, costs and expenses (including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) (collectively, "Buyer
Damages") asserted against or incurred by any Buyer Indemnitee as a result of or
arising out of (i) a breach of any representation or warranty contained in
Article II of this Agreement or in the Seller Disclosure Letter or any closing
certificate delivered by or on behalf of Seller pursuant to this Agreement, (ii)
any product sold or manufactured by the Companies prior to the Closing Date
(including products manufactured by or for the account of any of Seller,
Savannah or the Companies prior to the Closing, regardless of their inclusion in
inventory of a Company as of the Closing and their eventual sale by a Company or
by Buyer or their affiliates after the Closing except to the extent that, after
the Closing, a Company, Buyer or any of their affiliates, or any representative
or agent of a Company, Buyer or its affiliates, or any person unaffiliated with
Seller or Savannah or the Companies (excluding suppliers or contract
manufacturers of Seller, Savannah or the Companies or other persons affiliated
with the production, storage, transportation and handling of such products prior
to Closing to the extent they produced, stored, transported or handled such
products) was negligent in the storage, handling or distribution of such
products, in which case the indemnification obligation of Seller hereunder shall
be reduced to the extent that such negligence contributed to the Buyer Damages)
and (iii) any breach of any of the covenants and agreements of any Seller
contained in this Agreement, including without limitation any agreement of
Seller to indemnify Buyer with respect to specific matters contained elsewhere
in this Agreement. Buyer Indemnitees shall be entitled to recover any Buyer
Damages for which Seller is obligated to indemnify under this Section 7.2, (i)
first, from the Escrow Agent, an amount equal to any Buyer Damages any such
Buyer Indemnitee may suffer hereunder pursuant to Section 7.9 hereof and (ii)
second, if and to the extent that the Indemnification Escrow Amount is not
sufficient to cover such Buyer Damages, from Seller.

          (b)  Seller's obligation to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees for Buyer
Damages under Section 7.2(a) of this Agreement is subject to the following
limitations:

               (i)  No indemnification shall be made by Seller under
     Section 7.2(a)(i) unless the aggregate amount of Buyer Damages exceeds
     $750,000 (the "Basket Amount") and, in such event, indemnification shall be
     made by Seller only to the extent Buyer Damages exceed $500,000 (the
     "Deductible Amount");

               (ii) In no event shall Seller's aggregate obligation to indemnify
     the Buyer Indemnitees under Section 7.2(a)(i) exceed 50% of the Purchase
     Price (the "Cap Amount"), except in the event that such obligation to
     indemnify arises from the fraudulent act or omission of Seller;

                                                                  Execution Copy

          (iii)  The amount of any Buyer Damages shall be reduced by (A) any
amount actually received by a Buyer Indemnitee with respect to such Buyer
Damages under any insurance coverage or from any other party alleged to be
responsible for such Buyer Damages (provided, however, that the amount of any
such reduction for insurance proceeds shall be offset by the present value of
any increase in insurance premiums attributable to any claim for insurance
related to such Buyer Damages) and (B) the amount of any Tax benefit actually
realized by the Buyer Indemnitee attributable to such Buyer Damages (provided
however, that the amount of any such reduction for Tax benefit shall be offset
by any increased tax liability of the Buyer Indemnitee as a result of inclusion
in income of any part of payments made in respect of such Buyer Damages, and
that for purposes of determining the amount of any Tax benefit or detriment
pursuant to this Section 7.2(b)(iii), the marginal combined federal and state
income tax rate of the Buyer Indemnitee shall be deemed to be forty percent
(40%)). The Buyer Indemnitees shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
collect any amounts available under such insurance coverage and from such other
party alleged to have responsibility. If a Buyer Indemnitee receives an amount
under insurance coverage or from such other party with respect to Buyer Damages
at any time subsequent to any indemnification provided by Seller under this
Section 7.2, then such Buyer Indemnitee shall promptly reimburse Seller for
amounts paid by Seller to the Buyer Indemnitee in connection with providing such
indemnification up to such amount received by the Buyer Indemnitee;

          (iv)   Buyer agrees that Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to pursue any claim pursuant to this Section 7.2(b) that is potentially
payable under the Title Policy issued pursuant to Section 4.11 of this Agreement
against such Title Policy before a claim is made against Seller pursuant to this
Article VII. Buyer Damages shall be reduced by the amount of any such proceeds
received under such title insurance policy; and

          (v)    Seller shall be obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees.
under Section 7.2(a)(i) only for those claims giving rise to Buyer Damages as to
which the Buyer Indemnitees have given Seller written notice of prior to the end
of the Survival Period (to the extent the Survival Period is applicable to such
claim). Any written notice delivered by a Buyer Indemnitee to Seller with
respect to Buyer Damages shall set forth with as much specificity as is
reasonably practicable the basis of the claim for Buyer Damages and, to the
extent reasonably practicable, a reasonable estimate of the amount of such
claim. Subject to the procedures with respect to Claims under Section 7.4
hereof, if such written notice (or an amended notice) states the amount of Buyer
Damages claimed and Seller notifies the Buyer Indemnitee that Seller does not
dispute the claim described in such notice or fails to notify the Buyer
Indemnitee within 20 business days after delivery of such notice by the Buyer
Indemnitee whether Seller disputes the claim described in such notice, Buyer
Damages in the amount specified in such notice will be admitted by Seller, and
Seller will pay the amount of such Buyer Damages to the Buyer Indemnitee. If
Seller has timely disputed its liability with respect to such claim, Buyer and
Seller will proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute in
accordance with Section 8.6 hereof. If a written notice does not state the
amount of Buyer Damages claimed, such omission will not preclude the Buyer
Indemnitee from

     recovering from Seller the amount of Buyer Damages with respect to the
     claim described in such notice if any such amount is promptly provided once
     determined.

          (c) Subject to a Buyer Indemnitee's right to recover for Buyer Damages
from the Indemnification Escrow Amount in accordance with Section 7.9, Seller
will pay the amount of any Buyer Damages to the Buyer Indemnitee within 10
business days following the determination of Seller's liability for and the
amount of Seller Damages (whether such determination is made pursuant to the
procedures set forth in this Article VII, by agreement between Buyer and Seller,
by arbitration award or by final adjudication in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement).

          Section 7.3  Buyer's Agreement to Indemnify.

          (a)  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement,
from and after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and
its directors, officers, employees, affiliates, controlling persons, agents and
representatives and their successors and assigns (collectively, the "Seller
Indemnitees") from and against all liability, demands, claims, actions or causes
of action, assessments, losses, damages, costs and expenses (including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) (collectively, "Seller
Damages") asserted against or incurred by any Seller Indemnitee as a result of
or arising out of (i) a breach of any representation or warranty contained in
Article III of this Agreement or any closing certificate delivered by or on
behalf of Buyer pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) any breach of any of the
covenants and agreements of Buyer contained in this Agreement.

          (b)  Buyer's obligation to indemnify the Seller Indemnitees under
Section 7.3(a) of this Agreement is subject to the following limitations:

               (i)   No indemnification shall be made by Buyer under
     Section 7.3(a)(i) unless the aggregate amount of Seller Damages exceeds the
     Basket Amount and, in such event, indemnification shall be made by Buyer
     only to the extent that the aggregate amount of Seller Damages exceeds the
     Deductible Amount;

               (ii)  In no event shall Buyer's aggregate obligation to indemnify
     the Seller Indemnitees under Section 7.3(a)(i) exceed the Cap Amount,
     except in the event that such obligation to indemnify arises from the
     fraudulent act or omission of Buyer;

               (iii) The amount of any Seller Damages shall be reduced by (A)
     any amount actually received by a Seller Indemnitee with respect to such
     Seller Damages under any insurance coverage or from any other party alleged
     to be responsible for such Seller Damages (provided, however, that the
     amount of any such reduction for insurance proceeds shall be offset by the
     present value of any increase in insurance premiums attributable to any
     claim for insurance related to such Seller Damages) and (B) the amount of
     any Tax benefit actually realized by the Seller Indemnitee attributable to
     such Seller Damages (provided however, that the amount of any such
     reduction for Tax benefit shall be offset by any increased tax liability of
     the Seller Indemnitee as a result of inclusion in income of any part of
     payments made in respect of such Seller Damages, and that for purposes of
     determining the amount of any Tax benefit or detriment pursuant to

     this Section 7.3(b)(iii), the marginal combined federal and state income
     tax rate of the Seller Indemnitee shall be deemed to be forty percent
     (40%)). The Seller Indemnitees shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
     collect any amounts available under such insurance coverage and from such
     other party alleged to have responsibility. If a Seller Indemnitee receives
     any amount under insurance coverage or from such other party with respect
     to Seller Damages at any time subsequent to any indemnification provided by
     Buyer under this Section 7.3, then such Seller Indemnitee shall promptly
     reimburse Buyer for amounts paid by Buyer to the Seller Indemnitee in
     connection with providing such indemnification up to such amount received
     by the Seller Indemnitee; and

               (iv)  Buyer shall be obligated to indemnify the Seller
     Indemnitees under Section 7.3(a)(i) only for those claims giving rise to
     Seller Damages as to which the Seller Indemnitees have given Buyer written
     notice of prior to the end of the Survival Period. Any written notice
     delivered by a Seller Indemnitee to Buyer with respect to Seller Damages
     shall set forth with as much specificity as is reasonably practicable the
     basis of the claim for Seller Damages and, to the extent reasonably
     practicable, a reasonable estimate of the amount of such claim. Subject to
     the procedures with respect to Claims under Section 7.4 hereof, if such
     written notice (or an amended notice) states the amount of Seller Damages
     claimed and Buyer notifies the Seller Indemnitee that Buyer does not
     dispute the claim described in such notice or fails to notify the Seller
     Indemnitee within 20 business days after delivery of such notice by the
     Seller Indemnitee whether Buyer disputes the claim described in such
     notice, Seller Damages in the amount specified in such notice will be
     admitted by Buyer, and Buyer will pay the amount of such Seller Damages to
     the Seller Indemnitee. If Buyer has timely disputed its liability with
     respect to such claim, Seller and Buyer will proceed in good faith to
     negotiate a resolution of such dispute in accordance with Section 8.6
     hereof. If a written notice does not state the amount of Seller Damages
     claimed, such omission will not preclude the Seller Indemnitee from
     recovering from Buyer the amount of Seller Damages with respect to the
     claim described in such notice if any such amount is promptly provided once
     determined.

          (c)  Buyer will pay the amount of any Seller Damages to the Seller
Indemnitee within 10 business days following the determination of Buyer's
liability for and the amount of Seller Damages (whether such determination is
made pursuant to the procedures set forth in this Article VII, by agreement
between Buyer and Seller, by arbitration award or by final adjudication in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement).

          Section 7.4  Third-Party Indemnification. The obligations of Seller to
indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees under Section 7.2 of this Agreement with respect
to Buyer Damages and the obligations of Buyer to indemnify the Seller
Indemnitees under Section 7.3 of this Agreement with respect to Seller Damages,
in either case resulting from the assertion of liability by third parties (each,
as the case may be, a "Claim"), will be subject to the following terms and
conditions:

          (a)  Any party against whom any Claim is asserted will give the
indemnifying party written notice of any such Claim promptly after learning of
such Claim, and the indemnifying party may, at its option, undertake the defense
of such Claim by representatives of

                                       55

                                                                  Execution Copy

its own choosing. Failure to give prompt notice of a Claim under this Agreement
shall not affect the indemnifying party obligations under this Article VII,
except to the extent the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced by such
failure to give prompt notice. If the indemnifying party, within 30 days after
notice of any such Claim, or such shorter period as is reasonably required,
fails to assume the defense of such Claim, the Buyer Indemnitee or the Seller
Indemnitee, as the case may be, against whom such Claim has been made will (upon
further notice to the indemnifying party) have the right to undertake the
defense, compromise or settlement of such Claim on behalf of and for the account
and risk, and at the expense, of the indemnifying party, subject to the right of
the indemnifying party to assume the defense of such Claim at any time prior to
settlement, compromise or final determination of such Claim. If the indemnifying
party assumes such defense, the Buyer Indemnitee or the Seller Indemnitee, as
the case may be, shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and
to employ counsel, at its own expense (which expense shall not constitute a
Buyer Damage or Seller Damage, as applicable, unless the Buyer Indemnitee or the
Seller Indemnitee, as the case may be, reasonably determines that the
indemnifying party is not adequately representing or, because of a conflict of
interest, may not adequately represent, any interests of the Buyer Indemnitee or
the Seller Indemnitee, as the case may be, and only to the extent that such
expenses are reasonable), separate from the counsel employed by the Buyer
Indemnitee or the Seller Indemnitee, it being understood, however, that the
indemnifying party shall control such defense. The indemnifying party shall be
liable for the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Buyer Indemnitee or
the Seller Indemnitee, as the case may be, for any period during which the
indemnifying party has not assumed the defense thereof.

          (b) Anything in this Section 7.4 to the contrary notwithstanding, the
indemnifying party shall not enter into any settlement or compromise of any
action, suit or proceeding or consent to the entry of any judgment (i) which
does not include as an unconditional term of the delivery by the claimant or
plaintiff to the Seller Indemnitee or the Buyer Indemnitee, as the case may be,
of a written release from all liability in respect of such action, suit or
proceeding or (ii) for other than monetary damages to be borne by the
indemnifying party, without the prior written consent of the Seller Indemnitee
or the Buyer Indemnitee, as the case may be, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

          (c) The indemnifying party and the Seller Indemnitee or Buyer
Indemnitee, as applicable, shall provide each other such cooperation as may be
reasonably requested and at the expense of the indemnifying party in all aspects
of any investigation, defense, pretrial activities, trial, compromise,
settlement or discharge of any claim in respect of which indemnity is sought
under this Article VII, including, but not limited to, by providing the other
party with reasonable access to employees and officers (including as witnesses)
and other information.

          Section 7.5 No Setoff. Neither Buyer nor Seller shall have any right
to setoff any Buyer Damages or Seller Damages, respectively, against any
payments to be made by either of them under this Agreement.

          Section 7.6 No Duplication. Any liability for indemnification under
this Agreement shall be determined without duplication of recovery by reason of
the state of facts (i) giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of
more than one representation, warranty,

covenant or agreement or (ii) taken into account in determining any adjustment
to the Purchase Price under Section 1.9(c).

          Section 7.7 Qualifications for Materiality. Notwithstanding any
provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the indemnification obligations of
Seller and of Buyer under this Article VII in connection with a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in this
Agreement, and the amount of Losses to be indemnified, shall be determined
without regard to any qualifications, provisions or exceptions for "material",
"materiality," "in all material respects" (or correlative meanings) or "Seller
Material Adverse Effect" or "Buyer Material Adverse Effect" set forth in such
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement, and each of such
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements shall be deemed to
have been made or given for the purposes of this Article VII as though there
were no such qualification, provision or exception. The parties acknowledge that
the failure to disclose a matter in the Seller Disclosure Letter due to the
materiality thresholds set forth in any such representation, warranty, covenant
or other agreement shall not, per se, give rise to Buyer Damages or Seller
Damages, as the case may be.

          Section 7.8 Sole Remedy.

          (a) After the Closing, the parties agree that the sole and exclusive
remedy of any party to this Agreement or their respective affiliates with
respect to this Agreement, the events giving rise to this Agreement and the
transactions provided for in this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, shall
be limited to the indemnification provisions set forth in Section 1.9, 1.10,
1.11, 1.12, 1.13, 4.6, 4.8(k), 4.11, 4.13(b), 4.14 and 4.15 and this Article VII
and, in furtherance of the foregoing, each of the parties, on behalf of itself
and its affiliates, waives and releases the other parties to this Agreement (and
such other parties' affiliates) from, to the fullest extent permitted under any
applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action it or its
affiliates may have against the other party to this Agreement except as provided
by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will
prevent any party from bringing an action based upon allegations of fraud by the
other party in connection with this Agreement. In the event such action is
brought, the prevailing party's attorneys' fees and costs will be paid by the
nonprevailing party.

          (b) The parties intend that, even though indemnification and other
obligations appear in various sections and articles of this Agreement, the
indemnification procedures and, to the extent applicable, the limitations
contained in this Article VII shall apply to all indemnity and other obligations
of the parties under this Agreement, except as provided in Section 4.6 and
except to the extent expressly excluded in this Article VII.

          Section 7.9 No Special Damages. IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE
UNDER THIS ARTICLE VII OR OTHERWISE IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT FOR EXEMPLARY,
SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INDIRECT, REMOTE, SPECULATIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES EXCEPT
TO THE EXTENT ANY SUCH PARTY SUFFERS SUCH DAMAGES TO AN UNAFFILIATED THIRD PARTY
IN CONNECTION WITH A THIRD PARTY CLAIM, IN WHICH EVENT SUCH DAMAGES SHALL BE
RECOVERABLE.

          Section 7.10 Escrow Account.

          (a) The Adjustment Escrow Amount shall be held by the Escrow Agent
from the Closing Date until the final resolution of any adjustment to the
Purchase Price is determined under Section 1.9 hereof and shall be released by
the Escrow Agent in accordance with Section 1.9 hereof and the terms of the
Escrow Agreement.

          (b) The Indemnification Escrow Amount shall be held by the Escrow
Agent from the Closing Date until twenty-four months after the Closing Date (the
"Escrow Period") and shall be released by the Escrow Agent in accordance with
this Section 7.10 and the terms of the Escrow Agreement. During the Escrow
Period, if any Buyer Indemnitee suffers any Buyer Damages subject to
indemnification pursuant to this Article VII, it shall be entitled to receive,
upon final determination of the amount of Buyer Damages and its entitlement to
indemnification in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, from the Escrow
Agent out of the Indemnification Escrow Amount an amount equal to the amount of
such Buyer Damages.

          (c) At the end of the Escrow Period, the Escrow Agent, shall promptly
deliver to Seller cash (the "Returned Cash") in amount equal to the then current
balance of Indemnification Escrow Amount (subject to the prior reduction of the
Indemnification Escrow Amount in satisfaction of any Buyer Damage for which any
Buyer Indemnitee was entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article VII)
less the aggregate value (based on a reasonable good faith estimate of the
liability) of all claims for indemnification under this Article VII, if any, for
which notice has been timely filed by a Buyer Indemnitee pursuant to this
Article VII ("Pending Claims"). At the time that the Escrow Agent delivers the
Returned Cash to Seller, the Escrow Agent shall deliver a notice to Seller and
Buyer setting forth the amount of Returned Cash, the aggregate value of all
Pending Claims, and the amount of the Indemnification Escrow Amount, including
Investment Income (as defined in the Escrow Agreement) thereon, that will remain
in escrow under the Escrow Agreement pending resolution of any such Pending
Claims (the "Retained Cash").

          (d) Within ten business days after the date on which a claim for
indemnification of Buyer Damages against Retained Cash has been completely and
finally resolved in accordance with this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall
deliver to Seller the Retained Cash, including Investment Income thereon, less
an amount of cash equal to the aggregate amount released by the Escrow Agent to
the applicable Buyer Indemnitee pursuant to this Article VII in connection with
the final resolution of its claims against the Retained Cash.

                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

          Section 8.1 Amendment and Modification. This Agreement may be amended,
modified or supplemented at any time by the parties to this Agreement, under an

the Seller Disclosure Letter) and the Confidentiality Agreement (a) constitute

supersede other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
between the parties concerning the subject matter of this Agreement and (b)
shall not be assigned, by operation of law or otherwise, by a party, without the
prior written consent of the other parties.

          Section 8.3 Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
term or provision of this Agreement in any situation or jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other terms or provisions of this
Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision
in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction and the remaining terms and
provisions shall remain in full force and effect, unless doing so would result
in an interpretation of this Agreement which is manifestly unjust.

          Section 8.4 Notices. Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, all
notices and other communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and
may be given by any of the following methods: (a) personal delivery; (b)
facsimile transmission; (c) registered or certified mail, postage prepaid,
return receipt requested; or (d) overnight delivery service. Such notices and
communications shall be sent to the appropriate party at its address or

be deemed given upon receipt by such party or upon actual delivery to the
appropriate address, or, in case of a facsimile transmission, upon transmission
by the sender and issuance by the transmitting machine of a confirmation slip
that the number of pages constituting the notice have been transmitted without
error; in the case of notices sent by facsimile transmission, the sender shall
contemporaneously mail a copy of the notice to the addressee at the address
provided for above; provided, however, that such mailing shall in no way alter
the time at which the facsimile notice is deemed received):

          Section 8.5 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by,
enforced under and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or
rule thereof.

          Section 8.6 Dispute Resolution.

          (a) Negotiation; Mediation.

              (i)  In the event of any dispute or disagreement between Seller
and Buyer as to the interpretation of any provision of this Agreement (or the
performance of obligations under this Agreement), the matter, on written request
of either party, shall be referred to representatives of the parties for
decision, each party being represented by a senior executive officer who has no
direct operational responsibility for the matters contemplated by this Agreement
(the "Representatives"). The Representatives shall promptly meet in a good faith
effort to resolve the dispute. If the Representatives do not agree upon a
decision within 30 calendar days after reference of the matter to them, each of
Buyer and Seller shall be free to exercise the remedies available to it under
Section 8.6(b).

              (ii) The Representatives may, if they desire, agree to undertake
mediation and may, if they choose, do so in accordance with the commercial
mediation rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), either as
written or as modified by mutual agreement. A written agreement to undertake
mediation may be made at any time. If arbitration proceeds have been instituted,
they shall be stayed until the mediation process is terminated.

          (b) Arbitration.

              (i)  Any controversy, dispute or claim arising out of or relating
in any way to this Agreement or the other agreements contemplated by this
Agreement or the transactions arising hereunder or thereunder that cannot be
resolved by negotiation or

                                                                  Execution Copy

          mediation pursuant to Section 8.6(a) shall be settled exclusively by
          final and binding arbitration in the City of St. Louis, Missouri. Such
          arbitration will apply the laws of the State of Delaware and the
          commercial arbitration rules of AAA to resolve the dispute.

                 (ii)   Such arbitration shall be conducted by one independent
          and impartial arbitrator to be selected by mutual agreement of the
          parties, if possible. If the parties fail to reach agreement regarding
          appointment of an arbitrator within thirty days following receipt by
          one party of the other party's notice of arbitration, the arbitrator
          shall be selected from a list or lists of proposed arbitrators
          submitted by AAA. Unless the parties agree otherwise, the arbitrator
          shall be a licensed attorney with at least ten years of experience in
          the practice of law. The selection process shall be that which is set
          forth in the AAA commercial arbitration rules then prevailing, except
          that (A) the number of preemptory strikes shall not be limited and
          (B), if the parties fail to select an arbitrator from one or more
          lists, AAA shall not have the power to make an appointment but shall
          continue to submit additional lists until an arbitrator has been
          selected. Initially, however, promptly following its receipt of a
          request to submit a list of proposed arbitrators, AAA shall convene
          the parties in person or by telephone and attempt to facilitate their
          selection of an arbitrator by agreement. If the arbitrator should die,
          withdraw or otherwise become incapable of serving, a replacement shall
          be selected and appointed in a like manner.

                 (iii)  The arbitrator shall render an opinion setting forth
          findings of fact and conclusions of law with the reasons therefor
          stated. A transcript of the evidence adduced at the hearing shall be
          made and shall, upon request, be made available to either party. The
          fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be shared equally by the
          parties and advanced by them from time to time as required; provided
          that at the conclusion of the arbitration, the arbitrator may award
          costs and expenses to the prevailing party in the arbitration
          (including the costs of the arbitration previously advanced and the
          fees and expenses of attorneys, accountants and other experts). No
          pre-arbitration discovery shall be permitted, except that the
          arbitrator shall have the power in his or her sole discretion, on
          application by either party, to order pre-arbitration examination of
          the witnesses and documents that the other party intends to introduce
          in its case-in-chief at the arbitration hearing. The arbitrator shall
          render his or her award within 90 days of the conclusion of the
          arbitration hearing. The arbitrator shall not be empowered to award to
          either party any punitive damages in connection with any dispute
          between them arising out of or relating in any way to this Agreement
          or the other agreements contemplated hereby or the transactions
          arising hereunder or thereunder, and each party hereby irrevocably
          waives any right to recover such damages. The arbitration hearings and
          award shall be maintained in confidence.

                 (iv)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in
          this Section 8.6(b) and without prejudice to the above procedures,
          either party may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for
          temporary injunctive or other provisional judicial relief or to
          specifically enforce the terms of this Agreement if such action is
          necessary to avoid irreparable damage or to preserve the status quo
          until such time as the arbitrator is selected and available to hear
          such party's request for temporary relief. The award

         rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and not subject to judicial
         review and judgment thereon may be entered in any court of competent
         jurisdiction.

           (c) Inapplicable to Section 1.9. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, this Section 8.6 shall not apply to the
provisions of Sections 1.9(b) and (c) of this Agreement.

           Section 8.7  Descriptive Headings. The descriptive headings used in
this Agreement are inserted for convenience of reference only and shall in no
way be construed to define, limit, describe, explain, modify, amplify, or add to
the interpretation, construction or meaning of any provision of, or scope or
intent of, this Agreement nor in any way affect this Agreement.

           Section 8.8  Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but any of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

           Section 8.9  Fees and Expenses. Whether or not this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, and except as
otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, all costs and expenses
(including legal and financial advisory fees and expenses) incurred in
connection with, or in anticipation of, this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such
expenses (and, in the case of Seller and Savannah, the expenses incurred by the
Companies). Each of Seller, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand,
shall indemnify and hold harmless the other party from and against any and all
claims or liabilities for financial advisory and finders' fees incurred by
reason of any action taken by such party or otherwise arising out of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any person claiming to have been
engaged by such party. Seller agrees that none of the Companies has borne or
will bear any of Seller's or Savannah expenses in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

           Section 8.10 Interpretation. The phrase "to the knowledge of Seller"
or any similar phrase shall mean such facts and other information which as of
the date of this Agreement are known to any director or officer of Seller,
Savannah or the Companies and any of the following individuals William F.
Schwer, Walter Lehnies, Hal P. Mechler, Dan Garrett and Frank Jacobs or any
knowledge that would have been acquired by any such person upon appropriate
inquiry and investigation. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this
Agreement.

           Section 8.11 Third-Party Beneficiaries. Savannah is an intended
third-party beneficiary of this Agreement. This Agreement is solely for the
benefit of Seller, Savannah and their respective successors and permitted
assigns, with respect to the obligations of Buyer under this Agreement, and for
the benefit of Buyer, and its successors and permitted assigns, with respect to
the obligations of Seller, under this Agreement, and this Agreement shall not be
deemed to confer upon or give to any other third party any remedy, claim of
liability or reimbursement, cause of action or other right.

           Section 8.12 No Waivers. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement, no failure to exercise, delay in exercising, or single or
partial exercise of any right, power or remedy by any party, and no course of
dealing between the parties, shall constitute a waiver of any such right, power
or remedy. No waiver by a party of any default, misrepresentation, or breach of
warranty or covenant under this Agreement, whether intentional or not, shall be
deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation, or
breach of warranty or covenant under this Agreement or affect in any way any
rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence. No waiver
shall be valid unless in writing and signed by the party against whom such
waiver is sought to be enforced.

           Section 8.13 Specific Performance. The parties to this Agreement
agree that if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable
damage would occur, no adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would be
difficult to determine, and that the parties shall be entitled to specific
performance of the terms of this Agreement and immediate injunctive relief,
without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy, in
addition to any other remedy at law or in equity.
