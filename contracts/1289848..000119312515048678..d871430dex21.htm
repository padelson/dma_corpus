As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holders of any Company Stock (the " _Stockholders_ ") or
capital stock of MergerCo or any other Person:

 

(a) Each share of the capital stock of MergerCo issued and outstanding

the Stockholders Expense Amount Per Share from time to time, if any, for
each share of Company Stock subject to such Stock Option (the sum of (i)-(iv),

the Parent and the Company shall send a release agreement substantially in
the form attached hereto as _Exhibit G_ (" _Optionholder Release Agreement_
") to all Optionholders (other than Optionholders that are receiving a
Letter of Transmittal). If a

 



17  holder delivers to the Parent and Company a duly executed Optionholder
Release Agreement, together with such other documents as may be reasonably
requested, the Optionholder shall be entitled at the Closing to the Option
Closing Payment which shall be paid in accordance with _Section 3.1(b)_. All
other portions of the Option Cashout Consideration, if any, shall be paid to
each Optionholder to the extent provided in the applicable provisions of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and shall be subject to and reduced by all
applicable federal, state and local withholding taxes. The Option Closing

aggregate Stock Closing Payment in lieu of an amount equal to $2,000,000 of
the total cash Merger Consideration Per Share which such Stockholders are
entitled to receive pursuant to this Agreement. It is further acknowledged and
agreed that the Parent may distribute the Stock Closing Payment to
such Stockholders through a means other than the Paying Agent upon the
consent of such Stockholders.

ARTICLE III

 

 _PAYMENTS; APPRAISAL RIGHTS_

 

3.1 _Payments at Closing_.

 

(a) _Payment Fund Amount_. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit with Citibank,
N.A., a national banking association, as depository agent, and Continental
Stock Transfer and Trust Company, a New York corporation, as paying agent
(together, the " _Paying Agent_ ") in accordance with the paying agent
agreement by and among the Parent, Stockholders Representative and the
Paying Agent substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ (the "
_Paying Agent Agreement_ "), for the benefit of the Stockholders, for payment
through the Paying Agent in accordance with this _Section 3.1_, (i) the
Stock Closing Payment and (ii) cash in an amount equal to the sum of (A) the
product obtained by __multiplying__ (x) the Net Closing Payment Per Share
by (y) the number of shares of Company Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, __minus__ (B) $2,000,000 ((i) and
(ii) collectively, the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Company shall pay all
fees and expenses associated with the hiring and retention of the Paying
Agent. The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, make the
payments provided for in _Section 3.2_ out of the Payment Fund. The Payment
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose, except as provided in this

 



18  Agreement. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment
Fund as directed by Parent in direct obligations of the U.S. Treasury, on a
daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be the property of and will be promptly paid to Parent. If for any
reason (including losses) the cash in the Payment Fund shall be insufficient
to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made by the Paying
Agent hereunder, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall promptly deposit
cash into the Payment Fund in an amount that is equal to the deficiency in the
amount of cash required to fully satisfy such payment obligations.

 

(b) _Option Fund Amount_. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit with the
Surviving Corporation, for the benefit of the holders of Stock Options
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, including Stock Options
vesting in connection with the Merger, for payment through the Surviving
Corporation in accordance with this _Section 3.1(b)_, cash in an amount
equal to the aggregate Option Closing Payments (the " _Option Fund_ "). As
soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing, and in any event within
five (5) Business Days of the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall
pay all Option Closing Payments owing to an Optionholder pursuant to _Section
2.7(a)_, without interest and subject to and reduced by all applicable
federal, state and local withholding taxes, through a special payroll, by
check, direct deposit or wire transfer of immediately available funds from
the Option Fund.

(c) _Stockholders  Expense Amount_. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit
cash in an amount equal to the Stockholders Expense Amount into an account
designated by the Stockholders Representative. The Stockholders Expense
Amount shall be held by the Stockholders Representative as agent and in
trust for the benefit of the Stockholders and the Optionholders and shall only
be used to fund reasonable expenses incurred by the Stockholders
Representative in the performance of its duties and obligations hereunder for
the benefit of the Stockholders and the Optionholders. The Stockholders
Representative will hold the Stockholders Expense Amount in a segregated
account separate from its or any other partys corporate funds and will not
subject it to any lien, attachment, trustee process or any other judicial
process unless compelled to do so by such process. The Stockholders
Representative is not providing any investment supervision, recommendations
or advice and shall have no responsibility or liability for any loss of
principal of the Stockholders Expense Amount other than as a result of its
gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Stockholders Expense Amount will
be held by the Stockholders Representative until such time as the
Stockholders Representative determines, in its sole discretion, that the
Stockholders and the Optionholders shall have no further expenses to be
incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Any portion of the Stockholders Expense Amount remaining after such date
shall be allocated and paid by the Stockholders Representative to the
Stockholders and Optionholders as follows:

 

(i) The portion of the Stockholders Expense Amount that is payable to the
Stockholders in respect of their Company Stock shall be paid by the
Stockholders Representative to the Paying Agent on behalf of the
Stockholders, for further distribution and payment by the Paying Agent, of an
amount to each Stockholder equal to the product obtained by  _ _multiplying__
(x) the number of shares of Company Stock held by such Stockholder as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time __by__ (y) the Stockholders Expense
Amount Per Share. The Paying Agent shall make such payments as promptly as
reasonably practicable, but in no event later than the first Business Day
following the receipt of the applicable funds from the Stockholders
Representative.

 



19 (ii) The portion of the Stockholders Expense Amount that is payable to
the Optionholders in respect of their Stock Options shall be paid by the
Stockholders Representative to the Surviving Corporation on behalf of the
Optionholders, for further distribution and payment by the Surviving
Corporation, of an amount (subject to and reduced by all applicable federal,
state and local withholding Taxes) to each Optionholder equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Company Stock subject to
all Stock Options held by such Optionholder as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, by (y) the Stockholders Expense Amount Per Share. Such
payment shall be made by the Surviving Corporation. The Surviving Corporation
shall make such payments as promptly as reasonably practicable, but in no
event later than the next regularly scheduled payroll date following the
receipt of the applicable funds from the Stockholders Representative;
_provided_ that if such regularly scheduled payroll date is within five (5)
Business Days of the receipt of such funds by the Surviving Corporation, then
the Surviving Corporation shall pay such funds on the next regularly scheduled
payroll date thereafter.

 

(d) _Escrow Amount_. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit the Escrow Amount
with the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Amount  _ _plus__ all income accrued
thereon (the " _Escrow Fund_ ") shall be maintained by the Escrow Agent to
secure certain obligations of the Stockholders and Optionholders under this
Agreement. The Escrow Fund shall be administered and payable during the
Escrow Period in accordance with an escrow agreement by and among the
Stockholders Representative, the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the Escrow
Agent substantially in the form attached hereto as  _Exhibit A_ (the "
_Escrow Agreement_ "). All parties hereto agree for all tax purposes that
Parent shall be treated as the owner of the Escrow Fund, and all interest and
earnings derived from the investment and reinvestment of the Escrow Fund, or
any portion thereof, shall be allocable to Parent pursuant to Section 468B(g)
of the Code and Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.468B-8; _provided_
that forty-five percent (45%) of any interest or other earnings earned from
the investment and reinvestment of the Escrow Fund shall be distributed to
Parent as soon as practicable after the end of each such calendar quarter or,
if disbursement of some or all of the amounts held in the Escrow Fund is to
be made pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement before the end of a
calendar quarter, at the time of such disbursement. No party shall take any
action or filing position that is inconsistent with the foregoing. If any
portion of the Escrow Fund is released for the benefit of the Stockholders and
Optionholders pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, then such amount shall be
released by the Escrow Agent to the Stockholders and Optionholders as
follows:

(i) The released portion of the Escrow Fund that is payable to the
Stockholders in respect of their Company Stock shall be paid by the Escrow
Agent to the Paying Agent on behalf of the Stockholders, for further
distribution and payment by the Paying Agent, of an amount to each Stockholder
equal to the product obtained by _multiplying_  (x) the number of shares of
Company Stock held by such Stockholder as of

 



20  immediately prior to the Effective Time __by__ (y) the Escrow Consideration
Per Share. The Paying Agent shall make such payments as promptly as reasonably
practicable, but in no event later than the first Business Day following the
receipt of the applicable funds from the Escrow Agent.

(ii) The released portion of the Escrow Fund that is payable to the
Optionholders in respect of their Stock Options shall be paid by the Escrow
Agent to the Surviving Corporation on behalf of the Optionholders, for further
distribution and payment by the Surviving Corporation, of an amount (subject
to and reduced by all applicable federal, state and local withholding taxes)
to each Optionholder equal to the product obtained by __multiplying__ (x) the
number of shares of Company Stock subject to all Stock Options held by such
Optionholder as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, __by__ (y) the
Escrow Consideration Per Share. The Surviving Corporation shall make such
payments as promptly as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than
the next regularly scheduled payroll date following the receipt of the
applicable funds from the Escrow Agent; _provided_ that if such regularly
scheduled payroll date is within five (5) Business Days of the receipt of
such funds by the Surviving Corporation, then the Surviving Corporation shall
pay such funds on the next regularly scheduled payroll date thereafter.

 

(e) _Certain Restricted Actions on the Closing Date_. From and after the
Effective Time on the Closing Date until the day immediately following the
Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, operate in the ordinary course of business.

 

3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement and
in any event not less than five (5) Business Days following the date of this
Agreement, and provided that the Company has timely provided any required
information to Parent in connection therewith, Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Paying Agent to mail to each record holder of a
Company Stock Certificate a letter of transmittal and instructions in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "). After the
Closing, if a Stockholder surrenders to the Paying Agent a Company Stock
Certificate together with such Letter of Transmittal, and such other documents
as may be reasonably requested pursuant to the instructions included with the
Letter of Transmittal, such Stockholder shall be entitled to receive from the
Paying Agent in exchange therefor (subject to _Section 2.8_, if applicable),
cash in an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of shares represented
by such Company Stock Certificates multiplied by (y) the Net Closing Payment
Per Share. No interest will be paid or accrued on the Net Closing Payment Per
Share payable upon the surrender of the Company Stock Certificates. If a
holder surrenders to the Paying Agent a Company Stock Certificate,
together with such Letter of Transmittal duly executed, and such other
documents as may be reasonably requested pursuant to such instructions, any
time prior to the close of business on the date that is two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, and such holder is the record holder as of the
Closing Date, then the Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Paying Agent to pay the holder of such Certificate on the Closing Date

  



21  in accordance with this _Section 3.2(a)_, and such Certificate shall
forthwith be canceled. If payment is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Company Stock Certificate surrendered is registered,
it shall be a condition of payment that such Company Stock Certificate shall
be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and delivered to
the Paying Agent with all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and that the Person requesting such payment pay any transfer or other
taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Company Stock Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
the Paying Agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.

(b) If any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the execution of and delivery to the Paying Agent and Parent
of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Company Stock
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall deliver
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate the
Merger Consideration Per Share for each share of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Company Stock Certificate.

 

(c) To the extent permitted by applicable law, none of Parent, MergerCo, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any
Person in respect of any Merger Consideration Per Share from the Payment Fund
properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. If any Company Stock Certificate shall not
have been surrendered prior to twelve (12) months after the Effective Time,
any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Company
Stock Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become
the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(d) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and no further registration of transfers of shares shall thereafter be
made on the records of the Company. If, after the Effective Time, Company
Stock Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer,
they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration Per Share,
as provided in this _Article III_ , subject to applicable law in the case of
Dissenting Shares.

3.3 _Estimated Closing Balance Sheet; Estimated Closing Date Net Working
Capital; Estimated Closing Date Cash; Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness_.
Not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date and in no
event more than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall, acting reasonably and in good faith, prepare and deliver to Parent (i)
the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, (ii) a calculation of the Estimated
Closing Date Net Working Capital, (iii) a calculation of the Estimated
Closing Date Cash, (iv) a calculation of the Estimated Closing Date
Indebtedness, (v) an estimate of the Transaction Expenses, (vi) the Companys
calculation of the Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount, together
with any information that Parent may reasonably request to verify the amounts
reflected in any of the foregoing and (vii) an update to the Allocation
Percentages set forth on _Schedule 1(a)_ (the " _Estimated Closing
Statement_ "). The calculations and estimate referred to in subclauses (i) 
(vi) of the immediately preceding sentence shall be calculated on a basis

 



22  consistent with GAAP, and using the same accounting practices, policies,
judgments and methodologies (including with respect to reserves and revenue
recognition) used in the preparation of the audited Financial Statements and
in the calculation of the NWC Target (subject to the absence of footnote
disclosures and other presentation items and changes resulting from the year-
end adjustments set forth on Schedule 3.3(a)) (" _Applicable Accounting
Principles_ "). Illustrative examples showing the calculations required to
prepare the Estimated Closing Statement are set forth in _Schedule 3.3(b)_ ("
_Sample Statement_ "). Upon receipt of the Estimated Closing Statement,
Parent shall have the opportunity to review the Estimated Closing Statement
and, to the extent Parent has any good faith objections thereon, Parent and
the Company will negotiate such objections in good faith. If by two (2) days
prior to the Closing Date, the Parties have not agreed on the Estimated
Closing Date Net Working Capital and the Estimated Closing Date Net Working
Capital proposed by the Company exceeds the NWC Target by $1,000,000 or more,
then for purposes of (x) calculating the Net Merger Consideration payable to
the Stockholders and Optionholders under _Section 3.1_ and (y) determining
the Adjustment Amount in accordance with _Section 3.6_, the Estimated
Closing Date Net Working Capital shall equal the NWC Target __plus__
$1,000,000; _provided_ that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, any reduction of the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital
amount from the amount set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement pursuant
to this sentence shall not limit, modify or affect in any respect the
determination of the Closing Date Net Working Capital amount in accordance
with  _Section 3.6_ and, for the avoidance of doubt, the Stockholders
Representative shall not be estopped or otherwise limited in asserting in a
Protest Notice or otherwise that the Closing Date Net Working Capital equals
the amount set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement (or any other
amount).

3.4 _Payments at Closing for Indebtedness_. At the Closing, Parent and
MergerCo shall provide sufficient funds to the Surviving Corporation to enable
the Surviving Corporation to repay the Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness.
Parent and MergerCo will cooperate in arranging for such repayment and shall
take such reasonable actions as may be necessary to facilitate such repayment
and to facilitate the release, in connection with such repayment, of any Lien
securing the Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness.

 

3.5 _Payments at Closing for Transaction Expenses_. At the Closing, Parent and
MergerCo shall provide sufficient funds to the Surviving Corporation to
enable the Surviving Corporation to pay all outstanding Transaction Expenses
set forth on the Estimated Closing Statement. At the Closing, but effective
immediately prior to the Closing, the Company shall pay the unpaid
Transaction Expenses set forth on the Estimated Closing Statement.

3.6 _Post-Closing Adjustments_.

 

(a) _Closing Statement_. On or prior to the date that is one hundred and
twenty (120) days following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall
prepare and deliver to the Stockholders Representative (i) an unaudited
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the close
of business on the Closing Date, which balance sheet shall not give effect to
the Merger or any financing transactions in connection therewith (the "
_Closing Balance Sheet_ "), (ii) a calculation of the Net Working Capital of
the Company and its wholly-owned Subsidiaries as of the close of business on
the Closing Date (" _Closing_

 



23   _Date Net Working Capital_ "), (iii) a calculation of the Cash of the
Company and its wholly-owned Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the
Closing Date (" _Closing Date Cash_ "), and (iv) a calculation of the
aggregate amount of all Indebtedness of the Company and its wholly owned
Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the " _Closing
Date Indebtedness_ "), in each case, determined without giving effect to the
consummation of the Merger or any financing transactions in connection
therewith (the " _Closing Statement_ "). The Closing Statement shall be
prepared in accordance with the Sample Statement and the Applicable
Accounting Principles and otherwise in accordance with the requirements of
this Agreement; provided that, solely for purposes of the Surviving
Corporations calculation of Closing Date Net Working Capital, any accounts
receivable that are aged over 90 days as of the Closing Date, and that have
not been collected as of the date of the delivery of the Closing Statement,
shall be excluded from such calculation. The Closing Statement and the
preparation thereof shall be for the sole purpose of determining the
Adjustment Amount.

(b) _Review Period_. Within thirty (30) days of the Surviving Corporations
delivery to the Stockholders Representative of the Closing Statement, the
Stockholders Representative may deliver written notice (the " _Protest
Notice_ ") to the Surviving Corporation of any objections, specifying in
reasonable detail any contested amounts and the basis therefor, which the
Stockholders Representative may have to the Closing Statement. The sole
permissible grounds for objection shall be that the Closing Balance Sheet
and/or the calculations of the Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date
Cash and Closing Date Indebtedness were not calculated in accordance with this
Agreement. The failure of the Stockholders Representative to deliver such
Protest Notice within the prescribed time period will constitute the
Stockholders Representatives acceptance as final of the Closing Statement as
determined by the Surviving Corporation. Any amounts not disputed in
the Protest Notice (if one is delivered) shall be deemed to be accepted by
the Stockholders Representative as final. Upon receipt of the Closing
Statement, the Stockholders Representative and its accountants will be given
reasonable access to the Surviving Corporations relevant books, records,
workpapers and personnel during reasonable business hours for the purpose of
verifying the Closing Statement.

 

(c) _Disputes_. If the Surviving Corporation and the Stockholders
Representative are unable to resolve any disagreement with respect to the
Closing Statement within thirty (30) days following the Surviving
Corporations receipt of a Protest Notice, then the Parties shall mutually
retain KPMG LLP or if such firm is unable to perform such services, then a
nationally recognized independent accounting firm mutually selected by Parent
and the Stockholders Representative (such firm referred to as the "
_Accountants_ ") and refer solely the items and amounts in dispute to the
Accountants for final determination within forty-five (45) days after such
referral. The determination by the Accountants of the items and amounts in
dispute shall be based solely on presentations by the Surviving Corporation
and the Stockholders Representative and shall not involve the Accountants
independent review. Any determination by the Accountants shall not be outside
the range defined by the respective amounts in the Closing Statement proposed
by the Surviving Corporation and the Stockholders Representatives proposed
adjustments thereto, and such determination shall be final, binding and non-
appealable upon the Parties. Each of the Surviving Corporation, on the one
hand, and the Stockholders Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders and

 



24  Optionholders) on the other hand, shall bear that percentage of the fees and
expenses of the Accountants equal to the proportion (expressed as a
percentage) of the dollar value of the disputed amounts determined in favor
of the other party by the Accountants. Subject to the foregoing, each of the
Surviving Corporation and the Stockholders Representative agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Accountants in their
determination of the amounts set forth in the Closing Statement.

(d) _Adjustment Amount_. The " _Adjustment Amount_ ," which may be positive
or negative, shall mean zero:

(i) __plus__  (A) Closing Date Net Working Capital, __minus__ (B) the
Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital;

 

(ii) __plus__ (A) the absolute value of the amount of Estimated Closing Date
Indebtedness, __minus__  (B) the absolute value of the amount of Closing Date
Indebtedness;

Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Appraisal Rights Provisions_ ") (i) have not
executed a written consent adopting and approving this Agreement and (ii)
shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal for such shares, and not
effectively withdrawn, lost or failed to perfect their rights to appraisal
(collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), will not be converted as
described in _Section 2.6_, but at the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall be
canceled and shall cease to exist and shall represent the right to receive
only those rights provided under the Appraisal Rights Provisions; _provided_
_,_ _however_ , that all shares of Company Stock held by Stockholders who
shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost
their rights to appraisal of such shares of Company Stock under the Appraisal
Rights Provisions shall thereupon be deemed to have been canceled and retired
and to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration Per Share, without interest, in the manner
provided in _Section 2.6_. Persons who have perfected statutory rights with
respect to Dissenting Shares as aforesaid will not be paid by the Surviving
Corporation as provided in this Agreement and will have only such rights as

Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give Parent and MergerCo prompt notice of
any demands received by the Company for the exercise of appraisal rights with
respect to shares of Company Stock. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
conditioned, withheld or delayed), make any payment with respect to, or settle
or offer to settle, any such demands.

 



26 (b) Each dissenting Stockholder who becomes entitled under the Appraisal
Rights Provisions to payment for Dissenting Shares shall receive payment
therefor after the Effective Time from the Surviving Corporation (but only
after the amount thereof shall have been agreed upon or finally determined
pursuant to the Appraisal Rights Provisions), and such shares of Company
Stock shall be canceled.

3.8 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Paying Agent, Stockholders Representative, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be required, and Parent shall be entitled, to
deduct and withhold, as the case may be, from the consideration otherwise
payable to any Stockholder or Optionholder pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payments under the Code, or any provision of any Tax Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid in accordance with this
Agreement to the Stockholder or Optionholder in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made, and such amounts shall be delivered by
the Paying Agent, Stockholders Representative, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, to the applicable Governmental Authority.

 

3.9 _Allocation of Consideration_. The payment by Parent of the Merger
Consideration Per Share and the Option Cashout Consideration shall constitute
payment by Parent to each Stockholder and Optionholder, as applicable, and
satisfaction of Parents obligation to pay such amount hereunder.

 

3.10 _Payments_. All payments required to be made pursuant to this Agreement
shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by the recipient of such payment at least two (2)
Business Days prior to such payment.

each jurisdiction in which the property or assets owned, leased or operated

have a Company Material Adverse Effect. _Schedule 4.1_ sets forth a list of
all jurisdictions where the Company is qualified to do business. The Company
has heretofore made available to Parent complete and correct copies of the
Organizational Documents of the Company, as currently in effect.

 



27 (b) The Company has full legal right and corporate power and authority to

or any of its Subsidiaries could reasonably be expected to have any
Liabilities or which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or one of their
Affiliates sponsors, maintains or administers for employees or categories of
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Each plan, program or
contract set forth or required to be set forth on _Schedule 4.14(c)_ is
referred to herein as a " _Plan_." Except as set forth on  _Schedule
4.14(c)_ (the Plans set forth on _Schedule 4.14(c)_, the " _Company Plans_
"), there are no Plans maintained, sponsored or administered by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries.

neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the shareholder
approval of this Agreement, nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby could (either alone or in conjunction with any other
event) result in, or cause the accelerated vesting, payment, funding
or delivery of, or increase the amount or value of, any payment or benefit to
any employee, officer, director or other service provider of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
party to any Contracts, agreements, plans or arrangements covering any
current or former employees or directors thereof that, individually or
collectively, would give rise to the imposition of any excise tax under
Section 4999 of the Code or the payment of any amount that would be non-
deductible pursuant to Section 280G of the Code. There are no Contracts by
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound to compensate any
current or former officer, employee or director of the Company or any
Subsidiary for excise taxes paid pursuant to Section 4999 or Section 409A of
the Code.

(i) The Company has performed in all material respects all obligations
required to be performed by it (including the timely payment of payments and

(including all employer contributions and employee salary reduction
contributions), premiums and expenses to or in respect of each such Company
Plan have been timely paid in full or, to the extent not yet due, have been
adequately accrued on the applicable financial statements. Each such Company
Plan which is an "employee benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA
and intended to qualify under Section 401 of the Code has received a favorable
determination or is entitled to rely on opinion letter from the Internal
Revenue Service with respect to such qualification and covering all Tax Law
changes up to and including the Pension Protection Act of 2006, the Heroes
Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax Act of 2008 and the Worker, Retiree and
Employer Recovery Act of 2008, and nothing has occurred since the date of
such letter that has or is likely to adversely affect such qualification or
exemption or the imposition of any material Liability, penalty or tax under
ERISA or the Code. No Company Plan is under audit or is the subject of an
investigation by the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Department of Labor or
any other Governmental Authority, nor is any such audit or investigation
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened. No pending actions,
claims or lawsuits have been asserted or instituted against the Company Plans,
the assets of the trusts under such plans or the plan sponsor or the plan
administrator, or against any fiduciary of the Company Plans with respect to
the operation of such plans (other than routine benefit claims).

payments to any current or former employees for any wages, salaries,

required to be reimbursed to any current or former employees.

 



41 (k) To the extent the Company or any of its Subsidiaries utilizes any
independent contractors, temporary employees, leased employees or any other

treated them in accordance with applicable Laws and for purposes of all
Company Plans and perquisites. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries

salaries, commissions, bonuses, severance, termination pay, consulting fees or
other direct compensation or remuneration for any services performed therefor
or amounts required to be reimbursed to such Contingent Workers.

bonuses (both guaranteed and targeted); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Parties acknowledge and agree that while employees are entitled to
participate in the "success share program" (such program, the " _Success Share
Program_ "), the Company does not budget the allocations with respect to the
Success Share Program at an individual employee level.

(m) To the Knowledge of the Company, no employee or Contingent Worker of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is in any respect in violation in any
material respect of any term of any employment agreement, independent
contractor agreement, nondisclosure agreement, common law nondisclosure
obligation, fiduciary duty, non-competition agreement, restrictive covenant

Period or decreasing any Tax attribute of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries existing on the Closing Date.

each of its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries), each of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents
and Representatives and each of the heirs, executors, successors and assigns
of any of the foregoing (collectively, the " _Parent Indemnified Parties_ ")
from, against and in respect of any and all Losses (the " _Parent Losses_ ")
arising out of, or related to:

 

(a) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by the
Company in _Article IV_ of this Agreement or any other agreements,

the Adjustment Amount;

 

(d) any Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries that remains unpaid

(e) from any claims by any holder of Dissenting Shares as a result of the

9.2 _Indemnification Obligations of Parent_. From and after the Closing,
Parent shall indemnify, defend, save and hold harmless the Stockholders and
Optionholders, each of their

 



64  respective agents and Representatives and each of the heirs, executors,

_Stockholder Indemnified Parties_ ") from, against and in respect of any and
all Losses (the " _Stockholder Losses_ ") arising out of, or related to:

 

(a) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by Parent
or MergerCo in _Article V_ of this Agreement;

(b) any breach or nonperformance of any covenant, agreement or undertaking
made by Parent or MergerCo in this Agreement; and

(c) any breach or nonperformance of any covenant, agreement or undertaking
made by the Surviving Corporation in this Agreement that requires performance
by the Company after the Effective Time.

9.3 _Indemnification Procedure_. 

(a) Except with respect to Tax matters which shall be governed by _Section
10.6_, promptly after receipt by a Parent Indemnified Party or a Stockholder
Indemnified Party (hereinafter collectively referred to as an " _Indemnified
Party_ ") of notice by a third party of a threatened or filed complaint or the
threatened or actual commencement of any Action with respect to which such
Indemnified Party may be entitled to receive payment from the other Parties
for any Parent Losses or Stockholder Losses, as the case may be, such
Indemnified Party shall provide written notification to Parent, on the one
hand, or the Stockholders Representative, on the other hand, whoever is the
appropriate indemnifying Party or Parties hereunder (the " _Indemnifying
Party_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail the nature of the claim for
which indemnification is sought, the provision(s) under this Agreement that
provide the basis for such claim for indemnification, the amount of such third
party claim (if known) and the portion of such amount subject to
indemnification;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability under
this Agreement with respect to such claim only if, and only to the extent
that, such failure to notify the Indemnifying Party results in (i) the
forfeiture by the Indemnifying Party of rights and defenses otherwise
available to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim or (ii)
material prejudice to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim. The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice delivered to the
Indemnified Party within fifteen (15) days thereafter, to assume the defense
of such Action, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory
to the Indemnified Party and the payment of the fees and disbursements of such
counsel; _provided, however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not be
entitled to assume or maintain control of the defense of any Action and shall
pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified
Parties if (A) such Action involves, relates to or arises in connection with
any criminal Action, indictment, allegation or investigation, (B) such Action
principally seeks an injunction or equitable relief against any Indemnified
Parties, or (C) the amount in dispute or the _ad damnum_ (whichever is
greater), plus all projected costs and expenses associated with defending such
Action, is greater than the Losses for which the Indemnifying Party remains
liable under this Agreement (which, for purposes of this provision, shall be
reduced by the amount of all other than pending indemnification claims against
such Indemnifying Party). An election by the Indemnifying Party to assume the
defense of such Action shall be deemed an acknowledgement by such

 



65  Indemnifying Party that it is liable to the Indemnified Party for Losses
arising out of, related to, or resulting from such Action, subject to the
other provisions and limitations set forth in this Agreement. In the event,
however, that the Indemnifying Party declines or fails to assume the defense
of the Action on the terms provided above within such fifteen (15) day period,
then the Indemnified Party may employ counsel to represent or defend it in
any such Action and (provided such Indemnifying Party is not contesting in
good faith its obligation to provide indemnification in respect of such
matter) the Indemnifying Party will pay the reasonable fees and disbursements
of such counsel as incurred; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying
Party will not be required to pay the fees and disbursements of more than one
(1) counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction in any single
Action. In any Action with respect to which indemnification is being sought
hereunder, the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party, whichever is not
assuming the defense of such Action, shall have the right to participate in
such matter and to retain its own counsel at such Partys own expense. The
Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party controlling the defense of such
Action, as the case may be, shall at all times use reasonable efforts to keep
the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be,
reasonably apprised of the status of any matter the defense of which they are
maintaining and to cooperate in good faith with, and consult with, each other
with respect to the defense of such Action. If the Indemnifying Party fails
to diligently prosecute or defend such Action, the Indemnified Party may
assume control of such Action at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. The
Party not controlling such Action shall cooperate with and make available to
the controlling party such assistance and materials as may be reasonably
requested by it (including copies of any summons, complaint or other pleading
which may have been served on such party and any written claim, demand,
invoice, billing or other document evidencing or asserting the same).

(b) Except with respect to Tax matters which shall be governed by  _Section
10.6_, no Indemnified Party may settle or compromise any claim or consent to
the entry of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is being
sought hereunder without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned;
_provided_ , that the Indemnifying Party may only withhold its consent to any
such settlement or compromise if (i) the Indemnifying Party then promptly
elects to assume the defense of the Action with respect to which such
settlement or compromise was proposed, including the employment of counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the payment of the fees
and disbursements of such counsel and (ii) (A) such Action does not involve,
relate to or arise in connection with any criminal Action, indictment,
allegation or investigation, (B) such Action does not principally seek an
injunction or equitable relief against any Indemnified Parties, or (C) the
amount in dispute or the _ad damnum_ (whichever is greater), plus all
projected costs and expenses associated with defending such Action, is less
than the Losses for which the Indemnifying Party remains liable under this
Agreement (which, for purposes of this provision, shall be reduced by the
amount of all other than pending indemnification claims against such
Indemnifying Party). An Indemnifying Party may not, without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party, settle or compromise any claim or consent
to the entry of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is being
sought hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or consent (x) includes an
unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all liability arising out
of such claim, (y) does not contain (A) any finding or omission of wrongdoing
by the Indemnified Party or (B) any settlement,

 



66  compromise, consent, equitable order, judgment or term which affects,
restrains or interferes in any material way with the business of the
Indemnified Party or any of the Indemnified Partys Affiliates and (z) does
not impose criminal liability, regulatory sanctions or equitable remedies and
does not impose any obligation on the Indemnified Party other than solely the
payment of money damages for which the Indemnified Party will be fully
indemnified hereunder as shall be acknowledged in writing by the Indemnifying
Party prior to the effectiveness of such settlement, compromise or consent.

 

(c) In the event an Indemnified Party shall claim a right to payment pursuant
to this Agreement not involving a third party claim covered by _Section
9.3(a)_ hereof, such Indemnified Party shall send written notice of such claim
to the appropriate Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall specify the basis for
such claim. As promptly as possible after the Indemnified Party has given
such notice, such Indemnified Party and the appropriate Indemnifying Party
shall establish the merits and amount of such claim (by mutual agreement,
arbitration, litigation or otherwise) and, within five (5) Business Days of
the final determination of the merits and amount of such claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party immediately available
funds in an amount equal to such claim as determined hereunder, if any.

 

(d) Any payment made to an Indemnified Party shall be treated for Tax purposes
as an adjustment to the Aggregate Merger Consideration paid by Parent.

9.4 _Claims Period_. For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Claims Period_ "
shall be the period after the Closing Date during which a claim for
indemnification may be asserted under this Agreement by a Parent Indemnified
Party. The period after the Closing during which a claim for indemnification
may be asserted for breaches of representations or warranties pursuant to
_Section 9.1(a)_ of this Agreement by a Parent Indemnified Party shall
commence on the Closing Date and shall terminate on the eighteen (18) month
anniversary of the Closing Date;  _provided_ , _however_ , that claims for
breaches of the representations and warranties set forth in (a) _Sections
4.14_ (Employee Matters), _Section 4.15_ (Taxes) and _Section 4.17_ (Certain
Fees) shall survive the Closing and continue in effect, and a claim for
indemnification may be asserted, until the date sixty (60) days after the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, taking into account any
extensions or waivers thereof (the representations and warranties referred to
in this clause (a) being referred to as the " _Extended Representations_ "),
and (b) _Section 4.1_ (Organization), _Section 4.2_ (Equity Securities), 
_Section 4.3_ (Subsidiaries) and _Section 4.4(a)_ (Consents and Approvals;
No Violations) shall survive the Closing and continue in effect, and a claim
for indemnification may be asserted, at any time after the Closing,
including after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (the
representations and warranties referred to in this clause (b) being referred
to as the " _Fundamental Representations_ "). All covenants and obligations of
Parent, MergerCo, the Surviving Corporation and the Company contained in this
Agreement or in or any other agreements, certificates or other instruments
executed and delivered by Parent, MergerCo, the Surviving Corporation or the
Company in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby shall survive the Closing and continue in effect, and a claim for
indemnification may be asserted, until such covenants and obligations have
been fully performed in accordance with their respective terms.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if prior to the close of business on the last
day of any applicable Claims Period, an

 



67  Indemnifying Party shall have been properly notified of a claim for
indemnity hereunder and such claim shall not have been finally resolved or
disposed of at such date, such claim shall continue to survive and shall
remain a basis for indemnity hereunder until such claim is finally resolved or
disposed of in accordance with the terms hereof.

 

9.5 _Liability Limits_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
except with respect to the Extended Representations and Fundamental
Representations (to which subclauses (i) and (ii) of this _Section 9.5(a)_
shall not apply), (i) the Parent Indemnified Parties shall not make a claim
against the Stockholders or Optionholders for indemnification under _Section
9.1(a)_ hereof for Parent Losses unless and until the aggregate amount of
Parent Losses under _Section 9.1(a)_ hereof exceeds $815,500 (the " _Parent
Threshold_ "), and if such Parent Losses exceed the Parent Threshold, the
Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to the entire amount of all such
Parent Losses, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement; and (ii) the
right of the Parent Indemnified Parties to recover for any Parent Losses
pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)_ hereof shall not exceed $24,375,000.00 (the "
_Cap_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent Indemnified Parties shall
be entitled to recover for, and the Parent Threshold and the Cap shall not
apply to any Parent Losses with respect to any breach of or inaccuracy in any
of the Extended Representations or Fundamental Representations or any claim
against the Stockholders or Optionholders for indemnification under any of
the provisions of _Section 9.1_ other than _Section 9.1(a)_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (x) the aggregate liability of the Stockholders and
Optionholders under this Agreement (including for the avoidance of doubt
_Section 10.6_), any Ancillary Agreement or any other agreements,
certificates or other instruments executed and delivered connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, shall not exceed
the Aggregate Merger Consideration, and in no event shall any Stockholder or
Optionholder be liable for any amount in respect of Parent Losses in excess of
the Aggregate Merger Consideration proceeds actually received by such
Stockholder or Optionholder, (y) no individual Stockholder or Optionholder
shall be liable for any amount in excess of such Stockholders or
Optionholders Allocation Percentage of any particular Parent Loss under this
Agreement (including for the avoidance of doubt _Section 10.6_), any
Ancillary Agreement or any other agreements, certificates or other instruments
executed and delivered in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, and (z) no Stockholder or Optionholder shall be liable
to any Parent Indemnified Party: (A) for the breach by any other Stockholder
or Optionholder of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
of such other Stockholder or Optionholder set forth in this Agreement, any
Ancillary Agreement (or any other agreements, certificates or other
instruments executed and delivered connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby), including, for the avoidance of doubt,
any failure by any such other Stockholder or Optionholder to comply with its
obligations under _Section 6.15_ hereof, (B) if any representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements made by any other Stockholder or
Optionholder in this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement (or any other
agreements, certificates or other instruments executed and delivered
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby) are
ultimately determined to be unenforceable against such other Stockholder or
Optionholder, or if any such agreements, certificates or other instruments
(including any Letter of Transmittal) are ultimately determined not to comply
with any

 



68  applicable Laws, or (C) fraud by any other Person (in which case a claim for
actual fraud may be asserted solely against the Person who committed such
actual fraud and no other Stockholder or Optionholder shall be liable for the
actual fraud committed by such other Person), and notwithstanding anything to
contrary in this Agreement (including Section 9.5(b)), any claim for
indemnification with respect to breaches of any representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements made by a particular Stockholder or Optionholder in
this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement (or any other agreements, certificates
or other instruments executed and delivered connection with this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby), or with respect to any alleged actual
fraud committed by a particular Stockholder or Optionholder, must be asserted
by the Parent Indemnified Parties directly against such particular Stockholder
or Optionholder directly, and not against the Escrow Fund.

(b) Subject to the limitations in _Section 9.5(a)_, all claims for
indemnification for Parent Losses shall be paid __first_ ,_ from the Escrow
Fund until the Escrow Fund is depleted and __then__ by the Stockholders and
Optionholders, severally and not jointly and pro rata in proportion to their
respective Allocation Percentages.

(c) Any material, materiality, "Material Adverse Effect" or "Company Material
Adverse Effect" qualifications in the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements shall be disregarded for purposes of calculating the amount of
Parent Losses hereunder.

 

9.6 _Effect of Third Party Payments_. The amount of an Indemnifiable Loss for
which indemnification is provided in this  _Article IX_ shall be reduced to
take account of any (A) Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party
arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Indemnifiable Losses (a "
_Tax Benefit_ "), (B) by any other amount (including insurance proceeds)
recovered from third parties by the Indemnified Party (or its Affiliates) with
respect to such Indemnifiable Loss (net of the costs of collecting such
payments) (a " _Third Party Payment_ ") or (C) a BP Claims Payment actually
received by an Indemnified Party (net of the costs of collecting such
payments). If an Indemnified Party actually receives a Tax Benefit or Third
Party Payment after payment of any indemnification with respect to such
Indemnifiable Loss under this _Article IX_, then such Indemnified Party shall
pay to the Indemnifying Party, in such case, an amount equal to the lesser of
(x) the amount of such net Tax Benefit or Third Party Payment to the extent
related to such Indemnifiable Loss and (y) the amount paid by the Indemnifying
Party to such Indemnified Party with respect to such Indemnifiable Loss. If an
Indemnified Party actually receives a BP Claims Payment after payment of any
indemnification with respect to any Indemnifiable Loss under this _Article
IX_, then such Indemnified Party shall pay to the Indemnifying Party, in such
case, an amount equal to the lesser of (x) the amount of such BP Claims
Payment and (y) the amount paid by the Indemnifying Party to such Indemnified
Party.

9.7 _Mitigation_. To the extent required by Law, an Indemnified Party shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Losses for which it is
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Article IX_. The Stockholders
and Optionholders (including any officer or director of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries) shall not have any right of contribution, indemnification or
right of advancement from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Parent, or
other Indemnified Parties with respect to any claim hereunder, other than any
right of recovery that may be available to the Stockholders and Optionholders
from an insurer under any insurance policy providing indemnification to
directors and officers.

 



69 9.8 _Effect of Prior Knowledge_. The right to indemnification or any other
remedy based on representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the
Company in this Agreement, or any document, certificate or other instrument
required to be delivered by the Company under this Agreement shall not be
affected by any investigation conducted by any Parent Indemnified Party of
any other Person at any time, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being
acquired) by any Parent Indemnified Party or any other Person at any time,
whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
Closing, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of, or compliance with,
any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

 

9.9 _Exclusive Remedies_. Following the Closing, indemnification pursuant to
this _Article IX_ and _Section 10.6_, as applicable, shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Parties and any Persons claiming by or through any
Party (including the Indemnified Parties) for any matter related to this
Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or any other agreements, certificates or
other instruments executed and delivered in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, except for the ability to apply to any
court of competent jurisdiction for specific performance or injunctive
relief and except in the case of fraud, intentional misrepresentation or
willful misconduct.

ARTICLE X

 

 _TAX MATTERS_

10.1  _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns_. Parent shall prepare or cause
to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the Company
and its Subsidiaries that are required to be filed after the Closing Date.
Parent shall provide Stockholders Representative with a draft of each such
Tax Return that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (or a pro-forma Tax Return
solely related to the Company and its Subsidiaries in the case of any
consolidated, combined, affiliated or unitary Tax Return that includes Parent
or any of its respective Affiliates) at least thirty (30) calendar days prior
to the earlier of the date of filing of such Tax Return or the last date for
timely filing such Tax Return (giving effect to any valid extensions thereof)
accompanied by a statement setting forth the Stockholders and Optionholders
indemnification obligation, if any, pursuant to _Section 10.6_. Each such Tax
Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the past practices of
the Company, unless otherwise required by applicable Law, and Parent shall
make such revisions to such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by
Stockholders Representative within fifteen (15) calendar days of its receipt
of such Tax Return to the extent such comments would not increase Parents
direct or indirect liability for Taxes. Parent shall cause any amounts shown
to be due on such Tax Returns to be timely remitted to the applicable
Governmental Authority and, subject to _Section 9.5(b)_, shall be reimbursed
by the Stockholders and Optionholders to the extent indemnified for such Taxes
pursuant to _Section 10.6_. The reasonable costs of preparing such a Tax
Return shall be apportioned between Parent, on the one hand, and the
Stockholders and Optionholders, on the other hand, based on their

 



70  respective liability under such Tax Return. Parent and Company shall not
take any action, or permit any action to be taken, that may prevent the tax
year of the Company from ending for U.S. federal and state income Tax
purposes at the end of the day on which the Closing occurs. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that 100% of the Net Merger Consideration received by
Stockholders and Optionholders is intended to be treated for income and all
other applicable Tax purposes as consideration paid and received for the
surrender of Company Stock or Stock Options as applicable and that no portion
of the Net Merger Consideration shall be allocated to any non-competition,
non-solicitation or other similar restricted covenant entered into by a
Stockholder or Optionholder in connection with the Merger. The Parties shall
(and shall cause any applicable Affiliates to) (i) file all relevant Tax
Returns in a manner consistent with the foregoing intent and (ii) not take
any position inconsistent with such intent for any Tax purpose. For the
avoidance of doubt, the foregoing restrictions shall not apply to any Partys
treatment of the Net Merger Consideration solely for financial accounting
purposes.

10.2 _Straddle Period_.

 

(a) With respect to any Taxes that are payable with respect to a Straddle
Period, the portion of any such Taxes that shall be treated as attributable
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be:

(i) in the case of Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries that (x) are
based on income or receipts, or (y) imposed in connection with any direct or
indirect sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or personal,
tangible or intangible), deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if
the taxable year ended on (and included) the Closing Date; and

(ii) in the case of all other Taxes (including property Taxes), deemed to be
the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case of such Taxes
determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately
preceding period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the
number of calendar days in the period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire period.

 

(b) In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to a Straddle Period,
the portion of any such Taxes that shall be treated as attributable to a
Post-Closing Tax Period shall be all such Taxes other than the Taxes
attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)_.

 

10.3 _Tax Contests_.

 

(a) If written notice of any inquiry, assessment, audit, contest, action,
suit, investigation, examination, litigation or other similar proceeding with
respect to Taxes (a " _Tax Contest_ ") shall be made in writing by a
Governmental Authority to any of the Parent Indemnified Parties (including the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries) that, if successful, might result in an
indemnity payment pursuant to _Section 10.6_, Parent shall promptly notify
Stockholders Representative in writing of such Tax Contest; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if notice of a Tax Contest is not given to Stockholders
Representative sufficiently promptly then, solely to the extent that the
Stockholders and Optionholders are materially prejudiced as a result thereof,
Parent shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to  _Section 10.6_.

 



71 (b) Stockholders Representative (at the sole cost and expense of
the Stockholders and Optionholders) shall have the right to control all Tax
Contests and may make any decisions in connection with a Tax Contest related
to a taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date, _provided_
that: (i) Stockholders Representative provides written notice of its intent
to assume the defense of such claim within ten (10) Business Days of the
receipt of the notice required under _Section 10.3(a)_, (ii) the
Parent Indemnified Parties may at their own expense fully participate in the
proceedings related to such Tax Contest, (iii) Stockholders Representative
shall keep the Parent Indemnified Parties timely informed with respect to the
commencement, status and nature of such Tax Contest, (iv) Stockholders
Representative shall act in good faith to timely and diligently resolve such
Tax Contest and shall in good faith consider any reasonable comments proposed
by the Parent Indemnified Parties that are related to the defense of such Tax
Contest, and (v) Stockholders Representative shall not settle, compromise or
dispose of such Tax Contest in a manner that may adversely affect the Parent
Indemnified Parties after the Closing Date without the prior written consent
of the Parent Indemnified Parties, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld. In the event Stockholders Representative has not assumed the
defense of such Tax Contest (at the sole cost and expense of the Stockholders
and Optionholders) by providing the notice set forth in (i), above, the Parent
Indemnified Parties may assume the defense of any such Tax Contest and may
defend the same in such manner as it may reasonably deem appropriate,
_provided_ that Parent Indemnified Parties shall not settle, compromise or
dispose of such Tax Contest to the extent it would increase the
indemnification obligations of the Stockholders and Optionholders pursuant
to  _Section 10.6_ hereof without the prior written consent of the
Stockholders Representative, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

 

(c) Parent shall have the right to control all proceedings and may make any
decisions in connection with any Tax Contest related to a Straddle Period,
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the adverse determination of such claim would
be grounds for a claim for indemnity pursuant to _Section 10.6_ hereof, (i)
the Stockholders Representative may at its expense (on behalf of the
Stockholders and Optionholders) fully participate in the proceedings related
to such Tax Contest, (ii) Parent shall act in good faith to timely resolve
such Tax Contest and shall in good faith consider any reasonable comments
related to the defense of such Tax Contest proposed by the Stockholders
Representative, and (iii) Parent shall not settle, compromise or dispose of
such Tax Contest to the extent it would materially increase indemnification
obligations pursuant to _Section 10.6_ hereof without the prior written
consent of the Stockholders Representative, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld.

 

10.4 _Tax Cooperation_. Each Party will provide each other Party with such
information and records as may reasonably be requested by such other Party in
connection with the preparation of any Tax Return or any Tax Contest that
relates to the Company (or the Surviving Corporation) or any of its
Subsidiaries. Such cooperation will include the retention and (upon the other
Partys request) the provision of records and information that are reasonably
relevant to any such Tax Return or proceeding and making Representatives
reasonably available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material

 



72  provided hereunder at the expense of the Party making such request. The
Surviving Corporation and Parent will retain all books and records with
respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries until at least sixty (60) days after the expiration of the
statute or period of limitations of the respective Tax periods. Parent and the
Stockholders Representative further agree, upon request, to use their best
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental
Authority or other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate
any Tax that could be imposed, including with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby.

10.5 _Transfer Taxes_. Any and all sales (including bulk sales), use,
transfer, recording, value added, ad valorem, privilege, documentary, gross
receipts, registration, conveyance, excise, license, stamp or similar Taxes
and fees (collectively " _Transfer Taxes_ ") arising out of, in connection
with or attributable to the transactions effectuated pursuant to this
Agreement shall be paid by the Stockholders Representative. The Stockholders
Representative shall timely and accurately file all necessary Tax Returns and
other documentation with respect to Transfer Taxes (the " _Transfer Tax
Returns_ ") and timely pay the Transfer Taxes. If required by applicable Tax
Law, Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation will join in the execution of any
Transfer Tax Returns.

 

10.6 _Tax Indemnification_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing, each Stockholder and each Optionholder, in
each case, severally and not jointly and pro rata in proportion to their
respective Allocation Percentages, shall indemnify the Parent Indemnified
Parties (including, after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries), and
hold them harmless from and against any Loss attributable to (i) all Taxes
(or the nonpayment thereof) of the Company and its Subsidiaries for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period, (ii) all Taxes of any member of an affiliated,
consolidated, combined or unitary group of which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date, including
pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar
state, local or foreign Law or regulation, (iii) any breach of any
representation or warranty in  _Section 4.15_ (Taxes) (subject to _Article
IX_ (Indemnification)), and (v) any and all Taxes of any Person (other than
the Company and its Subsidiaries) imposed on the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as a transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant to any
Law, rule or regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction
occurring before the Closing; provided, however, that no indemnification shall
be provided for any Taxes taken into account as a Transaction Expense.
Subject to _Section 9.5(b)_, each Stockholder and Optionholder shall
reimburse the Parent Indemnified Parties for any Taxes of the Company or its
Subsidiaries which are the responsibility of such Stockholder or Optionholder
pursuant to this _Section 10.6_ within fifteen (15) Business Days after
payment of such Taxes by any Parent Indemnified Party.

 

(b) The Parent Indemnified Parties right to assert a claim for
indemnification for Taxes pursuant to  _Section 10.6(a)_ shall survive the
Closing and continue in effect until the date sixty (60) days after the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to such
Taxes, taking into account any extensions or waivers thereof. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if prior to the close of business on the last day of any

 



73  applicable period, an Indemnifying Party shall have been properly notified
of a claim for indemnity pursuant to _Section 10.6(a)_ hereof and such claim
shall not have been finally resolved or disposed of at such date, such claim
shall continue to survive and shall remain a basis for indemnity under
_Section 10.6(a)_ until such claim is finally resolved or disposed of in
accordance with the terms hereof.

 

(c) Any indemnification under this Agreement for Losses with respect to Taxes
other than with respect to a breach of any representation or warranty set
forth in Sections 4.15(b), (f), (i) and (k), shall be limited to Taxes
attributable to Pre-Closing Tax Periods.

 

(d) Any payment made to an Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section 10.6_
shall be treated for Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Aggregate Merger
Consideration paid by Parent.

10.7 _Post-Closing Tax Actions_. Unless required by applicable Law, Parent
and the Company shall not amend any Tax Return of the Company with respect to
a Pre-Closing Tax Period, take any action after the Closing on the Closing
Date outside the ordinary course of business, initiate discussions or
examinations with Governmental Authorities regarding Taxes with respect to
Pre-Closing Tax Periods, make any voluntary disclosures with respect to Taxes
for Pre-Closing Tax Periods, change any accounting method or adopt any
convention that shifts taxable income from a Tax period beginning (or deemed
to begin) after the Closing Date to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or shifts
deductions or losses from a Pre-Closing Tax Period to a Tax period beginning
(or deemed to begin) after the Closing Date, in each case, without the prior
written consent of the Stockholders Representative, to the extent any such
action, initiation of discussions or examinations, voluntary disclosure,
change in accounting method or adoption of any convention would adversely
affect indemnification obligations under this Agreement.

10.8 _Tax Dispute Resolution_. With respect to any dispute or a
disagreement relating to Taxes between the Parties, the Parties shall
cooperate in good faith to resolve such dispute between them; but if the
Parties are unable to resolve such dispute, the Parties shall mutually retain
the Accountants and submit the dispute to the Accountants for resolution,
which resolution shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. The
fees and expenses relating to any dispute as to the amount of Taxes owed by
either of the Parties shall be paid by Parent, on the one hand, and the
Stockholders and Optionholders, on the other, in proportion to each Partys
respective liability for the portion of the Taxes in dispute, as determined by
the Accountants, provided that any obligations of the Stockholders
and Optionholders pursuant to this _Section 10.8_ shall be satisfied in
accordance with _Section 9.5(b)_.

action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement may be
brought solely in the state or federal courts of the State of Delaware; (b)

and agrees to, and agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation and Parents
other Subsidiaries to consent and agree to, Goodwin representing the
Stockholders Representative and/or any of the Stockholders and Optionholders
(each, " _Seller Party_ ", and collectively, the " _Seller Parties_ ") after
the Closing, including with respect to disputes in which the interests of the
Seller Parties may be directly adverse to Parent and its Subsidiaries
(including Surviving Corporation and Parents other Subsidiaries), and even
though Goodwin may have represented the Company or the Companys Subsidiaries
in a matter substantially related to any such dispute. Parent further consents
and agrees to, and agrees to cause Surviving Corporation and Parents other
Subsidiaries to consent and agree to, the communication by Goodwin to the
Seller Parties in connection with any such representation of any fact known to
Goodwin arising by reason of Goodwins prior representation of the Company and
the Companys Subsidiaries. In connection with the foregoing, Parent hereby
irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert, and agrees to cause the Surviving
Corporation and Parents other Subsidiaries to irrevocably waive and not to
assert, any conflict of interest arising from or in connection with (i)
Goodwins prior representation of the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries
and (ii) Goodwins representation of the Stockholders Representative and the
Stockholders prior to and after the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
this consent and waiver of the right to assert any conflict of interest is
limited to matters arising in connection with the negotiation of this
Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements, and the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby. Nothing in this _Section 11.14_ shall constitute a waiver of any
attorney-client privilege or any privilege associated with attorney-client
communications or attorney work product with respect to
Goodwins representation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on any
matter (other than Goodwins representation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements, and
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, in a manner that would not
materially prejudice the Companys and any of its Subsidiarys rights and
obligations vis a vis third parties), and does not waive or excuse Goodwin
from complying with applicable rules of professional conduct regarding the
confidentiality of any client information of the Company and its Subsidiaries
other than as it pertains to Goodwins representation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements, and
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

in each case as if such Stockholder and/or Optionholder had personally done
such act, and the Stockholders Representative hereby accepts such
appointment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Stockholders Representative
shall have no obligation to act on behalf of the Stockholders and the
Optionholders, except as expressly provided herein and in the Escrow

of any Stockholder or Optionholder shall not terminate such appointment or the
authority and agency of the Stockholders Representative or the powers,
immunities and rights to indemnification granted to the
Stockholders Representative Group (defined below) hereunder. The power-of-
attorney granted in this _Section 11.15_ and the powers, immunities and
rights to indemnification granted to the Stockholders Representative Group
hereunder: (i) are coupled with an interest and irrevocable and (ii) shall
survive the delivery of an assignment by any Stockholder or Optionholder of
the whole or any fraction of his, her or its interest in the Escrow Fund.

 

(b) Each Stockholder and Optionholder (i) agrees that all actions taken by the

Escrow Agreement. The Stockholders Representative shall be entitled to (i)
rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any statements furnished
to him by any Stockholder and/or Optionholder, Parent, MergerCo, any employee
of the Company, any attorneys, accountants and other third Persons or any
other evidence deemed by the Stockholders Representative to be reliable, and
the Stockholders Representative shall be entitled to act on the advice of
counsel selected by him, (ii) rely upon any signature believed by it to be
genuine, and (iii) reasonably assume that a signatory has proper authorization
to sign on behalf of the applicable Stockholder, Optionholder or other party.

 



79 (c) The Stockholders Representative shall be entitled to retain
counsel acceptable to him and to incur such expenses as the Stockholders
Representative deems to be necessary or appropriate in connection with his
performance of his obligations under this Agreement and the other Ancillary
Agreements, and all such fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses) incurred by the Stockholders Representative shall be borne
by the Stockholders and Optionholders in accordance with their respective
Allocation Percentages.

 

(d) Certain Stockholders and Optionholders have entered into an engagement
agreement with the Stockholders Representative to provide direction to the
Stockholders Representative in connection with the performance of its
services under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (such Stockholders and
Optionholders, including their individual representatives, collectively
hereinafter referred to as the " _Advisory Group_ "). The Stockholders and
Optionholders hereby acknowledge and agree that, to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable law, (i) neither the Stockholders Representative
(together with its members, managers, directors, officers, contractors, agents
and employees) nor any member of the Advisory Group (collectively, the "
_Stockholders  Representative Group_") shall have any liability to the
Stockholders or Optionholders for any acts or omissions taken by the
Stockholders Representative in his capacity as such; and (ii) the
Stockholders and Optionholders waive any fiduciary and other duties that the
Stockholders Representative may owe to the Stockholders and Optionholders in
his capacity as such. The Stockholders and Optionholders hereby agree on a
several, pro rata basis in accordance with their respective Allocation
Percentages, to indemnify the Stockholders Representative Group (in its
capacity as such) against, and to defend and hold the Stockholders
Representative Group (in its capacity as such) harmless from, any and all
Losses of whatever kind which may at any time be imposed upon, incurred by or
asserted against the Stockholders Representative in such capacity in any way
relating to or arising out of his actions or failures to take action pursuant
to this Agreement or any other Ancillary Agreement. Such Losses may be
recovered first, from the Stockholders Expense Amount, second, from any
distribution of the Escrow Fund otherwise distributable to the Stockholders
and Optionholders at the time of distribution, and third, directly from
the Stockholders and Optionholders. The Stockholders and Optionholders
acknowledge that the Stockholders Representative shall not be required to
expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the
exercise or performance of any of its powers, rights, duties or privileges or
administration of its duties.

(e) The Stockholders Representative may resign at any time, and may be
removed by the vote of a majority in interest of the Stockholders and
Optionholders according to each Stockholders and Optionholders pro rata
share. The immunities and rights to indemnification shall survive the
resignation or removal of the Stockholders Representative or any member of
the Advisory Group and the Closing and/or any termination of this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement.

 



80 (f) The provisions of this _Section 11.15_ shall in no way impose
any obligations on Parent, MergerCo or the Company. In particular,
notwithstanding any notice received by Parent, MergerCo or the Company to the
contrary, and absent bad faith or willful misconduct, Parent, MergerCo or the
Company (i) shall be fully protected in relying upon and shall be entitled to
rely upon, and shall have no liability to the Stockholders or Optionholders
with respect to, actions, decisions and determinations of the Stockholders
Representative and (ii) shall be entitled to assume that all actions,
decisions and determinations of the Stockholders Representative are fully
authorized by, and shall be binding upon, all of the Stockholders and
Optionholders.
