ARTICLE 2 
THE MERGER

 



 

Section 2.01. _The Merger._

 



 

(a) On the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with Delaware Law, Merger
Subsidiary shall be merged with and into the Company in the Merger, whereupon,
the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease and the Company shall
be the surviving corporation (the " **Surviving Corporation** ") and shall
continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of Delaware as a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

 



 

(b) Subject to the provisions of Article 9, the closing of the Merger (the "
**Closing** ") shall take place at the offices of OMelveny and Myers LLP, 2765
Sand Hill Road, Menlo Park, California 94025 at 6:00 a.m. Menlo Park,
California time, as soon as possible, but in any event no later than one
Business Day after the date the conditions set forth in Article 9 (other than
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver of those
conditions at the Closing) have been satisfied or, to the extent permissible,
waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefit of such conditions, or
at such other place, at such other time or on such other date as Parent and
the Company may mutually agree consistent with Delaware Law (the date on which
the Closing occurs, the " **Closing Date** ").

 



 

(c) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file a certificate
of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and make all
other filings or recordings required by Delaware Law in connection with the
Merger. The Merger shall become

 



      
 

 



 

effective at such time (the " **Effective Time** ") as the certificate of
merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or
at such later time as may be specified in the certificate of merger).

 



 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set
forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.

 



 

Section 2.02. _Conversion of Shares. _At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof:

 



 

(a) except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(b), Section 2.02(c) or
Section 2.04, each share of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive (x)
$21.75 in cash, without interest (the " **Cash Consideration** ") and (y)
0.2675 of a share of Parent Common Stock (the " **Stock Consideration** " and,
together with the Cash Consideration the " **Merger Consideration** "). As of
the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and each share shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration to be paid in accordance with Section 2.03, without
interest.

 



 

(b) each share of Company Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or owned
by Parent or Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto;

 



 

(c) each share of Company Stock held by any Subsidiary of either the Company
or Parent (other than Merger Subsidiary) immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into such number of shares of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation such that each such Subsidiary
owns the same percentage of the Surviving Corporation immediately following
the Effective Time as such Subsidiary owned of the Company immediately prior
to the Effective Time; and

 



 

(d) each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with
the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and,
together with the shares described in Section 2.02(c), shall constitute the
only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

Section 2.03. _Surrender and Payment._

 



 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an agent reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " **Exchange Agent** ") for the purpose of
exchanging for the Merger Consideration (A) certificates representing shares
of Company Stock (the " **Certificates** ") or (B) uncertificated shares of
Company Stock (the " **Uncertificated Shares** "). Promptly after the
Effective Time (but in no event later than two Business Days after the
Effective Time), Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send,
to each holder of shares of Company Stock at the Effective Time a letter of
transmittal (in a form that was reasonably acceptable to the Company prior to
the Effective Time) and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery
shall

 



      
 

 



 

be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery
of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange
Agent) for use in such exchange.

 



 

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon
(i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by
the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of
Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company
Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share. Until so
surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes
only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. On the Closing Date, at
or promptly following the Effective Time or in the case of payments pursuant
to Section 2.04, when ascertained, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Company
Stock, cash and shares of Parent Common Stock in an amount sufficient to pay
the Merger Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "
**Payment Fund** "). The cash in the Payment Fund shall, pending its
disbursement to the holders of Company Stock, be invested by the Exchange
Agent as directed by Parent or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation in (i) short-term direct obligations of the United States of
America, (ii) short-term obligations for which the full faith and credit of
the United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of
principal and interest, (iii) short-term commercial paper rated the highest
quality by either Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Ratings Services, or (iv) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements
or bankers acceptances of commercial banks reasonably acceptable to the
Company; provided that no such investment or losses shall affect the amounts
payable to such holders of Company Stock and Parent shall promptly replace or
cause to be replaced any funds deposited with the Exchange Agent that are lost
through any investment so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is at all times
maintained at a level sufficient for the Exchange Agent to pay the Merger
Consideration. Earnings from investments, subject to the immediately preceding
proviso, shall be paid to and shall be the sole and exclusive property of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation. Except as contemplated by Section
2.03(e) hereof, the Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 



 

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly
transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 



 

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for
the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures
set forth, in this Article 2.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of
shares of Company Stock two years after the Effective Time shall be returned
to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of
Company Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section
2.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of
the Merger Consideration, in respect of such shares without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any
holder of shares of Company Stock for any amounts paid to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Stock immediately
prior to such time when such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted
by Applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 2.04 in respect of any Appraisal Shares shall be
returned to Parent, upon demand.

 



 

(g) The shares of Parent Common Stock constituting part of the Merger
Consideration shall be in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical
certificate is otherwise required under Applicable Law. No interest shall be
paid or accrued on the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(h) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered share of Company Stock with respect to shares of Parent Common
Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon surrender of such
share of Company Stock until such holder shall surrender such share of Company
Stock in accordance with this Article 2\. After the surrender of any such
share of Company Stock in accordance with this Article 2, such holder thereof
entitled to receive shares of Parent Common Stock shall be entitled to receive
any such dividends or other distributions, without interest thereon, with a
record date after the Effective Time and which theretofore had become payable
with respect to whole shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such holder in
respect of such share of Company Stock.

 



 

Section 2.04. _Appraisal Shares_. Notwithstanding Section 2.02, shares of
Company Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than shares of Company Stock canceled in accordance with Section
2.02(b)) and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of adoption of this
Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who has properly exercised
appraisal rights in respect of such shares in accordance with the DGCL (such
shares being referred to collectively as the " **Appraisal Shares** " until
such time as such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such
holders appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares) shall
not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration but instead
the holders thereof shall be entitled to payment of the appraised value of
such shares in accordance with the DGCL; provided that if, after the Effective
Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such holders
right to appraisal pursuant to the DGCL, such shares of Company Stock shall be
treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.02(a),
without interest thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate formerly
representing such share or

 



      
 

 



 

transfer of such Uncertificated Share, as the case may be. The Company shall
provide Parent prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company
for appraisal of shares of Company Stock, any withdrawal of any such demand
and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to
the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL that relates to such demand, and
Parent shall have the opportunity and right to participate in all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands under the DGCL consistent with
the obligations of the Company thereunder. Except with the prior written
consent of Parent, the Company shall not voluntarily make any payment with
respect to, or voluntarily offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

 



 

Section 2.05. _Company Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each option to purchase
shares of Company Stock outstanding under any Company Stock Plan (a "
**Company Stock Option** ") shall be fully vested and, at the Effective Time,
canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to
the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the
excess, if any, of (A) the Equity Award Merger Consideration, over (B) the
exercise price per Share subject to such cancelled Company Stock Option,
without interest (such amounts payable hereunder, the " **Option Payments**
"). Any such Company Stock Option with respect to which the exercise price per
Share subject thereto is greater than the Equity Award Merger Consideration
shall be cancelled in exchange for no consideration. Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to pay the Option Payments to the holder of the
applicable Company Stock Option at or reasonably promptly after the Effective
Time (but in no event later than three Business Days after the Effective
Time).

 



 

(b) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each award of restricted
stock units with respect to shares of Company Stock granted under a Company
Stock Plan (each, a " **Company RSU** ") that is outstanding and vested
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including those Company RSUs that
become vested by their terms immediately prior to or as of the Effective Time)
(each, a " **Company Vested RSU** ") shall be canceled and converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash equal to (i) the number of shares of
Company Stock subject to such Company Vested RSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Equity Award Merger Consideration (such
amount, the " **Company Vested RSU Merger Consideration** "). Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the Company Vested RSU Merger
Consideration to the holder of the applicable Company Vested RSU at or
reasonably promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than three
Business Days after the Effective Time).

 



 

(c) Effective as of the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is not a Company
Vested RSU (each, a " **Company Unvested RSU** ") shall be assumed by Parent
and converted into that number of restricted stock units of Parent Common
Stock, rounded down to the nearest whole share (" **Converted RSUs** "), equal
to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such
Company Unvested RSU and (y) the Equity Conversion Ratio. Any Converted RSUs
issued pursuant to this Section 2.05(c) shall otherwise be subject to the same
terms and conditions (modified as appropriate to reflect the assumption) as
were applicable

 



      
 

 



 

under such Company Unvested RSU; provided, that all references to the
"Company" in the applicable Company Stock Plans and award agreements will be
references to Parent.

 



 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof administering any Company Stock Plan) shall
adopt such resolutions or take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting,
providing for the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.05. The Company
shall provide that, following the Effective Time, no holder of any Company
Stock Option or Company RSU shall have the right to acquire any equity
interest in the Company or the Surviving Corporation in respect thereof.

 



 

(e) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to
the holder of each Converted RSU appropriate notices setting forth the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such award then held by each such
holder, as adjusted pursuant to this Section 2.05.

 



 

Section 2.06. _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Exchange Agent, Merger
Subsidiary, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant
to this Article 2 such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under any provision of federal, state,
local or foreign Tax law. If the Exchange Agent, Merger Subsidiary, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, withholds any such
amounts and properly pays such amounts over to the appropriate Taxing
Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to Person in respect of which such withholding was made.

 



 

Section 2.07. _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the shares of Company Stock represented by such Certificate, as contemplated
by this Article 2.

 



 

Section 2.08. _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company shall occur, including by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date
during such period, but excluding any change that results from any exercise of
options or the vesting of restricted share units outstanding as of the date
hereof to purchase shares of Company Stock granted under the Companys stock
option or compensation plans or arrangements, the Merger Consideration and any
other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately
adjusted. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class as a result of a
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or
readjustment, or stock dividend or other similar change

 



      
 

 



 

in capitalization, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made
to the Stock Consideration to be delivered pursuant to Section 2.02.

 



 

Section 2.09. _No Fractional Share_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, neither certificates nor scrip for a fractional share of
Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger or pursuant to Section 2.05.
Each holder of shares of Company Stock who otherwise would have been entitled
to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all
shares of Company Stock owned by such holder at the Effective Time to be
converted into Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Article 2) shall be
entitled to receive, from the Exchange Agent in accordance with the provisions
of this Section 2.09, in lieu of such fractional share, an amount of cash
(rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the product
of: (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the Parent Measurement Price. The
parties acknowledge that payment of cash in lieu of issuing certificates or
scrip for a fractional share was not separately bargained-for consideration
but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the
expense and inconvenience to Parent that otherwise would be caused by the
issuance of a fractional share. No such holder shall be entitled to dividends,
voting rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional share.

contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, the
Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholder Meeting (i) after
consultation with Parent, to the extent necessary to ensure that any required
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is provided to the
Companys stockholders within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the
Company Stockholder Meeting, (ii) as otherwise required by Applicable Law or
(iii) if as of the time for which the Company Stockholder Meeting is scheduled
as set forth in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, there are insufficient shares
of Company Stock represented (in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholder Meeting. Subject
to Section 6.03, the Board of Directors of the Company shall (A) recommend

Section 6.03. _Company Acquisition Proposals_.

 



 

(a) Subject to Section 6.03(b), Section 6.03(c) Section 6.03(d) and Section
6.03(f), (i) the Company shall not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, investment
bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors retained by the Company or
its Subsidiaries (collectively, " **Company Representatives** ") not to,
directly or indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or
encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal, (B) enter into or
participate in any discussions or negotiations with, or furnish any non-public
information or access relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to,
any Third Party with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or
proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal
or (C) enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar
agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal and (ii) except as otherwise
provided in this Section 6.03, the Board of Directors of the Company shall not
fail to make and shall not withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify, or resolve
to or publicly propose to withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation, or approve, endorse or
recommend or publicly propose to approve, endorse or recommend, an Acquisition
Proposal (any of the foregoing in this clause (ii), an " **Adverse
Recommendation Change** "; provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, none of
(1) actions contemplated by Section 6.03(a) or 6.03(b), (2) the determination
by the Board of Directors in accordance with this Section 6.03 that an
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or (3) the delivery by
the Company of the notices to Parent required by this Section 6.03 shall, in

 



      
 

 



 

and of itself, constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change). The Company will
be liable for any breach of this Section 6.03 by any Company Representatives
as if such breach had been committed by the Company. The Company shall
immediately cease any discussions or negotiations with any person with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that could reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal and promptly after the date hereof
terminate access to any Third Party or its Representatives to any electronic
data room maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and request that any such person
promptly return or destroy all confidential information concerning the Company
and its Subsidiaries to the extent permitted pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement with such person. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall not release
any Third Party from, or waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant
permission under, (x) any standstill provision in any agreement to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or (y) any confidentiality
provision in any agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party except, with respect to clause (x), (A) to the extent that prior to
the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval the Board of Directors of the
Company concludes in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, the failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law or (B) to the extent that any standstill provision in any
agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party includes
a "fallaway" or other similar provision that causes such standstill provision
to be released, waived, modified or amended as a result of the Company
entering into this Agreement in and of itself.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding Section 6.03(a), if at any time prior to obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval, the Company or any of the Company
Representatives has received an unsolicited written, bona fide Acquisition
Proposal from any Third Party that did not result from a breach of this
Section 6.03 and that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, then
the Company, directly or indirectly through the Company Representatives, may,
on the terms provided in this Section 6.03, (i) engage in negotiations or
discussions with such Third Party and its Representatives related to such
written Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) furnish to such Third Party or its
Representatives non-public information and access relating to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement;
provided, that, prior to or concurrently with the time it is made available to
such Third Party, the Company shall make available to Parent (including by
notifying Parent that such information has been posted to an electronic data
room to which Parent and its Representatives have access) any information
relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries that is made available to such
Third Party.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, if the Company and the
Company Representatives are in material compliance with Section 6.03, and if
the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel and taking into account the
discussions with Parent outlined below, that the failure to take such action
would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law, the Board of Directors of the Company may, at any time prior
to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, make an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to any fact, event, change, development or
set of circumstances that materially affects the business, financial

 



      
 

 



 

condition or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole that (A) does not involve or relate to an Acquisition Proposal or
to Parent or any of its Affiliates or its or their respective Representatives
and (B) (i) is not known and was not reasonably discoverable or foreseeable to
the Board of Directors of the Company as of the date hereof or (ii) the
consequences of which were not reasonably discoverable or foreseeable to the
Board of Directors of the Company as of the date hereof (an " **Intervening
Event** "); provided that in each case: (x) the Company provides Parent three
(3) Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action,
which notice shall include reasonable detail with respect to any such facts,
events, changes, developments or set of circumstances underlying such action;
(y) during such three (3) Business Day period described in clause (x), the
Company considers in good faith and discusses with Parent and its
Representatives (if Parent desires to discuss) any adjustments or
modifications to the terms of this Agreement; and (z) at the end of the three
(3) Business Day period described in clause (x), the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel (after taking into account any adjustments or
modifications to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent
during the period described in clause (x)) that the failure to take such
action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary
duties under Applicable Law, provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, any
determination by the Company Board of Directors after the date of this
Agreement that the per share Merger Consideration payable in the Merger is not
sufficient shall not in and of itself constitute an Intervening Event and in
no event shall such Intervening Event result from a change in the trading
price of the Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock (it being understood
that the underlying facts giving rise or contributing to such change in the
trading price of Company Common Stock may be taken into account in determining
whether there has been an Intervening Event). The Company shall notify Parent
in writing within one (1) Business Day after any Adverse Recommendation
Change.

 



 

(d) In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors
of the Company from (i) complying with Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the 1934 Act with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal; or (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of the
Company if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary
duties under Applicable Law; provided, that in the case of the foregoing
clauses (i) or (ii), any such action taken or statement made that contains an
Adverse Recommendation Change shall be subject to the provisions of this
Section 6.03.

 



 

(e) The Company shall (i) notify Parent orally and in writing promptly (but in
no event later than forty-eight (48) hours) after receipt by the Company of
any Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall identify the Third Party making,
and the material terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal and
(ii) keep Parent reasonably informed promptly (but in no event later than
forty-eight (48) hours) after any material developments, discussions or
negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal and shall provide to Parent
promptly (but in no event later than forty-eight (48) hours) after receipt
thereof of copies of all proposed transaction agreements or proposal letters
or similar materials (and any attachments, annexes, exhibits, schedules and
other similar materials in connection therewith) sent or provided to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that describe any material terms or
conditions of any Acquisition Proposal.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, at
any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, if the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel and in response to an unsolicited, written, bona fide
Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of Section 6.03, that
(i) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (ii) the
failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach
of its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, then the Board of Directors of
the Company may make an Adverse Recommendation Change or cause the Company to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i) (provided that,
substantially concurrently with such termination the Company enters into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal (a " **Company
Acquisition Agreement** ")); provided, that, prior to taking any such action
the Company has complied in all material respects with this Section 6.03(f).
Further, the Board of Directors of the Company shall not make an Adverse
Recommendation Change (or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
10.01(d)(i)) pursuant to this Section 6.03(f) in response to an Acquisition
Proposal, unless (i) the Company promptly notifies Parent in writing, at least
three Business Days before taking such action, of the determination of the
Board of Directors of the Company that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal and of its intention to take such action, attaching the most
current version of the proposed agreement under which such Superior Proposal
is proposed to be consummated and the identity of the Third Party making such
Superior Proposal (it being understood that each time any material revision or
material amendment to the terms of the Acquisition Proposal determined to be a
Superior Proposal is made, the initial three (3) Business Day period shall be
extended for an additional two (2) Business Days after notification of such
material revision or material amendment in accordance with Section 6.03(e) and
this Section 6.03(f) to Parent) and (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company
(A) shall have considered in good faith and discussed with Parent (if Parent
desires to discuss) any adjustments or modifications to this Agreement
proposed by Parent and (B) shall have determined in good faith, at the end of
the period set forth in clause (i) and after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal would
continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if any adjustments or modifications
to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent were to be given
effect. For the avoidance of doubt, any change to the financial or other
material terms of a Superior Proposal shall require a new notice to Parent and
a new two (2) Business Day period and discussions process under this Section
6.03(f).

 



 

(g) The Board of Directors of the Company shall reaffirm publicly the Company
Board Recommendation to the Companys stockholders within ten (10) Business
Days of Parents written request to do so, made at any time that an
Acquisition Proposal has been made to the Company, has been publicly announced
and is pending; provided that Parent shall be entitled to make such a written
request for reaffirmation, and the Board of Directors of the Company shall
only be required to make such reaffirmation, on only one occasion with respect
to any one Acquisition Proposal (with each material revision or material
amendment to the price or terms of such Acquisition Proposal triggering one
additional Parent right to request reaffirmation).

 



 

(h) As used in this Agreement:

 



 

(i) " **Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement** " means a confidentiality
agreement that contains provisions that are no less favorable in the aggregate
to the

 



       
 

 



 

Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that
such confidentiality agreement may contain a less restrictive or no standstill
restriction, in which case the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to be
amended to contain only such less restrictive provision, or to omit such
provision, as applicable.

 



 

(ii) " **Superior Proposal** " means a bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal
for at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Stock or at least
a majority of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
that the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, and taking
into account all relevant terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal
(including the timing and likelihood of consummation of such proposal, taking
into account all legal, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal), would
be reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms and that,
if consummated, would result in a transaction more favorable to the Companys
stockholders (solely in their capacity as such) from a financial point of view
than the Merger (taking into account any irrevocable written proposal by
Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.03(f)).

 



 

Section 6.04. _Access to Information. _From the date hereof until the
Effective Time and subject to Applicable Law and the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Company shall during normal business hours (a) give to Parent,
its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized Representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours to the offices, properties,
books and records of such party and (b) instruct its employees, counsel,
financial advisors, auditors and other authorized Representatives to
reasonably cooperate with Parent in such access; provided, however, that
Parent will not be permitted to conduct any environmental sampling or analysis
without the Companys prior written consent. Any access pursuant to this
Section 6.04 shall be conducted under supervision of appropriate personnel of
the Company and in such manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the
conduct of the business of the Company.

Section 7.04. _Indemnification and Insurance. _Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, as
follows:

 



 

(a) All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, and rights to
advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any Person
who is or prior to the Effective Time becomes, or has been at any time prior
to the date of this Agreement, a present or former director, officer, employee
or agent (including as a fiduciary with respect to an employee benefit plan)
of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
predecessors (each, an " **Indemnified Person** ") as provided in the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, the Amended and Restated Bylaws
of the Company, the organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the Company
or any indemnification agreement, or other written agreement between the
Company and an Indemnified Person containing any express indemnification
provisions, between such Indemnified Person and the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall survive the Merger and, for a period of six (6) years,
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would
adversely affect any right thereunder of any such Indemnified Person.

 



 

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation (jointly and severally) shall indemnify and hold harmless all
Indemnified Persons to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware Law and any
other Applicable Law in the event of any threatened or actual claim, suit,
action, proceeding or investigation (a " **Claim** "), whether civil, criminal
or administrative, based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in
part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that the Indemnified Person is or
was a director (including in a capacity as a member of any board committee),
officer, employee or agent of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective predecessors or (ii) this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, whether in any case asserted or arising
before, on or after the Effective Time, against any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or
investigation to each Indemnified Person to the fullest extent permitted by
Law upon receipt of any undertaking required by Applicable Law), judgments,
fines and amounts paid in settlement of or in connection with any such
threatened or actual Claim. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall
settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened
or actual Claim for which indemnification could be sought by an Indemnified
Person hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Person from all liability arising
out of such Claim or such Indemnified Person otherwise consents in writing to
such settlement, compromise or consent. Parent and the

 



      
 

 



 

Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with an Indemnified Person in the
defense of any matter for which such Indemnified Person could seek
indemnification hereunder.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, or if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of
the directors and officers liability coverage of the Companys existing
directors and officers insurance policies and the Companys existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a claims reporting or
discovery period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time with
respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to the
Effective Time (including claims with respect to the adoption of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) with
terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less
favorable than the coverage provided under the Companys existing policies;
provided that the Company shall give Parent a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the selection of such "tail" insurance policy and the Company
shall give good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent with
respect thereto; and provided that the premium per annum payable for such
"tail" insurance policy shall not exceed 300% of the amount per annum the
Company paid in its last full fiscal year (such maximum amount, the "
**Maximum Tail Premium** ") and if the cost for such "tail" insurance policy
exceeds the Maximum Tail Premium, then the Company shall obtain a policy with
the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Tail
Premium.

 



 

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys of all
or substantially all of its property and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the applicable
successor, assign or transferee shall assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 7.04 (including this Section 7.04(d)).

 



 

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.04 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under
Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law, under any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise.
These rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to
benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person. The obligations
of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 7.04 shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of
any Indemnified Person without the consent of such Indemnified Person.

 



 

(f) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys
fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Person in enforcing the
indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 7.04.

 



 

Section 7.05. _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) With respect to employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately
before the Effective Time who continue in employment with Parent or one of its
Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation) ("
**Company Employees** "), Parent

 



      
 

 



 

shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to (i) for a period of twelve
(12) months following the Closing (or, if earlier, the termination of the
applicable Company Employees employment with Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and their Affiliates), provide base salaries or base wage levels
at least equal to what the Company Employees were receiving from the Company
or its Subsidiaries immediately before the Closing, and (ii) for a period from
and after the Effective Time until December 31, 2017 (or, if earlier, the
termination of the applicable Company Employees employment with Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and their Affiliates), provide health and welfare
benefits that, taken as a whole, are substantially comparable in the aggregate
to the health and welfare benefits provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries
to the Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time (or, if more
favorable to the Company Employee, substantially comparable in the aggregate
to the health and welfare benefits provided to similarly situated employees of
Parent and its Affiliates).

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 7.05(a), from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
assume, honor and continue until December 31, 2017, or, if sooner, until all
obligations thereunder have been satisfied, all of the Companys employment,
severance, bonus, incentive compensation, commission, change in control,
retention and termination plans and agreements, in each case, as in effect at
the Effective Time, including with respect to any payments, benefits or rights
arising as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either
alone or in combination with any other event), without any amendment or
modification, other than any amendment or modification required to comply with
Applicable Law or with the consent of the applicable Company Employee.

 



 

(c) With respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates with respect to any Company
Employee (including any vacation, paid time-off and severance plans), for
purposes of determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits, vesting
and benefit accruals, such Company Employees service with the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (as well as service with any
predecessor employer of the Company or any such Subsidiary, to the extent
service with the predecessor employer is recognized by the Company or such
Subsidiary under the comparable Company Employee Plans) shall be treated as
service with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their Affiliates to the
extent such service was recognized under the corresponding Company Employee
Plan in which such Company Employee participated prior to the Closing;
provided, however, that such service need not be recognized to the extent that
such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits or for purposes
of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan (whether or not tax-
qualified), supplemental retirement plan or similar plan or arrangement.

 



 

(d) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to waive, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates to waive, any pre-
existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and
waiting periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by the Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates in which any Company Employee
(or the dependents of any eligible employee) will be eligible to participate
from and after the Effective Time. Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to recognize, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or
any of its Affiliates to recognize, the dollar amount of all payments incurred
by each Company Employee (and his or her eligible

 



      
 

 



 

dependents) under any applicable Company Employee Plan during the calendar
year in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such years
deductible, co-payment limitations and out-of-pocket maximums under the
relevant welfare benefit plans in which such Company Employee will be eligible
to participate from and after the Effective Time.

 



 

(e) The Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions necessary and
appropriate to terminate: (a) all Company Employee Plans that contain a cash
or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code
(the " **401(k) Plans**"), with such termination of the 401(k) Plans to be
effective no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date; (b)
all Company Employee Plans set forth on Schedule 7.05(d); provided, however,
that Parent may, in its sole and absolute discretion, make an election to
sponsor and maintain any 401(k) Plan by providing the Company with written
notice of such election at least three Business Days before the Effective
Time. With respect to each Company Employee Plan to be terminated as described
in this Section 7.05(e), the Company shall deliver to Parent, no later than
the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, evidence that the Companys
board of directors has validly adopted resolutions to terminate such Company
Employee Plan (the form and substance of which shall be subject to review and
approval of Parent). If the distributions of assets from the trust of a 401(k)
Plan that is terminated are reasonably anticipated to trigger liquidation
charges, surrender charges or other fees to be imposed upon the account of any
participant or beneficiary of such terminated plan or upon the Company or plan
sponsor, then the Company shall take such actions as are necessary to
reasonably estimate the amount of such charges and fees and provide such
estimate in writing to Parent at least three Business Days prior to the
Effective Time.

 



 

(f) Nothing in this Section 7.05 shall, or shall be construed so as to, (i)
create any right in any Person, including any employees, former employees, any
participant in any Company Employee Plan or any dependent or beneficiary
thereof, (ii) create any right to continued employment or other service with
Parent, Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates, (iii)
modify or amend the provisions of a Company Employee Plan or require Parent or
any of its Affiliates to adopt or maintain, or restrict Parent or any of its
Affiliates from terminating, employee benefit plan or arrangement of Parent or
any of its Affiliates, (iv) prevent or restrict in any way the right of Parent
to terminate, reassign, promote or demote any employee or other service
provider of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof at any time following the
Closing, or to change any terms and conditions of the employment or other
service of such service providers at any time following the Closing, or (v)
create any third party rights in any such current or former service provider
of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof (or any beneficiary or dependent
thereof). For purposes of clarity, however, nothing in this section is
intended to adversely affect any independent contractual right of a Company
Employee without his/her consent thereto.

 



 

Section 7.06. _No Impeding Actions_ Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary
agrees that, from the date hereof to the Effective Time, it shall not, and it
shall cause its Subsidiaries not to: (a) take any action that is intended to
or would reasonably be likely to result in any of the conditions to
consummating the Merger becoming incapable of being satisfied or (b) take any
action or fail to take any action which would, or would be reasonably likely
to, individually or in the aggregate, prevent, materially delay or materially
impede the ability of Parent or Merger

 



      
 

 



 

Subsidiary to consummate the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
under this Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.07. _Filing of Form S-8_. Parent agrees to file no later than ten
(10) Business Days after the Effective Time a registration statement on Form
S-8 (or any successor form) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable with respect to Converted RSUs and shall use all reasonable efforts
to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration
statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses
contained therein) for so long as the Converted RSUs assumed or granted in
accordance with this Agreement remain outstanding. Parent shall at times
ensure that there will remain a sufficient number of unissued shares of Parent
Common Stock to meet its share issuance obligations in connection with the
Company Unvested RSUs. Parent shall also use its reasonable best efforts to
take any action required to be taken by it under any applicable state
securities laws in connection with the conversion of the Company Unvested RSUs
into Converted RSUs, and the Company shall furnish to Parent any information
concerning the Company and holders of the Company RSUs as may be reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with any such action. Parent shall take all
action necessary to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issuable
upon the vesting of the Company Unvested RSUs, to be approved for listing on
Nasdaq at or prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

ARTICLE 8 
COVENANTS OF PARENT, MERGER SUBSIDIARY AND THE COMPANY

 



 

Section 8.01. _Efforts._

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company and
Parent shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, cooperate with
each other and use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under Applicable Law to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable,
including (i) obtaining all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from
Third Parties, (ii) preparing and filing as promptly as practicable after the
date hereof with any Governmental Authority all documentation to effect all
necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions
of information, financial statements, records, applications and other
documents, in each case, to the extent applicable, (iii) obtaining and
maintaining all approvals, consents, registrations, Permits, authorizations,
licenses, waivers and other confirmations required to be obtained from any
Governmental Authority that are necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) defending or contesting any action, suit
or proceeding challenging this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby and (v) executing and delivering any additional instruments necessary
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and
the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, make (i) an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 5 Business Days after the
date hereof), (ii) each other appropriate filing required pursuant to any
Foreign Antitrust Law (collectively with the HSR Act, the " **Antitrust Laws**
") as

 



      
 

 



 

promptly as practicable (and in any event within 15 Business Days after the
date hereof), (iii) comply at the earliest practicable date with any request
under any of the Antitrust Laws for additional information, documents, or
other materials received by each of them or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates from any Governmental Authority in respect of such
filings or such transactions and (iv) cooperate with each other in connection
with any such filing (including, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law,
providing copies of all such documents to the non-filing parties prior to
filing and considering all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested in connection therewith), and in connection with resolving any
investigation or other inquiry of any Governmental Authority under any of the
Antitrust Laws with respect to any such filing or any such transaction. Each
such party shall use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to each other all
information required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant
to any Applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each such party shall as promptly as practicable inform the other
parties hereto of any oral communication with, and provide copies of written
communications with, any Governmental Authority regarding any such filings or
any such transaction. No party hereto shall independently participate in any
formal meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of any such filings,
investigation, or other inquiry without giving the other parties hereto prior
notice of the meeting and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Authority, the opportunity to attend and/or participate. Subject to Applicable
Law, the parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one another in
connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any
party hereto relating to proceedings under any of the Antitrust Laws. Any
party may, as it deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any
competitively sensitive material provided to the other parties under this
Section 8.01 as "outside counsel only". Such materials and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of the
recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers, or directors of the recipient, unless express written permission is
obtained in advance from the source of the materials. The parties shall take
reasonable efforts to share information protected from disclosure under the
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense privilege or
any other privilege pursuant to this section so as to preserve any applicable
privilege.

 



 

(c) The Company and Parent shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to, cooperate with each other and use their reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions and use reasonable best efforts to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable
Law to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as practicable, including (subject to the last sentence
of this paragraph): (i) selling or otherwise disposing of, or holding separate
and agreeing to sell or otherwise dispose of, assets, categories of assets or
businesses of the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries; (ii)
terminating existing relationships, contractual rights or obligations of the
Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries; (iii) terminating any
venture or other arrangement; (iv) creating any relationship, contractual
rights or obligations of the Company or Parent or their respective
Subsidiaries or (v) effectuating any other change or restructuring of the
Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries (and, in each case, to
enter into agreements or stipulate to the entry of an order or decree or file
appropriate applications with the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of
Justice, or any attorney general of any state of the United States in
connection with any of the foregoing) (each a " **Divestiture Action** "). In
the event Parent agrees to effect a Divestiture Action, the Company

 



      
 

 



 

and its Subsidiaries shall, upon request by Parent, consent and/or agree as
needed in order to effectuate a Divestiture Action to the extent such action
relates to the Company or its Subsidiaries or its or their businesses or
assets. Further Parent and the Company shall not take, and shall not permit
their respective Affiliates to take any action (including the acquisition by
it or its Affiliates of any interest in any Person that derives revenues from
products, services or lines of business similar to the Companys products,
services or lines of business) if such action would make it materially more
likely that there would arise any impediments under any Antitrust Law that may
be asserted by any Governmental Authority to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable. In the event that
any action is threatened or instituted challenging the Merger as violative of
any Antitrust Law, Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, defend and
contest or otherwise resolve the action (with the Companys cooperation). In
the event that any permanent or preliminary injunction or other order is
entered or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered in any proceeding that
would make consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would restrain, enjoin or
otherwise prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
to vacate, modify or suspend such injunction or order so as to permit such
consummation prior to the End Date. The Company shall cooperate with Parent
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to assist Parent in resisting and
reducing any Divestiture Action. Parent shall, in a manner consistent with the
terms and the objective of this Agreement, control and lead all actions,
strategy and communications, and make all determinations as to the appropriate
course of action and the timing of all actions and communications, with
respect to Antitrust Laws, Governmental Authorities and all other related
matters, including dealings with Governmental Authorities and any Divestiture
Actions or litigation under Antitrust Laws; provided, however, that Parent
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law and Governmental Authority, (i) without causing undue delay or
materially impeding Parents ability to satisfy its obligations in this
Section 8.01(c), consult with the Company in advance of any meeting,
teleconference or other communication with such Governmental Authority and
provide the Company with an opportunity to attend or participate in such
meeting, teleconference or other communication, (ii) afford the Company an
opportunity to review any written advocacy materials to be submitted to such
Governmental Authority in advance of the submission thereof, and (iii) furnish
the Company with copies of all written materials received by or on behalf of
such party from such Governmental Authority, in each case to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law. The Company shall not, without Parents prior
written consent or request, communicate, offer, negotiate, or agree or bind
itself or Parent, with any Governmental Authority or other third party
regarding any Divestiture Action. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, however, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall
propose, consent to, or take any Divestiture Action without prior written
consent of Parent, and neither Parent, nor the Company, nor any of their
respective Affiliates shall be obligated to consent or commit to any
Divestiture Action unless (A) the parties are informed by the Federal Trade
Commission, the Department of Justice, or any attorney general of any state of
the United States that such actions are demanded and required as a condition
to providing approval or resolving proceedings under any Antitrust Law and (B)
such actions, considered individually or in the aggregate, would not result in
a Detriment. For the purposes of this Section 8.01(c), an action so demanded
and required by a Governmental Authority would be deemed to result in a "
**Detriment** " if such action, considered individually or

 



      
 

 



 

in the aggregate with all other actions so demanded and required by a
Governmental Authority would have an adverse impact that is material to (a)
the reasonably anticipated benefits to Parent of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (b) the business of the Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, or (c) the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, provided,
further that in no event shall Parent be required to license any of the
Intellectual Property of Parent, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries.

 



 

Section 8.02. _Form S-4; Proxy Statement/Prospectus._

 



 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, (i)
Parent shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC, the Form S-4 with
respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in the Merger and (ii)
Parent and the Company shall cooperate in preparing and cause to be filed with
the SEC the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Each of Parent and the Company shall
use reasonable best efforts to (A) have the Form S-4 declared effective under
the 1933 Act as promptly as practicable after such filing and (B) to keep the
Form S-4 effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and other
transactions contemplated hereby. Each of Parent and the Company shall furnish
all information concerning itself, its Affiliates and the holders of its
shares to the other and provide such other assistance as may be reasonably
requested by the other in connection with any such action and the preparation,
filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus.
Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other upon the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Form S-4 or Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and
shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other
with copies of all correspondence between it and its Representatives, on one
hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and all written comments with respect to
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 received from the SEC and
advise the other party on any oral comments with respect to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 received from the SEC. Each of the
Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as
promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond
as promptly as practicable to any comment from the SEC with respect to the
Form S-4. Prior to filing the Form S-4 (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or mailing the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate and provide the other
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such documents or response
in advance (including the proposed final version of such document or
response). If required by Applicable Law, the Company shall disseminate to its
stockholders, as promptly as reasonably practicable, any amendment of or
supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus required as a result of such
comments.

 



 

(b) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval,
any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which, in the
reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent, should be set forth in an
amendment of, or a supplement to, any of the Form S-4 or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, so that any of such documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the party which

 



       
 

 



 

discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties, and the
Company and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any
necessary amendment of, or supplement to, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or
the Form S-4 and, to the extent required by Law, in disseminating the
information contained in such amendment or supplement to stockholders of the
Company.

 



 

(c) The Company shall take, in accordance with applicable Law and the Company
Organizational Documents, all action necessary to mail the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to the Companys stockholders as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective by the SEC and to convene
the Company Stockholder Meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable after
the date of mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (including setting an
appropriate record date for the Company Stockholder Meeting). Unless and until
an Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred in accordance with Section 6.03,
the Company shall, through the Company Board of Directors, make the Company
Board Recommendation, include such Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and solicit and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
the Company Stockholder Approval, and shall not submit any other proposal to
such holders in connection with the Company Stockholder Meeting without the
prior written consent of Parent.

 



 

Section 8.03. _Public Announcements. _Subject to Section 6.03, and unless and
until an Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred, Parent and the Company
shall consult with each other before issuing any press release, having any
communication with the press (whether or not for attribution), making any
other public statement or scheduling any press conference or conference call
with investors or analysts with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and, except in respect of any such press release,
communication, other public statement, press conference or conference call as
may be required by Applicable Law or any listing agreement with or rule of any
national securities exchange or association, shall not issue any such press
release, have any such communication, make any such other public statement or
schedule any such press conference or conference call prior to such
consultation.

 



 

Section 8.04. _Further Assurances. _At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger
Subsidiary, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take

party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any
right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written
agreement or other communication). Delivery of an executed counterpart of a
signature page to this Agreement by facsimile, ".pdf" format or scanned pages

Section 11.12. _Severability. _If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions

Section 11.13. _Specific Performance. _The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be
an adequate remedy would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not
perform their obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including
failing to take such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in
accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The
parties acknowledge and agree that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in the courts described in Section 11.08 without proof of
damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled under this Agreement at law or in equity, and the right of
specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would
have entered into this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto agrees that it
will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that the other parties hereto have an adequate
remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy
for any reason at law or in equity. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in accordance with this Section 11.13 shall not be required to
provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction. If, prior to the End Date, any party brings any suit, action or
proceeding, in each case in accordance with Section 11.08, to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof,
the End Date shall automatically be extended by (A) the amount of time during
which such suit, action or proceeding is pending, plus twenty (20) Business
Days or (B) such other time period established by the court presiding over
such suit, action or proceeding, as the case may be.
