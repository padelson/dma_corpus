</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Ladies and Gentlemen:
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be an &#147;affiliate&#148; of
Remington Oil and Gas Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the &#147;<U><B>Company</B></U>&#148;), as the term
&#147;affiliate&#148; is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c)&nbsp;and (d)&nbsp;of Rule&nbsp;145 of the Rules and
Regulations (the &#147;<U><B>Rules and Regulations</B></U>&#148;) of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
&#147;<U><B>Commission</B></U>&#148;) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (together with the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, the &#147;<U><B>Securities Act</B></U>&#148;). Pursuant to the terms of the
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of January&nbsp;22, 2006 (the &#147;<U><B>Merger Agreement</B></U>&#148;), by and
among the Company, Cal Dive International, Inc., a Minnesota corporation (&#147;<U><B>Cal Dive</B></U>&#148;), and
the Company will be merged with and into a to be formed, wholly owned subsidiary of Cal Dive
(&#147;<U><B>Sub</B></U>&#148;), the Company will be merged with and into Sub, in consideration of cash and shares
of common stock, without par value, of Cal Dive (&#147;<U><B>Cal Dive Common Stock</B></U>&#148;), with Sub as the
surviving corporation (the &#147;<U><B>Merger</B></U>&#148;).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I represent, warrant, and covenant to Cal Dive and Sub that in the event I receive any Cal
Dive Common Stock as a result of the Merger:
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of any Cal Dive Common Stock
acquired by me in the Merger in violation of the Securities Act.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. I have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and discussed their requirements
and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of Cal
Dive Common Stock, to the extent I felt necessary, with my counsel or counsel for Cal Dive and Sub.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C. I have been advised that the issuance of Cal Dive Common Stock to me pursuant to the Merger
has been or will be registered with the Commission under the Securities Act on a Registration
Statement on Form&nbsp;S 4. I have also been advised, however, that, because at the time the Merger
will be submitted for a vote of the stockholders of the Company, I may be deemed to be an affiliate
of the Company (without anything in this letter agreement being an admission of such fact), the
distribution by me of any Cal Dive Common Stock acquired by me in the Merger will not be registered
under the Securities Act and that I may not sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of any Cal Dive
Common Stock acquired by me in the Merger unless (i)&nbsp;such sale, transfer, or other disposition has
been registered under the Securities Act, (ii)&nbsp;such sale, transfer, or other disposition is made in
conformity with the volume and other limitations of Rule&nbsp;145 promulgated by the Commission under
the Securities Act, or (iii)&nbsp;in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to Cal Dive such sale,
transfer, or other disposition is otherwise exempt from registration under the Securities Act.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D. I understand that Cal Dive is under no obligation to register under the Securities Act the
sale, transfer, or other disposition by me or on my behalf of any Cal Dive Common Stock acquired by
me in the Merger or to take any other action necessary in order to make an exemption from such
registration available.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E. I also understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to Cal Dive&#146;s transfer
agent with respect to Cal Dive Common Stock and that there will be placed on the certificates (or
in the case of shares issued in book-entry form, an appropriate notation of the records of Cal
Dive&#146;s transfer agent) for any Cal Dive Common Stock acquired by me in the Merger, or any
substitutions therefore, a legend stating in substance:
</DIV>



<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 6%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;The shares represented by this certificate were issued in a
transaction to which Rule&nbsp;145 under the Securities Act of 1933 may
apply. The shares represented by this certificate may only be
transferred in compliance with the requirements of the Securities
Act of 1933, including, without limitation, Rule&nbsp;145 promulgated
thereunder, or pursuant to an applicable exemption therefrom.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F. It is understood and agreed that the legend set forth in paragraph E above shall be removed
by the delivery of substitute certificates (or change in notation on the records of Cal Dive&#146;s
transfer agent) without such legend if the undersigned shall have delivered to Cal Dive a copy of a
letter from the staff of the Commission, or an opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Cal Dive, to the effect that such legend is not required for purposes of the
Securities Act.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that (a)&nbsp;Cal Dive will supply me with any information necessary to enable me to
make routine sales of any Cal Dive Common Stock acquired by me in the Merger as may be permitted by
and in accordance with the provisions of Rule&nbsp;144 under the Securities Act or any similar rule of
the Commission hereafter applicable, and (b)&nbsp;Cal Dive will comply with all requirements of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the
&#147;<U><B>Exchange Act</B></U>&#148;), with respect to the filing by Cal Dive of annual, periodic and other
reports on a timely basis in a manner sufficient to allow sales of any such Cal Dive Common Stock
by me during the two year period following the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement)
if such sales are otherwise permitted by law or regulation. Upon my written request, Cal Dive
shall furnish me with a written statement representing that it has complied with the reporting
requirements enumerated in Rule&nbsp;144(c)(1), or if Cal Dive is not then subject to Section&nbsp;13 or
15(d) of the Exchange Act, that it has made publicly available the information concerning Cal Dive
required by Rule&nbsp;144(c)(2).
