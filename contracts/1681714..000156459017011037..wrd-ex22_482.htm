with the Properties, including those described on Exhibit A-6; but excluding,
in all instances, any such interest or right to the extent transfer is
restricted by Third Party agreement, a Governmental Body or applicable Law
(unless and until the necessary consents or approvals to transfer have been
obtained pursuant to Section 4.6 or unless as otherwise set forth in this
Agreement) (subject to such exclusion, the "Surface Agreements");

 

(g)All equipment, machinery, tools, fixtures and owned rolling stock,
including (i) trailers, rolling test equipment, rolling machinery and other
portable wheeled equipment, and other tangible personal property and
improvements and (ii) manifolds, well equipment, casing, tubing, pumps,
motors, fixtures, machinery, compression equipment, flow lines, processing and
separation facilities, pads, materials, SCADA equipment and transmitters,
telecommunications equipment, field radio telemetry and associated
frequencies, pressure transmitters and central processing equipment, in each
case, that is owned by any Seller and that is used or held for use in
connection with the ownership or operation of the Properties (the
"Equipment");

  (h)All Hydrocarbons (or proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons) produced from
or attributable to the Properties after the Effective Time and the Stored
Hydrocarbons, together with Imbalances associated with the Properties, which
would otherwise accrue for the Sellers' benefit;

 

(i)The Records;

 

(j)To the extent assignable or re-issuable into Purchaser's name (which
reissuance will be at Purchaser's sole cost and expense), all permits,
approvals, allowances, emission or pollution credits, or authorizations by, or
filings with, any Governmental Body and all water rights relating to the
construction, ownership or operation of the Assets, including those described
on Exhibit A-7 (the "Permits");

 

(k)All trade credits, account receivables, receivables, take-or-pay amounts
receivable, and other receivables to the extent attributable to the Assets and
attributable to periods after the Effective Time, excluding any items (i)
related to the Retained Seller Obligations or (ii) to which Sellers are
otherwise entitled pursuant to Section 2.4; and

 

(l)All rights, claims and causes of action of Sellers against Third Parties
arising under or with respect to any Asset, excluding items related to the
Retained Seller Obligations.

 

Section 2.3Excluded Assets

 

. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Assets shall not include, and
there is excepted, reserved and excluded from this transaction, the Excluded
Assets. In the event Purchaser comes into possession of any Excluded Assets,
it shall deliver such Excluded Assets, as promptly as possible, to or as
directed by Sellers. Notwithstanding any term of this Agreement to the
contrary, to the extent any Asset is excluded hereunder pursuant to Sections
4.2(b)(iii), 4.6(b), 4.6(c), 5.1(b)(iii), 5.1(d) or 8.1(a), Sellers shall
retain any Assets directly associated therewith. To the extent Purchaser
reasonably requires use of any such Asset for the continued operation of the
Assets (in the manner operated by Sellers prior to Closing), Sellers shall
grant Purchaser such use upon reasonable request.

 

Section 2.4Effective Time; Proration of Costs and Revenues

 

.

 

(a)If Closing occurs, Purchaser shall be entitled to (without duplication of
any amounts paid pursuant to Section 3.4 or otherwise) (i) all production of
Hydrocarbons from or attributable to the Properties after 12:01 a.m., Central
Time, on January 1, 2017 (the "Effective Time") and all products and proceeds
attributable thereto and (ii) all other income, proceeds, receipts and credits
earned with respect to the Assets after the Effective Time, and Purchaser
shall be responsible for, and entitled to any refunds with respect to, all
Property Costs incurred after the Effective Time.

 

(b)Sellers shall be entitled to (without duplication of any amounts paid
pursuant to Section 3.4 or otherwise) (i) all production of Hydrocarbons from
or attributable to the Properties prior to and at the Effective Time and all
products and proceeds attributable thereto and (ii) all other income,
proceeds, receipts and credits earned with respect to the Assets prior to and
at the Effective Time, and such Sellers shall be responsible for, and entitled
to any refunds with respect to (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Tax
benefit attributable to any reduction in severance (or impact) Taxes that may
be realized after the Effective Time but that results from payments or
production for periods prior to or at the Effective Time), all Property Costs
and

  other costs attributable to the ownership and operation of the Assets or the
production of Hydrocarbons therefrom incurred prior to or at the Effective
Time.

 

(c)With respect to Property Costs paid by AEPO on behalf of Third Parties,
regardless of whether such Property Costs were paid before, at or after the
Effective Time, AEPO shall be entitled to retain all proceeds of cash calls,
billings and other funds received as reimbursement in respect of such Property
Costs. With respect to Property Costs paid by AEPO prior to the Closing on
behalf of Third Parties and attributable to periods after the Effective Time
that remain unreimbursed (the "Unreimbursed Third Party Property Costs") as of
the date the final settlement statement is prepared pursuant to Section 10.4,
regardless of whether such Property Costs were paid before, at or after the
Effective Time, Purchaser shall pay to AEPO an amount equal to the amount of
all such Unreimbursed Third Party Property Costs and Purchaser shall be
entitled to all receivables with respect thereto and all proceeds of cash
calls, billings and other funds received as reimbursement in respect thereof.
As part of the final settlement statement, AEPO shall provide reasonable
supporting documentation in respect of such unreimbursed Property Costs and
include the payment to be made by Purchaser pursuant to this Section 2.4(c) in
the calculation of the final settlement statement.

 

(d)Should any Party receive any proceeds or other income after the Closing to
which another Party is entitled under this Section 2.4, such receiving Party
shall fully disclose, account for and promptly remit same. Similarly, should
Purchaser pay any Property Costs after the Closing for which Sellers are
responsible under this Section 2.4, Sellers shall reimburse the Purchaser
promptly after receipt of an invoice, accompanied by proof of payment, with
respect to such Property Costs. If Sellers receive any invoice for Property
Costs after the Closing for which Purchaser is responsible under this Section
2.4, Sellers shall promptly forward such invoice to Purchaser. Each Party
agrees that this Section 2.4(d) shall not be interpreted to require a Party to
remit or reimburse, as the case may be, any such amounts more frequently than
once per calendar month, unless the amounts owed exceed $100,000.00.

 

(e)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.4,
following the third anniversary of the Closing Date, Sellers shall have no
further entitlement to amounts earned from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced
from or attributable to the Assets and other income earned with respect to the
Assets and no further responsibility for Property Costs (other than Property
Taxes specifically allocated to Sellers as provided in Article 13) incurred
with respect to the Assets.

 

Section 2.5Procedures

 

.

 

(a)For purposes of allocating production and accounts receivable with respect
thereto under Section 2.4, gaseous Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be "from or
attributable to" the Properties when they pass through the delivery point
sales meter closest to the well. Sellers shall utilize reasonable
interpolative procedures to arrive at an allocation of production when exact
meter readings or gauging and strapping data is not available. Sellers shall
provide to Purchaser evidence of all meter readings and all gauging and
strapping procedures conducted on or about the Effective Time in connection
with the Assets, together with all data necessary to support any estimated
allocation, for purposes of establishing the adjustment to the Unadjusted
Purchase Price pursuant to Section 3.4. The terms "earned" and "incurred"
shall be interpreted in

  accordance with GAAP and Council of Petroleum Accountants Society ("COPAS")
standards, and expenditures which are incurred pursuant to an operating
agreement, unit agreement or similar agreement shall be deemed incurred based
on when services are rendered, when the goods are delivered or when the work
is performed.

 

(b)Purchaser shall handle all joint interest audits and other audits of
Property Costs covering the period for which Purchaser is in whole or in part
responsible under Section 2.4; provided, however, that Purchaser shall not
agree to any adjustments to previously assessed costs for which any Seller is
liable, or any compromise of any audit claims to which any Seller would be
entitled, without the prior written consent of Sellers, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Each Party shall
provide the other Party with a copy of all applicable audit reports and
written audit agreements received by such Party or its Affiliates and relating
to periods for which any such Party is partially responsible.

 

(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, right-of-way
fees and other Property Costs (other than delay rentals, lease extension
payments, lease bonus payments and/or insurance premiums due prior to the
Effective Time which shall be the sole responsibility of Sellers and Property
Taxes) that are paid periodically shall be prorated based on the number of
days in the applicable period falling before and the number of days in the
applicable period falling on or after the day of the Effective Time. Property
Taxes shall be prorated as set forth in Section 13.2.

 

ARTICLE 3 
PURCHASE PRICE

 

Section 3.1Unadjusted Purchase Price

 

. The purchase price for the Assets shall be an aggregate amount equal to
$505,000,000.00 (the "Unadjusted Purchase Price"), which shall be adjusted as
provided in Section 3.4; provided, however, that the portion of the Unadjusted
Purchase Price payable to the Admiral Sellers (as set forth on Schedule 3.1)
at the Closing (the "Stock Purchase Price") shall be paid, delivered and
issued in the form of Purchaser Common Stock, subject to adjustment pursuant
to Section 3.4. AEPO, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be paid the portion
of the Unadjusted Purchase Price (as set forth on Schedule 3.1) at Closing in
cash (the "Cash Purchase Price"), subject to adjustment pursuant to Section
3.4. The number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock payable to the Admiral
Sellers at Closing shall be calculated pursuant to the Stock Issuance
Agreement and such shares shall bear an aggregate value equal to the Stock
Purchase Price, subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 3.4.

 

Section 3.2Deposit

 

. Within one Business Day after the Execution Date, Purchaser shall pay to
AEPO on behalf of Sellers, in immediately available funds by wire transfer
into an account designated by AEPO prior to the date hereof, an amount equal
to 10% of the Unadjusted Purchase Price (the "Deposit"). The Deposit shall be
applied against the Cash Purchase Price at the Closing or be distributed in
accordance with the terms of Section 11.3, as applicable.

 

Section 3.3Allocation of Unadjusted Purchase Price

 

. 

 

(a)Within sixty days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and
deliver to Sellers, using and based upon the best information available to
Purchaser, a schedule along with

  reasonably detailed supporting documentation, setting forth an allocation of
the Unadjusted Purchase Price and any other items properly treated as
consideration for U.S. federal income Tax purposes among the classes of assets
provided for in Treasury Regulation § 1.338-6, in accordance with Section 1060
of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (and any
similar provisions of state, local or foreign Law, as appropriate) and, to the
extent allowed by applicable Law, in a manner consistent with the Allocated
Values (the "Preliminary Allocation Schedule"). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, the "Allocated Value" for (i) any Well equals
the portion of the Unadjusted Purchase Price allocated to such Well on Exhibit
A-2; (ii) any Undeveloped Lease equals the portion of the Unadjusted Purchase
Price allocated to such Undeveloped Lease on Exhibit A-3; and (iii) any Unit
equals the portion of the Unadjusted Purchase allocated to such Unit on
Exhibit A-8. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
Sellers have accepted such Allocated Values for purposes of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby but make no representation or warranty as
to the accuracy of such values.

 

(b)As soon as reasonably practicable, but not later than forty-five (45) days
following receipt of the Preliminary Allocation Schedule, Sellers shall
deliver to Purchaser a written report containing any changes that Sellers
proposes to be made in such schedule (and specifying the reasons therefore in
reasonable detail). The Parties shall undertake to agree on a final schedule
no later than fifteen (15) Business Days subsequent to the receipt by
Purchaser of Seller's proposed changes (such schedule, if any, the "Final
Allocation Schedule").

 

(c)If Sellers and Purchaser reach an agreement with respect to the Final
Allocation Schedule in accordance with Section 3.3(b), (i) Purchaser and
Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to update the Final
Allocation Schedule in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code following any
adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement, and
(ii) Purchaser and Sellers shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, report
consistently with the Final Allocation Schedule in all Tax Returns; provided,
however, that no Party shall be unreasonably impeded in its ability and
discretion to negotiate, compromise and/or settle any Tax audit, claim or
similar proceedings in connection with such allocation.

 

Section 3.4Adjustments to Unadjusted Purchase Price

 

. All adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be made (x) without
duplication (in this Agreement or otherwise), (y) in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and, to the extent not inconsistent with this Agreement, in
accordance with GAAP and COPAS as consistently applied in the oil and gas
industry in Texas and (z) only with respect to matters, (A) in the case of
Section 3.4(b)(iii), for which valid notice is given on or before the Defect
Claim Date and (B) in all of the other cases set forth in Section 3.4(a) or
Section 3.4(b), identified on or before the last day of the three year
anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Cut-off Date"). Any adjustments to the
Unadjusted Purchase Price hereunder shall be made between the Cash Purchase
Price and the Stock Purchase Price, in the same ratio as the Cash Purchase
Price bears to the Stock Purchase Price (the "Consideration Ratio"); provided
that any adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price as a result of a Title
Defect affecting only the Admiral Sellers' interest in the Assets will reduce
the applicable Admiral Sellers' portion of the Stock Purchase Price on a
dollar-for-dollar basis (with no adjustment to the Cash Purchase Price) and
any adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price as a result of a Title Defect
affecting only AEPO's interest in the Assets will reduce the Cash Purchase
Price on a dollar-for-dollar basis (with no adjustment to the Stock Purchase

  Price). Without limiting the foregoing, the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall
be adjusted as follows, resulting in the "Adjusted Purchase Price":

 

(a)The Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward by the following
amounts:

 

(i)an amount equal to all Property Costs that are (A) incurred after the
Effective Time but paid by any Seller and (B) incurred prior to the Effective
Time but allocable to post-Effective Time periods pursuant to Section 2.5(c)
and paid by Sellers, but excluding, in each case, any amounts previously
reimbursed to Sellers by Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.4(d);

 

(ii)an amount equal to all proceeds and other income to which Sellers are
entitled pursuant to Section 2.4(b) to the extent that such amounts have been
received by Purchaser and not remitted or paid to any Seller;

 

(iii)an amount equal to any Tax benefit as of the Cut-off Date that can
reasonably be determined by Sellers as attributable to any reduction in
severance Taxes that may be realized after the Effective Time but that results
from payments or production for periods prior to or at the Effective Time;

 

(iv)to the extent that proceeds for the associated production prior to and at
the Effective Time have not been received by or remitted to any Seller, an
amount equal to the aggregate volumes of Hydrocarbons stored in stock tanks or
other storage as of the Effective Time (the "Stored Hydrocarbons"), in each
case, from or attributable to the ownership and operation of the Assets or the
production of Hydrocarbons therefrom multiplied by $48.08 for oil;

 

(v)any amount equal to any upward adjustment for Imbalances as determined in
accordance with the procedures set forth on Schedule 3.4; and

 

(vi)any other amount provided for elsewhere in this Agreement or otherwise
agreed upon in writing by the Parties as an upward adjustment to the
Unadjusted Purchase Price.

 

(b)The Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by the following
amounts:

 

(i)an amount equal to all Property Costs and other costs attributable to the
ownership and operation of the Assets or the production of Hydrocarbons
therefrom that are incurred prior to the Effective Time but paid by Purchaser,
but excluding any amounts previously reimbursed to Purchaser by Sellers
pursuant to Section 2.4(d);

 

(ii)an amount equal to all proceeds and other income to which Purchaser is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.4(a), to the extent that such amounts have been
received by Sellers and not remitted or paid to Purchaser;

 

(iii)any undisputed (as agreed upon by the Parties or determined by the Title
Expert) Title Defect Amounts for Title Defects determined pursuant to Section
4.2 (as offset by undisputed Title Benefit Amounts for Title Benefits
determined pursuant to Section 4.3) or the

  undisputed (as agreed upon by the Parties or determined by the Environmental
Expert) Remediation Amounts for any Adverse Environmental Conditions
determined pursuant to Section 5.1;

 

(iv)the amount of (A) any reduction in value of the Assets caused by Casualty
Losses, as set forth in Section 4.7(a), or (B) the Allocated Value for any
portion of the Assets taken in condemnation or under right of eminent domain,
as set forth in Section 4.7(b);

 

(v)an amount equal to the Allocated Value, if any, of any Assets excluded from
this transaction pursuant to Section 4.2(b)(iii), Section 4.6(b), Section
4.6(c), Section 5.1(b)(iii), Section 5.1(d) or Section 8.1(a);

 

(vi)any amount equal to any downward adjustment for Imbalances as determined
in accordance with the procedures set forth on Schedule 3.4; and

 

(vii)any other amount provided for elsewhere in this Agreement or otherwise
agreed upon in writing by the Parties as a downward adjustment to the
Unadjusted Purchase Price.

 

Section 3.5Parent Guaranty.

 

(a) Simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, Purchaser shall cause
WildHorse Resource Development Corporation to deliver to Sellers the Parent
Guaranty.

 

ARTICLE 4 
TITLE MATTERS; CONSENTS

 

Section 4.1Sellers' Title

 

. Except for the special warranty of title set forth in the Conveyances and
the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 6.5, 6.6, 6.10, 6.11,
6.13 and 6.14 (the "Specified Representations"), Sellers make no, and
expressly disclaim any, warranty or representation, express, implied,
statutory or otherwise, with respect to Sellers' title to any of the Assets
and Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees that, subject to Section 4.5,
Purchaser's sole remedy for any defect of title, including any Title Defect,
with respect to any of the Assets, (a) on or before the Defect Claim Date,
shall be as set forth in Section 4.2 and (b) from and after the Defect Claim
Date (without duplication), shall be pursuant to the special warranty of title
set forth in the Conveyances and/or Section 12.2(b)(iv) for breaches of the
Specified Representations of Sellers; provided, however, that Purchaser
further acknowledges and agrees that Purchaser shall not be entitled to
protection under the special warranty of title provided in the Conveyances for
any Title Defect reported under this Article 4. The special warranty of title
contained in the Conveyances shall be subject to the terms and provisions of
this Section 4.1 (mutatis mutandis). If, after the Closing, Purchaser provides
written notice of a breach of the special warranty of title in the Conveyances
to any breaching Seller, such Seller shall have a reasonable opportunity to
cure such breach (not to exceed ninety days following notice of such breach).
In any event, the recovery on a breach of Sellers' special warranty of title
contained in the Conveyances shall not exceed, in the aggregate, the Allocated
Value of the affected Asset. Disputes regarding the existence of a breach of
the special warranty of title contained in the Conveyances, the amount by
which the affected Asset is adversely affected by

  such breach or the cure of such breach shall be resolved in accordance with
Section 14.3 of this Agreement.

 

Section 4.2Title Defects

 

.

 

(a)To assert a claim of a Title Defect, Purchaser must deliver a claim notice
to Sellers (each, a "Title Defect Notice") at or prior to 5:00 p.m. Central
Time on the Defect Claim Date. Each Title Defect Notice shall be in writing
and shall include (i) a description of, and a reasonable explanation of
Purchaser's basis for, the alleged Title Defect, (ii) identification of each
Well, Unit or Undeveloped Lease (each, a "Title Defect Property"), in each
case, that is adversely affected by the Title Defect, (iii) the Allocated
Value of each Title Defect Property, (iv) all documents in Purchaser's
possession or control (or references thereto if such documents are also in
Seller's possession or in the applicable county records) upon which Purchaser
relies for its assertion of a Title Defect, including, at a minimum,
supporting documents available to Purchaser (or Purchaser may include
references thereto if any such documents are also in any Seller's possession
or in the applicable county records), to the extent reasonably necessary for
Sellers to verify the existence of the alleged Title Defect, (v) the identity
of the Seller(s) affected by such Title Defect (based on the reasonable belief
of Purchaser); and (vi) the amount by which Purchaser reasonably believes the
Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property is reduced by the alleged Title
Defect calculated in accordance with Section 4.2(c), and the computations
therefor. To be valid, each Title Defect Notice must be substantially in
compliance with each of the requirements of the foregoing sentence.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary and
subject to Purchaser's rights under the special warranties of title contained
in the Conveyances and Section 12.2(b)(iv) for breaches of the Specified
Representations, Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived its right to assert
any Title Defects for which a Title Defect Notice in substantial compliance
with each of the requirements set forth in Section 4.2(a)(i) - (vi) above has
not been delivered on or before the Defect Claim Date.

 

(b)Remedies. To the extent Purchaser delivers any valid Title Defect Notices
prior to the Defect Claim Date, then, subject to the Defect Threshold and
Aggregate Defect Deductible, Sellers may, on or before 5:00 p.m. Central Time
five Business Days following the Defect Claim Date (the "Remedy Period"):

 

(i)elect to cure such Title Defect, which curative work may extend up to 90
days from and after the Closing (the "Post-Closing Cure Period");

 

(ii)notify Purchaser that Sellers do not intend to cure such Title Defect, in
which case the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Title Defect
Amount, as agreed upon by the Parties attributable to such Title Defect; or

 

(iii)elect to retain the entirety of any Well or Undeveloped Lease that is
adversely affected by such Title Defect (including the directly associated
Assets reasonably necessary to own, use or operate such Well or Undeveloped
Lease, as the case may be) in the event that the Title Defect Amount with
respect to such Title Defect exceeds ninety percent (90%) of the Allocated
Value of the affected Well or Undeveloped Lease, in which case the affected
Well or Undeveloped Lease and directly associated Assets will be become
Excluded Assets, and the Unadjusted Purchase Price will be reduced by an
amount equal to the Allocated

  Value of such Well or Undeveloped Lease, in each case, including the Allocated
Value of any other directly associated Assets so excluded;

 

provided, however, that if Sellers fail to elect a remedy prior to the end of
the Remedy Period, Sellers shall be deemed to have elected the remedy
described in Section 4.2(b)(i); provided further that, in the case of Sellers'
election (or deemed election) of the remedies described in Section 4.2(b)(i)
or Section 4.2(b)(ii), the Title Defect Properties shall be conveyed to
Purchaser at the Closing in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. For
any Title Defect with respect to which Sellers and Purchaser agree on the
validity of the asserted Title Defect and the Title Defect Amount and for
which (1) Sellers have elected the remedy described in Section 4.2(b)(ii) or
(2) Sellers have elected the remedy described in Section 4.2(b)(i) and such
Title Defect is not waived by Purchaser or cured by Sellers prior to the
expiration of the Post-Closing Cure Period, then, in each case, subject to the
Defect Threshold and the Aggregate Defect Deductible, the Unadjusted Purchase
Price will be reduced by the Title Defect Amount of such Title Defect;
provided, however, that any downward adjustments made pursuant to clause (2)
of this sentence shall be made and accounted for at the time of the final
calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant to Section 10.4. An
election by Sellers to attempt to cure a Title Defect shall be without
prejudice to their rights under Section 4.4 and shall not constitute an
admission against interest or a waiver of Sellers' rights to dispute the
existence, nature or value of, or cost to cure, the alleged Title Defect or
the adequacy of any Title Defect Notice or any curative action. No reduction
shall be made to the Unadjusted Purchase Price to the extent Sellers have
cured any asserted Title Defect. To the extent Sellers partially cure any
asserted Title Defect, any reduction to the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall
equal the portion of the Title Defect Amount relating to the uncured portion
of the subject Title Defect.

 

(c)The "Title Defect Amount" resulting from a Title Defect shall be the amount
by which the Allocated Values of the adversely affected Title Defect
Properties are reduced as a result of the existence of such Title Defect and
shall be determined in accordance with the following methodology, terms and
conditions:

 

(i)if Purchaser and Sellers agree on the Title Defect Amount, that amount
shall be the Title Defect Amount;

 

(ii)if the Title Defect is a lien, encumbrance or other charge that is
undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the
amount necessary to be paid to remove the Title Defect from Sellers' interest
in the affected Title Defect Property;

 

(iii)with respect to any Well, if the Title Defect reflects a discrepancy
between (A) Sellers' actual Net Revenue Interest for the affected Well and (B)
the Net Revenue Interest stated in Exhibit A-2 for such Well, and there is a
corresponding proportionate decrease in the Working Interest for such Well
below that stated in Exhibit A-2 for such Well, then the Title Defect Amount
shall be an amount equal to the product of the Allocated Value of such Well
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the Net
Revenue Interest decrease and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue
Interest stated in Exhibit A-2 for such Well; provided, however, that with
respect to any discrepancy in a Reversionary Net Revenue Interest, the Title
Defect Amount shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect the likely economic
effect of the asserted Title Defect over the life of the affected Well;

  (iv)with respect to any Unit or Undeveloped Lease, if the Title Defect
represents a discrepancy between (A) Sellers' actual Net Acres for the
affected Unit or Undeveloped Lease and (B) the Net Acres stated on Exhibit A-8
or A-3, as applicable for such Unit or Undeveloped Lease, then the Title
Defect Amount shall be an amount equal to the product of the Allocated Value
of such Unit or Undeveloped Lease multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the amount of such Net Acre decrease and the denominator of which is
the Net Acres stated in Exhibit A-8 or A-3, as applicable, for such Unit or
Undeveloped Lease;

 

(v)with respect to any Undeveloped Lease, if the Title Defect is based on
Sellers' having an actual Net Revenue Interest in such Undeveloped Lease less
than the Net Revenue Interest Floor (or the Net Revenue Interest set forth on
Exhibit A-3 for such Lease, as the case may be), then the Title Defect Amount
shall be an amount equal to the product of Allocated Value of such Undeveloped
Lease multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by which
the Net Revenue Interest Floor (or the Net Revenue Interest set forth on
Exhibit A-3 for such Lease, as the case may be) exceeds such actual Net
Revenue Interest and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest
Floor (or the Net Revenue Interest set forth on Exhibit A-3 for such Lease, as
the case may be); 

 

(vi)if the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden or
charge upon or other defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type
not described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) above, the Title Defect
Amount shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the
Title Defect Property, the portion of the Title Defect Property adversely
affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect, the
potential economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the Title
Defect Property, the likelihood and timing of potential capital expenditures
over the life of the Title Defect Property, the values placed upon the
asserted Title Defect by Purchaser and Sellers and such other factors as are
necessary to make a proper evaluation;

 

(vii)the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in any other
Title Defect Amount hereunder or of any amounts for which Purchaser otherwise
receives credit in the calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price and shall be
calculated in a manner that is net to Sellers' interest in the applicable
Title Defect Property; and

 

(viii)notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 4 or any
instrument or undertaking delivered pursuant hereto (except in the case of
Title Defect Amount(s) under Section 4.2(c)(ii) attributable to Title Defects
arising from clause (g) of the definition of Defensible Title), the aggregate
Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title Defects upon any
Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of such Title
Defect Property.

 

(d)If Sellers and Purchaser cannot reach an agreement on alleged Title Defects
and Title Defect Amounts by (i) the Closing Date or (ii) solely with respect
to any disputes over the adequacy of Sellers' post-Closing Date curative work,
the end of the Post-Closing Cure Period, the provisions of Section 4.4 shall
apply.

  (e)The Parties acknowledge that the Leases set forth on Exhibit A-1 and
Exhibit A-3 are divided into tracts. Exhibit A-3 sets forth a separate
Allocated Value for each subdivision of each Undeveloped Lease. Reference to
the term "Lease" throughout this Agreement will be interpreted to refer to
each subdivision of a Lease reflected as a separate line item on Exhibit A-1
and Exhibit A-3, regardless of whether any particular line item represents an
entire Lease or only a particular tract of such Lease. By way of example
only, if an Undeveloped Lease is subdivided into four tracts, then Exhibit A-1
and Exhibit A-3 will identify all the subdivisions of such Undeveloped Lease
using four separate line items. If such Undeveloped Lease is affected by a
Title Defect, the "Title Defect Property" will be the specific tracts
affected, not necessarily the entire Undeveloped Lease.

 

(f)Exhibit A-8 identifies, in part, Sellers' interest in the existing Units
and the Leases included within each existing Unit. Following the Execution
Date, upon request, Sellers will use reasonable efforts to assist Purchaser in
identifying the specific number of Net Acres contributed by each Lease to each
Unit.

 

Section 4.3Title Benefits

 

.

 

(a)Sellers have the right, but not the obligation, to deliver to Purchaser
prior to the Closing Date a notice (a "Title Benefit Notice") in writing that
includes (i) a description of, and a reasonable explanation of Sellers' basis
for, the alleged Title Benefit, (ii) identification of each Well or
Undeveloped Lease affected by such Title Benefit (each a "Title Benefit
Property"), (iii) the Allocated Value of each Title Benefit Property, (iv) all
documents in Sellers' possession or control upon which Sellers rely for their
assertion of a Title Benefit or references to such documents to the extent the
documents are in Purchaser's possession, including, at a minimum, supporting
documents available to Sellers to the extent reasonably necessary for
Purchaser to verify the existence of the alleged Title Benefit and (v) the
amount by which Sellers reasonably believe the Allocated Value of each Title
Benefit Property is increased by such Title Benefit and the computations
therefor. To be valid, each Title Benefit Notice must be substantially in
compliance with each of the requirements of the foregoing sentence.

 

(b)With respect to each Title Benefit Property affected by Title Benefits
reported under Section 4.3(a), any reduction to the Unadjusted Purchase Price
pursuant to Section 4.2 or Section 4.4 for a Title Defect will be offset by an
amount (the "Title Benefit Amount") equal to the increase in the Allocated
Value for the Title Benefit Properties affected by such Title Defect, as
determined pursuant to Section 4.3(c). Any such offset shall be made and
accounted for in the final calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant
to Section 10.4. For the avoidance of doubt, the Unadjusted Purchase Price
may be adjusted for any Title Benefits only as an offset to any Unadjusted
Purchase Price adjustments for Title Defects.

 

(c)The Title Benefit Amount for any Title Benefit shall be calculated using
methodology substantially similar to the methodology used to calculate Title
Defect Amounts pursuant to Section 4.2(c) (mutatis mutandis), with such
adjustments as are necessary to permit the Parties to use such calculations
and methodologies to determine the amount by which the Allocated Value of the
affected Title Benefit Property is increased as a result of the existence of
such Title Benefit.

  (d)If Sellers and Purchaser cannot reach an agreement on alleged Title
Benefits and Title Benefit Amounts by the Closing, the provisions of Section
4.4 shall apply.

 

Section 4.4Title Disputes

 

.

 

(a)Sellers and Purchaser shall attempt to agree on all asserted Title
Defects/Title Benefits and Title Defect Amounts/Title Benefit Amounts
(including, in each case, the adequacy of notices thereof or any curative
actions with respect thereto) prior to the Closing Date. If, by (i) the
Closing Date or (ii) solely with respect to any disputes over the adequacy of
Sellers' post-Closing Date curative work, the end of the Post-Closing Cure
Period, Sellers and Purchaser are unable to agree on an alleged Title
Defect/Title Benefit or Title Defect Amount/Title Benefit Amount, including
the adequacy of any notice thereof or any curative actions with respect
thereto (the "Disputed Title Matters") such disputes, and only such disputes,
shall be exclusively and finally resolved in accordance with the following
provisions of this Section 4.4. Any Asset subject to a Disputed Title Matter
shall be conveyed to Purchaser at the Closing, and a cash amount equal to the
alleged Title Defect Amounts/Title Benefit Amounts shall be placed in escrow
with the Escrow Agent, and any adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price
resulting from the expert determination shall be reflected in the final
calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant to Section 10.4. Any
initiation of an expert determination of any Disputed Title Matter shall be in
accordance only with the following subsections (b) through (k).

 

(b)No later than ten Business Days following the (i) the Closing Date or (ii)
solely with respect to any disputes over the adequacy of Sellers' post-Closing
Date curative work, the end of the Post-Closing Cure Period, either Party may
submit any Disputed Title Matter to expert determination pursuant to this
Section 4.4 by written notice to the other Party, together with all reasonably
supporting documentation in its possession or control regarding such Disputed
Title Matter. If a Party does not submit a notice of expert determination to
the other Party in accordance with this Section 4.4(b), such Party shall be
deemed to have waived all such Disputed Title Matters, which shall be deemed
conclusively resolved in accordance with the Title Defect Notice or Title
Benefit Notice or subsequent correspondence between the Parties.

 

(c)By not later than ten Business Days after a Party's receipt of a written
description of any Disputed Title Matters, such Party shall provide to the
initiating Party a written response setting forth its position with respect to
such Disputed Title Matters, together with all reasonably supporting
documentation in its possession or control.

 

(d)There shall be a single title expert (the "Title Expert"), who shall be an
attorney with at least 15 years of experience examining oil and gas titles in
the region of Texas in which the Assets are located. Within two Business Days
following the initiating Party's receipt of the other Party's response as
described in Section 4.4(c), Sellers and Purchaser shall each exchange lists
of three acceptable, qualified title experts, and shall certify that each
potential title expert set forth on its list has not, and such title expert's
firm has not, represented the certifying Party or any of its Affiliates within
the previous two years. Within two Business Days following the exchange of
lists of acceptable title experts, Sellers and Purchaser shall select by
mutual agreement the Title Expert from their original lists of three
acceptable title experts. If no such agreement is reached, the Houston office
of the American Arbitration Association shall select a title expert from the
original lists provided by Sellers and Purchaser to serve as the Title Expert.

  (e)Within two Business Days following the selection and engagement of the
Title Expert, the Parties shall submit to the Title Expert one copy of (i)
this Agreement, with specific reference to this Section 4.4, the other
applicable provisions of this Article 4 and any defined terms in Appendix A
relevant to this Article 4, (ii) the initiating Party's written description of
the Disputed Title Matters provided pursuant to Section 4.4(b), together with
the supporting documents that were provided to the other Party and (iii) the
other Party's written response to the initiating Party's written description
of the Disputed Title Matters provided pursuant to Section 4.4(c), together
with the supporting documents that were provided to the initiating Party. The
Title Expert shall resolve the Disputed Title Matters based only on the
foregoing submissions. Neither Purchaser nor Sellers shall have the right to
submit additional documentation to the Title Expert or to demand discovery on
the other Party. 

 

(f)The Title Expert, once appointed, shall have no ex parte communications
with any Party concerning the determination required hereunder. All
communications between any Party and the Title Expert shall be conducted in
writing, with copies sent simultaneously to the other Parties in the same
manner, or at a meeting in Houston, Texas, to which the representatives of all
Parties have been invited and of which such Parties have been provided at
least five days' written notice.

 

(g)The Parties will instruct the Title Expert to make his determination by
written decision within 15 Business Days following submission of the Disputed
Title Matters to the Title Expert pursuant to Section 4.4(e), which shall be
final and binding upon the Parties, without right of appeal. In making the
determination, the Title Expert shall be bound by the rules set forth in this
Article 4. The Title Expert may consult with and engage disinterested Third
Parties to advise the Title Expert but shall disclose to the Parties the
identities of any such consultants. Any such consultant shall not have worked
as an employee of or consultant for either Party or its Affiliates during the
two-year period preceding the expert determination and shall not have any
financial interest in the dispute. The written finding of the Title Expert
will set forth the Title Expert's finding, if applicable, as to (A) whether
the subject Title Defect exists or has been cured and, subject to the
following sentence, the resulting Title Defect Amount, (B) the existence of
the asserted Title Benefit and, subject to the following sentence,
corresponding Title Benefit Amount, (C) the deficiencies in any notice of the
foregoing and the specific supplemental information that, if provided, would
cause such notice to be in compliance with the terms of Section 4.2(a), and/or
(D) the adequacy of any title curative action, including any such additional
curative actions necessary to cure properly any asserted Title Defect, as
applicable, in each case, including the Title Expert's rationale for the
determination. With respect to a Title Defect Amount or Title Benefit Amount,
the Title Expert shall be limited to awarding only the final amount proposed
by either Party in its submissions provided pursuant to Section 4.4(e). The
Title Expert shall make a separate and independent determination with respect
to each Disputed Title Matter submitted and shall provide a detailed written
finding supporting such determination. For the avoidance of doubt, the
submission of a Disputed Title Matter for interim determination (e.g., a
determination about the adequacy of a Title Defect Notice) shall not prohibit
any Party from subsequently disputing the existence of an asserted Title
Defect or Title Benefit, the corresponding Title Defect Amount or Title
Benefit Amount or the adequacy of any curative actions taken with respect to
an asserted Title Defect, unless the Title Expert has already made a
determination with respect to such matters.

  (h)The Title Expert shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of
determining the specific disputed Title Defects or Title Benefits and shall
not be empowered to award Damages, interest or penalties to either Party with
respect to any matter.

 

(i)Each Party shall bear its own legal fees and other costs of preparing and
presenting its case. The costs of the Title Expert shall be borne (i) by
Sellers in a ratio equal to a fraction, the numerator of which is the
aggregate amount awarded by the Title Expert in favor of Purchaser, and the
denominator of which is the aggregate amount of the Title Defects Amounts
submitted for determination to the Title Expert, and (ii) the remainder by
Purchaser.

 

(j)Subject to the Defect Threshold and the Aggregate Defect Deductible, any
amounts determined to be owed by either Party shall be accounted for in the
final determination of the Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant to Section 10.4
and Sellers and Purchaser shall deliver documentation to the Escrow Agent
required to release the amounts determined by the Title Expert to be owed to
either Party. Any alleged Title Defects/Title Benefits determined not to be
Title Defects/Title Benefits under the decision of the Title Expert shall be
final and binding as not being Title Defects/Title Benefits, and any such
decision of the Title Expert shall be enforceable by either Party in any court
of competent jurisdiction.

 

(k)Any dispute over the interpretation or application of this Section 4.4
shall be decided by the Title Expert with reference to the Laws of the State
of Texas. The Parties intend that the procedures set forth in this Section
4.4 shall not constitute or be handled as arbitration proceedings under the
Federal Arbitration Act or any applicable state arbitration act and that the
provisions of this Section 4.4 shall be specifically enforceable.

 

Section 4.5Limitations on Applicability

 

.

 

(a)This Article 4, the special warranty of title provided in the Conveyances
and Section 12.2(b)(iv) for breaches by Sellers of the Specified
Representations shall comprise, subject to the limitations set forth in this
Agreement, the exclusive rights and remedies of Purchaser with respect to
Title Defects.

 

(b)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
shall there be any adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price or other
remedies available in respect of Title Defects under this Article 4 unless the
sum of (i) all such Title Defect Amounts that exceed the Defect Threshold and
(ii) all Remediation Amounts for Adverse Environmental Conditions that exceed
the Defect Threshold exceeds the Aggregate Defect Deductible, beyond which
point, Purchaser shall be entitled to adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase
Price or other remedies elected by Sellers in accordance with this Article 4
only to the extent that the sum of such Title Defect Amounts and such
Remediation Amounts exceeds the Aggregate Defect Deductible. 

 

(c)In the event (i) Purchaser is entitled to a remedy pursuant to clause (b)
above and such remedy is that a Property is removed from this transaction or
not transferred to Purchaser or (ii) a Property is removed from this
transaction or not transferred to Purchaser pursuant to Section 4.6(b),
Section 4.6(c) or Section 8.1(a), the Allocated Value of any such removed
Property shall not be included in the Aggregate Defect Deductible.

  (d)The Parties acknowledge and agree that a Title Defect may affect multiple
Properties and in such event the Parties acknowledge and agree, for the
avoidance of doubt, that if the Title Defect Amount associated therewith
(which shall be the aggregate reduction in Allocated Value of all affected
Properties) exceeds the Defect Threshold then, subject to the Aggregate Defect
Deductible, Purchaser shall be entitled to the remedies provided in this
Article 4.

 

(e)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in the Northstars
Purchase and Sale Agreement, in the event a Title Defect hereunder
additionally constitutes a Title Defect under the Northstars Purchase and Sale
Agreement, then, for such Title Defect, the "Defect Threshold" referenced in
Section 4.5(b) of this Agreement shall be equal to $60,000.00 and the "Defect
Threshold" in Section 4.5(b) of the Northstars Purchase and Sale Agreement
shall be equal to $15,000.00.

 

Section 4.6Consents to Assignment and Preferential Rights to Purchase

 

.

 

(a)As soon as reasonably practicable following the Execution Date but in any
event no later than ten Business Days following the Execution Date, Sellers
shall send (i) notice to the holder of any consent to assignment or similar
approval necessary for the Parties to complete the transactions as
contemplated hereby that will be triggered by the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any Required Consents
but excluding the Customary Post-Closing Consents), requesting consents to the
Conveyances and (ii) notice to any Third Party holder of any Preferential
Right to Purchase that is triggered by the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (each notice to be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Purchaser), requesting waiver of such Preferential Right to Purchase, in each
case, in accordance with the contractual requirements pertaining to each
consent to assignment, approval right and Preferential Right to Purchase. Any
such Preferential Right to Purchase must be exercised subject to all terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, including the successful Closing
pursuant to Article 10 as to those Assets for which such Preferential Right to
Purchase has not been exercised. The consideration payable under this
Agreement for any particular Asset for purposes of Preferential Right to
Purchase notices shall be the Allocated Value for such Asset, subject to
adjustment as described in Section 3.4. Sellers shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain such consents and approvals and waivers of such
Preferential Rights to Purchase (or the exercise thereof) prior to the
Closing; provided, however, that Sellers shall not be required to (i) make
payments or (ii) remain liable for (post-closing) or undertake obligations to
or for the benefit of the holders of such rights in order to obtain any such
consent, approval or waiver. Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with
Sellers in seeking to obtain such consents and approvals and waivers of
Preferential Rights to Purchase, which cooperation will include providing
evidence of creditworthiness. Subject to clauses (b) and (c) below, if
Sellers are unable to obtain such consents, approvals or waivers by the
Closing Date, Sellers shall have no further obligation to seek to obtain such
consents, approvals or waivers after the Closing.

 

(b)Required Consents.

 

(i)If any Contract or Surface Agreement is subject to a Required Consent and
such Required Consent has not been obtained prior to the Closing or is subject
to a Soft Consent and such Soft Consent is denied in writing (and the holder
gives a reason for such denial in

  writing) prior to the Closing (such Required Consents and Soft Consents, the
"Unobtained Contract Consents"), (A) such Contract or Surface Agreement, as
applicable will be excluded from the Assets conveyed at the Closing and will
be treated as an Excluded Asset, and (B) Purchaser may request that Sellers
execute and deliver such instruments and take such other actions as Purchaser
may reasonably request to carry out the intent of this Agreement and the
transfer of any Property and its related Assets related to such Contract or
Surface Agreement, as applicable, including, to the extent reasonably
practicable, the execution of back-to-back agreements to effect the transfer
to Purchaser of the benefits to and burdens on Sellers under the Contract or
Surface Agreement subject to such Unobtained Contract Consent; provided,
however, that entering into such back-to-back agreements does not: (x)
expressly result in a breach of the Contract or Surface Agreement subject to
such Unobtained Contract Consent, (y) result in a violation of Law by Sellers
or (z) impose a burden on Sellers that is materially disproportionate to the
benefit received by Purchaser under the Contract or Surface Agreement subject
to such Unobtained Contract Consent (such arrangements, the "Back-to-Back
Arrangements"). Sellers' obligation to perform Back-to-Back Arrangements with
respect to any Contract or Surface Agreement pursuant to this Section
4.6(b)(i) will terminate upon the earlier of (x) the Cut-off Date, (y) the
date that the Unobtained Contract Consent with respect to such Contract or
Surface Agreement is obtained and (z) the date Purchaser notifies Sellers that
it has made alternative arrangements that vitiate the need for such Contract
or Surface Agreement, which notice shall be provided by Purchaser as soon as
practicable after such alternative arrangements are made (provided that such
Contract or Surface Agreement does not prohibit such alternative arrangement).
If Purchaser is assigned the Property or Properties to which such Contract or
Surface Agreement relates, but such Contract or Surface Agreement is not
transferred to Purchaser pursuant to the terms of this Section 4.6(b)(i),
Sellers shall continue after the Closing to use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any Unobtained Contract Consents that have not been
affirmatively denied so that such Contract or Surface Agreement can be
transferred to Purchaser; provided, however, that if Sellers are unable to
obtain such Unobtained Contract Consent by the Cut-off Date, Sellers shall
have no further obligation to seek to obtain such Unobtained Contract Consent
and, at Purchaser's election, unless the affected Contract is a midstream or
marketing Contract, the affected Contract or Surface Agreement shall be
assigned to Purchaser by Sellers. For the avoidance of doubt, any Damages
arising from or relating to any such assignment shall be Assumed Purchaser
Obligations and not Retained Seller Obligations. If Purchaser does not so
elect, the affected Contract or Surface Agreement shall be deemed an Excluded
Asset under this Agreement for all purposes.

 

(ii)If any Lease is subject to a Required Consent and such Required Consent
has not been obtained prior to the Closing or is subject to a Soft Consent and
such Soft Consent is denied in writing (and the holder gives a reason for such
denial in writing) prior to the Closing (such Required Consents and Soft
Consents, the "Unobtained Lease Consents"), then, in each case, (i) the
affected Lease and the Assets directly associated with the Lease shall be
excluded from the Assets conveyed at the Closing and shall be deemed to be
Excluded Assets and (ii) the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
Allocated Value of such excluded Lease and directly associated Assets, if any.
If such Unobtained Lease Consent is subsequently obtained prior to the Cut-off
Date, then Sellers shall notify Purchaser and an additional Closing shall be
held within five Business Days following receipt of such consent at which (A)
Sellers shall sell, assign and convey the affected Lease and related Assets
that were excluded at Closing to Purchaser pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement (using the form of Conveyance) and

  (B) Purchaser shall pay to Sellers an amount equal to the Allocated Value of
such Assets, adjusted (mutatis mutandis) in accordance with Section 3.4. In
the event of such assignment, the term "Closing Date" with respect to any such
Assets shall mean the date of assignment of such Assets from Sellers to
Purchaser. If such Unobtained Lease Consent is not obtained by the Cut-off
Date, Sellers shall have no further obligation to seek to obtain such
Unobtained Lease Consent and, at Purchaser's election, an additional Closing
shall be held within five Business Days following such election at which (A)
Sellers shall sell, assign and convey the affected Lease and its directly
associated Assets that were excluded at the Closing to Purchaser pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement (using the form of Conveyance) and (B) Purchaser
shall pay to Sellers an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Assets,
adjusted (mutatis mutandis) in accordance with Section 3.4. For the avoidance
of doubt, any Damages arising from or relating to any such assignment shall be
Assumed Purchaser Obligations and not Retained Seller Obligations. If
Purchaser does not so elect, the affected Lease and its directly associated
Assets shall be deemed an Excluded Asset under this Agreement for all
purposes.

 

(iii)For purposes of this Section 4.6(b), a Required Consent shall be deemed
obtained if the Person holding the Required Consent grants consent or is
deemed to have consented pursuant to the terms of the document in which the
Required Consent is contained. For the avoidance of doubt, if Sellers do not
obtain consent from the holder of any Soft Consent, then, except for those
Soft Consents constituting Unobtained Contract Consents or Unobtained Lease
Consents, the underlying Asset shall be conveyed to Purchaser at Closing and
Sellers shall not be liable for failure to obtain such Soft Consent.

 

(c)Preferential Rights to Purchase.

 

(i)If, prior to the Closing, the holder of a Preferential Right to Purchase
that will be triggered by the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (A) notifies Sellers that it intends to exercise its
Preferential Right to Purchase or (B) has failed to exercise or waive its
Preferential Right to Purchase, and the time for such exercise or waiver has
not yet expired, (i) the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be decreased by the
Allocated Value for such Asset and (ii) the affected Asset shall be excluded
from the Assets conveyed at the Closing and shall be deemed an Excluded Asset
under this Agreement for all purposes. In such case, Sellers shall retain the
consideration paid by the holder of such Preferential Right to Purchase and
shall have no further obligation with respect to the affected Asset under this
Agreement.

 

(ii)If, on the Closing Date, any holder of a Preferential Right to Purchase
triggered by the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement has failed to exercise or waive its Preferential Right to Purchase
as to any portion of the Assets and the time for such exercise or waiver has
expired, the affected Assets shall be transferred to Purchaser at the Closing.

 

(iii)If, following the Closing but prior to the date that is 90 days following
the Closing, the holder of a Preferential Right to Purchase triggered by the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (A) who
exercised such right fails to consummate the purchase in accordance with the
applicable agreement or (B) fails to exercise or waive such right and the time
for such exercise or waiver has expired, in each case, Sellers shall notify

  Purchaser and an additional Closing shall be held within five Business Days
following such failure at which (A) Sellers shall sell, assign and convey the
affected Assets to Purchaser pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (using
the form of Conveyance) and (B) Purchaser shall pay to Sellers an amount equal
to the Allocated Value of such Assets, adjusted (mutatis mutandis) in
accordance with Section 3.4. In the event of such assignment, the term
"Closing Date" with respect to any such Assets shall mean the date of
assignment of such Assets from Sellers to Purchaser. Following the date that
is 90 days following the Closing, Sellers shall have no further obligation to
sell and convey any Assets subject to a Preferential Right to Purchase
triggered by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement which have not
yet been conveyed to Purchaser pursuant to this Section 4.6(c), and Purchaser
shall have no further obligation to accept and pay for such Assets, and such
Assets shall be deemed Excluded Assets under this Agreement for all purposes.

 

(iv)If the Parties inadvertently close on any Asset burdened by a Preferential
Right to Purchase that is triggered by the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, either (A) without having provided the
required notification to the holder of such Preferential Right to Purchase or
(B) without such holder having waived such Preferential Right to Purchase or
the time period for the exercise of such Preferential Right to Purchase having
expired, and, after the Closing, the holder of such Preferential Right to
Purchase successfully exercises such Preferential Right to Purchase, then
Purchaser shall convey such Asset directly to the holder of such Preferential
Right to Purchase and shall be entitled to retain all proceeds paid for the
affected Asset by the holder of the Preferential Right to Purchase.

 

(d)Customary Post-Closing Consents. Purchaser, within 30 days after the
Closing, shall file for approval with the applicable Governmental Bodies all
assignment documents and other state transfer documents required to effectuate
the transfer of the Assets. Purchaser further agrees promptly after the
Closing to take all other actions reasonably required of it by Governmental
Bodies having jurisdiction to obtain all requisite regulatory approvals with
respect to this transaction, and to use its reasonable commercial efforts to
obtain the approval by such Governmental Bodies, as applicable, of Sellers'
assignment documents requiring approval from such Governmental Body in order
for Purchaser to be recognized by such Governmental Body as the owner of the
Assets. Sellers shall provide Purchaser with the resignation and designation
of operator instruments, and Purchaser shall provide Sellers with approved
copies of the assignment documents and other state transfer documents within
ten Business Days of the receipt of such items by Purchaser.

 

Section 4.7Casualty Loss or Condemnation

 

.

 

(a)If, after the Execution Date but prior to the Closing Date, any portion of
the Assets is affected by Casualty Losses and the Damages as a result of such
Casualty Losses exceed, in the aggregate, $1,500,000.00, Purchaser shall
nevertheless be required to close, subject to Section 9.2(f), and the Sellers
whose Assets are affected by such Casualty Losses shall elect by written
notice to Purchaser prior to the Closing to (i) cause the Assets adversely
affected by such Casualty Losses to be repaired or restored to at least their
condition prior to such Casualty Losses, at the affected Sellers' (or
Seller's) sole cost and expense, as promptly as reasonably practicable, (ii)
indemnify Purchaser against any costs or expenses that Purchaser reasonably
incurs to repair or restore the Assets subject to any such Casualty Losses to
the

  condition such Assets were in prior to such Casualty Losses, provided that
Purchaser has consented to accept such indemnity or (iii) make an appropriate
monetary adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price reflecting the cost to
repair or restore the Assets adversely effected by such Casualty Losses to at
least their condition prior to such Casualty Losses, or if such Casualty
Losses are not capable of being repaired or restored, then the "reduction in
value" caused by such Casualty Losses; provided, however, that such "reduction
in value" shall not exceed any amount mutually agreed upon by the Parties as
the reasonable cost of repair; provided further, that in no event will any
calculation of Damages, cost of repair or reduction in value hereunder take
into account any loss of production or changes in production as a result of
such Casualty Loss, through an emergency shut-in or otherwise.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall only be entitled to a remedy in
respect of Casualty Losses pursuant to the foregoing sentence to the extent,
and only to the extent, such Casualty Losses exceed $1,500,000.00; provided,
however, that with respect to any portion of such Casualty Losses that does
not exceed $1,500,000.00, Purchaser shall be entitled to all sums paid to
Sellers by Third Parties by reason of such Casualty Losses and all of Sellers'
right, title and interest (if any) in unpaid awards, condemnation payments,
rights to insurance and other rights and claims against Third Parties (other
than Persons within the Seller Group) arising out of such Casualty Losses.

 

(b)If, after the Execution Date but prior to the Closing Date, any portion of
the Assets is taken in condemnation or under right of eminent domain by any
Governmental Body, (i) the affected Asset shall be excluded from the Assets
conveyed at the Closing and shall be deemed an Excluded Asset and (ii) the
Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be decreased by the Allocated Value for such
Asset. If any action for condemnation or taking under right of eminent domain
is pending or threatened with respect to any portion of the Assets after the
Execution Date, but no taking of such Asset occurs prior to the Closing Date,
Sellers shall, at the Closing, sell, assign and convey to Purchaser, or
subrogate Purchaser to Sellers' right, title and interest (if any) in such
taking, including any insurance claims, unpaid awards and other rights against
Third Parties (other than claims against Persons within the Seller Group)
arising out of the taking, insofar as they are attributable to the Assets (or
portions thereof) threatened to be taken.

 

ARTICLE 5 
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

 

Section 5.1Adverse Environmental Conditions

 

.

 

(a)To assert a claim of an Adverse Environmental Condition, Purchaser must
deliver a claim notice to Sellers (each, an "Environmental Condition Notice")
at or prior to 5:00 p.m. Central Time on the Defect Claim Date. To be valid,
each Environmental Condition Notice shall be in writing and shall include (i)
a description of, and a reasonable explanation of Purchaser's basis for, the
alleged Adverse Environmental Condition, including a description of any
standards that Purchaser asserts must be met to comply with Environmental
Laws, (ii) identification of each Asset adversely affected by the Adverse
Environmental Condition (each, an "Environmental Defect Property"), (iii) the
Allocated Value of each Environmental Defect Property, (iv) all documents in
Purchaser's possession or control upon which Purchaser relies for its
assertion of an Adverse Environmental Condition, including, at a minimum,
supporting documents available to Purchaser to the extent reasonably necessary
for Sellers to verify the existence of the alleged Adverse Environmental
Condition, and (v) the Remediation Amount that

  Purchaser asserts is attributable to such alleged Adverse Environmental
Condition and the computations therefor. To be valid, each Environmental
Condition Notice must be substantially in compliance with each of the
requirements of the foregoing sentence. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser
may not assert any Adverse Environmental Condition to the extent constituting
a Disclosed Environmental Condition, which are set forth on Schedule 5.1.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, but
without limitation of Purchaser's rights and remedies pursuant to Section
12.2(b)(iv) for breaches of the representations and warranties of Sellers in
Section 6.21, Purchaser will be deemed to have waived its right to assert any
Adverse Environmental Conditions for which an Environmental Condition Notice
in substantial compliance with each of the requirements set forth in Section
5.1(a)(i) - (v) above has not been delivered on or before the Defect Claim
Date.

 

(b)Remedies. To the extent Purchaser delivers any valid Environmental
Condition Notice in accordance with Section 5.1(a) prior to the Defect Claim
Date, then, subject to the Defect Threshold and Aggregate Defect Deductible,
Sellers may, on or before the end of the Remedy Period, elect any of the
following remedies:

 

(i)Notify Purchaser that they intend to Remediate such Adverse Environmental
Condition and undertake such Remediation, which Remediation work may extend to
the end of the Post-Closing Cure Period under a mutually agreeable form of
access agreement containing reciprocal forms of the applicable terms binding
upon Purchaser in Section 8.1, in which case Sellers shall retain such
Environmental Defect Property (including any directly associated Assets) at
the Closing, and the Unadjusted Purchase Price will be reduced by the
Allocated Value (if any) of such Environmental Defect Property and any other
directly associated Assets so retained;

 

(ii)Notify Purchaser that they do not intend to Remediate such Adverse
Environmental Condition, in which case the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the Remediation Amount, as agreed upon by the Parties or determined
by the Environmental Expert, attributable to such Environmental Defect; or

 

(iii)To the extent the alleged Remediation Amount exceeds $500,000.00, retain
such Environmental Defect Property (including any directly associated Assets)
or the portion thereof subject to the Adverse Environmental Condition (at
which point such Environmental Defect Property (including any directly
associated Assets) or portion so retained will become an Excluded Asset), and
reduce the Unadjusted Purchase Price by an amount equal to the Allocated
Value, if any, of such Environmental Defect Property, or portion thereof, and
any other directly associated Assets so retained;

 

provided, however, that if Sellers fail to elect a remedy prior to the end of
the Remedy Period, Sellers shall be deemed to have elected the remedy
described in Section 5.1(b)(i); provided further that in the case of Seller's
election of the remedy described in Section 5.1(b)(ii), the applicable
Environmental Defect Properties shall be conveyed to Purchaser at the Closing
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and, subject to the Defect
Threshold and the Aggregate Defect Deductible, the Unadjusted Purchase Price
shall be reduced by the Remediation Amount of such Adverse Environmental
Condition. In the event that Sellers have elected the remedy in Section
5.1(b)(i) and (i) such Adverse Environmental Condition is

  Remediated at or prior to the expiration of the Post-Closing Cure Period,
within five Business days after such completion, Sellers shall convey the
affected Environmental Defect Property (and its directly associated Assets) to
Purchaser pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (using the form of
Conveyance) and Purchaser will pay to Sellers an amount equal to the Allocated
Value of such Assets, adjusted (mutatis mutandis) in accordance with Section
3.4 or (ii) such Adverse Environmental Condition is not fully Remediated prior
to the expiration of the Post-Closing Cure Period, then within five Business
days after such expiration, Sellers shall elect to either (A) convey the
Environmental Defect Property to Purchaser (in accordance with the provisions
of clause (i) of this sentence, except that Purchaser shall pay Sellers an
amount for such Assets equal to their Allocated Value less the remaining
Remediation Amount or, if the remaining Remediation Amount is greater than the
adjusted Allocated Value of such Assets, Sellers shall pay Purchaser the
amount of such excess) or (B) to the extent the remaining Remediation Amount
asserted by Purchaser is greater than $500,000.00, retain such Environmental
Defect Property and its directly associated Assets permanently. An election
by Sellers to attempt to Remediate an Adverse Environmental Condition shall be
without prejudice to their rights under Section 5.2 and shall not constitute
an admission against interest or a waiver of Sellers' right to dispute the
existence, nature or value of, or cost to Remediate, the alleged Adverse
Environmental Condition or the adequacy of any Environmental Condition Notice
or any curative action.

 

(c)If Sellers select the remedy in Section 5.1(b)(i) or Section 5.1(b)(ii) and
Purchaser waives such Adverse Environmental Condition or Sellers fail to
Remediate and the Unadjusted Purchase Price is adjusted for such Adverse
Environmental Condition, then in each case Purchaser shall be deemed to have
assumed responsibility for Remediation of such Adverse Environmental Condition
and such Adverse Environmental Condition and all liabilities with respect
thereto shall be deemed to constitute Assumed Purchaser Obligations. With
respect to any provision of this Article 5 that refers to any Remediation
completed by Sellers, Sellers will be deemed to have adequately completed the
Remediation upon mutual agreement of the Parties that the Remediation has been
implemented to the extent necessary to comply with Environmental Laws
applicable; provided, however, that if the Parties cannot reach an agreement,
the issue of whether the Remediation is completed may be resolved by the
dispute resolution procedures set forth in Section 5.2. Without limitation of
Purchaser's rights and remedies pursuant to Section 12.2(b)(iv) for breaches
of the representations and warranties of Sellers in Section 6.21, following
the completion of any Remediation in accordance with this Section 5.1(c),
Purchaser shall have no further remedies against Sellers with respect to the
Remediation of the applicable Adverse Environmental Condition or the
corresponding Remediation Amount.

 

(d)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, including this Article 5,
in the event the Remediation Amount for an alleged Environmental Conditions
exceeds $500,000.00, then Purchaser shall have the right to elect ((X) prior
to Closing, if (i) the Parties have agreed on the Remediation Amount prior to
Closing or (ii) Purchaser believes in good faith the Remediation Amount
exceeds $500,000.00, or (Y) promptly following the Environmental Expert's
decision, if there is a related Disputed Environmental Matter) to exclude such
Environmental Defect Property and its directly associated Assets from the
transactions contemplated hereby; in which case Sellers shall retain such
Environmental Defect Property (including any directly associated Assets) at
the Closing, and the Unadjusted Purchase Price will

  be reduced by the Allocated Value (if any, and as adjusted hereunder) of such
Environmental Defect Property and any other directly associated Assets so
retained. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser's remedies under this Section
5.1(d) shall be subject to the Defect Threshold and the Aggregate Defect
Deductible.

 

Section 5.2Adverse Environmental Condition Disputes

 

.

 

(a)Sellers and Purchaser shall attempt to agree on all asserted Adverse
Environmental Conditions and Remediation Amounts prior to the Closing Date.
If, by (i) the Closing Date or (ii) solely with respect to any disputes over
the adequacy of Sellers' post-Closing Date Remediation work, the end of the
Post-Closing Cure Period, Sellers and Purchaser are unable to agree on an
alleged Adverse Environmental Condition, on the completion of Remediation or
on an alleged Remediation Amount (including, in each case, the adequacy of
notices thereof or any Remediation actions with respect thereto) (the
"Disputed Environmental Matters") such disputes, and only such disputes, shall
be exclusively and finally resolved in accordance with the following
provisions of this Section 5.2. Any Asset subject to a Disputed Environmental
Matter at the Closing shall be retained by Sellers at Closing and a cash
amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Asset shall be placed in escrow
with the Escrow Agent. Any initiation of an expert determination of any
Disputed Environmental Matter shall only be in accordance with the following
provisions.

 

(b)No later than twenty Business Days following the (i) the Closing Date or
(ii) solely with respect to any disputes over the adequacy of Sellers' post-
Closing Date Remediation work, the end of the Post-Closing Cure Period, either
Party may submit any Disputed Environmental Matter to expert determination
pursuant to this Section 5.2 by written notice to the other Party, together
with all reasonably supporting documentation of such Disputed Environmental
Matter. If a Party does not submit a notice of expert determination to the
other Party in accordance with this Section 5.2(b), such Party shall be deemed
to have waived all such Disputed Environmental Matters, which shall be deemed
conclusively resolved in accordance with the other Party's written position in
the Environmental Condition Notice or subsequent correspondence between the
Parties.

 

(c)By not later than twenty Business Days after a Party's receipt of a written
description of any Disputed Environmental Matters, such Party shall provide to
the initiating Party a written response setting forth its position with
respect to such Disputed Environmental Matters, together with all reasonably
supporting documentation.

 

(d)There shall be a single environmental expert (the "Environmental Expert"),
who shall be an environmental consultant with at least ten years' experience
examining environmental matters involving oil and gas producing properties in
the region in Texas in which the Assets are located. Within two Business Days
following the initiating Party's receipt of the other Party's response as
described in Section 5.2(c), Sellers and Purchaser shall each exchange lists
of three acceptable, qualified environmental experts, and shall certify that
each potential environmental expert set forth on its list has not, and such
environmental expert's firm has not, represented the certifying Party or any
of its Affiliates within the previous two years. Within two Business Days
following the exchange of lists of environmental experts, Sellers and
Purchaser shall select by mutual agreement the Environmental Expert from their
original lists of three acceptable

  environmental experts. If no such agreement is reached, the Houston office of
the American Arbitration Association shall select an environmental expert from
the original lists provided by Sellers and Purchaser to serve as the
Environmental Expert.

 

(e)Within two Business Days following the selection and engagement of the
Environmental Expert, the Parties shall submit to the Environmental Expert one
copy of (i) this Agreement, with specific reference to this Section 5.2, the
other applicable provisions of this Article 5 and any defined terms in
Appendix A relevant to this Article 5, (ii) the initiating Party's written
description of the Disputed Environmental Matters provided pursuant to Section
5.2(b), together with the supporting documents that were provided to the other
Party and (iii) the other Party's written response to the initiating party's
written description of the Disputed Environmental Matters, together with the
supporting documents that were provided to the initiating Party. The
Environmental Expert shall resolve the Disputed Environmental Matters based
only on the foregoing submissions. Neither Purchaser nor Sellers shall have
the right to submit additional documentation the Environmental Expert or to
demand discovery on the other Party.

 

(f)The Environmental Expert, once appointed and engaged, shall have no ex
parte communications with any Party concerning the determination required
hereunder. All communications between any Party and the Environmental Expert
shall be conducted in writing, with copies sent simultaneously to the other
Parties in the same manner, or at a meeting in Houston, Texas, to which the
representatives of all Parties have been invited and of which such Parties
have been provided at least five days' written notice.

 

(g)The Parties will instruct the Environmental Expert to make his
determination by written decision within 15 Business Days following submission
of the Disputed Environmental Matters to the Environmental Expert, which shall
be final and binding upon the Parties, without right of appeal and shall be
enforceable by either Party in any court of competent jurisdiction. In making
the determination, the Environmental Expert shall be bound by the rules set
forth in this Article 5. The Environmental Expert may consult with and engage
disinterested Third Parties to advise the Environmental Expert but shall
disclose to the Parties the identities of such consultants. Any such
consultant shall not have worked as an employee of or consultant for either
Party or its Affiliates during the two-year period preceding the expert
determination and shall not have any financial interest in the dispute. The
written finding of the Environmental Expert will set forth the Environmental
Expert's finding, if applicable, as to (A) whether the subject Adverse
Environmental Condition exists or has been Remediated and, subject to the
following sentence, the resulting Remediation Amount, (B) the deficiencies in
any notice of the foregoing and the specific supplemental information that, if
provided, would cause such notice to be in compliance with the terms of
Section 5.1(a) and/or (C) the adequacy of any Remediation action, including
any such additional Remediation actions necessary to Remediate properly any
asserted Adverse Environmental Condition, as applicable, in each case,
including the Environmental Expert's rationale for the determination. With
respect to a Remediation Amount, the Environmental Expert shall be limited to
awarding only the final amount proposed by either Party in its submissions
provided pursuant to Section 5.2(e). The Environmental Expert shall make a
separate and independent determination with respect to each Disputed
Environmental Matter submitted and shall provide a detailed written finding
supporting such determination. For the avoidance of doubt, the submission of a
Disputed Environmental Matter for interim

  determination (e.g., a determination about the adequacy of an Environmental
Condition Notice) shall not prohibit any Party from subsequently disputing the
existence of an asserted Adverse Environmental Condition, the Remediation
Amount or the adequacy of any Remediation actions taken with respect to an
asserted Adverse Environmental Condition unless the Environmental Expert has
already made a determination with respect to such matters.

 

(h)The Environmental Expert shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of
determining the specific disputed Adverse Environmental Conditions and shall
not be empowered to award Damages, interest or penalties to either Party with
respect to any matter.

 

(i)Each Party shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of preparing
and presenting its case. The costs of the Environmental Expert shall be borne
(i) by Sellers in a ratio equal to a fraction, the numerator of which is the
aggregate Remediation Amounts awarded by the Environmental Expert in
Purchaser's favor, and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of the
associated Remediation Amounts submitted for determination to the
Environmental Expert, and (ii) the remainder by Purchaser.

 

(j)After the Environmental Expert's determination is delivered as set forth in
Section 5.2(g), Sellers shall promptly elect whether (i) if the Remediation
Amount exceeds $500,000.00, to retain the entirety of the Environmental Defect
Property that is subject to such Disputed Environmental Matter, together with
all associated Assets, and reduce the Unadjusted Purchase Price by the
Allocated Value of such Environmental Defect Property and associated Assets
(in which case such Environmental Defect Property and such associated Assets
shall be deemed to be Excluded Assets hereunder) or (ii) to reduce the
Unadjusted Purchase Price as set forth in the immediately following sentence,
in which case, Sellers shall convey the affected Environmental Defect Property
(and its directly associated Assets) to Purchaser pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement (using the form of Conveyance). Subject to the Defect
Threshold and the Aggregate Defect Deductible, any amounts determined to be
owed by either Party shall be accounted for in the final determination of the
Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant to Section 10.4, and Sellers and Purchaser
shall deliver documentation to the Escrow Agent required to release the
amounts determined by the Environmental Expert to be owed to either Party.
Any alleged Adverse Environmental Conditions determined not to be Adverse
Environmental Conditions under the decision of the Environmental Expert shall
be final and binding as not being Adverse Environmental Conditions.

 

(k)Any dispute over the interpretation or application of this Section 5.2
shall be decided by the Environmental Expert with reference to the Laws of the
State of Texas. The Parties intend that the procedures set forth in this
Section 5.2 shall not constitute or be handled as arbitration proceedings
under the Federal Arbitration Act or any applicable state arbitration act, and
that the provisions of this Section 5.2 shall be specifically enforceable.

 

Section 5.3Limitations on Applicability

 

.

 

(a)This Article 5 shall comprise, subject to Purchaser's rights under this
Agreement with respect to the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 6.21 (and Section 12.2(b)(iv) for breaches thereof) and the
limitations set forth in this Agreement, the

  exclusive rights and remedies of Purchaser with respect to Adverse
Environmental Conditions or any other environmental matter with respect to any
Asset.

 

(b)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
shall there be any adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price or other
remedies available in respect of Adverse Environmental Conditions under this
Article 5 unless the sum of (i) all such Remediation Amounts that exceed the
Defect Threshold and (ii) all such Title Defect Amounts that exceed the Defect
Threshold exceeds the Aggregate Defect Deductible, after which point Purchaser
shall be entitled to adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price or other
remedies elected by Sellers in accordance with this Article 5 only to the
extent that the sum of such Remediation Amounts and such Title Defect Amounts
exceeds the Aggregate Defect Deductible.

 

(c)In the event (i) Purchaser is entitled to a remedy pursuant to clause (b)
above and such remedy is that a Property is removed from this transaction or
not transferred to Purchaser or (ii) a Property is removed from this
transaction or not transferred to Purchaser pursuant to Section 4.6(b),
Section 4.6(c) or Section 8.1(a), the Allocated Value of any such removed
Property shall not be included in the Aggregate Defect Deductible.

there any unfair labor practice complaints or grievances currently pending or,
to the knowledge of Sellers, threatened against any Employer with respect to
the Available Employees.

 

(c)AEPO has made available to Purchaser a benefits booklet describing employee
benefits commonly provided to the Available Employees. Each Employee Benefit
Plan that is intended to be qualified within the meaning of Section 401(a) of
the Code and from which any Available Employee could receive an "eligible
rollover distribution" has received a favorable determination letter as to its
qualification, or is the subject of an opinion letter, from the Internal
Revenue Service, and to the knowledge of Sellers, nothing has occurred that
would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such favorable
determination.

 

(d)The Employers have complied, and are currently in compliance in all
material respects with all applicable Laws pertaining to labor or employment
matters, including, but not limited to Laws governing or regarding hours of
work, the payment of wages (including overtime) or other compensation,
employee benefits, employment discrimination and harassment, occupational
safety and health, and any and all other Laws governing or pertaining to the
terms, conditions, and privileges of employment. No proceedings, claims or
charges alleging any failure to comply with such Laws pertaining to
employment-related matters are currently pending or, to the knowledge of
Sellers, threatened, against any Employer with respect to the Available
Employees (and, to the knowledge of Sellers, there is no basis therefor), and
no such proceeding, claim or charge has previously been filed or commenced
against any Employer with respect to the Available Employees.

 

(e)Except as set forth on Schedule 6.20, Sellers do not contribute to, and do
not have any liability with respect to, any Employee Benefit Plan that is an
"employee pension benefit plan" (as such term is defined under Section 3(2) of
ERISA) that is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of
the Code. Sellers do not contribute to, and do not have any liability with
respect to, any Employee Benefit Plan that is a "multiemployer plan" (as
defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA). Purchaser's acquisition of the
Assets will not cause Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to incur any
liability under Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code.

 

Section 6.21Environmental Matters

 

. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.1, to the knowledge of Sellers, (a) no
Seller has received any written notice from a Governmental Body or other
Person alleging or involving any material noncompliance with or potential
material liability under any Environmental Law with respect to the Assets or
operations conducted thereon that remains unresolved as of the Execution Date
and (b) there are no claims, demands, suits, investigations or proceedings of
a material nature pending before a Governmental Body under

  Environmental Laws against any Seller with respect to the Assets or any
Sellers' ownership or operation thereof.

 

Section 6.22Payout Balances

 

. With respect to those Wells operated by AEPO, Schedule 6.22 sets forth, and
with respect to any Well operated by a Third Party, to Sellers' knowledge,
Schedule 6.22 sets forth, the payout balances as of the date set forth on
Schedule 6.22 for each Well subject to reversion or other adjustment at payout
(or some other event, other than a termination of a Lease in accordance with
its terms).

ARTICLE 8 
COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES

 

Section 8.1Access

 

.

 

(a)Between the Execution Date and the Defect Claim Date, Sellers will give
Purchaser and its Representatives access to the Assets (and to designated
employees of Sellers responsible for the Assets, at such times as Purchaser
may reasonably request) and access to and the right to copy, at Purchaser's
sole cost, risk and expense, the Records (or originals thereof) in Sellers'
possession or control, for the purpose of conducting a reasonable due
diligence review of the Assets, but only to the extent that Sellers have the
authority to grant such access without breaching applicable Law or any
Contract or other restriction binding on any Seller, including with respect to
any Properties not operated by Sellers (provided, that Sellers shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any such consents or waivers to
allow Purchaser access to the Assets). Purchaser shall be entitled to
conduct, at Purchaser's expense, a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment of
the Properties and may conduct visual inspections and record reviews relating
to the Assets, including their condition and compliance with Environmental
Laws, all of which shall be completed prior to the Defect Claim Date;
provided, however, that if Purchaser does conduct a Phase I Environmental Site
Assessment on any of the Properties, it will provide Sellers with a copy of
any final non-privileged reports or findings generated in connection
therewith. Neither Purchaser nor its Representatives may operate any
equipment or conduct any testing or sampling of soil, groundwater or other
materials (including any testing or sampling for Hazardous Substances,
Hydrocarbons or NORM) on or with respect to the Assets (the "Invasive
Activity") prior to the Closing without the prior written consent of Sellers
(which consent may be withheld in Sellers' sole discretion), and all such
activities shall be deemed outside of the scope of a Phase I Environmental
Site Assessment. If, following Purchaser's Phase I Environmental Site
Assessment, Purchaser reasonably concludes based on the results thereof that
it is necessary to conduct Invasive Activity on a Property prior to the
Closing in order for Purchaser to ascertain the existence or extent of an
Adverse Environmental Condition or any Remediation Amount for an Adverse
Environmental Condition, and Purchaser requests (in writing) authorization
from Sellers to perform such Invasive Activity on or prior to June 5, 2017
(which notice includes the corresponding portions of the Phase I Environmental
Site Assessment on which Purchaser has based its reasonable conclusions), and
Sellers reject or fail to consent to Purchaser's request within two days' of
their receipt thereof, Purchaser shall have the right, in its sole discretion,
to exclude such Property and its directly associated Assets from

  the Properties conveyed by Sellers to Purchaser at Closing, in which case the
Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such
excluded Assets and such Assets shall be deemed Excluded Assets. If Sellers
consent to the requested Invasive Activity, all Invasive Activities performed
by Purchaser or Purchaser's Representatives shall be subject to the Phase II
Guidelines.

 

(b)Purchaser shall abide by Sellers', and any Third Party operator's
reasonable safety rules, regulations, and operating policies while conducting
its due diligence evaluation of the Assets. Any conclusions made from any
examination done by Purchaser shall result from Purchaser's own independent
review and judgment.

 

(c)The access granted to Purchaser under this Section 8.1 shall be limited to
Sellers' or the applicable Third Party operator's normal business hours, and
Purchaser's investigation shall be conducted in a manner that minimizes
unreasonable interference with the operation of the Assets and shall be at
Purchaser's sole cost, risk and expense. Purchaser shall coordinate its
access rights to the Assets with Sellers to reasonably minimize any
inconvenience to or interruption of the conduct of business by Sellers or
applicable Third Party operators. For any Property not operated by any
Seller, Sellers will reasonably cooperate with Purchaser in contacting the
Third Party operators of any such non-operated Property directly to arrange
for access for purposes of Purchaser's Phase I Environmental Site Assessment;
provided, however, that Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Sellers cannot
and do not covenant or warrant that Purchaser will be granted access to any
Properties operated by Third Parties for purposes of conducting diligence of
any kind under this Agreement. Purchaser shall provide Sellers with at least
two Business Days' written notice before the Assets are proposed to be
accessed pursuant to this Section 8.1, which notice will include a general
description of the activities Purchaser intends to undertake. Purchaser shall
repair any damage to the Properties caused by its investigation and shall
cause each Property to be restored to substantially the same conditions that
existed prior to the investigation. 

 

(d)Purchaser acknowledges that, pursuant to its right of access to the Assets,
Purchaser will become privy to confidential and other information of Sellers
or an applicable Third Party operator and that such confidential information
(which includes Purchaser's conclusions with respect to its evaluations) shall
be held confidential by Purchaser in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement and any applicable privacy Laws regarding personal
information. For the avoidance of doubt, the existence and contents of any
Phase I Environmental Site Assessment conducted by or on behalf of Purchaser
on the Assets shall be deemed to be "confidential information" for the
purposes of this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(e)In connection with the rights of access, examination and inspection granted
to Purchaser under this Section 8.1, (i) PURCHASER WAIVES AND RELEASES ALL
CLAIMS AGAINST THE SELLER GROUP AND ITS REPRESENTATIVES AND ANY THIRD PARTY
OPERATORS ARISING IN ANY WAY THEREFROM OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED THEREWITH AND
(ii) PURCHASER HEREBY AGREES TO INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD HARMLESS EACH OF
THE SELLER GROUP, SELLERS' REPRESENTATIVES AND THIRD PARTY OPERATORS FROM AND
AGAINST ANY AND ALL DAMAGES ATTRIBUTABLE TO PERSONAL INJURY,

  DEATH OR PHYSICAL PROPERTY DAMAGE, OR VIOLATION OF THE SELLER GROUP'S OR ANY
THIRD PARTY OPERATOR'S RULES, REGULATIONS, OR OPERATING POLICIES, ARISING OUT
OF, RESULTING FROM OR RELATING TO ANY FIELD VISIT OR OTHER DUE DILIGENCE
ACTIVITY CONDUCTED BY PURCHASER OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES WITH RESPECT TO THE
ASSETS, REGARDLESS OF FAULT, EXCEPT, IN EACH CASE, TO THE EXTENT ARISING OUT
OF, RESULTING FROM OR RELATING TO THE WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF ANY MEMBER OF
SELLER GROUP AND PROVIDED FURTHER THAT PURCHASER'S WAIVER AND RELEASE SET
FORTH IN THIS SECTION 8.1(e) SHALL NOT LIMIT PURCHASER'S REMEDIES UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO CONDITIONS AFFECTING THE ASSETS. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Purchaser shall have no indemnity obligations under this
Section 8.1(e) for any pre-existing condition or Damage that existed prior to
the Purchaser and its Representatives accessing the Assets but is merely
discovered or revealed by Purchaser or its Representatives during its access
to the Assets and for which the condition is not exacerbated or the Damages
are not increased as a result of Purchaser's or its Representative's access
(in which case the indemnity obligation under this Section 8.1(e) shall apply
only to the extent of any such exacerbation or increase in Damages).

 

Section 8.2Government Reviews

 

. In a timely manner, Sellers and Purchaser shall (a) make all required
filings, prepare all required applications and conduct negotiations with each
Governmental Body as to which such filings, applications or negotiations are
necessary or appropriate in the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including with respect to the transfer or re-issuance of all required
Permits and (b) provide such information and assistance as each may reasonably
request to make such filings, prepare such applications and conduct such
negotiations. Each Party shall reasonably cooperate with and use all
commercially reasonable efforts to assist the other with respect to such
filings, applications, and negotiations. Without limiting the foregoing,
within five Business Days following the execution by Purchaser and Sellers of
this Agreement, Purchaser and Sellers will prepare and simultaneously file
with the DOJ and the FTC the notification and report form required by the HSR
Act for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and request early
termination of the waiting period thereunder. Purchaser and Sellers agree to
respond promptly to any inquiries from the DOJ or the FTC concerning such
filings and to comply in all material respects with the filing requirements of
the HSR Act. Purchaser and Sellers shall cooperate with each other and shall
promptly furnish all information to the other Party that is necessary in
connection with Purchaser's and Sellers' compliance with the HSR Act.
Purchaser and Sellers shall keep each other fully advised with respect to, and
furnish copies of, any requests from or communications with the DOJ or the FTC
concerning such filings and shall consult with each other with respect to all
responses thereto. Sellers and Purchaser shall use their respective
reasonable efforts to take all actions reasonably necessary and appropriate in
connection with any HSR Act filing to consummate the transactions consummated
hereby. All filing fees incurred in connection with the HSR Act filings made
pursuant to this Section 8.2 shall be borne one-half by Purchaser and one-half
by Sellers.

  Section 8.3Public Announcements; Confidentiality

 

.

 

(a)Neither Party shall make or issue any press release or other announcements
to the general public concerning the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement without the prior consent of the other Party, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld. If either Party desires to make an announcement
to the general public, it shall first give the other Party forty-eight hours
written notification of its desire to make such a public announcement. The
written notification shall include (i) a request for consent to make the
announcement, and (ii) a written draft of the text of such public
announcement. Nothing in this Section 8.3(a) shall prohibit any Party from
issuing or making a public announcement or statement if such Party deems it
necessary to do so in order to comply with any applicable Law or the rules of
any stock exchange upon which the Party's or a Party's Affiliate's capital
stock is traded; provided, however, that to the extent possible, prior written
notification shall be given to the other Parties prior to any such
announcement or statement.

 

(b)The Parties shall keep all information and data relating to this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby strictly confidential in accordance
with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained therein, if the Closing should occur, the
confidentiality obligations with respect to Purchaser and its representatives
in the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue with respect to the Excluded
Assets and the information referenced in Section 8.1(d) but not otherwise and
shall be deemed terminated for all purposes with respect to the Assets.

 

(c)From and after the Closing Date until the date that is one year after the
Closing Date, Sellers shall (and shall direct their respective Affiliates and
each of their Representatives to) keep confidential and not disclose any of
the Records of which Sellers retained copies (the "Restricted Information"),
except as and to the extent permitted by the terms of this Agreement or the
instruments delivered or entered into at Closing. The obligation shall not
apply to any information that is (i) in the public domain as of the Closing
Date, (ii) published or otherwise becomes part of the public domain through no
fault of Sellers, their Affiliates or their Representatives in violation of
this Section 8.3(c) after the Closing Date or (iii) becomes available to
Sellers or any of their Affiliates from a source that, to such Seller's or
such Affiliate's knowledge, did not acquire such information (directly or
indirectly) on a confidential basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each
Seller may make disclosures (i) to its Affiliates and each of its and their
owners, directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, financial and
other advisors, contractors, attorneys and accountants (in each case, to the
extent bound by confidentiality obligations and to the extent such disclosure
is reasonably necessary) and (ii) as required by Law, Governmental Body and/or
in connection with disputes hereunder or as otherwise required under any
Seller's debt instruments; provided, however, that with respect to clause (ii)
above, Sellers, to the extent practicable, shall provide Purchaser with prompt
notice thereof so that Purchaser, at its sole cost and expense, may seek a
protective order or other appropriate remedy or waive compliance with the
provisions of this Section 8.3(c). In the event that such protective order or
other remedy is not obtained or Purchaser waives compliance with the
provisions of this Section 8.3(c), Sellers shall or shall cause the Person
required to disclose such Restricted Information to furnish only that portion
of the information that such Person is legally required.

  Section 8.4Operation of Business

 

. 

 

(a)Except as to (a) the matters set forth on Schedule 8.4, (b) requirements
from a Governmental Body, (c) situations wherein emergency action is taken in
the face of a risk to life, property, or the environment, or (d) any other
matters consented to by Purchaser in writing (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), from the Execution Date until
the Closing Date, Sellers:

 

(i)will conduct their business related to the Seller Operated Assets and cause
the Assets to be operated and maintained in the ordinary course consistent
with Sellers' recent practices, as a reasonably prudent operator and in
accordance with applicable Laws, including the payment of Property Costs;

 

(ii)maintain, or cause to be maintained, the books of account and Records
relating to the Assets in the usual, regular and ordinary manner and in
accordance with the usual accounting practices of Sellers;

 

(iii)will not make any capital expenditures with respect to the Assets in
excess of $50,000.00, net to Sellers' interest, as set forth in any AFE;

 

(iv)will not terminate (voluntarily), amend or extend any Material Contract,
Surface Agreement or Lease or enter into any Contract that would constitute a
Material Contract if in existence on the Execution Date;

 

(v)will use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain all material Permits
and will maintain bonds and guaranties affecting the Assets and make all
filings that Sellers are required to make under applicable Law with respect to
the Assets;

 

(vi)will not incur any costs to secure any Lease renewals or extensions;

 

(vii)will not acquire any assets or properties that would constitute "Assets"
if in existence on the Execution Date, or transfer, sell, swap, hypothecate,
encumber, mortgage, farmout or otherwise dispose of any Properties or material
equipment, machinery, tools, fixtures or other tangible personal property and
improvements, except for (A) sales and dispositions of Hydrocarbons made in
the ordinary course of business and (B) the disposition of obsolete, worn out
or damaged equipment consistent with past practices if such equipment is
replaced with similar equipment of a like or better quality;

 

(viii)will maintain insurance coverage on the Assets presently furnished by
Third Parties in the amounts and coverages and of the types presently in
force;

 

(ix)will use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain in full force and
effect all Leases that are presently held by production unless Sellers are
prevented from doing so because Purchaser fails to consent to an action under
this Section 8.4;

 

(x)will use commercially reasonable efforts to keep Purchaser reasonably
informed, upon Sellers obtaining knowledge thereof, of any Lease termination
or of any operation or activities with respect to the Assets proposed by a
Third Party;

  (xi)will not waive, compromise or settle any material right or claim or
proceeding with respect to any of the Properties other than with regards to
items that are Retained Seller Obligations or waivers, compromises or
settlements requiring payment of monetary damages not in excess of $50,000.00
individually with no grant of injunctive or other relief;

 

(xii)will use commercially reasonable efforts to oppose any Third Party's
application for an exception to Texas Railroad Commission Rule 37 insofar as
affecting any Property (the costs of which opposition shall be considered
Property Costs for all purposes of this Agreement);

 

(xiii)will not make any election (or fail to make an election, the result of
which is) to go non-consent with respect to any of the Properties;

 

(xiv)will not take, nor direct any of its Affiliates (or authorize and direct
any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other Person
retained by, acting for or on behalf of any Seller or any such Affiliate) to
take any intentional, purposeful action to solicit or negotiate any offer from
any Person concerning the acquisition of the Assets by any Person other than
Purchaser or its Affiliates. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this sub-
clause (xiv) shall prohibit any such action relating to acquisition, through
merger, asset purchase or other form of business combination, involving
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation or AEPO or all or substantially all of the
assets of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation or AEPO; and

 

(xv)will not enter into any agreement or commitment with respect to any of the
foregoing.

 

(b)Requests for approval of any action restricted by this Section 8.4 shall be
delivered to the following individual, who shall have full authority to grant
or deny such requests for approval on behalf of Purchaser:

 

William B. Coffey 
Email: Brad.Coffey@wildhorserd.com

 

Purchaser's approval of any action restricted by this Section 8.4 shall be
considered granted within ten days (unless a shorter time is reasonably
required by the circumstances or is required by the terms of the Contract with
respect to which such approval is being requested and, in each case, such
shorter time is specified in Sellers' notice) after Sellers' notice to
Purchaser requesting such consent unless Purchaser notifies Sellers to the
contrary during that period. In the event of an emergency, Sellers may take
such action as a prudent operator would take and shall notify Purchaser of
such action promptly thereafter. Purchaser acknowledges that Sellers own
undivided interests in certain of the Properties where no Seller is the
operator, and Purchaser agrees that the acts or omissions of the other working
interest owners (including the operators) who are not a Seller shall not
constitute a breach of the provisions of this Section 8.4, nor shall any
action required by a vote of working interest owners constitute such a breach
so long as Sellers have not proposed an action that would be in violation of
this Section 8.4 and have voted their interest in a manner that complies with
the provisions of this Section 8.4.

  (c)In the event that, between the Execution Date and the Closing Date, (i)
Purchaser and its Affiliates deliver to Sellers any AFE for a new well, any
proposal for a new unit or any other similar capital proposal, (i) Sellers
will elect to participate in any such proposal and (ii) Purchaser will carry
Sellers for 100% of their interest in the operations subject to such proposal,
such that Sellers shall not be obligated to expend any capital associated with
such operations. If this Agreement is terminated for any reason, Sellers
shall be deemed to have relinquished their interests in the applicable asset
subject to such operations to Purchaser until such time as Purchaser has
recouped 100% of its out-of-pocket costs associated with conducting the
operations subject to such proposal, at which time Sellers' interest shall
immediately revert back to Sellers.

 

Section 8.5Operatorship

 

. While Purchaser acknowledges that it desires to succeed Sellers as operator
of those Assets or portions thereof that any Seller may presently operate,
Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Sellers cannot and do not covenant or
warrant that Purchaser will become successor operator of the same since the
Assets or portions thereof may be subject to operating or other agreements
that control the appointment of a successor operator. Within five Business
Days after the Closing, Sellers will send notices to co-owners of those
Properties that any Seller currently operates indicating that such Seller is
resigning as operator and recommending that Purchaser, or, if Purchaser so
elects, Purchaser's designee, be elected as successor operator and Sellers
shall use such other commercially reasonable efforts to support Purchaser's
efforts to become successor operator. Sellers make no representations or
warranties to Purchaser as to the transferability of operatorship of any
Properties that Sellers currently operate.

 

Section 8.6Change of Name

 

. Within 90 days after the Closing, Purchaser shall eliminate the name
"Anadarko" or "Admiral" and any variants thereof from the Assets and shall
have no right to use any logos, trademarks or trade names belonging to Sellers
or any of their Affiliates.

 

Section 8.7Replacement of Bonds, Letters of Credit and Guaranties

 

. The Parties understand that none of the bonds, letters of credit or
guaranties, if any, posted by any Seller with Governmental Bodies, co-owners
or any other Person and relating to the Assets will be transferred to
Purchaser. Prior to the Closing or within 90 days thereafter, Purchaser will
obtain, or cause to be obtained in the name of Purchaser or one of its
Affiliates, as applicable, replacements for the bonds, letters of credit and
guaranties identified on Schedule 8.7, to the extent such replacements are
necessary to permit the cancellation of the bonds, letters of credit and
guaranties posted by Sellers. If Purchaser or one of its Affiliates, as
applicable, fails to obtain any replacement bond, letter of credit, guaranty
or other credit support obligation by the time required under this Section
8.7, then, until such time as Purchaser or its Affiliates, as applicable,
obtains a replacement, (a) Purchaser agrees to reimburse Seller Group upon
request for any amounts paid or suffered under any credit support of Sellers
with respect to the Assets after the Closing Date and (b) Purchaser will
secure such obligation by providing to Sellers back-to-back credit support
reasonably acceptable to Sellers for the benefit of Sellers with respect to
each credit support obligation of Sellers covering the Assets that remains in
place at such time.

 

Section 8.8Amendment to Schedules

 

. Prior to the Closing, Sellers shall have the right to supplement their
Schedules relating to the representations and warranties set forth in

  Article 6 with respect to any matters arising or occurring subsequent to the
Execution Date; provided, however, that all such supplements shall be
disregarded for purposes of determining whether the condition to Purchaser's
obligation to close the transaction pursuant to Section 9.2(a) has been
satisfied and shall not prejudice Purchaser's rights pursuant to Article 12
with respect to such matters, it being the intent of the Parties that, subject
to the other terms and conditions of Article 12, Purchaser shall be entitled
to indemnification for any breaches of representations and warranties
associated with any matters added to such supplemented Schedules pursuant to
this Section 8.8.

 

Section 8.9Further Assurances

 

. After the Closing, Sellers and Purchaser agree to take such further actions
and to execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further documents as are
reasonably requested by the other Party for carrying out the purposes of this
Agreement or of any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement. 

 

Section 8.10Employee Matters

 

. 

 

(a)From and after the date of this Agreement, and notwithstanding the
Confidentiality Agreement, Purchaser shall be permitted to meet with and
interview Available Employees in connection with prospective employment with
Purchaser or its Affiliates and offer employment to any such Available
Employee on terms determined by Purchaser in its sole discretion. Purchaser
is responsible for scheduling any meetings or interviews and Seller shall
reasonably assist Purchaser with respect to such scheduling. Any meetings or
interviews between Purchaser and Available Employees shall be scheduled at
times and places that are not unreasonably inconvenient or disruptive to AEPO
or its Affiliates and during normal business hours, with reasonable advance
notice being provided to AEPO or its Affiliates. It is understood that
Purchaser shall have no obligation to interview or make an offer of employment
to any of the Available Employees. Any offer of employment extended by
Purchaser to Available Employees shall be made at least ten (10) days prior to
the Closing, in writing (or an electronic document) with an identification of
such Available Employee's salary or hourly rate, bonus opportunity, incentive
compensation and benefits. Within three (3) days after the date the Purchaser
makes any such offer of employment, Purchaser shall send to AEPO a schedule
identifying each Available Employee who received an offer of employment from
Purchaser, and whether such offer of employment was for compensation greater
than, less than or equal to the compensation currently being paid to such
Available Employee. All offers of employment contemplated by this Section
8.10(a) shall expire at least five (5) days prior to the Closing, and after
the Closing shall be void. Purchaser shall promptly, but in any event at
least four (4) days prior to the Closing, notify AEPO of whether such offers
of employment have been accepted or rejected by the applicable Available
Employees (and, if the agreed upon compensation differs from the initial offer
of employment, Purchaser shall notify AEPO of the revised compensation
arrangement (i.e., as greater than, less than, or equal to current
compensation)). Purchaser hereby agrees that it will comply with all
applicable Laws in making any employment decisions and taking any actions
pursuant to this Section 8.10(a). Purchaser also agrees that it will provide
copies of any offer letters and/or acceptance letters to AEPO at its
reasonable request. All Available Employees who accept an offer of employment
from Purchaser shall be referred to herein as "Transferred Employees."

  (b)AEPO shall terminate the employment of any Transferred Employee as of the
Closing Date unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties. Sellers shall be
responsible for all obligations owed to Rejected Available Employees and
Transferred Employees, if any, up to and including the last date of their
employment with Employer, including, salary, bonus (including any "retention
bonus" or "stay bonus"), accrued paid time off, severance, retirement benefits
and amounts owed under any Employee Benefit Plan.

 

(c)For a period of one (1) year following the Closing, Purchaser may not,
directly or indirectly (including through its Affiliates or any staffing or
search firm or other vendor), solicit, hire or retain, in employment or any
other capacity, any Available Employee that (i) is not offered employment by
Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.10(a) or (ii) declines any offer of employment
made by Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.10(a) (collectively, "Rejected
Available Employees"). For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section
8.10(c) shall prohibit AEPO or its Affiliates from retaining any Rejected
Available Employee or attempting to induce any such Rejected Available
Employee to continue their employment with AEPO or its Affiliates, as
applicable.

 

(d)Purchaser shall be solely responsible for complying with the WARN Act and
any and all obligations under other applicable Laws requiring notice of plant
closings, relocations, mass layoffs, reductions in force or similar actions
(and for any failures to so comply), in any case, applicable to the
Transferred Employees, which result from any action by Purchaser and its
Affiliates after the Closing Date. Purchaser shall indemnify and hold
harmless AEPO and its Affiliates against any and all liabilities arising in
connection with any failure to comply with the requirements of this Section
8.10(d).

 

(e)AEPO shall be solely responsible for complying with the WARN Act and any
and all obligations under other applicable Laws requiring notice of plant
closings, relocations, mass layoffs, reductions in force or similar actions
(and for any failures to so comply), in any case, applicable to the Available
Employees, which result from any action by AEPO and/or its Affiliates on or
before the Closing Date. AEPO shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and
its Affiliates against any and all liabilities arising in connection with any
failure to comply with the requirements of this Section 8.10(e).

 

(f)The provisions of this Section 8.10 are solely for the benefit of the
respective Parties to this Agreement and nothing in this Section 8.10, express
or implied, shall confer upon any employee (or any dependent or beneficiary
thereof), any rights or remedies, including any right to continuance of
employment or any other service relationship with the Purchaser, AEPO or any
of their respective Affiliates, or any right to compensation or benefits of
any nature or kind whatsoever under this Agreement. For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in this Agreement will be construed as an amendment to any
Employee Benefit Plan or any other compensation and benefit plans maintained
for or provided to directors, officers or employees of AEPO or its Affiliates
prior to or following the Closing.

 

Section 8.11Suspense Funds

 

. Purchaser acknowledges that Suspense Funds may exist as of the Closing
Date. If Closing occurs, Purchaser accepts sole responsibility for and agrees
to pay all costs and expenses associated with the Suspense Funds as an Assumed
Purchaser Obligation. Purchaser shall receive a credit for the amount of
Suspense Funds held by Sellers as

  of the date of the preparation of the final settlement statement pursuant to
Section 10.4(b), which credit shall be accounted for as a downward adjustment
in such final settlement statement (but such credit will not, in any event, be
considered an adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, AEPO shall pay out all "minimum suspense" in September in
accordance with AEPO's regular practices. To the extent any such payment is
returned to AEPO, AEPO will forward the relevant details to Purchaser, and
Purchaser shall assume responsibility for the payment of such funds. On or
about December 29, 2017, AEPO shall pay to Purchaser the total amount of all
returned payments received by AEPO prior to such date.

 

Section 8.12Access to Financial Information

business hours, any and all existing information and documents in the
possession of Sellers relating to the Assets that Purchaser may reasonably
require (i) to comply with tax and financial reporting requirements and audits
that may be required by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Securities Act of 1933 and/or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (including
the filing by WildHorse Resource Development Corporation with the Securities
and Exchange Commission of one or more registration statements to register any

and (ii) make any filings with any Governmental Body; and

 

(b)Following the Execution Date and until the second anniversary of the
Closing Date, Sellers will use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate
with the independent auditors retained by Purchaser ("Purchaser's Auditor") in
connection with their audit or review of any revenue and expense statements
and reserve information of the Assets that Purchaser or WildHorse Resource
Development Corporation requires to comply with their tax and financial
reporting requirements and audits that may be required by the Securities and
Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933 and/or the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, which cooperation will include (i) reasonable access
during normal business hours to Sellers' employees, representatives and agents
who were responsible for preparing the revenue and expense statements,
including Standardized Measure of Oil and Gas, ("SMOG") and work papers and
other supporting documents used in the preparation of financial statements, as
may be reasonably required by Purchaser's Auditor to perform an audit in
accordance with GAAP and (ii) the delivery of one or more customary
representation letters from Sellers to Purchaser's Auditor that are reasonably
requested by Purchaser or its Affiliates to allow Purchaser's Auditor to
complete an audit (or review of any financial statements) and to issue an
opinion with respect to an audit or review of those financial records required
pursuant to this Section 8.12(b);

 

provided that (i) Purchaser will reimburse Sellers, within twenty (20)
Business Days after demand therefor, for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs
incurred by Sellers in complying with the provisions of this Section 8.12,
(ii) such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the
ongoing operations of Sellers or any Seller's Affiliates or the ongoing job
responsibilities of Sellers' personnel, (iii) no Seller nor any of its
Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, consultants or
representatives shall have any liability for any statement, materials or
information by Sellers or any such Person in connection with this Section
8.12, and

  Purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify Sellers from and against any liabilities
incurred in connection with this Section 8.12, (iv) Sellers' failure to
perform any of its obligations under this Section 8.12 shall not delay the
Closing hereunder and Purchaser may not assert that its conditions to Closing
under Section 9.2 have not been satisfied due to any failure by Seller to
comply with its obligations under this Section 8.12 and (v) Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that any financial information provided to Purchaser
pursuant to this Section 8.12 shall be unaudited at the time it is provided,
and each Seller and such Seller's Affiliates shall have no obligation to
provide audited financial information pursuant to this Section 8.12; provided,
further, that without limiting the generality of this Section 8.12, for a
period of three (3) years following the Closing Date, Sellers shall, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to, retain all books, records, information
and documents existing at the Closing and otherwise in their or their
Affiliates' possession that are necessary to prepare and audit financial
statements with respect to the Assets, except to the extent originals or

statement is prepared, and showing the calculation of each such adjustment or
item, based, to the extent possible, on actual credits, charges, receipts and
other items before and after the Effective Time. Sellers shall, at
Purchaser's request, supply available

  documentation in reasonable detail to support any credit, charge, receipt or
other item. As soon as reasonably practicable but not later than the 30th day
following receipt of Sellers' statement hereunder, Purchaser shall deliver to
Sellers a written report containing any changes that Purchaser proposes be
made to such statement. Sellers may deliver a written report to Purchaser
during this same period reflecting any changes that Sellers propose to be made
to such statement as a result of additional information received after the
statement was prepared.

 

(c)The Parties shall undertake to agree on the final settlement statement. In
the event that the Parties cannot reach agreement within a reasonable period
of time, either Party may refer the remaining matters in dispute to the
Houston, Texas office of Grant Thornton LLP (the "Independent Accountant") for
review and final determination. In the event that Grant Thornton LLP refuses
or is otherwise unable to act as the Independent Accountant, the Parties shall
cooperate in good faith to appoint an independent certified public accounting
firm qualified and of national recognition in the United States that is
mutually agreeable to the Parties, in which event "Independent Accountant"
shall mean such firm. Within 15 days after either Party's referral of the
remaining matters in dispute to the Independent Accountant, Purchaser (on the
one hand) and Sellers (on the other hand) shall submit separate written
statements setting forth their respective positions with respect to all
matters that remain in dispute relating to the final settlement statement.
Within 30 days after the submission of such matters to the Independent
Accountant, or as soon as practicable thereafter, the Independent Accountant,
acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator, will make a final determination,
binding on Sellers and Purchaser (absent fraud or manifest error), and
enforceable by either Party in any court of competent jurisdiction. There
shall be no ex parte communications between any of Sellers or Purchaser, on
the one hand, and the Independent Accountant, on the other hand, relating to
those matters in dispute, other than the initial written submission by Sellers
and Purchaser of their respective positions on the matters in dispute and
written answers by Sellers and Purchaser to written questions from the
Independent Accountant. The Independent Accountant shall be authorized to
select only the position as to any adjustment set forth in the final
settlement statement as presented by either Sellers (on the one hand) or
Purchaser (on the other hand). The Independent Accountant shall act as an
independent neutral expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific
disputed matters submitted by the Parties and may not award Damages, interest
or penalties to the Parties with respect to any matter. The Independent
Accountant shall have no power to reach any other result and shall select the
adjustment or line item set forth in the final settlement statement that, in
its judgment, is the closest to being in conformity with this Agreement. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Independent Accountant shall not make any
determination with respect to any matter other than those matters affecting
the calculations of the final settlement statement that remain in dispute.
Sellers and Purchaser shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of
presenting its written submissions to the Independent Accountant. The costs
of the Independent Accountant shall be borne by Sellers, on the one hand, and
Purchaser, on the other hand, based on the proportion the amount awarded in
such Parties' favor bears to the aggregate amount submitted to the Independent
Accountant for determination.

 

(d)Within ten days after the earliest of (i) the expiration of Purchaser's
30-day review period without delivery of any written report by Purchaser as
contemplated in Section 10.4(b), (ii) the date on which the Parties finally
determine the matters required to be set forth in the final settlement
statement and (iii) the date on which the Independent Accountant finally
determines the disputed matters submitted to it, as applicable, (A) Purchaser
shall pay to

  Sellers the amount by which (i) the final Adjusted Purchase Price, less the
Deposit amount, plus the amount of the Unreimbursed Third Party Property
Costs, less the Suspense Funds, exceeds (2) the Closing Payment or (B) Sellers
shall pay to Purchaser the amount by which the Closing Payment exceeds the
final Adjusted Purchase Price, less the Deposit amount, plus the amount of the
Unreimbursed Third Party Property Costs, less the Suspense Funds, as
applicable. Any such payment, whether to or from the Sellers, shall be made
in cash in accordance with the Consideration Ratio.

 

(e)Purchaser shall assist Sellers in the preparation of the final statement of
the Adjusted Purchase Price under Section 10.4(d) by furnishing invoices,
receipts, reasonable access to personnel, and such other assistance as may be
reasonably requested by Sellers to facilitate such process post-Closing.

 

(f)All cash payments made or to be made under this Agreement shall be made by
electronic transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated
by the appropriate Party in writing (with email being sufficient).

this Agreement;

 

(f)by Sellers if the Parent Guaranty ceases to be in full force and effect and

  (g)by AEPO (on behalf of Sellers), upon written notice to Purchaser, if

within one Business Day after the Execution Date, provided the termination
right described in this Section 11.1(g) must be exercised, if ever, prior to
Sellers' receipt of the Deposit;

 

provided, however, that no Party shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement
under Section 11.1(b), 11.1(c) or 11.1(d) if the Closing has failed to occur
because such Party negligently or willfully failed to perform or observe in
any material respect its covenants or agreements hereunder.

 

Section 11.2Effect of Termination

 

. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 11.1, this Agreement
shall become void and of no further force or effect, except for the
Confidentiality Agreement and the provisions of Section 8.1(d), Section
8.1(e), Section 8.3, Section 8.4(c), Section 8.10(f), Article 11, Section 14.1
through Section 14.11, Section 14.13, Section 14.18, Section 14.19 and
Appendix A, which shall continue in full force and effect, and Sellers shall
be free immediately to enjoy all rights of ownership of the Assets and to
sell, transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of the Assets to any Person
without any restriction under this Agreement. 

 

Section 11.3Remedies for Breach; Distribution of Deposit Upon Termination

 

.

 

(a)If Sellers could terminate this Agreement (i) under Section 11.1(b), and
Purchaser's breach or failure to perform its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements hereunder, individually or in the aggregate, with all
other breaches and failures to perform by Purchaser that have not been waived
in writing by Sellers, are preventing or have prevented the satisfaction of
the conditions set forth in Section 9.1, (ii) pursuant to Section 11.1(c) or
(iii) pursuant to Section 11.1(f), then, in each case, Sellers, at their
option, may, as their sole and exclusive remedy, either (1) terminate this
Agreement and retain the Deposit together with any interest or income thereon,
as liquidated damages, free of any claims by Purchaser or any other Person
with respect thereto or (2) seek an injunction, order of specific performance
or other equitable relief to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
this Agreement and deduct the costs of pursuing such relief from the Deposit.
If Sellers elect to retain the Deposit but are, for any reason, prohibited
from retaining the Deposit as liquidated damages, Sellers may then pursue
whatever legal or equitable rights and remedies may be available to Sellers,
provided any such damages recovered from Purchaser may not exceed an amount
equal to the Deposit. If Sellers elect to pursue an injunction, order of
specific performance or other equitable relief to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions of this Agreement and are unable to obtain such specific
performance, then Sellers shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement and
retain the Deposit together with any interest or income thereon, as liquidated
damages, free of any claims by Purchaser or any other Person with respect
thereto. In the event Sellers elect to terminate this Agreement and retain
the Deposit, Sellers shall be free to enjoy immediately all rights of
ownership of the Assets and to sell, transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose
of the Assets to any party without any restriction under this Agreement. It
is expressly stipulated by the Parties that the actual amount of damages
resulting from any such termination would be difficult, if not impossible, to
determine accurately because of the unique nature of this Agreement, the
unique nature of the Assets, the uncertainties of applicable commodity markets
and

  differences of opinion with respect to such matters, and that the liquidated
damages provided for herein are a reasonable estimate by the Parties of such
damages.

 

(b)If Purchaser could terminate this Agreement pursuant to (i) Section
11.1(b), and Sellers' breach or failure to perform their representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder, individually or in the
aggregate, with all other breaches and failures to perform that have not been
waived in writing, are preventing or have prevented the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Section 9.2 or (ii) Section 11.1(d), then, Purchaser,
at its option, may either (i) terminate this Agreement, receive back the
entirety of the Deposit (which Sellers shall promptly return to Purchaser upon
Purchaser's proper termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section
11.3(b) without any interest accrued thereon, free of any claims by any Seller
or any other Person with respect thereto) and seek to recover damages from
Sellers up to but not exceeding the amount of the Deposit or (ii) in lieu of
terminating this Agreement, seek an injunction and order of specific
performance or other equitable relief to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, in either case, as its sole and exclusive
remedy, all other remedies being expressly waived by Purchaser.

 

(c)If this Agreement is terminated under Section 11.1 for any reason other
than the reasons set forth in Section 11.3(a) or Section 11.3(b), Sellers
shall refund to Purchaser the Deposit, without any interest accrued thereon,
free of any claims by any Seller or any other Person with respect thereto, and
the Parties will have no further obligation or liability to one another
hereunder other than as set forth in this Section 11.3, Section 11.2 and the
Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Purchaser shall not be entitled to receive interest on the Deposit,
whether the Deposit is applied against the Unadjusted Purchase Price or
returned to Purchaser pursuant to this Section 11.3(c).

 

(d)Upon termination of this Agreement, Purchaser shall destroy or return to
Sellers all title, engineering, geological and geophysical data, environmental
assessments and reports, maps, documents and other information furnished by
Sellers to Purchaser or prepared by or on behalf of Purchaser in connection
with its due diligence of the Assets, and an officer of Purchaser shall
confirm the same to Sellers in writing.

obligated to defend, at the indemnifying Party's sole expense, any litigation
or other administrative or adversarial proceeding against the indemnified
Party relating to any matter for which the indemnifying Party has agreed to
indemnify and hold the indemnified Party harmless under this Agreement.
However, the indemnified Party shall have the right to participate with the
indemnifying Party in the defense of any such matter at its own expense. The
indemnifying Party shall have the right to select counsel for any matters it
is defending, provided that the indemnified Party shall have the right to

party from all liability and Damages in respect of such third party claim or

thereto in any manner that may materially and adversely affect the indemnified
party (other than as a result of money damages covered by the indemnity). With

the indemnifying party shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of a
notice of such claim to (i) cure the Damages complained of, (ii) admit its
obligation to provide indemnification with respect to such Damages or (iii)
dispute the claim for such indemnification. If the indemnifying party does
not notify the indemnified party within such thirty (30) day period that it

the indemnifying party shall be conclusively deemed obligated to provide such
indemnification hereunder.

such Property Taxes for Tax periods ending prior to the Effective Time and a
proportionate share of the actual amount of such Taxes for a Tax period in
which the Effective Time occurs (a "Current Tax Period") determined by
multiplying such actual Taxes by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days in the Current Tax Period prior to the day that includes the
Effective Time and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the
Current Tax Period and (b) Purchaser being responsible for all such Property
Taxes for Tax periods beginning on or after the day that includes the
Effective Time and a proportionate share of the actual amount of such Taxes
for a Current Tax Period determined by multiplying such actual Taxes by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Current Tax
Period on and after the day that includes the Effective Time and the
denominator of which is the total number of days in the Current Tax Period.
Property Taxes that are based on the quantity of or the value of production of
Hydrocarbons shall be apportioned between Sellers and Purchaser based on the
number of units or value of production actually produced, as applicable,
before and at, with regard to Sellers, or after, with regard to Purchaser, the
Effective Time.

 

Section 13.3Cooperation.

 

(a)From and after the Closing Date, each Seller shall grant to Purchaser (or
its designees) reasonable access at all reasonable times to the information,
books and records relating to the Assets within the possession of Sellers
(including work papers and correspondence with taxing authorities, but
excluding work product of and attorney-client communications with any of
Sellers' legal counsel and personnel files), and shall afford Purchaser (or
its designees) the right (at Purchaser's expense) to take extracts therefrom
and to make copies thereof, to the extent reasonably necessary to permit
Purchaser (or its designees) to prepare Tax Returns for which Purchaser is
responsible hereunder, to conduct negotiations with Tax authorities, and to
implement the provisions of, or to investigate or defend any claims between
the Parties arising under, this Agreement.

  (b)From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall grant to each Seller (or
Sellers' designees) reasonable access at all reasonable times to the
information, books and records relating to the Assets within the possession of
Purchaser (including work papers and correspondence with taxing authorities,
but excluding work product of and attorney-client communications with any of
Purchaser's legal counsel and personnel files), and shall afford Sellers (or
Sellers' designees) the right (at Sellers' expense) to take extracts therefrom
and to make copies thereof, to the extent reasonably necessary to permit
Sellers (or Sellers' designees) to prepare Tax Returns for which Sellers are
responsible hereunder, to conduct negotiations with Tax authorities, and to
implement the provisions of, or to investigate or defend any claims between
the Parties arising under, this Agreement.

 

(c)Except with respect to Income Taxes, each of the Parties hereto will
preserve and retain all schedules, work papers and other documents within such
Party's possession relating to any Tax Returns of or with respect to Taxes
relating to the Assets or to any claims, audits or other proceedings with
respect thereto until the latest of (i) the expiration of the statute of
limitations (including extensions) applicable to the taxable period to which
such documents relate, (ii) the final determination of any controversy with
respect to such taxable period, (iii) the final determination of any payments
that may be required with respect to such taxable period under this Agreement,
and (iv) seven (7) years after the Closing Date.

 

(d)At either Purchaser's or Sellers' request, the other Party shall provide
reasonable access to Purchaser's or Sellers', as the case may be, and their
respective Affiliates' personnel who have knowledge of the information
described in this Section 13.3.

 

Section 13.4Like-Kind Exchange

 

. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, Purchaser shall have the
right to structure the transactions contemplated under the terms of this
Agreement as a Like-Kind Exchange. Notwithstanding any other provisions of
this Agreement, in connection with effectuating a Like-Kind Exchange, each
Party shall have the right, at or prior to the Closing Date or any subsequent
Closing, to assign all or a portion of its rights under this Agreement (the
"Assigned Rights") to a "qualified intermediary" (as that term is defined in
Treasury Regulation § 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)) or to a "qualified exchange
accommodation titleholder" (as that term is defined in U.S. Revenue Procedure
2000-37). In the event a Party (in its capacity as an exchanging party,
referred to in this Section 13.4 as an "Exchanging Party") assigns the
Assigned Rights to a "qualified intermediary" pursuant to this Section 13.4,
then such Exchanging Party agrees to notify Sellers in writing of such
assignment reasonably in advance of the Closing Date. In addition, should a
Party choose to effectuate a Like-Kind Exchange, the Parties agree to use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with one another in the
completion of such an exchange, including the execution of all documents
reasonably necessary to effectuate such a Like-Kind Exchange; provided,
however, that (a) the Closing Date shall not be delayed or affected by reason
of the Like-Kind Exchange, (b) the Exchanging Party shall effect its Like-Kind
Exchange through an assignment of the Assigned Rights to a "qualified
intermediary" or to a "qualified exchange accommodation titleholder," but such
assignment shall not release such Exchanging Party from any of its liabilities
or obligations under this Agreement and (c) the non-Exchanging Party shall
incur no additional costs, expenses, fees or Damages as a result of or in
connection with the exchange requested by the Exchanging Party. Each Party
hereby acknowledges and agrees that any assignment of this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 13.4 shall not release a Party from, or modify, any of its
respective liabilities and

  obligations (including indemnity obligations to the other Party) under this
Agreement. Neither Party, by its consent to a Like-Kind Exchange by the other
Party, shall be responsible in any way for the Exchanging Party's compliance
with the rules applicable to such other Party's Like-Kind Exchange.

 

Section 13.5Refunds

 

. Purchaser agrees to pay to Sellers the amount of any refund, credit against
Tax or other Tax benefit (including any refunds, credits or rebates) together
with any interest thereon received from a Governmental Body after the Closing
by Purchaser or its Affiliates in respect of any Property Taxes due with
respect to the ownership and operation of the Assets or the production of
Hydrocarbons therefrom (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Tax benefit
or amount attributable to a reduction in severance Taxes that may be realized
after the Effective Time but that results from payments or production for
periods prior to or at the Effective Time), prior to or at the Effective Time
(determined in the manner described in Section 13.2) to the extent not
otherwise taken into account under Section 2.4 or as an adjustment to the
Unadjusted Purchase Price under Section 3.4, within five days after such
refund, credit or other benefit is actually received or realized by Purchaser
or its Affiliates.

 

Section 13.6Audits

 

. From and after the Closing, each of Purchaser, on the one hand, and
Sellers, on the other hand (the "Tax Indemnified Person"), shall notify the
other Party in writing within 15 days of receipt by the Tax Indemnified Person
of written notice of any pending or threatened audits, adjustments, claims,
examinations, assessments or other proceedings with respect to any Taxes that
are likely to affect the liability of such other Party under this Agreement (a
"Tax Audit"). If the Tax Indemnified Person fails to give such timely notice
to the other Party, it shall not be entitled to indemnification or
reimbursement for any Taxes arising in connection with such Tax Audit to the
extent such failure to give notice actually and materially adversely affects
the other Party. If such Tax Audit relates to a Tax period that ends before
the Effective Time or a Current Tax Period for which only Sellers would be
liable to indemnify Purchaser under this Agreement, Sellers shall, at their
expense, conduct and control the defense and settlement of such Tax Audit. If
such Tax Audit relates solely to a Tax period beginning after the Effective
Time or a Current Tax Period for which only Purchaser would be liable to
indemnify Sellers under this Agreement, Purchaser shall, at its expense,
conduct and control the defense and settlement of such Tax Audit. If such Tax
Audit relates to a Current Tax Period for which both Sellers and Purchaser
could be liable under this Agreement, Purchaser shall be entitled to conduct
and control the defense and settlement of such Tax Audit, but (a) Sellers
shall be entitled to participate in any such Tax Audit relating to Taxes for
which it may be responsible hereunder at their own expense and (b) Purchasers
shall not settle, compromise or concede any portion of any Tax Audit that is
reasonably likely to affect the Tax liability of Sellers without the consent
of Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned.

 

Section 13.7Characterization of Certain Payments

 

. The Parties agree that any payments made pursuant to this Article 13,
Article 12 or Section 10.4 shall be treated for all Tax purposes as an
adjustment to the Adjusted Purchase Price unless otherwise required by
applicable Laws.

 

Section 13.8Transfer Taxes, Recording Fees and Transaction Fees

 

. Purchaser shall bear any sales, use, excise, real property transfer or
gain, gross receipts, goods and services, registration, recording fees,
capital, documentary, stamp or similar Taxes (including any

  penalties, interest or additional amounts which may be imposed with respect
thereto but not including any income or franchise taxes) (collectively,
"Transfer Taxes") imposed upon, or with respect to, the transfer of the Assets
or other transactions contemplated hereby, including any fees or payments to
lessors under the Leases (if any). Purchaser and Sellers shall cooperate in
good faith to minimize the incurrence of any such Transfer Taxes, fees or
payments, including the filing or submission of an appropriate certificate or
other evidence of exemption by Purchaser. Except as otherwise provided
herein, all costs and expenses (including legal and financial advisory fees
and expenses) incurred in connection with, or in anticipation of, this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party
incurring such expenses.

 

Section 13.9Tax Characterization

 

. For United States federal and applicable state income Tax purposes ("Tax
Purposes"), the Parties acknowledge that the Assets are considered to be held
by the Tax Partnership and the Closing will be treated as the purchase and
sale of all of the interests in the Tax Partnership. For Tax Purposes, each
Party agrees that the deemed purchase and sale of all of the interests in the
Tax Partnership pursuant to the Closing shall be treated in accordance with
Situation 2 of Revenue Ruling 99-6, 1991-1 C.B. 432. Accordingly, (i) the Tax
Partnership shall terminate under Code Section 708(b)(1)(A); (ii) Sellers
shall report gain or loss, if any, resulting from the sale of their interests
in the Tax Partnership in accordance with Code Section 741; (iii) for purposes
of classifying the acquisition by Purchaser hereunder, the Tax Partnership
shall be deemed to have made a liquidating distribution of its assets to
Sellers; and (iv) immediately following the deemed distribution, Purchaser
shall be deemed to have acquired, by purchase, all of the former Tax
Partnership's assets. Purchaser and Sellers and their Affiliates shall
report, act, and file Tax Returns in all respects and for all purposes
consistent with such treatment, and neither Purchaser nor Sellers shall take
any position (whether in audits, Tax Returns or otherwise) that is
inconsistent with such treatment unless required to do so by applicable Law.

. No Party shall assign all or any part of this Agreement, nor shall any
Party assign or delegate any of its rights or duties hereunder, without the
prior written consent of the other Party, which consent may be withheld for
any reason, and any assignment or delegation made without such consent shall
be void; provided, however, that Purchaser may, without the prior written
approval of Sellers, assign this Agreement to an Affiliate of Purchaser prior
to the Closing; provided that (i) Purchaser provides Sellers with prompt
notice of such assignment, (ii) Purchaser (for the avoidance of doubt,
Purchaser as of the Execution Date) shall remain responsible and liable for
all of its obligations and liabilities under this Agreement and the Parent
Guaranty shall remain in full force and effect and (iii) any consents obtained
by Sellers in the name of WHR Eagle Ford LLC prior to Sellers' receipt of
written notice of such assignment shall be deemed in compliance with this
Agreement with respect to the identity of the assignee thereof (i.e., Sellers
shall not be required to obtain a new consent in the name of assignee, or

Consent) to the assignee). Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

 

Section 14.7Entire Agreement

the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the
Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all prior
agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or
written, of the Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof.

 

Section 14.8Amendment

 

. This Agreement may be amended or modified only by an agreement in writing
executed by all Parties and expressly identified as an amendment or
modification.

  Section 14.9No Third Party Beneficiaries

 

. Nothing in this Agreement shall entitle any Person other than Purchaser and
Sellers to any claim, cause of action, remedy or right of any kind, except the
rights expressly provided in Section 8.1(e) and 12.2 to the Persons described
therein.

 

Section 14.10Construction

 

. The Parties acknowledge that (a) Sellers and Purchaser have had the
opportunity to exercise business discretion in relation to the negotiation of
the details of the transaction contemplated hereby, (b) this Agreement is the
result of arms-length negotiations from equal bargaining positions and (c)
Sellers and Purchaser and their respective counsel participated in the
preparation and negotiation of this Agreement. Any rule of construction that
a contract be construed against the drafter shall not apply to the
interpretation or construction of this Agreement.

 

Section 14.11Limitation on Damages

 

. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, EXCEPT IN
CONNECTION WITH ANY DAMAGES INCURRED BY THIRD PARTIES FOR WHICH
INDEMNIFICATION IS SOUGHT UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, NONE OF
PURCHASER, SELLERS NOR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES SHALL BE ENTITLED TO
CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES OR DAMAGES FOR
LOST PROFITS OR DIMINUTION IN VALUE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT,
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES WERE REASONABLY FORESEEABLE AND REGARDLESS
OF WHETHER ANY SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO SUCH DAMAGES WERE
DISCLOSED TO THE OTHER PARTY IN ADVANCE, AND, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN
THIS SENTENCE, PURCHASER AND EACH SELLER, FOR ITSELF AND ON BEHALF OF ITS
AFFILIATES, RESPECTIVELY, HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO SUCH DAMAGES IN
CONNECTION WITH OR WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF FAULT.

 

Section 14.12Recording

 

. As soon as practicable after the Closing, Purchaser shall record the
Conveyances and other assignments, if any, delivered at the Closing in the
appropriate counties as well as with any appropriate Governmental Bodies and
provide Sellers with copies of all recorded or approved instruments.

 

Section 14.13Conspicuousness

 

. SELLERS AND PURCHASER AGREE THAT, TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW
TO BE EFFECTIVE, THE PROVISIONS IN THIS AGREEMENT IN BOLD-TYPE ALL CAPS FONT
ARE "CONSPICUOUS" FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANY APPLICABLE LAW.

 

Section 14.14Time of Essence

 

. This Agreement contains a number of dates and times by which performance or
the exercise of rights is due, and the Parties intend that each and every such
date and time be the firm and final date and time, as agreed. For this
reason, each Party hereby waives and relinquishes any right it might otherwise
have to challenge its failure to meet any performance or rights election date
applicable to it on the basis that its late action constitutes substantial
performance, to require the other Party to show prejudice, or on any equitable
grounds. Without limiting the foregoing, time is of the essence in this
Agreement. If the date specified in this Agreement for giving any notice or
taking any action is not a Business Day (or if

  the period during which any notice is required to be given or any action taken
expires on a date which is not a Business Day), then the date for giving such
notice or taking such action (and the expiration date of such period during
which notice is required to be given or action taken) shall be the next day
that is a Business Day.

 

Section 14.15Delivery of Records

 

. Sellers, at Sellers' cost and expense, shall deliver the Records in
electronic form to Purchaser within ten Business Days following the Closing
and shall make the Records in physical form, if any, available to Purchaser
for pickup within 30 days following the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt,
Sellers may keep a copy of all Records for their files.

 

Section 14.16Severability

 

. The invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision of this
Agreement in any situation or jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of the other terms or provisions hereof or the validity or
enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other situation or in
any other jurisdiction, and the remaining terms and provisions shall remain in
full force and effect unless doing so would result in an interpretation of
this Agreement that is manifestly unjust.

 

Section 14.17Specific Performance

 

. The Parties agree that if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms, irreparable damage would
occur, no adequate remedy at Law would exist and damages would be difficult to
determine, and the Parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the
terms hereof and immediate injunctive relief, without the necessity of proving
the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy, in addition to any other remedy
available at Law or in equity.

 

Section 14.18Seller Representative

 

. Each Seller, by executing this Agreement, irrevocably constitutes and
appoints AEPO and its successors, acting as hereinafter provided, as such
appointing Party\'s attorney-in-fact to act on behalf of such Person in
connection with the authority granted to AEPO pursuant to this Section 14.18,
and acknowledges that such appointment is coupled with an interest. Each
Seller, by such appointment, (i) authorizes AEPO subsequent to the date hereof
to act on such appointing Party\'s behalf with respect to any and all matters
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) agrees to be bound by all agreements
and determinations made by and documents executed and delivered by AEPO
pursuant to such authority granted to AEPO hereunder; provided, however, that
the Admiral Sellers reserve the right to determine, and in no event shall AEPO
have the right or authority to determine on behalf of the Admiral Sellers, if
the condition precedent set forth in Section 9.1(i) has been met. Each
Seller, by the execution of this Agreement, expressly acknowledges and agrees
that Purchaser, each member of the Purchaser Group and any other Person shall
be entitled to solely interact with, and rely on any and all actions taken by,
AEPO acting pursuant to its authority granted under this Section 14.18 without
any liability to, or obligation to inquire of, such appointing Party.

 

Section 14.19Sellers' Liability

 

. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Parties
agree that each Seller shall be, severally and not jointly, liable for
Sellers' obligations and liabilities under this Agreement, in proportion to
the percentage of the Unadjusted Purchase Price payable to such Seller (i.e.,
with respect to any loss for which multiple Sellers are liable, such as a loss
arising from a breach by multiple Sellers of a

  representation hereunder, each such Seller shall be severally liable for a
percentage of such loss equal to the proportionate share of the Unadjusted
Purchase Price payable to such Seller as compared to the total portion of the
Unadjusted Purchase Price payable all such liable Sellers).
