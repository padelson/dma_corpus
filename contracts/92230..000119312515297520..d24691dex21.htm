AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of August 17, 2015 (this " _Agreement_
"), by and between BBandT Corporation, a North Carolina corporation (" _Parent_
"), and National Penn Bancshares, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation ("
_National Penn_ ").

 

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent and National Penn have determined
that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and their
shareholders to consummate the strategic business combination transaction
provided for herein, pursuant to which National Penn will, subject to the
terms and conditions set forth herein, merge with and into Parent (the "
_Merger_ "), so that Parent is the surviving corporation (hereinafter
sometimes referred to in such capacity as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") in
the Merger; and

WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the
Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and
this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a plan of
reorganization for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code; and

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties
and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

 

1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with the North Carolina Business Corporation Act (the " _NCBCA_ ")
and the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law and the Pennsylvania Entity
Transactions Law (collectively, the " _PBCL_ "), at the Effective Time,
National Penn shall merge with and into Parent. Parent shall be the Surviving
Corporation in the Merger, and shall continue its corporate existence under
the laws of the State of North Carolina. Upon consummation of the Merger, the
separate corporate existence of National Penn shall terminate.

 

1.2 _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m., New
York City time, at the offices of OMelveny and Myers LLP, on a date which shall
be no later than three (3) business days after the satisfaction or waiver
(subject to applicable law) of the latest to occur of the conditions set
forth in Article VII hereof (other than those conditions that by their nature
can only be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver thereof), unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing
by Parent and National Penn. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred
to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_."

 



-1- 1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
on or before the Closing Date, Parent and National Penn, respectively, shall
cause to be filed a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the
State of North Carolina (the " _North Carolina Secretary_ ") and a statement
of merger with the Pennsylvania Department of State (the " _Pennsylvania
Department_ ") (collectively, the " _Certificates of Merger_ "). The Merger
shall become effective as of the date and time specified in the Certificates
of Merger (such date and time, the " _Effective Time_ ").

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the
Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the
NCBCA and the PBCL.

1.5 _Parent Common Stock_. At and after the Effective Time, each share of
common stock, par value $5.00 per share, of Parent (the " _Parent Common
Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
remain an issued and outstanding share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation and shall not be affected by the Merger.

1.6 _Conversion of National Penn Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, National
Penn or the holder of any of the following securities:

 

(a) Subject to Sections 2.1, 2.2 and 2.4(e), each share of the common stock,
without par value, of National Penn issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (the " _National Penn Common Stock_ "), except for
shares of National Penn Common Stock owned by National Penn as treasury stock
or owned by National Penn or Parent (in each case other than shares of
National Penn Common Stock held in any National Penn Benefit Plans or related
trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held
in a fiduciary or agency capacity or as a result of debts previously
contracted (collectively, the " _Exception Shares_ ")), shall be converted,
in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Agreement, into the right
to receive the following, without interest:

 

(i) For each share of National Penn Common Stock with respect to which an
election to receive cash (a " _Cash Election_ ") has been effectively made
and not revoked or deemed revoked pursuant to Section 2.2 (collectively, the "
_Cash Election Shares_ "), an amount in cash equal to the Per Share Cash
Consideration (the " _Cash Consideration_ ");

(ii) For each share of National Penn Common Stock with respect to which an
election to receive Parent Common Stock (a " _Stock Election_ ") has been
effectively made and not revoked or deemed revoked pursuant to Section 2.2
(collectively, the " _Stock Election Shares_ "), a number of validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
Exchange Ratio (the " _Stock Consideration_ "), it being understood that upon
the Effective Time, pursuant to Section 1.5, the Parent Common Stock,
including the shares issued to former holders of National Penn Common Stock

Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.6 based on the holders
election in accordance with and subject to Sections 2.1 and 2.2 and treating
the shares of National Penn Common Stock subject to such National Penn
Restricted Stock Award in the same manner as all other shares of National Penn

Stock Plan, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and that will by its terms or by the terms of the
applicable National Penn Stock Plan or deferral election settle in connection
with the Merger (a " _Settled Deferred Stock Unit Award_ ") shall fully vest
and shall be converted into the right to receive, without interest, a payment
equal to the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.6 based on the
holders election in accordance with and subject to Sections 2.1 and 2.2 and
treating the shares of National Penn Common Stock underlying such Settled
Deferred Stock Unit Award in the same manner as all other shares of National

Award_ ") with respect to a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to
the product of (1) the number of shares of National Penn Common Stock subject
to such National Penn Deferred Stock Unit Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by (2) the Exchange Ratio, with such Converted

the agreements evidencing the grants thereof, and if applicable, the number
and kind of shares available for issuance under each such National Penn Stock
Plan shall be adjusted to reflect shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance
with the provisions of the applicable National Penn Stock Plan. On or prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall reserve for future issuance a number of
shares of Parent Common Stock at least equal to the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock that will be subject to National Penn Stock Options as a
result of the actions contemplated by Section 1.7(a). Immediately following

chartered commercial bank and a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, pursuant
to an agreement and plan of merger to be agreed upon by Parent and National
Penn, which agreement shall be in form and substance customary for mergers
similar to the Bank Merger (the " _Bank Merger Agreement_ "). Parent Bank
shall be the surviving entity in the Bank Merger and, following the Bank
Merger, the separate corporate existence of National Penn Bank shall cease.
The parties agree that the Bank Merger shall become effective immediately

EXCHANGE OF SHARES

2.1  _Proration_.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the total
number of shares of National Penn Common Stock (including shares subject to
National Penn Restricted Stock Awards, National Penn Restricted Stock Unit
Awards and Settled Deferred Stock Unit Awards) to be entitled to receive the
Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 1.6(a) shall be equal to the product
(rounded down to the nearest whole share) of (i) 0.3 and (ii) the total number
of shares of National Penn Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (including for these purposes the shares subject
to National Penn Restricted Stock Awards, National Penn Restricted Stock Unit
Awards and Settled Deferred Stock Unit Awards, but excluding the shares of
National Penn Common Stock to be cancelled as provided in Section
1.6(d)) (the " _Cash Conversion Number_ "). All other shares of National Penn
Common Stock (including shares subject to National Penn Restricted Stock
Awards, National Penn Restricted Stock Unit Awards and Settled Deferred Stock
Unit Awards, but excluding the shares of National Penn Common Stock to be
cancelled as provided in Section 1.6(d)) shall be converted into the right to
receive the Stock Consideration.

 

(b) Promptly (and in any event no later than five (5) business days) after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to effect the
allocation among holders of National Penn Common Stock, National Penn
Restricted Stock Awards, National Penn Restricted Stock Unit Awards and
Settled Deferred Stock Unit Awards of rights to receive the Cash Consideration
and the Stock Consideration as follows:

(i) If the aggregate number of shares of National Penn Common Stock (including
shares subject to National Penn Restricted Stock Awards, National Penn
Restricted Stock Unit Awards and Settled Deferred Stock Unit Awards) with
respect to which Cash Elections shall have been made (the " _Cash Election
Number_ ") exceeds the Cash Conversion Number, then all Stock Election Shares
and all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Stock Consideration, and Cash Election Shares of each holder thereof will be
converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that
number of Cash Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(A) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder by (B) a fraction,
the numerator of which is the Cash Conversion Number and the denominator of
which is the Cash Election Number (with the Exchange Agent to determine,
consistent with Section 2.1(a), whether fractions of Cash Election Shares
shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number of such holders Cash
Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration; and

(ii) If the Cash Election Number is less than the Cash Conversion Number (the
amount by which the Cash Conversion Number exceeds the Cash Election Number
being referred to herein as the " _Shortfall Number_ "), then all Cash
Election 

 



-8-  Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration
and the Non-Election Shares and Stock Election Shares shall be treated in the
following manner:

 

(A) If the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of Non-
Election Shares, then all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive the Stock Consideration, and the Non-Election Shares of each
holder thereof shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration in respect of that number of Non-Election Shares equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Non-Election Shares held by
such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Number
and the denominator of which is the total number of Non-Election Shares (with
the Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with Section 2.1(a), whether
fractions of Non-Election Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the
remaining number of such holders Non-Election Shares being converted into the
right to receive the Stock Consideration; or

(B) If the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election Shares, then
all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration, and Stock Election Shares of each holder thereof shall be
converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that
number of Stock Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(x) the number of Stock Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction,
the numerator of which is the amount by which the Shortfall Number exceeds the
total number of Non-Election Shares, and the denominator of which is the
total number of Stock Election Shares (with the Exchange Agent to determine,
consistent with Section 2.1(a), whether fractions of Stock Election Shares
shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number of such holders
Stock Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration.

2.2 _Election Procedures_. Each holder of record of shares of National Penn
Common Stock, National Penn Restricted Stock Awards, National Penn Restricted
Stock Unit Awards or Settled Deferred Stock Unit Awards to be converted into
the right to receive the Cash Consideration and/or the Stock Consideration in
accordance with, and subject to, Sections 1.6(a) and 2.1 (a " _Holder_ ")
shall have the right, subject to the limitations set forth in this Article II,
to submit an election in accordance with the following procedures:

(a) Each Holder may specify in a request made in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 2.2 (herein called an " _Election_ ") (i) the
number of shares of National Penn Common Stock owned by such Holder (or
subject to such National Penn Restricted Stock Awards, National Penn
Restricted Stock Unit Awards or Settled Deferred Stock Unit Awards) with
respect to which such Holder desires to make a Stock Election and (ii) the
number of shares of National Penn Common Stock owned by such Holder (or
subject to such National Penn Restricted Stock Awards, National Penn
Restricted Stock Unit Awards or Settled Deferred Stock Unit Awards) with
respect to which such Holder desires to make a Cash Election.

(b) Parent shall prepare a form reasonably acceptable to National Penn,
including appropriate and customary transmittal materials in such form as
prepared by Parent and reasonably acceptable to National Penn (the " _Form of
Election_ "), so as to permit Holders to exercise their right to make an
Election.

 



-9- (c) Parent (i) shall initially make available and mail the Form of Election
not less than twenty (20) business days prior to the anticipated Election
Deadline to Holders of record as of the business day prior to such mailing
date, and (ii) following such mailing date, shall use all reasonable efforts
to make available as promptly as possible a Form of Election to any
stockholder, holder of National Penn Restricted Stock Awards, holder of
National Penn Restricted Stock Unit Awards or holder of Settled Deferred Stock
Unit Awards who requests such Form of Election prior to the Election
Deadline. The time period between such mailing date and the Election Deadline
is referred to herein as the " _Election Period_ ".

 

(d) Any Election shall have been made properly only if the Exchange Agent
shall have received, during the Election Period, a Form of Election properly
completed and signed (including duly executed transmittal materials included
in the Form of Election) and accompanied by any Old Certificates representing
all certificated shares to which such Form of Election relates or by an
appropriate customary guarantee of delivery of such Old Certificates, as set
forth in such Form of Election, from a member of any registered national
securities exchange or a commercial bank or trust company in the United
States. As used herein, unless otherwise agreed in advance by the parties, "
_Election Deadline_ " means 5:00 p.m. local time (in the city in which the
principal office of the Exchange Agent is located) on the date which the
parties shall agree is as near as practicable to two (2) business days
preceding the Closing Date. The Parties shall cooperate to issue a press
release reasonably satisfactory to each of them announcing the date of the
Election Deadline not more than fifteen (15) business days before, and at
least five (5) business days prior to, the Election Deadline.

(e) Any Holder may, at any time during the Election Period, change or revoke
his or her Election by written notice to the Exchange Agent prior to the
Election Deadline accompanied by a properly completed and signed revised Form
of Election. If any Election is not properly made with respect to any shares
of National Penn Common Stock or any shares subject to National Penn
Restricted Stock Awards, National Penn Restricted Stock Unit Awards or Settled
Deferred Stock Unit Awards (none of Parent, National Penn nor the Exchange
Agent being under any duty to notify any Holder of any such defect), such
Election shall be deemed to be not in effect, and the shares of National Penn
Common Stock, or any shares subject to National Penn Restricted Stock Awards,
National Penn Restricted Stock Unit Awards or Settled Deferred Stock Unit
Awards, covered by such Election shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed to be
Non-Election Shares, unless a proper Election is thereafter timely made.

 

(f) Any Holder may, at any time during the Election Period, revoke his or her
Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the
Election Deadline or by withdrawal prior to the Election Deadline of his or
her Old Certificates, or of the guarantee of delivery of such Old
Certificates, previously deposited with the Exchange Agent. All Elections
shall be automatically deemed revoked upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of
written notification from the parties that this Agreement has been terminated
in accordance with the terms hereof.

 

(g) Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Form of Election, Parent,
in the exercise of its reasonable, good faith discretion, shall have the
right to make all determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of this
Agreement, governing (i) the validity of the Forms of Election and compliance
by any Holder with the Election procedures set forth 

 



-10-  herein, (ii) the method of issuance and delivery of New Certificates
representing the whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock into which
shares of National Penn Common Stock are converted in the Merger and (iii)
the method of payment of cash for shares of National Penn Common Stock
converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock.

 

2.3 _Parent to Make Merger Consideration Available_. At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a
bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to
National Penn (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of
Old Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, (a) New
Certificates representing the aggregate Stock Consideration to be issued
pursuant to Section 1.6 and exchanged pursuant to Section 2.4(a), and (b) cash
in an amount sufficient to pay (i) the aggregate Cash Consideration payable
to holders of National Penn Common Stock (other than National Penn Restricted
Stock Awards) and (ii) cash in lieu of any fractional shares (such cash and
New Certificates described in the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), together
with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto (after giving effect
to Section 6.10), being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").
The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent, provided that no such investment or losses thereon shall
affect the amount of Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Old
Certificates. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be paid to Parent.

2.4 _Exchange of Shares_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later
than five (5) business days thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent
to mail to each holder of record of one or more Old Certificates representing
shares of National Penn Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time
that have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the
applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to Article I and that has not
theretofore submitted its Old Certificates with a Form of Election, a letter
of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Old Certificates shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Old Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Old Certificates in exchange for the
Stock Consideration and/or the Cash Consideration which such holder shall
have become entitled to receive in accordance with, and subject to, Sections
1.6(a), 2.1 and 2.2, and any cash in lieu of fractional shares which the
shares of National Penn Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate or
Old Certificates shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant
to this Agreement as well as any dividends or distributions to be paid
pursuant to Section 2.4(b). From and after the Effective Time and the
completion of the allocation procedure set forth in Section 2.1, upon proper
surrender of an Old Certificate or Old Certificates for exchange and
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such properly completed
letter of transmittal or Form of Election, as applicable, duly executed, the
holder of such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a New Certificate
representing the Stock Consideration to which such holder of National Penn
Common Stock shall have become entitled to receive in accordance with, and
subject to, Sections 1.6(a), 2.1 and 2.2 and/or (ii) a check representing the
amount of (A) the Cash Consideration which such holder has the right
to receive in respect of the surrendered Old Certificate or Old Certificates
in accordance with, and subject to, Sections 1.6(a), 2.1 and 2.2, (B) any cash
in lieu of fractional

 



-11-  shares which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the
surrendered Old Certificate or Old Certificates pursuant to Section 2.4(e) and
(C) any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 2.4(b), and the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be
paid or accrued on the Cash Consideration or any cash in lieu of fractional
shares payable to holders of Old Certificates. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Sections 2.4 and 2.2, each Old Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive, upon surrender, the applicable Merger Consideration and any cash in
lieu of fractional shares or in respect of dividends or distributions as
contemplated by this Section 2.4.

 

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Parent Common
Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate until
the holder thereof shall surrender such Old Certificate in accordance with
this Article II. After the surrender of an Old Certificate in accordance with
this Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive
any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon,
which theretofore had become payable with respect to the Stock Consideration
which the shares of National Penn Common Stock represented by such Old
Certificate have been converted into the right to receive (after giving
effect to Section 6.10).

(c) If any New Certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock is to
be issued in a name other than that in which the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall
be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an
appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer,
and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent
in advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the
issuance of a New Certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock in
any name other than that of the registered holder of the Old Certificate or
Old Certificates surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been
paid or is not payable.

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of National Penn of the shares of National Penn Common Stock
that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Old Certificates representing such shares are
presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged for the applicable Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional
shares and dividends or distributions that the holder presenting such Old
Certificates is entitled to, as provided in this Article II.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no New
Certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Old Certificates, no
dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable
on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a shareholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional
share, Parent shall pay to each former shareholder of National Penn who
otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash
(rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the average of the
closing-sale prices of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange LLC
(the

 



-12-  " _NYSE_ ") (as reported by _The Wall Street Journal_ ) for the five (5)
full trading days ending on the day preceding the Closing Date (the " _Parent
Share Closing Price_ ") by (ii) the fraction of a share (rounded to the
nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent Common Stock
which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section
1.6 and subject to Section 2.1.

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of National Penn for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall
be paid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former shareholders of National Penn
who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look
only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration,
cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and
distributions on the Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect of each former
share of National Penn Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined
pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, National Penn, the Surviving
Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any
former holder of shares of National Penn Common Stock for any amount
delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws.

 

(g) Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange
Agent to deduct and withhold, from the applicable Merger Consideration, any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, cash dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to this Section 2.4 or any other amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of National
Penn Common Stock or National Penn Equity Awards such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the
case may be, and paid over to the appropriate governmental authority, the
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of National Penn Common Stock or National Penn Equity
Award in respect of which the deduction and withholding was made by Parent or
the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

 

(h) In the event any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as
Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Old Certificate, the
Exchange Agent or Parent, as applicable, will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Old Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration and
any cash in lieu of fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof pursuant
to this Agreement.

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF NATIONAL PENN

 

Except (i) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by National Penn
to Parent concurrently herewith (the " _National Penn Disclosure Schedule_
"); _provided_ , that (a) no

 



-13-  such item is required to be set forth as an exception to a representation or
warranty if its absence would not result in the related representation or
warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (b) the mere inclusion of an item
in the National Penn Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation
or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by National Penn that such item
represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or that such
item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect and (c) any
disclosures made with respect to a section of this Article III shall be deemed
to qualify (1) any other section of this Article III specifically referenced
or cross-referenced and (2) other sections of this Article III to the extent
it is reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding the absence of a
specific cross reference) from a reading of the disclosure that
such disclosure applies to such other sections or (ii) as disclosed in any
National Penn SEC Reports filed by National Penn prior to the date hereof (but
disregarding risk factor disclosures contained under the heading "Risk
Factors," or disclosures of risks set forth in any "forward-looking
statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly non-specific
or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), National Penn hereby
represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 

(a) National Penn is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and is a
bank holding company duly registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of
1956, as amended (" _BHC Act_ ") and has not elected to be treated as
financial holding company under the BHC Act. National Penn has the corporate
power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted. National Penn is duly
licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature
of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the
properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on National Penn. As used in this
Agreement, the term " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means, with respect to
Parent, National Penn or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, a
material adverse effect on (i) the business, properties, assets, liabilities,
results of operations or financial condition of such party and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole ( _provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect to
this clause (i), Material Adverse Effect shall not be deemed to include the
impact of (A) changes, after the date hereof, in U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") or applicable regulatory accounting
requirements, (B) changes, after the date hereof, in laws, rules or
regulations of general applicability to companies in the industries in which
such party and its Subsidiaries operate, or interpretations thereof by courts
or Governmental Entities, (C) changes, after the date hereof, in global,
national or regional political conditions (including the outbreak of war or
acts of terrorism) or in economic or market conditions affecting the financial
services industry generally and not specifically relating to such party or
its Subsidiaries, (D) the failure, in and of itself, to meet earnings
projections or internal financial forecasts or any decrease in the market
price of National Penn Common Stock, but not including the underlying causes
thereof, (E) disclosure or consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or actions expressly required by this Agreement in contemplation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, or (F) actions or omissions taken pursuant
to the written consent or request of Parent, in the case of National Penn, or
National Penn, in the case of Parent; except, with respect to subclauses (A),
(B), (C) or (D), to the extent that the effects of such change are
materially 

 



-14-  disproportionately adverse to the business, properties, assets, liabilities,
results of operations or financial condition of such party and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other companies in the
industry in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate) or (ii) the ability
of such party to timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. As
used in this Agreement, the word " _Subsidiary_ " when used with respect to
any party, means any corporation, partnership, limited liability company,
bank, trust or other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated,
which is (x) consolidated with such party for financial reporting purposes or
(y) directly or indirectly (through one or more intermediaries) controlled by
or owned more than fifty percent by such party (for the avoidance of doubt,
with respect to National Penn, the statutory business trusts related to
the trust preferred securities of National Penn (the " _Trust Preferred
Securities_ ") are Subsidiaries of National Penn). True and complete copies of
the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of National Penn (the "
_National Penn Articles_ ") and the Amended and Restated By-Laws of National
Penn (the " _National Penn Bylaws_ "), as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, have previously been made available by National Penn to Parent.

(b) Each Subsidiary of National Penn (a " _National Penn Subsidiary_ ") (i) is
duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is
recognized under applicable law, in good standing in all jurisdictions
(whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of
property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and in
which the failure to be so qualified would reasonably be likely, either
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on
National Penn and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own
or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now
conducted. There are no restrictions on the ability of any Subsidiary of
National Penn to pay dividends or distributions except, in the case of a
Subsidiary that is a regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends or
distributions generally applicable to all such regulated entities. The deposit
accounts of each Subsidiary of National Penn that is an insured depository
institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "
_FDIC_ ") through the Deposit Insurance Fund (as defined in Section 3(y) of
the Federal Deposit Insurance Act of 1950) to the fullest extent permitted by
law, all premiums and assessments required to be paid in connection therewith
have been paid when due, and no proceedings for the termination of such
insurance are pending or, to National Penns knowledge, threatened. Section
3.1(b) of the National Penn Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete
list of all Subsidiaries of National Penn as of the date hereof. There is no
person whose results of operations, cash flows, changes in shareholders
equity or financial position are consolidated in the financial statements of
National Penn other than the National Penn Subsidiaries.

equity based awards under any of the National Penn Stock Plans. All of the
issued and outstanding shares of National Penn Common Stock have been duly
authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership
thereof. No bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness that have the
right to vote on any matters on which shareholders of National Penn may vote

are outstanding.

 

(b) There are no voting trusts, shareholder agreements, proxies or other
agreements in effect pursuant to which National Penn or any of
its Subsidiaries has a contractual or other obligation with respect to the
voting or transfer of the National Penn Common Stock or other equity interests

applicable) pursuant to the laws, rules or regulations of the United States,
any state, any foreign entity, or any Regulatory Agency, and have paid all
fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith, except where the
failure to file such report, registration or statement or to pay such fees and
assessments, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on National Penn. Except for
examinations of National Penn and its Subsidiaries conducted by a Regulatory
Agency in the ordinary course of business, no Regulatory Agency has initiated
or has pending any proceeding or, to the knowledge of National Penn,
investigation into the business or operations of National Penn or any of its
Subsidiaries since January 1, 2012, except where such proceedings or
investigation would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on National Penn. There is no
unresolved violation, criticism, or exception by any Regulatory Agency with
respect to any report or statement relating to any examinations or
inspections of National Penn or any of its Subsidiaries which would reasonably
be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on National Penn.

 

(b) An accurate and complete copy of each final registration statement,
prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed with or
furnished to the SEC by National Penn or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ ") or the
Exchange Act, as the case may be, since January 1, 2012 (the " _National Penn
SEC Reports_ "), is publicly available. No such National Penn SEC Report, at
the time filed, furnished or communicated (and, in the case of registration
statements and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness and the dates
of the relevant meetings, respectively), contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except that
information filed or furnished as of a later

 



-19-  date (but before the date of this Agreement) shall be deemed to modify
information as of an earlier date. As of their respective dates, all National
Penn SEC Reports filed or furnished under the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act complied as to form in all material respects with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto. As of the date of this Agreement,

3.6 _Financial Statements_.

 

(a) The financial statements of National Penn and its Subsidiaries included

the related notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in
accordance with, the books and records of National Penn and its Subsidiaries,
(ii) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated results
of operations, cash flows, changes in shareholders equity and consolidated

case of unaudited statements to year-end audit adjustments normal in nature
and amount), (iii) complied, as of their respective dates of filing with the
SEC, in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with
the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv)
have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the

the notes thereto. The books and records of National Penn and its
Subsidiaries have been since January 1, 2012, and are being, maintained in all
material respects in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and
accounting requirements and reflect only actual transactions. KPMG LLP has
not resigned (or informed National Penn that it intends to resign) or been
dismissed as independent public accountants of National Penn as a result of or
in connection with any disagreements with National Penn on a matter of
accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing
scope or procedure.

(b) Except as would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on National Penn, neither National
Penn nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature whatsoever
(whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to
become due), except for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved
against on the consolidated balance sheet of National Penn included in its
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2015
(including any notes thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice since June 30, 2015, or in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of National Penn and
its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of National Penn or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-
direct control that would not reasonably be likely to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on National Penn.
National Penn (x) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act)

 



-20-  to ensure that material information relating to National Penn, including its
Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and the chief
financial officer of National Penn by others within those entities as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and to
make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), and (y) has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to
National Penns outside auditors and the audit committee of National Penns
Board of Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses
in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect National Penns ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information, and (ii) to the knowledge of National Penn, any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in National Penns internal controls over
financial reporting. These disclosures were made in writing by management to
National Penns auditors and audit committee and a copy has previously been
made available to Parent. To the knowledge of National Penn, there is
no reason to believe that National Penns outside auditors and its chief
executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations
adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due.

(d) Since January 1, 2012, (i) neither National Penn nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of National Penn, any director, officer,
auditor, accountant or representative of National Penn or any of its
Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of
any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or,
to the knowledge of National Penn, oral, regarding the accounting or auditing
practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect to
loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of National Penn
or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls,
including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that National
Penn or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or
auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing National Penn or any of
its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by National Penn or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities

National Penn or any committee thereof or to the knowledge of National Penn,
to any director or officer of National Penn.

which has been previously provided to Parent.

National Penn nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any, and there are no
pending or, to National Penns knowledge, threatened, legal, administrative,
arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions or governmental or
regulatory investigations of any nature against National Penn or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their current or former directors or executive
officers.

 

(b) There is no material injunction, order, judgment, decree, or regulatory
restriction imposed upon National Penn, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets

Merger, would apply to the Surviving Corporation or any of its affiliates).

 

3.10 _Taxes and Tax Returns_.

 

(a) Each of National Penn and its Subsidiaries has duly and timely filed
(taking into account all applicable extensions) all material Tax Returns in
all jurisdictions in which Tax Returns are required to be filed by it, and all
such Tax Returns are true, correct, and complete in all material respects.

owing to any employee, creditor, shareholder, independent contractor or other
third party. Neither National Penn nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted
any extension or waiver of the limitation period applicable to any material
Tax that remains in effect. The federal income Tax Returns of National Penn
and its Subsidiaries for all years up to and including 2010 have been

asserted or assessed against National Penn or any of its Subsidiaries. There
are no pending or threatened in writing disputes, claims, audits, examinations
or other proceedings regarding any material Taxes of National Penn and its
Subsidiaries or the assets of National Penn and its Subsidiaries. In the last
six years, neither National Penn nor any of its Subsidiaries has been informed
in writing by any jurisdiction that the jurisdiction believes that National
Penn or any of its Subsidiaries was required to file any Tax Return that was
not filed. National Penn has made available to Parent true, correct, and
complete copies of any private letter ruling requests, closing agreements or
gain recognition agreements with respect to Taxes requested or executed in the
last six years. There are no Liens for material Taxes (except Taxes not yet
due and payable) on any of the assets of National Penn or any of
its Subsidiaries. Neither National Penn nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
party to or is bound by any Tax sharing, allocation or

 



-22-  indemnification agreement or arrangement (other than such an agreement or
arrangement exclusively between or among National Penn and its Subsidiaries).
Neither National Penn nor any of its Subsidiaries (A) has been a member of an
affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return (other than a
group the common parent of which was National Penn) or (B) has any liability
for the Taxes of any person (other than National Penn or any of its
Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by
contract or otherwise. Neither National Penn nor any of its Subsidiaries has

related transactions)" within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code of

Code) in a distribution of stock intended to qualify for tax-free treatment
under Section 355 of the Code. Neither National Penn nor any of its
Subsidiaries has participated in a "listed transaction" within the meaning of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b)(2). At no time during the past five
years has National Penn been a United States real property holding
corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code. Neither
National Penn nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to include any
material item of income in, or to exclude any material item of deduction from,
taxable income in any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the
Closing Date as a result of any (i) change in method of accounting, (ii)
closing agreement, (iii) intercompany transaction or excess loss account
described in Treasury Regulations under Section 1502 of the Code (or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign law), (iv) installment sale or

sponsored by National Penn or any of its Subsidiaries or any National Penn
ERISA Affiliate for the benefit of any current or former employee, officer,
director or independent contractor of National Penn or any of its Subsidiaries

(b) National Penn has heretofore made available to Parent true and complete
copies of each material National Penn Benefit Plan and the following related
documents, to the extent applicable, (i) the most recent copy of any summary

its Subsidiaries has, within the past three years, taken any action to take
corrective action or make a filing under any voluntary correction program of
the IRS, Department of Labor or any other Governmental Entity with respect to
any National Penn Benefit Plan, and neither National Penn nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any knowledge of any plan defect that would qualify for
correction under any such program.

 

(d) Section 3.11(d) of the National Penn Disclosure Schedule identifies each
National Penn Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code (the " _National Penn Qualified Plans_ "). The IRS has
issued a favorable determination letter with respect to each National Penn
Qualified Plan and the related trust, which letter has not been revoked (nor
has revocation been threatened in writing), and, to the knowledge of National
Penn, there are no existing circumstances and no events have occurred that
would have a material adverse effect on the qualified status of any National
Penn Qualified Plan or the related trust or increase the costs relating
thereto. No trust funding any National Penn Benefit Plan is intended to meet
the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.

 

(e) Each National Penn Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) and any
award thereunder, in each case that is subject to Section 409A of the Code,
has (i) since January 1, 2005, been maintained and operated, in all material
respects, in good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code and IRS
Notice 2005-1 and (ii) since January 1, 2009, been, in all material respects,

such plan is in "at-risk" status for purposes of Section 430 of the Code, (ii)
no reportable event within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for which

(g) None of National Penn and its Subsidiaries nor any National Penn ERISA
Affiliate has, at any time during the last six years, contributed to or been
obligated to contribute to any plan that is a "multiemployer plan" within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ ") or a plan
that has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under
common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a " _Multiple
Employer Plan_ "), and none of National Penn and its Subsidiaries nor any
National Penn ERISA Affiliate has incurred any material liability to a
Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan as a result of a complete or
partial withdrawal (as those terms are defined in Part I of Subtitle E of
Title IV of ERISA) from a Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan that
has not been satisfied in full.

(h) Neither National Penn nor any of its Subsidiaries sponsors, has sponsored

the prior three years through the date hereof, have been timely made or paid
in full or, to the extent not required to be made or paid on or before the
date hereof, have been fully reflected on the books and records of National
Penn.

 

(j) There are no pending or, to National Penns knowledge, threatened claims
(other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or
arbitrations that have been asserted or instituted, and, to National Penns
knowledge, no set of circumstances exists that may reasonably give rise to a
claim or lawsuit, against the National Penn Benefit Plans, any
fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the National Penn Benefit
Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the National Penn
Benefit Plans that would, in any case, reasonably be expected to result in any
material liability of National Penn or any of its Subsidiaries to the PBGC,
the IRS, the Department of Labor, any Multiemployer Plan, a Multiple Employer
Plan, any participant in a National Penn Benefit Plan or any other party.

 

(k) None of National Penn and its Subsidiaries nor any National Penn ERISA
Affiliate nor any other person, including any fiduciary, has engaged in any
"prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section
406 of ERISA), which could subject any of the National Penn Benefit Plans or
their related trusts, National Penn, any of its Subsidiaries, any National
Penn ERISA Affiliate or any person that National Penn or any of its
Subsidiaries has an obligation to indemnify, to any material tax or material
penalty imposed under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

 



-25- (l) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction
with any other event) result in, cause or accelerate the vesting,
exercisability or delivery of, increase in the amount or value of, any
payment, right or other benefit or result in any forgiveness of indebtedness
to, any employee, officer, director or individual independent contractor of
National Penn or any of its Subsidiaries, or result in any funding of or
limitation on the right of National Penn or any of its Subsidiaries to amend,
merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any National Penn
Benefit Plan or related trust. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, no amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the
form of benefits) by National Penn or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof
or as a result of such transactions in conjunction with any other event) will
be an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Code.

(m) No National Penn Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement
of Taxes under Section 409A or 4999 of the Code, or otherwise. National Penn
has made available to Parent preliminary copies of Section 280G calculations
(whether or not final), which to the best of its knowledge are true, correct
and complete, with respect to any disqualified individual who is a "named
executive officer" of National Penn as defined in Item 402 of Regulation S-K
promulgated under the Securities Act in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(n) No National Penn Benefit Plan is subject to the laws of any jurisdiction
outside the United States.

or bound by any collective bargaining or similar agreement with any labor
organization, or work rules or practices agreed to with any labor organization
or employee association applicable to employees of National Penn or any of its
Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of National Penn, there are no organizing
efforts by any union or other group seeking to represent any employees of
National Penn or any of its Subsidiaries.

since December 31, 2012, held, all licenses, franchises, permits and
authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses
and ownership of their respective properties, rights and assets under and
pursuant to each (and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable
in connection therewith), except where neither the cost of failure to hold
nor the cost of obtaining and holding such license, franchise, permit or
authorization (nor the failure to pay any fees or assessments) would, either
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on National Penn, and to the knowledge of National Penn no
suspension or cancellation of any such necessary license, franchise, permit or
authorization is threatened. National Penn and each of its Subsidiaries have
complied in all material respects with and are not in material default or

Subsidiaries, or to the knowledge of National Penn, any director, officer,
employee, agent or other person acting on behalf of National Penn or any of
its Subsidiaries has, directly or indirectly, (i) used any funds of National
Penn or any of its Subsidiaries for unlawful contributions, unlawful gifts,
unlawful entertainment or other expenses relating to political activity, (ii)
made any unlawful payment to foreign or domestic governmental officials or

Subsidiaries acts as a fiduciary, including accounts for which National Penn
or any of its Subsidiaries serves as a trustee, agent, custodian, personal
representative, guardian, conservator or investment adviser, in accordance
with the terms of the applicable governing documents and applicable Laws,
except where the failure to so administer such accounts would not reasonably
be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on National Penn. Since December 31, 2012, none of National
Penn or any of its Subsidiaries, or, to National Penns knowledge, any
director, officer, or employee of National Penn or its Subsidiaries, has
committed any breach of trust or fiduciary duty with respect to any such
fiduciary account, and the accountings for each such fiduciary account are
true and correct and accurately reflect the assets of such fiduciary account,
except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on National Penn.

National Penn, and, to the knowledge of National Penn, there is no reasonable
basis for any such proceeding, claim, action or investigation. National Penn
is not subject to any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter agreement or

shall be deemed to qualify (1) any other section of this Article

to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business
conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets
owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except
where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not, either
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent. True and complete copies of the Parent Articles and
Parent Bylaws, as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously

(b) Each Subsidiary of Parent (a " _Parent Subsidiary_ ") (i) is duly

(a) The financial statements of Parent and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the Parent SEC Reports (including the related
notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance
with, the books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash
flows, changes in shareholders equity and consolidated financial position of
Parent and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of the
respective dates therein set forth (subject in the case of
unaudited statements to year-end audit adjustments normal in nature and
amount), (iii) complied, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC,
in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv)
have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the
periods involved, except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in
the notes thereto. The books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries have
been since January 1, 2012, and are being, maintained in all material respects
in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting
requirements and reflect only actual transactions. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
has not resigned (or informed Parent that it intends to resign) or been
dismissed as independent public accountants of Parent as a result of or in
connection with any disagreements with Parent on a matter of
accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or
auditing scope or procedure.

 



-40- (b) Except as would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, neither Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether
absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due),
except for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the
consolidated balance sheet of Parent included in its Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2015 (including any notes thereto)
and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice since June 30, 2015, or in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Parent and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Parent or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct
control that would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent (i) has implemented
and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule
13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to
Parent, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive
officer and the chief financial officer of Parent by others within those
entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures and to make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (ii) has disclosed, based
on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Parents outside
auditors and the audit committee of Parents Board of Directors (x) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation
of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of
the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parents
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information,
and (y) to the knowledge of Parent, any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Parents
internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures were made in
writing by management to Parents auditors and audit committee and a copy has
previously been made available to National Penn. To the knowledge of Parent,
there is no reason to believe that Parents outside auditors and its chief
executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations
adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due.

 

(d) Since January 1, 2012, (i) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor, to the knowledge of Parent, any director, officer, auditor, accountant
or representative of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or
otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or, to the knowledge of Parent,
oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods (including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-
downs, charge-offs and accruals) of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has
engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney
representing Parent or any of its 

 



-41-  Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
has reported evidence of a material violation of securities laws, breach of
fiduciary duty or similar violation by Parent or any of its officers,
directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of Parent or any
committee thereof or to the knowledge of Parent, to any director or officer of
Parent.

 

4.7 _Broker s Fees_. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary nor any of

Agreement and (ii) the acquisition by Parent of The Bank of Kentucky
Corporation and Susquehanna Bancshares, Inc., Parent and its Subsidiaries have
carried on their respective businesses in all material respects in the
ordinary course.

proceedings, claims, actions or governmental or regulatory investigations of
any nature against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their current
or former directors or executive officers.

(b) There is no material injunction, order, judgment, decree, or regulatory
restriction imposed upon Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (or that, upon consummation of the Merger,

4.10 _Compliance with Applicable Law_. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries
hold, and have at all times since December 31, 2012, held, all licenses,
franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of
their respective businesses and ownership of their respective properties,
rights and assets under and pursuant to each (and have paid all fees and
assessments due and payable in connection therewith), except where neither the
cost of failure to hold nor the cost of obtaining and holding such license,
franchise, permit or authorization (nor the failure to pay any fees or
assessments) would, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, and to the knowledge of
Parent no suspension or cancellation of any such necessary license, franchise,
permit or authorization is threatened. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries
have complied in all material respects with and are not in material default or
violation under any applicable law, statute, order, rule or regulation of any

each of Parents Subsidiaries that is an insured depository institution is
"well-capitalized" and "well managed" (as those terms are defined in
applicable regulations). Each of Parents Subsidiaries that is an insured
depository institution has a Community Reinvestment Act rating of

individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent,
none of Parent, or its Subsidiaries, or to the knowledge of Parent, any

Agreement (including the Merger and the Bank Merger), and to comply with the
terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all such Governmental Entities. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, as soon as practicable and in no event later than
thirty (30) business days after the date of this Agreement, Parent
and National Penn shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to,
each prepare and file any applications, notices and filings required in order
to

 



-50-  obtain the Requisite Regulatory Approvals. Parent and National Penn shall
each use, and shall each cause their applicable Subsidiaries to use,
reasonable best efforts to obtain each such Requisite Regulatory Approval as
promptly as reasonably practicable. The parties shall cooperate with each
other in connection therewith (including the furnishing of any information and
any reasonable undertaking or commitments that may be required to obtain the
Requisite Regulatory Approvals). Parent and National Penn shall have the right
to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will consult the
other on, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange
of information, all the information relating to National Penn or Parent, as
the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which appears in
any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or
any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto
shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each party will provide
the other with copies of any applications and all correspondence relating
thereto prior to filing, other than any portions of material filed in
connection therewith that contain competitively sensitive business or other
proprietary information filed under a claim of confidentiality. The parties
hereto agree that they will consult with each other with respect to the
obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third
parties and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the
other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the
transactions contemplated herein. Each party shall consult with the other in
advance of any meeting or conference with any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, give the other party and/or its
counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and
National Penn shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) avoid the entry
of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, and (ii) avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as
possible, including proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by
consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of businesses or assets of Parent, National Penn and their
respective Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall require Parent or
National Penn or their respective Subsidiaries to take, or agree to take, any
actions specified in this Section 6.1 that, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on Parent
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or on National Penn and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (in each case, measured on a scale relative to
National Penn and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) (a " _Materially
Burdensome Regulatory Condition_ ").

 

(d) Parent and National Penn shall, upon request, furnish each other with all
information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers
and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement, the S-4 or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent,
National Penn or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Parent and National Penn
agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that none

 



-51-  of the information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in (i) the S-4 will, at the time the S-4 and each
amendment or supplement thereto, if any, is filed or becomes effective under
the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading and (ii) the Proxy Statement and any
amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date it is filed with the SEC, at
the date of mailing to shareholders and at the time of National Penns meeting
of its shareholders to consider and vote upon approval of this Agreement,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which such statement was
made, not misleading. Each of Parent and National Penn further agrees that if
it becomes aware that any information furnished by it would cause any of the
statements in the S-4 or the Proxy Statement to be false or misleading with
respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly inform the
other party thereof and to take appropriate steps to correct the S-4 or the
Proxy Statement.

 

(e) Parent and National Penn shall promptly advise each other upon receiving
any communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is
required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that
any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of
any such approval will be materially delayed.

6.2 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws, each of Parent and
National Penn, for the purposes of verifying the representations and
warranties of the other and preparing for the Merger and the other matters
contemplated by this Agreement, shall, and shall cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants,
counsel, advisors and other representatives of the other party, access,
during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to
all its properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel, information
technology systems, and records, and each shall cooperate with the other
party in preparing to execute after the Effective Time conversion or
consolidation of systems and business operations generally (including by
entering into customary confidentiality, non-disclosure and
similar agreements with such service providers and/or the other party), and,
during such period, each of Parent and National Penn shall, and shall cause
its respective Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party such
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such party
may reasonably request. Each party shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to minimize any interference with the other partys regular business
operations during any such access. Neither Parent nor National Penn nor any
of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to
disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or
prejudice the rights of Parents or National Penns, as the case may be,
customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in
possession or control of such information (after giving due consideration to
the existence of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement
between the parties) or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order,
judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to
the date of this Agreement. The parties hereto will make appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the
restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

 



-52- (b) Each of Parent and National Penn shall hold all information furnished by
or on behalf of the other party or any of such partys Subsidiaries or
representatives pursuant to Section 6.2(a) in confidence to the extent
required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the confidentiality
agreement, dated June 5, 2015, between Parent and National Penn (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the
representations and warranties of the other set forth herein. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give either party, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the operations of the other party prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

(d) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.2(a), National Penn shall use
reasonable best efforts to provide data processing, item processing and other
processing support or outside contractors to assist in performing all tasks
reasonably required and requested by Parent to result in a successful
conversion of the data and other files and records of National Penn and its
Subsidiaries to Parents production environment (the " _Conversion_ "), in
such a manner sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that a successful
Conversion will occur at, as may be elected in writing by Parent to National
Penn after the date hereof and prior to filing the application for approval of
the Merger and the Bank Merger from the Federal Reserve Board, (x) the time
that is immediately following the Merger and the Bank Merger (such an
election in this clause (x), a " _Simultaneous Conversion Election_ ") or (y)
such later date as may be specified by Parent, in each case, subject to any
applicable laws, including laws regarding the exchange of information and
other laws regarding competition. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, National Penn shall, subject to any such applicable laws: (i)
reasonably cooperate with Parent to establish a project plan as specified
by Parent to effectuate the Conversion; (ii) use its commercially reasonable
efforts to have National Penns outside contractors continue to support both
the Conversion effort and its ongoing needs until the Conversion can be
established; (iii) provide, or use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain from any outside contractors, all data or other files and layouts
reasonably requested by Parent for use in planning the Conversion, as soon as
reasonably practicable; (iv) provide reasonable access to National Penns
personnel and facilities and, with the consent of its outside contractors, its
outside contractors personnel and facilities, to the extent necessary to
enable the Conversion effort to be completed on schedule; and (v) give notice
of termination, conditioned upon the completion of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, of the contracts of outside data, item and
other processing contractors or other third-party vendors to which National
Penn or any of its Subsidiaries are bound if requested to do so by Parent to
the extent permitted by such contracts; _provided_ , that National Penn shall
not be required to take any action that would prejudice or adversely affect
in any material respect its rights under any such contracts in the event the
Closing does not occur. Parent shall promptly reimburse National Penn for any
reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred in connection with the
actions described in this Section 6.2(d).

6.3 _National Penn Shareholder Approval_.

 

(a) National Penn shall take, in accordance with applicable law and the
National Penn Articles and National Penn Bylaws, all action necessary to
convene a meeting of

 



-53-  its shareholders (the " _National Penn Meeting_ ") to be held as soon as
reasonably practicable after the S-4 is declared effective for the purpose of
obtaining the Requisite National Penn Vote required in connection with this
Agreement and the Merger, and, if so desired and mutually agreed, upon other
matters of the type customarily brought before an annual or special meeting of
shareholders to adopt a merger agreement. The Board of Directors of National
Penn shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the shareholders of
National Penn the Requisite National Penn Vote, including by communicating to
its shareholders its recommendation (and including such recommendation in the
Proxy Statement) that they adopt and approve this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and National Penn shall engage a proxy
solicitor reasonably acceptable to Parent to assist in the solicitation of
proxies from shareholders relating to the Requisite National Penn Vote.
However, subject to Section 8.1 and Section 8.2, if the Board of Directors of
National Penn, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with
respect to financial matters, its financial advisor, determines in good faith
that it would more likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary
duties under applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement, then in
submitting this Agreement to its shareholders, the Board of Directors of
National Penn may submit this Agreement to its shareholders without
recommendation (although the resolutions approving this Agreement as of the
date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the Board of
Directors of National Penn may communicate the basis for its lack of a
recommendation to its shareholders in the Proxy Statement or an appropriate
amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by law; provided, that
the Board of Directors of National Penn may not take any actions under this
sentence unless (i) it gives Parent at least five (5) business days prior
written notice of its intention to take such action and a reasonable
description of the event or circumstances giving rise to its determination to
take such action (including, in the event such action is taken by the Board of
Directors of National Penn in response to an Acquisition Proposal, the latest
material terms and conditions and the identity of the third party in any such
Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment or modification thereof, or describe in
reasonable detail such other event or circumstances) and (ii) at the end of
such notice period, the Board of Directors of National Penn takes into
account any amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by Parent and
after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to
financial matters, its financial advisor, determines in good faith that
it would nevertheless more likely than not result in a violation of its
fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement.
Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new
Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section 6.3 and will require a new
notice period as referred to in this Section 6.3.

(b) National Penn shall adjourn or postpone the National Penn Meeting, if, as
of the time for which such meeting is originally scheduled there are
insufficient shares of National Penn Common Stock represented (either in
person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business
of such meeting, or if on the date of such meeting National Penn has not
received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares necessary to
obtain the Requisite National Penn Vote; _provided_ , that National Penn
shall not be required to adjourn or postpone the National Penn Meeting more
than three times pursuant to this first sentence of Section 6.3(b).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless this Agreement has
been terminated in accordance with its terms, the National Penn Meeting shall
be convened and this Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of
National Penn at the National Penn Meeting, for the purpose of voting on the
adoption of this Agreement and the other matters contemplated hereby, and
nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve National Penn of such
obligation.

 



-54- 6.4 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Subject in all respects to Section 6.1
and Section 6.3 of this Agreement, each of Parent and National Penn shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to
comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on such party
or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and the Bank Merger and,
subject to the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to
cooperate with the other party to obtain) any material consent, authorization,
order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any
other third party that is required to be obtained by National Penn or Parent
or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger, the
Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

6.5 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall cause the shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE,
subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

6.6 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to provide each continuing employee of National Penn and its Subsidiaries with
compensation and employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries; _provided_ that Parent may satisfy its obligation under this
Section 6.6(a) for a transitional period by providing compensation and
employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to
those provided by National Penn or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (A) for a
period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary of
the Closing Date, provide severance payments and benefits to each continuing
employee of National Penn and its Subsidiaries that are no less favorable than
the severance payments and benefits set forth on Section 6.6(a)(i) of the
National Penn Disclosure Schedule; and (B) provide the other benefits as set
forth on Section 6.6(a)(ii) of the National Penn Disclosure Schedule.

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries
in which any employees of National Penn or its Subsidiaries become eligible to
participate on or after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), Parent shall
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to: (i) waive all pre-existing
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to such employees and their eligible
dependents under any New Plans, except to the extent such pre-existing
conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the analogous
National Penn Benefit Plan, (ii) provide each such employee and their eligible
dependents with credit for any co-payments or co-insurance and deductibles
paid prior to the Effective Time under a National Penn Benefit Plan (to the
same extent that such credit was given under the analogous National Penn
Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any
applicable deductible, co-payment, co-insurance or maximum

 



-55-  out-of-pocket requirements under any New Plans, and (iii) recognize all
service of such employees with National Penn and its Subsidiaries for all
purposes in any New Plan to the same extent that such service was taken into
account under the analogous National Penn Benefit Plan prior to the Effective
Time; _provided_ that the foregoing service recognition shall not apply (A) to
the extent it would result in duplication of benefits for the same period of
services, (B) for purposes of any defined benefit pension plan or benefit plan
that provides retiree welfare benefits, or (C) to any benefit plan that is a
frozen plan or provides grandfathered benefits. 

(c) The Surviving Corporation agrees to assume and honor all National Penn
Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms as of the date hereof or as
modified consistent with the terms of this Agreement.

(d) National Penn shall either continue National Penns 401(k) plan(s) or if,
and only if, requested by Parent in writing not later than ten (10) business
days prior to the Effective Time, National Penn shall take all actions as are
necessary, including the adoption of board of directors or
compensation committee resolutions or consents, to terminate National Penns
401(k) plan(s), effective no later than the day immediately prior to the
Effective Time, with such termination to be subject to the occurrence of the
Effective Time. Prior to taking any such action, National Penn shall provide
Parent with a copy of such resolutions or consent in connection with such plan
termination, and shall consider any comments provided by Parent in good faith.
Parent shall cause the 401(k) plans of Parent or its Affiliates to accept as
soon as practicable rollover distributions from current and former employees
of National Penn and its Subsidiaries with respect to such individuals
account balances (including loans), if elected by any such individuals.

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer,
director or consultant of National Penn or any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates any right to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving
Corporation, National Penn, or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall
interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the
Surviving Corporation, National Penn, Parent or any Subsidiary or affiliate
thereof to discharge or terminate the services of any employee, officer,
director or consultant of National Penn or any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause.
Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify
any National Penn Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or employment
plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the ability
of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates to
amend, modify or terminate any particular National Penn Benefit Plan, New Plan
or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement
after the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of the final
sentence of Section 9.11, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any person, including any current or
former employee, officer, director or consultant of National Penn or any of
its Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, each present and

 



-56-  former director, officer or employee of National Penn and its Subsidiaries
(in each case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the " _National
Penn Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, whether arising before or after the Effective Time, arising in
whole or in part out of, or pertaining to, the fact that such person is or was
a director, officer or employee of National Penn or any of its Subsidiaries
and pertaining to matters, acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time, including matters, acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred by such National Penn
Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law;
_provided_ that the National Penn Indemnified Party to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking (in a reasonable and customary form) to repay
such advances if it is ultimately determined that such National Penn
Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification.

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance maintained by National Penn (
_provided_ , that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies
with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the
insured) with respect to claims against the present and former officers and
directors of National Penn or any of its Subsidiaries arising from facts or
events which occurred at or before the Effective Time (including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to expend, on an annual
basis, an amount in excess of 250% of the aggregate annual premium paid as of
the date hereof by National Penn for such insurance (the " _Premium Cap_ "),
and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium
Cap, then the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of
insurance which provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium
equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, National Penn, in
consultation with, but only upon the consent of Parent, may (and at the
request of Parent, National Penn shall use its reasonable best efforts to)
obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six-year "tail" policy under
National Penns existing directors and officers insurance policy providing
equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if and to the
extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate,
does not exceed the Premium Cap.

 

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
National Penn Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If
the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns shall
consolidate with or merge into any other entity and not be the continuing
or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, transfer all or
substantially all of its assets or deposits to any other entity or engage in
any similar transaction, then in each case, the Surviving Corporation will
cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation will expressly assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.7.

 



-57- (d) The obligations of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and National Penn
under this Section 6.7 shall not be terminated or modified in a manner so as
to adversely affect any National Penn Indemnified Party or any other person
entitled to the benefit of this Section 6.7 without the prior written consent
of the affected National Penn Indemnified Party.

6.8 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement (including, any merger between a Subsidiary of Parent, on the one
hand, and a Subsidiary of National Penn, on the other) or to vest the
Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights,
approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, the
proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their
respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may
be reasonably requested by Parent. Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent
hereby expressly assumes the due and punctual performance and observance of
each and every covenant and condition in the Investment Agreement, dated as of
October 5, 2010, between National Penn and Warburg Pincus Private Equity X,
L.P., to be performed and observed by National Penn. At or immediately prior
to the Effective Time, National Penn shall deliver written notice of non-
renewal (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent) under the
contracts set forth on Section 6.8 of the National Penn Disclosure Schedule.

6.9  _Advice of Changes_. Parent and National Penn shall each promptly advise
the other party of any fact, change, event or circumstance known to it (i)
that has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it
or (ii) which it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or
constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or
covenants contained herein or that reasonably could be expected to give rise,
individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in Article
VII; _provided_ , that any failure to give notice in accordance with the
foregoing shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this Section 6.9 or
the failure of any condition set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied,
or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party failing to
give such notice, in each case unless the underlying fact, change, event or
circumstance would independently result in a failure of the conditions set
forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied.

6.10 _Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement, each of Parent and
National Penn shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends
in respect of Parent Common Stock and National Penn Common Stock and the
record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of
the parties hereto that holders of National Penn Common Stock shall not
receive two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, in any quarter with
respect to their shares of National Penn Common Stock and any shares of Parent
Common Stock any such holder receives in exchange therefor in the Merger.

6.11 _Advisory Board; Community Commitment_.

 

(a) At or promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall invite each
member of the Board of Directors of National Penn as of the date of this
Agreement (other than those individuals specified in Section 6.11(a) of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule) to serve as paid members of one or more regional
advisory boards in accordance with the terms set forth in Section 6.11(a) of
the Parent Disclosure Schedule.

 



-58- (b) On the Closing Date, Parent shall create a charitable foundation, or
support an existing charitable foundation acceptable to National Penn, in
Pennsylvania dedicated to providing ongoing economic development support to
the Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania and Berks County, Pennsylvania communities, in
accordance with Section 6.11(b) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule. On the
Closing Date, Parent or National Penn shall contribute to the foundation an
amount in cash equal to $5,000,000. Parent will designate the individuals
listed on Section 6.11(b) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule to serve as
trustees or designated advisors of the foundation prior to Closing.

(c) Following the Effective Time, Parent will use its reasonable best efforts
to support a continued meaningful employee presence in the Lehigh Valley,
Pennsylvania and Berks County, Pennsylvania.

 

6.12 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) National Penn shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and cause its
and their officers, directors, agents, advisors and
representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate
inquiries or proposals with respect to, (ii) engage or participate in any
negotiations with any person concerning, or (iii) provide any confidential or
nonpublic information or data to, or have or participate in any discussions
with, any person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that,
prior to the receipt of the Requisite National Penn Vote, in the event
National Penn receives an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal,
it may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries
Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic information or
data and participate in such negotiations or discussions to the extent that
its Board of Directors concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of
its outside counsel, and with respect to financial matters, its financial
advisor) that failure to take such actions would be more likely than not to
result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law; _provided_
, _further_ , that, prior to providing any nonpublic information permitted to
be provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso, National Penn shall have
provided such information to Parent, and shall have entered into a
confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no less favorable
than the Confidentiality Agreement, which confidentiality agreement shall not
provide such person with any exclusive right to negotiate with National Penn.
National Penn will, and will cause its Representatives to, immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations
conducted before the date of this Agreement with any person other than Parent
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. National Penn will promptly (and in
any event within one (1) business day) advise Parent following receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry which would reasonably be expected to lead
to an Acquisition Proposal, and the substance thereof (including the terms and
conditions of and the identity of the person making such inquiry or
Acquisition Proposal), and will promptly (and in any event within one (1)
business day) advise Parent of any related developments, discussions and
negotiations on a current basis, including any amendments to or revisions of
the terms of such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal. National Penn shall use its
reasonable best efforts to enforce any existing confidentiality or standstill
agreements to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in accordance
with the terms thereof. Unless this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with its terms, National Penn shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and cause its and their officers, directors, agents, advisors and
representatives not to on its behalf, enter into any letter

 



-59-  of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement, merger agreement, or other agreement (other than a confidentiality
agreement referred to and entered into in accordance with this Section
6.12(a)) relating to any Acquisition Proposal. As used in this Agreement, "
_Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean, other than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, any offer, or proposal relating to, or any third party
indication of interest in, (i) any acquisition or purchase, direct or
indirect, of 25% or more of the consolidated assets of National Penn and its
Subsidiaries or 25% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of
National Penn or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute 25% or more of the consolidated assets of National Penn,
(ii) any tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that,
if consummated, would result in such third party beneficially owning 25% or
more of any class of equity or voting securities of National Penn or its
Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 25% or
more of the consolidated assets of National Penn, or (iii) a merger,
consolidation, share exchange or other business combination involving National
Penn or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate,
constitute 25% or more of the consolidated assets of National Penn, except,
in each case, any sale of whole loans and securitizations in the ordinary
course of business and any _bona fide_ internal reorganization.

 

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent National Penn or its
Board of Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the
Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that such
Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant
to such Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.

 

6.13 _Public Announcements_. National Penn and Parent shall each use their
reasonable best efforts (a) to develop a joint communications plan, (b) to
ensure that all press releases and other public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint
communications plan, and (c) except in respect of any announcement required
by (i) applicable law or regulation, (ii) a request by a Governmental Entity
or (iii) an obligation pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any
securities exchange, National Penn and Parent agree to consult with each
other and to obtain the advance approval of the other party (which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before issuing any
press release or, to the extent practical, otherwise making any
public statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

6.14 _Change of Method_. Parent may at any time change the method of
effecting the Merger and the Bank Merger (including by providing for the
merger of National Penn with a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent) if and to
the extent requested by Parent, and National Penn agrees to enter into
such amendments to this Agreement as Parent may reasonably request in order
to give effect to such restructuring; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
change or amendment shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the
Merger Consideration provided for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect
the Tax treatment of the Merger with respect to National Penns shareholders
or (iii) be reasonably likely to cause the Closing to be prevented or
materially delayed or the receipt of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals to be
prevented or materially delayed.

 



-60- 6.15 _Restructuring Efforts_. If National Penn shall have failed to obtain the
Requisite National Penn Vote at the duly convened National Penn Meeting or
any adjournment or postponement thereof, each of the parties shall in good
faith use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the
transaction provided for herein ( _provided_ , _however_ , that no party
shall have any obligation to agree to (i) alter or change any material term of
this Agreement, including the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration
provided for in this Agreement or (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of
the Merger with respect to National Penns shareholders) and/or (in the case
of National Penn) resubmit this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby (or as restructured pursuant to this Section 6.15) to its shareholders
for adoption.

6.16 _Takeover Statutes_. Neither Parent nor National Penn shall take
any action that would cause any Takeover Statute to become applicable to this
Agreement, the Merger, or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby,
and each of Parent and National Penn shall take all necessary steps to exempt
(or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover Statute now or hereafter in
effect. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may purport to be, applicable
to the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent and National Penn
will grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate
or minimize the effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including, if necessary, challenging the
validity or applicability of any such Takeover Statute.

 

6.17 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. National Penn and Parent
agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain those officers
and directors of National Penn subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (the " _National Penn Insiders_ "), both
prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that National Penn
Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the
Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection
with the conversion of shares of National Penn Common Stock and National Penn
Equity Awards in the Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose
agree to the provisions of this Section 6.17. The Board of Directors of Parent
and of National Penn, or a committee of non-employee directors thereof (as
such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act),
shall promptly, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, take all such
steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause (i) any dispositions of
National Penn Common Stock or National Penn Equity Awards and (ii) any
acquisitions of Parent Common Stock and/or equity awards of Parent by any
National Penn Insiders who, immediately following the Merger, will be officers
or directors of the Surviving Corporation subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, in each case, pursuant to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to be exempt from liability
pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law.

6.18 _Litigation and Claims_. Each of Parent and National Penn shall promptly
notify each other in writing of any action, arbitration, audit, hearing,
investigation, litigation, suit, subpoena or summons issued, commenced,
brought, conducted or heard by or before, or otherwise involving, any
Governmental Entity or arbitrator pending or, to the knowledge of Parent or
National Penn, as applicable, threatened against Parent, National Penn or any
of their

 



-61-  respective Subsidiaries that (a) questions or would reasonably be expected
to question the validity of this Agreement, the Bank Merger Agreement or the
other agreements contemplated hereby or thereby or any actions taken or to be
taken by Parent, National Penn or their respective Subsidiaries with respect
hereto or thereto, or (b) seeks to enjoin or otherwise restrain the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. National Penn shall give Parent
the opportunity to participate at its own expense in the defense or settlement
of any shareholder litigation against National Penn and/or its directors or
affiliates relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and no such settlement shall be agreed without Parents prior written consent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

6.19 _Assumption of National Penn Debt_. Parent agrees to execute and deliver,
or cause to be executed and delivered, by or on behalf of the Surviving
Company, at or prior to the Effective Time, one or more supplemental
indentures, guarantees, and other instruments required for the due assumption
of National Penns obligations in respect of its outstanding debt, Trust
Preferred Securities, guarantees, securities, and other agreements to the
extent required by the terms of such debt, guarantees, securities, and other
agreements.

 

6.20 _No Control of Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct the operations of National Penn or its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall give National
Penn, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations
of Parent or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, each of Parent and National Penn shall exercise, consistent
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and
supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

ARTICLE VIII

 

TERMINATION

8.1  _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after adoption of this Agreement by the
shareholders of National Penn:

 

(a) by mutual consent of Parent and National Penn in a written instrument;

 

(b) by either Parent or National Penn if any Governmental Entity that must
grant a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger or
the Bank Merger and such denial has become final and nonappealable or any
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final
nonappealable order, injunction or decree permanently enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the Merger or the Bank
Merger, unless the failure to obtain a Requisite Regulatory Approval shall be
due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform
or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein;

(c) by either Parent or National Penn if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before the first anniversary of the date of this Agreement
(the " _Termination Date_ "), unless the failure of the Closing to occur by
such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this
Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party
set forth herein;

(d) by either Parent or National Penn ( _provided_ , that the terminating
party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or other agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a breach of any
of the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties
(or any such representation or warranty shall cease to be true) set forth in
this Agreement on the part of National Penn, in the case of a termination by
Parent, or Parent, in the case of a termination by National Penn, which breach
or failure to be true, either individually or in the aggregate with all other
breaches by such party (or failures of such representations or warranties to
be true), would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date,
the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.2, in the case of a
termination by Parent, or Section 7.3, in the case of a termination by
National Penn, and which is not cured by the earlier of the Termination Date
and the date that is 45 days following written notice to National Penn, in
the case of a termination by Parent, or Parent, in the case of a termination
by National Penn, or by its nature or timing cannot be cured during such
period; or

 



-65- (e) by Parent, if (i) prior to such time as the Requisite National Penn Vote
is obtained, National Penn or the Board of Directors of National Penn (A)
submits this Agreement to its shareholders without a recommendation for
approval, or otherwise withdraws or materially and adversely modifies (or
discloses its intention to withdraw or materially and adversely modify) its
recommendation as contemplated by Section 6.3(a), or recommends to its
shareholders an Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger, or (B) materially
breaches its obligations under Section 6.3 or 6.12; or (ii) a tender offer or
exchange offer for 20% or more of the outstanding shares of National Penn
Common Stock is commenced (other than by Parent or a Subsidiary thereof), and
the Board of Directors of National Penn recommends that the shareholders of
National Penn tender their shares in such tender or exchange offer or
otherwise fails to recommend that such shareholders reject such tender offer
or exchange offer within the ten (10) business day period specified in
Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (b), (c),
(d) or (e) of this Section 8.1 shall give written notice of such termination
to the other party in accordance with Section 9.6, specifying the provision or
provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is effected.

 

8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Parent or National
Penn as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void
and have no effect, and none of Parent, National Penn, any of their respective
Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them shall have any
liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) Sections 3.3(a), 3.7,
4.3(a), 4.7, 6.2(b) and this Section 8.2 and Article IX shall survive any
termination of this Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, neither Parent nor National Penn shall
be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its
fraud or willful and material breach of any provision of this Agreement
(which, in the case of National Penn, shall include the loss to the holders
of National Penn Common Stock and National Penn Equity Awards of the economic
benefits of the Merger, including the loss of the premium offered to the
shareholders of National Penn).

 

(b) (i) In the event that after the date of this Agreement a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known to senior management of
National Penn or shall have been made directly to its shareholders generally
or any person shall have publicly announced (and not withdrawn) an Acquisition
Proposal with respect to National Penn and (x) (A) thereafter this Agreement
is terminated by either Parent or National Penn pursuant to Section 8.1(c)
without the Requisite National Penn Vote having been obtained or (B)
thereafter this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d),
and (y) prior to the date that is fifteen (15) months after the date of such
termination, National Penn enters into a definitive agreement or consummates a
transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same
Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above), then National Penn shall, on
the earlier of the date it enters into such definitive agreement and the date
of consummation of such transaction, pay Parent, by wire transfer of same day
funds, a fee equal to $64,500,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "); _provided_ ,
that for purposes of this Section 8.2(b), all references in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal to "25%" shall instead refer to "50%".

 



-66- (ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant
to Section 8.1(e), then National Penn shall pay Parent, by wire transfer of
same day funds, the Termination Fee as promptly as reasonably practical after
the date of termination (and, in any event within three (3) business days
thereafter). 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting the
right of any party to recover liabilities or damages, the maximum aggregate
amount of fees payable by National Penn under this Section 8.2 shall be equal
to the Termination Fee.

(d) Each of Parent and National Penn acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other
party would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if National Penn
fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.2, and, in
order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit which results in a
judgment against National Penn for the Termination Fee or any portion
thereof, National Penn shall pay the costs and expenses of Parent (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit. In
addition, if National Penn fails to pay the amounts payable pursuant to
this Section 8.2, then National Penn shall pay interest on such overdue
amounts (for the period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was
originally required to be paid and ending on the date that such overdue amount
is actually paid in full) at a rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" (as
announced by JPMorgan Chase and Co. or any successor thereto) in effect on the
date on which such payment was required to be made for the period commencing
as of the date that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid.
The amounts payable by National Penn pursuant to Section 8.2(b) constitute
liquidated damages and not a penalty, and, except in the case of fraud or
willful misconduct, shall be the sole monetary remedy of Parent in the event
of a termination of this Agreement specified in such section.

ARTICLE IX
