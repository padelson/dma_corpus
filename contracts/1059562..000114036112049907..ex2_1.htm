EARNOUT PAYMENT

   
---|---

conditions in Section 2.6(b), as additional Purchase Price, Buyer shall pay to
Sellers' Representative on behalf of Sellers the following amounts:

  

  

     |  

(i)

  |  

if a Change of Control is consummated during the Earnout Period, the lesser of
(A) the product of (1) the Annualized Earnout Amount multiplied by (2) the
Earnout Multiple or (B) Forty Million Dollars and 00/100 ($40,000,000) (the
amount paid is the "Annualized Earnout Payment"); and

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(ii)

  |  

(A) the lesser of (1) the product of (I) the Earnout Amount multiplied by (II)
the Earnout Multiple or (2) Forty Million Dollars and 00/100 ($40,000,000.00)
minus (B) the Annualized Earnout Payment, if any (the amount paid is the
"Earnout Payment").

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
will the sum of the Annualized Earnout Payment and the Earnout Payment exceed
Forty Million Dollars and 00/100 ($40,000,000.00) and in no event will either
the Annualized Earnout Payment or the Earnout Payment be less than zero.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

15  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The Earnout Payment and Annualized Earnout Payment will be paid by Buyer
within fifteen (15) days after the determination of such amounts,
respectively, is final, binding, and conclusive on the parties in accordance
with this Section 2.6 (the date of payment of the Earnout Payment being the
"Earnout Payment Date"); provided, however, that portion, if any, of the
Earnout Payment that is attributable to Adjusted EBITDA in excess of Thirty
One Million Dollars and 00/100 ($31,000,000.00) (the "Excess Earnout") will be
paid, subject to the last sentence of this Section 2.6(b), by Buyer on the
first anniversary of the Earnout Payment Date (the "Second Earnout Payment
Date"). Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Excess Earnout, if any, will not be due, and Buyer will have no obligation to
pay any Excess Earnout, if either Charlie Newell or Henry Newell has been
terminated by Buyer or any Affiliate for Cause or have voluntarily terminated
their employment with Buyer or any Affiliate other than for Good Reason prior
to the Second Earnout Payment Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the death or
disability (as such term may be defined in the Executive Employment Agreement
of Charlie Newell and Henry Newell) of either Charlie Newell or Henry Newell
will not affect the rights of the Sellers to receive any Annualized Earnout
Payment or Earnout Payment.

  

  

(c) No interest shall accrue, and Sellers shall not be entitled to any
interest, on the Annualized Earnout Payment or Earnout Payment under this
Agreement.

  

  

(d) Buyer shall maintain separate records for the Acquired Companies during
the Earnout Period sufficient to adequately track the impact of any changes to
accounting polices and adjustments to EBITDA. Promptly following the
completion of the audited financial statements for of the Earnout Period,
Buyer shall prepare (i) a consolidated income statement of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for the Earnout Period, which shall be prepared in accordance
with GAAP, except as set forth in the definition of Adjusted EBITDA (the
"Income Statement"), and (ii) a computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA,
showing separately each of the adjustments made to EBITDA to arrive at
Adjusted EBITDA (the "Computation Notice"). Buyer shall deliver the Income
Statement and the Computation Notice to Sellers' Representative within fifteen
(15) days following the date on which the Buyer files its annual report on
Form 10-K with the SEC for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, but in any
event no later than April 15, 2014.

  

  

(e) Upon execution of such access letters as may reasonably be required by
Buyer, Sellers' Representative and its Representatives shall be given
reasonable access during reasonable business hours to (and, at their expense,
copies of) all Buyer's and its Representatives books, records, and other
documents, including work papers, worksheets, notes, and schedules used in
preparation of the Income Statement and its computation of EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA in the Computation Notice for the purpose of reviewing the Income
Statement and the Computation Notice in each case, other than work papers that
Buyer considers proprietary and which are not reasonably necessary for
Sellers' Representative and its Representatives to evaluate the Income
Statement and computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, such as internal
control documentation, engagement planning, time control and audit signoff,
and quality control work papers.

  

  

(f) If, within forty five (45) days following delivery of the Income Statement
and the Computation Notice to Sellers' Representative, Sellers' Representative
has not delivered Buyer notice of an objection as to any amount set forth on
the Income Statement or the computation of EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA in the
Computation Notice (which notice shall state in reasonable detail the basis of
Sellers' Representative's objection) (the "Objection Notice"), the Adjusted
EBITDA as computed by Buyer will be final, binding, and conclusive on the
parties.

  

  

(g) If Sellers' Representative timely delivers Buyer an Objection Notice, and
if Sellers' Representative and Buyer fail to resolve the issues raised in the
Objection Notice within thirty (30) days after delivering the Objection
Notice, Sellers' Representative and Buyer shall submit the issues remaining in
dispute for resolution to Deloitte LLP or if Deloitte LLP is providing
accounting services to Buyer or is otherwise unable or unwilling to serve in
such capacity, a recognized national or regional independent accounting firm
mutually acceptable to Buyer and Sellers' Representative) (the "Independent
Accountants").

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

16  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(h) The parties shall negotiate in good faith in order to seek agreement on
the procedures to be followed by the Independent Accountants including
procedures with regard to the presentation of evidence. If the parties are
unable to agree upon procedures within ten (10) days of the submission to the
Independent Accountants, the Independent Accountants shall establish such
procedures giving due regard to the intention of the parties to resolve
disputes as promptly, efficiently, and inexpensively as possible, which
procedures may, but need not be, those proposed by either Buyer or Sellers'
Representative. The Independent Accountants shall be directed to resolve only
those issues in dispute and render a written report on their resolution of
disputed issues with respect to the Income Statement and the Computation
Notice as promptly as practicable, but no later than sixty (60) days after the
date on which the Independent Accountants are engaged. The determination of
Adjusted EBITDA by the Independent Accountants will be based solely on written
submissions of Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers' Representative, on the
other hand, and will not involve independent review. Any determination by the
Independent Accountants will not be outside the range established by the
amounts in (i) the Income Statement and the computation of EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA in the Computation Notice proposed by Buyer, and (ii) Sellers'
Representative's proposed adjustments thereto. Such determination will be
final, binding and conclusive on the parties.

  

  

     |  

(i)

  |  

If the computation of Adjusted EBITDA is submitted to the Independent
Accountants for resolution:

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(i)

  |  

Sellers' Representative and Buyer shall execute any agreement required by the
Independent Accountants to accept their engagement pursuant to this Section
2.6;

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(ii)

  |  

Sellers' Representative and Buyer shall promptly furnish or cause to be
furnished to the Independent Accountants such work papers and other documents
and information relating to the disputed issues as the Independent Accountants
may request and are available to that party or its accountants or other
Representatives, and shall be afforded the opportunity to present to the
Independent Accountants, with a copy to the other party, any other written
material relating to the disputed issues;

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(iii)

  |  

the determination by the Independent Accountants, as set forth in the report
to be delivered by the Independent Accountants to both Sellers' Representative
and Buyer, will include all the changes in the Income Statement and the
computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the Computation Notice required
as a result of the determination made by the Independent Accountants; and

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(iv)

  |  

Sellers and Buyer shall each bear one-half of the fees and costs of the
Independent Accountants; provided however that the engagement agreement
referred to in clause (i) above may require the parties to be bound jointly
and severally to the Independent Accountants for those fees and costs, and in
the event Sellers and Buyer pay to the Independent Accountants any amount in
excess of one-half of the fees and costs of their engagement, the other
part(ies) agree(s) to reimburse Sellers or Buyer, as applicable, upon demand
to the extent required to equalize the payments made by Sellers and Buyer with
respect to the fees and costs of the Independent Accountants.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

(j) In the event of a Change of Control is consummated during the Earnout
Period, Buyer and Sellers shall comply with the provisions of Section 2.6(b)
through (i), but all references to the Earnout Period shall be deemed to mean
the Annualized Earnout Period, all references to Adjusted EBITDA shall be
deemed to mean the Annualized Adjusted EBITDA, and the deadline for deliveries
in Section 2.6(d) shall be 45 days after the consummation of the Change of
Control.

  

  

(k) The Annualized Earnout Payment and Earnout Payment are additional
consideration for the Common Units. The Company, Buyer and each Seller shall
prepare and files its income Tax Returns in a manner consistent with treatment
of the Annualized Earnout Payment and Earnout Payment as additional
consideration for the Common Units. The Company, Buyer and each Seller shall
not take any position, whether in Tax Returns, Tax examinations or otherwise,
that is inconsistent with such treatment of the Annualized Earnout Payment or
Earnout Payment as additional consideration for the Common Units, unless
required to do so by applicable law.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

17  

  

 

 

 

  

  

    

2.7

  |  

WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

A working capital adjustment amount (which may be a positive or negative
number), with a negative number to be called the Working Capital Deficit,
which reduces the Purchase Price, and a positive number to be called the
Working Capital Surplus, which increases the Purchase Price will be determined
as follows (and, for the avoidance of doubt, such adjustment amount will
exclude the effects of the restatement described in Section 8.13):

  

  

(a) Buyer shall cause the Acquired Companies to close their books as of the
Closing Date.

  

  

(b) Upon completion of the Closing of the books as described in Section 2.7(a)
(which will occur no later than fifteen (15) days after the date on which
Buyer files its annual report on Form 10-K with the SEC for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2012) but in any event no later than April 15, 2013 (the
"Completion Date"), Buyer shall cause the Acquired Companies to prepare (i)
the Closing Balance Sheet; and (ii) the Working Capital Schedule, which will
include Buyer's calculation of the Net Working Capital and the Working Capital
Deficit or Working Capital Surplus, if any, based on the Closing Balance
Sheet. Buyer shall deliver to Sellers' Representative the Closing Balance
Sheet and Working Capital Schedule, as soon as reasonably practicable after
the Completion Date, but in no event later than five (5) days after the
Completion Date. At the time Buyer delivers the Closing Balance Sheet and the
Working Capital Schedule, Buyer shall also deliver the working papers utilized
by Buyer to prepare the Working Capital Schedule and all other materials
reasonably requested by Sellers' Representative relating to the Working
Capital Schedule.

  

  

(c) Sellers' Representative shall have forty five (45) days following receipt
of the Closing Balance Sheet and Working Capital Schedule (the "Notice
Period") during which to notify Buyer in writing of any dispute of any item
contained therein, which notice shall set forth in detail the basis for such
dispute (the "Working Capital Objection Notice"). During the Notice Period,
Buyer shall cause the Company to provide the Sellers' Representative
reasonable access to the Company's accounting records to verify the accuracy
of the Working Capital Schedule and Closing Balance Sheet. In the event
Sellers' Representative does not notify Buyer of any dispute within the Notice
Period or notifies Buyer within the Notice Period that it does not dispute any
item contained therein, the Working Capital Schedule delivered by Buyer and
Buyer's calculation of the Working Capital Deficit or Working Capital Surplus,
if any, shall be, and shall be deemed to be, the final Working Capital
Schedule (the "Final Working Capital Schedule"), and the Closing Balance Sheet
shall be, and shall be deemed to be, the final Closing Balance Sheet and in
each case shall be final and binding upon Buyer and Sellers upon the
expiration of the Dispute Period (or upon the receipt of the Sellers'
Representative notice of no dispute).

  

  

(d) If Sellers' Representative timely delivers the Working Capital Objection
Notice, Buyer and Seller shall reasonably cooperate in good faith to resolve
any such dispute as promptly as possible, and upon such resolution, the Final
Working Capital Schedule and Final Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in
accordance with the agreement of Buyer and Sellers. In the event Buyer and
Sellers are unable to resolve any such dispute within thirty (30) days
following Buyer's receipt of Working Capital Objection Notice (the "Dispute
Period"), such dispute shall be submitted to, and all issues having a bearing
on such dispute shall be resolved by the Independent Accountant. During the
Dispute Period, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith and promptly
provide and give reasonable access to all financial data having a reasonable
relationship to the disputed amounts to the requesting party.

  

  

(e) In resolving any such dispute, the Independent Accountant shall consider
only those items or amounts in the Working Capital Schedule and the Closing
Balance Sheet as to which Sellers have disagreed, but shall receive and review
a memorandum from each party outlining the party's arguments and financial
back up concerning its position. The Independent Accountant shall act as an
arbitrator, with the opportunity to review all relevant information concerning
this Agreement, the interpretation of its provisions regarding this Section
and the Working Capital of the Company and the Closing Balance Sheet and its
determination of the Final Working Capital Schedule and the Working Capital
Deficit or Working Capital Surplus, if any, based thereon and the Closing
Balance Sheet shall be final and binding on the parties. The parties shall
direct the Independent Accountant to use commercially reasonable efforts to
complete its work within thirty (30) days following its engagement. Fifty
percent (50%) of the expenses and fees of the Independent Accountant shall be
borne by Buyer and the other fifty percent (50%) by Sellers.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

18  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(f) Within five (5) Business Days following the determination of the Final
Working Capital Schedule, if there is a Working Capital Deficit, Sellers shall
pay to Buyer, in cash, an amount equal to the Working Capital Deficit, in
cash, and if there is a Working Capital Surplus, Buyer shall pay to Sellers,
in cash, an amount equal to the Working Capital Surplus. For purposes of
clarification, no amount will be payable by either party if the Net Working
Capital is determined to fall within the Target Working Capital.

CAPITALIZATION OF COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

(a) Sellers and the Preferred Holders constitute all of the members of the
Company. The membership interests in the Company, and all rights of the
members of the Company under the Organizational Documents of the Company, are
represented by units of membership interest. The Organizational Documents of
the Company provide that 1,058,810 Common Units and 98,340 Preferred Units of
membership interest, constituting the Units, are issued and outstanding and
constitute one hundred percent (100%) of the ownership interests in the
Company. The Units are not represented by certificates. Sellers are the owners
(of record and beneficially) of all of the Common Units, free and clear of all
Encumbrances including any restriction on the right of any Seller to transfer
the Common Units, and the membership interests and rights represented thereby,
to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement. The Preferred Holders are the owners (of
record and beneficially) of all of the Preferred Units, free and clear of all
Encumbrances including any restriction on the right of any Preferred Holder to
transfer the Preferred Units, and the membership interests and rights
represented thereby, to the Company pursuant to the Preferred Units Assignment
(defined below). The assignments, endorsements, membership powers, or other
instruments of transfer to be delivered by each Seller to Buyer at the Closing
will be sufficient to transfer such Seller's entire interest as a member of
the Company, including such Seller's entire interest in the Common Units and
all rights under the Organizational Documents of the Company, (of record and
beneficially) owned by such Seller. Upon execution and delivery of the
Assignment of Membership Interest, Buyer will receive good title to the Common
Units and the membership interests represented thereby, free and clear of all
Encumbrances. Part 3.3(a) lists Sellers and Preferred Unit Holders and the
number of Common Units and Preferred Units held by each, respectively, and the
percentage of ownership of the Company held by each Seller and Preferred
Holder.

  

  

(b) Part 3.3(b) lists for each Subsidiary its authorized Equity Securities,
the number and type of Equity Securities issued and outstanding, and the
identity of each owner (of record and beneficially) of such Equity Securities
and number of shares or percentage of membership held by each holder. Except
as set forth on Part 3.3(b), all outstanding Equity Securities of each
Subsidiary are owned of record and beneficially by one or more of the Acquired
Companies, free and clear of all Encumbrances. At the Closing, all outstanding
Equity Securities of each Subsidiary will be owned of record and beneficially
by one or more of the Acquired Companies, free and clear of all Encumbrances.
The Company has entered into Membership Interest Purchase Agreement and
Releases with all members of Ozark Mountain Technologies, LLC ("Ozark
Mountain") other than those members that are Acquired Companies, a copy of
which is attached to Part 3.3(b), that provide for the transfer to an Acquired
Company of all membership interests in Ozark Mountain held by such members
("Minority Interest Repurchase Agreement and Releases"). Prior to Closing, the
Company will enter into an agreement with all the Preferred Holders in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer that effects the transfer of all
the Preferred Units from the Preferred Holders to the Company immediately
prior to Closing (the "Preferred Unit Assignment"). Following the Closing, the
Company will not have any obligation of any kind to the Preferred Holders in
respect of the Preferred Units. All the outstanding Equity Securities of each
Acquired Company have been duly authorized and validly issued, and are fully
paid and nonassessable. Except as set forth in Part 3.3(b), there are no
Contracts relating to any Equity Security of any Acquired Company, including
the sale, voting, or transfer thereof. No outstanding Equity Security or other
security of any Acquired Company was issued in violation of the Securities Act
or any other Legal Requirement. No Acquired Company has any outstanding
subscription, option, warrant, call or exchange right, convertible security,
or other Contract or other obligations in effect giving any Person (other than
another Acquired Company) the right to acquire (whether by preemptive rights
or otherwise) any Equity Security of any Acquired Company.

  

  

(c) Except as set forth on Part 3.3(c), no Acquired Company owns, or is a
party to or bound by any Contract to acquire, any Equity Security or other
security of any Person or any direct or indirect equity or ownership interest
in any other business. No Acquired Company is obligated to provide funds to or
make any investment (whether in the form of a loan, capital contribution, or
otherwise) in any other Person.

REAL AND PERSONAL PROPERTY

(a) Part 3.6(a) lists all real estate owned by each Acquired Company (the
"Owned Real Property"), including street address and tax identification
number, and the Acquired Company that owns such property. Sellers have
delivered to Buyer true and complete copies of all deeds, existing title
insurance policies and surveys of or pertaining to the Real Property and other
instruments by which any Acquired Company acquired the Owned Real Property or
instruments relating to the Owned Real Property.

  

  

(b) Part 3.6(b) lists all real estate leased by any Acquired Company as a
lessee, sub-lessee, or assignee (the "Leased Real Property" and, together with
the Owned Real Property, the "Real Property"), and the Acquired Company that

leases listed in Part 3.17(a). Such leases contain the entire agreement
between the landlord of each of the leased premises and the Acquired Company,
and there is no other Contract between the landlord and any Acquired Company
affecting such Leased Real Property. No Acquired Company leases Real Property
as a lessor or sub-lessor.

  

  

(c) The Owned Real Property and the Acquired Companies' interests in the
Leased Real Property are owned or leased, as applicable, by the respective
Acquired Companies free and clear of all Encumbrances, variances, or
limitations of any nature, other than Permitted Encumbrances and as set forth
in Part 3.6(c). All buildings, plants, and structures owned by any Acquired
Company lie wholly within the boundaries of the Real Property in question and
do not encroach upon the property of, or otherwise conflict with the property
rights of, any other Person. There are no buildings, structures, fixtures, or
other improvements permanently situated on an Adjoining Property that
encroaches on any part of the Real Property. Each parcel of Real Property
abuts on, and has direct vehicular access to, a public road or has access to a
public road via a permanent, irrevocable, appurtenant easement benefiting such
Real Property and constituting a part thereof. Certificates of occupancy are
in full force and effect for each location of Real Property, and the uses
thereof being made by the Acquired Companies do not violate any applicable
zoning, subdivision, land use, or other Legal Requirement. No Third Party
(other than any Governmental Authority pursuant to eminent domain or similar
process) has a right to acquire any interest in the Owned Real Property.

  

  

(d) The Acquired Companies own all tangible personal property reflected as
owned in the Interim Balance Sheet (other than inventory sold since the
Interim Balance Sheet Date in the Ordinary Course of Business), free and clear

of Section 401(a) of the Code or (y) a plan subject to Title IV of ERISA.
Other than the Acquired Companies, no corporation or trade or business has
ever been affiliated with, controlled by, controlling, or under common control
with any Seller within the meaning of Section 414 of the Code or Section
4001(a)(14) or 4001(b) of ERISA.

  

  

(b) Sellers have delivered to Buyer true and correct copies of all Employee
Plan Documents.

  

  

(c) Except as set forth in Part 3.13(c), all amounts owed by any Acquired
Company under the terms of any Employee Plan have been timely paid in full.
Except as set forth in Part 3.13(c), each Employee Plan that provides health
or welfare benefits is fully insured, and any incurred but not reported claims
under each such Employee Plan that is not fully insured have been properly
accrued. Each Acquired Company has paid in full all required insurance
premiums, subject only to normal retrospective adjustments in the Ordinary
Course of Business, with regard to each Employee Plan.

  

  

(d) Each Acquired Company has complied with the applicable continuation
requirements for each Employee Plan, including (i) Section 4980B of the Code
(as well as its predecessor provision, Section 162(k) of the Code) and
Sections 601 through 608, inclusive, of ERISA ("COBRA") and (ii) any
applicable state Legal Requirements mandating welfare benefit continuation
coverage for employees.

  

  

(e) The form of each Employee Plan is in compliance with the applicable terms
of ERISA, the Code, and any other applicable Legal Requirement, including, but
not limited to, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Family
Medical Leave Act of 1993, and the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996, and each Employee Plan has been operated in
compliance with such Legal Requirements and the written Employee Plan
documents. No Acquired Company and no fiduciary of an Employee Plan has
violated the requirements of Section 404 of ERISA. Except as set forth in Part
3.13(e), the Acquired Companies are in compliance with all Legal Requirements
related to reporting for the Employee Plans. Except as set forth in Part
3.13(e), each required report and description of an Employee Plan (including
IRS Form 5500 Annual Reports, Summary Annual Reports, Summary Plan
Descriptions, and Summaries of Material Modifications) have been (to the
extent required) timely filed with the IRS, the United States Department of
Labor, or other Governmental Body and distributed as required, and all notices
required by ERISA or the Code or any other Legal Requirement with respect to
each Employee Plan have been appropriately given. No Acquired Company has any
unfunded liability with respect to any Employee Plan.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

26  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

  

(f) Each Employee Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code has received, or is based on a form of plan that has received, a
favorable determination letter or opinion letter from the IRS, which is
current. No circumstance exists that could result in revocation of any such
favorable determination letter. Each trust created under any such Employee
Plan has been determined to be exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of
the Code and no circumstance exists that could result in a revocation of such
exemption. The Acquired Companies have not established, maintained, or
contributed to, or had any obligation to establish, maintain, or contribute to
an Employee Plan that is intended to meet the requirements of Code Section
501(c)(9) or is a multiple employer welfare arrangement within the meaning of
Section 3(40)(A) of ERISA. No circumstance exists that could give rise to a
loss of any intended tax consequence or to any Tax under Section 511 of the
Code with respect to any Employee Plan. No Acquired Company has made any
voluntary correction program submission to either the Internal Revenue Service
or the Department of Labor with respect to any compliance failure or
operational failure as relates to any Employee Plan.

  

  

(g) There has never been any Proceeding relating to any Employee Plan and no
such Proceeding is threatened, and the Acquired Companies have no obligation
under an Employee Plan or with respect to which an Acquired Company would have
any liability or that could result in a lien attaching to the Acquired
Company. To the Knowledge of Sellers, no event has occurred or circumstance
exists that could give rise to or serve as a basis for the commencement of any
such Proceeding. To the Knowledge of Sellers no Acquired Company and no
fiduciary of an Employee Plan has engaged in a transaction with respect to any
Employee Plan that could subject any Acquired Company or Buyer to a Tax or
penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(l) of ERISA
or a violation of Section 406 of ERISA. To the Knowledge of Sellers neither
the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation or
performance of any Contemplated Transaction will, directly or indirectly (with
or without notice or lapse of time), result in the assessment of a Tax or
penalty under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(l) of ERISA or result in
a violation of Section 406 of ERISA.

  

  

(h) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
or performance of any Contemplated Transaction will, directly or indirectly
(with or without notice or lapse of time), obligate any Acquired Company to
pay any separation, severance, termination, change in control, or similar
benefit to, or accelerate the time of vesting for, change the time of payment
to, or increase the amount of compensation due to, any director, employee,
officer, former employee, or former officer of any Acquired Company. There is
no Contract providing for payments that could subject any Person to liability
under Section 4999 of the Code.

  

  

(i) Other than the continuation coverage requirements of COBRA and any
obligation under an Employee Plan qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code,
no Acquired Company has any obligation or potential liability for benefits to
employees, former employees, or their dependents following termination of
employment or retirement under any Employee Plan.

  

  

(j) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
or performance of any Contemplated Transaction will, directly or indirectly
(with or without notice or lapse of time), result in an amendment,
modification, or termination of any Employee Plan. No written or oral
representation has been made to any employee or former employee of any
Acquired Company promising or guaranteeing any employer payment or funding for
the continuation of medical, dental, life, or disability coverage for any
period of time beyond the end of the current plan year (except to the extent
of coverage required under COBRA). No written or oral representation has been
made to any employee or former employee of any Acquired Company concerning the
employee benefits of Buyer. No statement, either written or oral, has been
made by an Acquired Company to any Person with regard to any Employee Plan
that was not in accordance with the Employee Plan and that could have an
adverse economic consequence to the Acquired Company or to Buyer.

  

  

(k) No Acquired Company has contributed to, has had any obligation to
contribute to, or has had any liability, at any time within six (6) years
prior to the Closing Date, with respect to any "employee pension benefit plan"
within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA that is a "defined benefit plan"
within the meaning of Section 3(35) of ERISA or is otherwise subject to Title
IV of ERISA or the funding standards of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302
of ERISA. No Employee Plan is a stock bonus or pension plan within the meaning
of Section 401(a) of the Code.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

27  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(l) No Acquired Company has contributed to, has had any obligation to
contribute to, or has had any liability, at any time within six (6) years
prior to the Closing Date, with respect to a "multiemployer plan" within the
meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA or Section 414(f) of the Code or a plan that
has two or more contributing sponsors, at least two of whom are not under
common control within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code.

  

  

(m) Except as set forth in Part 3.13(m), no Employee Plan is subject to
Section 409A of the Code. Each Employee Plan subject to Section 409A of the
Code ("Deferred Compensation Plan") complies in all material respects with
Section 409A of the Code. No Acquired Company has (i) granted to any Person an
interest in any Deferred Compensation Plan that is, or upon the lapse of a
substantial risk of forfeiture with respect to such interest will be, subject
to the Tax imposed by Section 409A(a)(1)(B) or (b)(4)(A) of the Code, or (ii)
materially modified any Deferred Compensation Plan in a manner that could
cause an interest previously granted under such plan to become subject to the
Tax imposed by Section 409A(a)(1)(B) or (b)(4) of the Code.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ASSETS

(a) Part 3.22(a) contains a true and complete list of (i) all Intellectual
Property Assets owned by the Acquired Companies that are the subject of any
issuance, registration, certificate, application, or other filing by, to or
with any Governmental Body or authorized private registrar, including
registered Marks, registered Copyrights, issued Patents, Net Name
registrations, and pending applications for any of the foregoing, and (ii)
material unregistered Intellectual Property Assets owned by the Acquired
Companies, in both cases indicating on Part 3.22(a) the name of the Acquired
Company that owns or licenses such Intellectual Property Asset. Part 3.22(a)
also lists all material invention disclosures relating to inventions conceived
or reduced to practice by one or more officers, employees, independent
contractors, or other parties with whom any Acquired Company may have
collaborated in connection with developments on behalf of such Acquired
Company's business ("Invention Disclosures"), including the name of the
Acquired Company that owns or uses such Invention Disclosure.

(b) The Intellectual Property Assets are all those used in or necessary for
the conduct of the business of the Acquired Companies as it is being conducted
other than commercially available, off-the-shelf software consisting of
"shrink wrap," "execute-by-opening," or similar license agreements. One or
more Acquired Companies is the owner of each of the owned Intellectual
Property Assets, free and clear of any Encumbrance, and has the right to use
them without payment to any Person other than another Acquired Company. No
Acquired Company is bound by, and none of the owned Intellectual Property
Assets is subject to, any Contract that in any material way limits or
restricts the ability of any Acquired Company to use, exploit, assert, or
enforce any such owned Intellectual Property Asset anywhere in the world. It
is not necessary to utilize any intellectual property of any employee of the
Acquired Companies made prior to that employee's employment by the Acquired
Companies in conducting the Acquired Companies' business as currently
conducted, except for Intellectual Property Assets that have been assigned to
the Acquired Companies. The use of any Intellectual Property Asset and the
conduct of the business of the Acquired Companies as currently conducted do
not infringe on or otherwise violate the legal rights of any Person. The
disclosure of any Intellectual Property Asset, or such documentation related
thereto, including, but not limited to, contracts and letters of intent, to
Buyer does not infringe on or otherwise violate the legal rights of any
Person.

secrecy, confidentiality, and value of each Trade Secret (including the
enforcement by each Acquired Company of a policy requiring each employee or
contractor to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements
substantially in such Acquired Company's standard form, and all current and
former employees and independent contractors of each Acquired Company have
executed such an agreement). To Knowledge of Sellers no Trade Secret is part
of the public knowledge or literature or has been used, divulged, or
appropriated either for the benefit of any Person (other than an Acquired
Company) or to the detriment of any Acquired Company. No Trade Secret is
subject to any adverse claim or has been challenged, and, to the Knowledge of
Sellers, no such challenge is threatened. To the Knowledge of Sellers, no
Trade Secret infringes or is alleged to infringe any intellectual property
right of any Person. The documentation relating to each Trade Secret is

explain it and to allow its full and proper use without reliance on the
knowledge or memory of any individual.

SECURITIES LAW MATTERS

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

(a) The Consideration Shares acquired by each Seller are being acquired for
investment for such Seller's own account and not with a view to the
distribution thereof within the meaning of Section 2(11) of the Securities
Act. Each Seller understands that the Consideration Shares have not been, and
will not be, registered under the Securities Act by reason of a specific
exemption from the registration provisions of the Securities Act, which
depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of the investment
intent and the accuracy of such Seller's representations as expressed in this
Agreement.

  

  

(b) Each Seller has received all the information it considers necessary or
appropriate for deciding whether to acquire the Consideration Shares. Each
Seller has reviewed the annual, quarterly and periodic reports of Buyer that
have been filed with the SEC. Each Seller has been given the opportunity to
obtain any information or documents relating to, and ask questions and receive
answers about, Buyer, the Consideration Shares and the business of and
prospects of Buyer which it deems necessary to evaluate the merits and risks
related to its investment in such shares and to verify the information
received.

  

  

(c) Each Seller has such knowledge and experience in financial and business
matters that such Seller is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its
investment in Buyer and has the capacity to protect its own interests. Each
Seller is able to bear the economic risks of its investment in the
Consideration Shares for an indefinite period of time, including the risk of a
complete loss of such Seller's investment in such securities.

  

  

(d) Each Seller understands that the Consideration Shares will be
characterized as "restricted securities" as defined in Rule 144 promulgated
under the Securities Act because they are being acquired from Buyer in a
transaction not involving a public offering and that, under the Securities
Act, the Consideration Shares may be resold without registration under the
Securities Act only in certain limited circumstances. Each Seller acknowledges
that the Consideration Shares must be held indefinitely unless subsequently
registered under the Securities Act and under applicable state securities laws
or an exemption from such registration is available. Each Seller is aware that
the provisions of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, which permit
limited resale of share purchased in a private placement are subject to the
satisfaction of certain conditions, including, among other things, the
availability of certain current public information about Buyer and the resale
occurring not less than six months after a party has purchased and paid for
the security to be sold.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Each Seller understands that the Consideration Shares and any securities
issued in respect thereof or exchanged therefore, may bear, substantially,
over or all of the following legends:

  

  

(a) THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF
1933, AS AMENDED, AND MAY NOT BE SOLD, TRANSFERRED, ASSIGNED OR HYPOTHECATED
UNLESS (A) THERE IS AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER SUCH ACT
COVERING SUCH SECURITIES, (B) THE SALE IS MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH RULE 144
UNDER SUCH ACT OR (C) THE COMPANY RECEIVES AN OPINION OF COUNSEL FOR THE
HOLDER OF THE SECURITIES REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY STATING THAT
SUCH SALE IS EXEMPT FROM THE REGISTRATION AND PROSPECTUS DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS
OF SUCH ACT.

  

  

Any legend required by the securities laws of any state to the extent such
laws are applicable to the shares represented by the certificate so legended.

  

  

(f) Each Seller is an accredited investor as defined in Rule 501(a) of
Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act.

  

  

(g) The true address of each Seller is set forth in Part 3.22 (g). Each Seller
is presently a bona fide resident of, or is domiciled in, and received the
offer and made the decision to invest in the Consideration Shares in the state
listed in such address.

  

  

(h) Each Seller, if an entity, was not organized for the purpose of holding
the Equity Securities of the Company.

Part 3.26 lists for each of the two (2) years ending 2010 and 2011, and for
the first ten (10) months of 2012, the names of the respective customers that
were, in the aggregate, the ten (10) largest customers (for purposes of this
section, each customer shall be deemed to include its Affiliates, together
counted as a single customer, for purposes of determining the ten (10) largest
customers) in terms of dollar value of products or services, or both, sold by
each Acquired Company ("Major Customers"). Part 3.26 also lists for each such
year, the names of the respective suppliers that were, in the aggregate, the
twenty-five (25) largest suppliers in terms of dollar value of products or
services, or both, to each Acquired Company ("Major Suppliers"). Except as set
forth in Part 3.26, no Major Customer or Major Supplier has given any Acquired
Company written, or to the Knowledge of Sellers, oral notice terminating,
canceling, materially reducing the volume under, or renegotiating the pricing
terms or any other material terms of any Applicable Contract or relationship
with any Acquired Company or threatening to take any of such actions and, to
the Knowledge of Sellers, no Major Customer or Major Supplier intends to do

Company, whether such Loss is incurred by reason of any express or implied

39  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Except as set forth in Part 3.27(b), no Acquired Company has given to any

copy of Buyer's annual report of Form 10-K filed with the SEC with respect to
the fiscal year ended 2011, and each quarterly report on Form 10-Q, Current
Report on Form 8-K, other report, schedule, registration statement, and
definitive proxy statement filed by Buyer with the SEC on or after the date of

FINANCING COMMITMENT

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

(a) Buyer has delivered to Seller Representative copies of the executed
commitment letter (the "Commitment Letter") from the Financing Sources
pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the
Financing Sources have committed (the "Financing Commitment") to lend the
amounts set forth therein to Buyer for the purpose of funding the Contemplated
Transactions (the "Debt Financing").

  

  

(b) The Financing Commitment is, as of the date hereof, in full force and
effect and has not been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise amended,
supplemented or modified in any respect. The Financing Commitment, in the form
so delivered, is, to Buyer's Knowledge, a legal, valid and binding obligation
of the Financing Sources subject to the terms and conditions set forth
therein. Except for a fee letter (a complete copy of which has been provided
to the Sellers' Representative with only the fee amounts and certain other
terms redacted (none of which would adversely affect the amount,
conditionality, enforceability, termination or availability of the Debt
Financing), as of the date hereof there are no side letters or other
agreements, contracts or arrangements related to the funding or investing, as
applicable, of the Debt Financing other than as expressly set forth in the
Financing Commitment. As of the date hereof, (i) no event has occurred which,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or
Breach on the part of Buyer under any terms of the Financing Commitment, and
(ii) there has been no failure of any condition on the part of Buyer required
under the Financing Commitment or other action on the part of Buyer that would
or would reasonably be expected to result in any portion of the Debt Financing
contemplated thereby to be unavailable. As of the date hereof, Buyer has no
reason to believe that it would be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any
term or condition of the Financing Commitment required to be satisfied by it.
Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions precedent to Buyer's obligation to
consummate the transactions provided for hereunder, the aggregate proceeds of
the Debt Financing as provided by the Commitment Letter, if funded in
accordance with the Financing Commitment, together with the cash and cash
equivalents otherwise available to Buyer, will be sufficient to fund all of
the amounts required to be provided by Buyer for the consummation of such
transactions, and are sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Buyer's
obligations to fund the cash portion of the Purchase Price pursuant to Section
2.2.

perpetual: (i) keep the Confidential Information confidential and deliver
promptly to Buyer, or immediately destroy at Buyer's option, all embodiments
and copies of the Confidential Information that are in such Seller's
possession; (ii) not use the Confidential Information for any reason or
purpose; and (iii) without limiting the foregoing, not disclose the
Confidential Information to any Person, except with Buyer's Consent.

  

  

(c) Section 7.3(b) does not apply to that part of the Confidential Information
that becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a
Breach of this Section 7.3 by any Seller. Confidential Information shall not
be deemed "generally available to the public" merely because it is included or
incorporated in more general information that is publicly available or because
it combines features which individually may be publicly available.

  

  

(d) If any Seller becomes compelled in any Proceeding to make any disclosure
that is prohibited by this Section 7.3, such Seller shall, to the extent
legally permissible, provide Buyer with prompt notice of such compulsion so
that Buyer may seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate
remedy or waive compliance with the provisions of this Section 7.3. In the
absence of a protective order or other remedy, such Seller may disclose that
portion (and only that portion) of the Confidential Information that, based
upon the opinion of such Seller's counsel, such Seller is legally compelled to
disclose; provided, however, that such Seller shall use its commercially
reasonable best efforts to obtain written assurance that any Person to whom
any Confidential Information is so disclosed shall accord confidential
treatment to such Confidential Information.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Nothing in this Section 7.3 will diminish the protections and benefits
under applicable Legal Requirements to which any Trade Secret of any Acquired
Company is entitled. If any information that an Acquired Company asserts to be
a Trade Secret under applicable Legal Requirements is found by a court of
competent jurisdiction not to be such a Trade Secret, such information will
nonetheless be considered Confidential Information of that Acquired Company
for purposes of this Section 7.3.

change any Tax election, change any annual Tax accounting period, adopt or
change any method of Tax accounting, file any amended Tax Return, enter into
any closing agreement, settle any Tax claim or assessment, surrender any right
to claim a Tax refund, offset or other reduction in Tax liability, or take or
omit to take any other action, if any such action or omission would result in
a Breach of any representation under Section 3.11.

  

  

(b) Any and all existing Tax Related Agreements shall be terminated by the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date, and neither the Company
nor any Subsidiary shall have any further rights or liabilities thereunder.

  

  

(c) The purchase and sale contemplated by this Agreement shall be treated for
income Tax purposes as a sale of the Common Units by Sellers, and a purchase
of the Company's assets by Buyer. Buyer and Sellers shall agree on the
valuation of the assets and an allocation statement, allocating the Purchase
Price among the assets of the Company in accordance with Section 1060 of the
Code. The Company, each Seller, and Buyer shall prepare its income Tax Returns
in a manner consistent with the valuations and allocations agreed to by the
parties. The Company, each Seller, and Buyer shall not take any position
whether in Tax Returns, Tax examinations or otherwise, that is inconsistent
with such valuations or allocations unless required to do so by applicable
law.

  

  

(d) The purchase and sale contemplated by this Agreement shall be treated for
income Tax purposes as a sale of the Common Units by Sellers, and a purchase
of the Company's assets by Buyer. The valuation of the Company's assets,
including assets owned by limited liability companies, and the allocation of
consideration to the Company's asset are set forth on Schedule 7.5(c). The
Company, each Seller, and Buyer shall prepare its income Tax Returns in a
manner consistent with the valuations and allocations agreed to by the
parties. The Company, each Seller, and Buyer shall not take any position,

with such valuations or allocations unless required to do so by applicable
law.

(including all prior taxable years) ending on and including the Closing Date.
For income Tax purposes, and for any taxable year of the Company and its
Subsidiaries that does not end on, and would otherwise extend beyond, the
Closing Date, there shall be a deemed short taxable year ending on and
including such date and a second deemed short taxable year beginning on and
including the day after such date. For purposes of allocating gross income and
deductions between deemed short taxable years, the books of the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall be closed as of the close of business of the Closing
Date, and all amounts of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be reflected
in the period in which such items accrued under the Company's and its
Subsidiaries' normal Tax accounting methods; provided, that any transaction
entered into by the Company or its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date, but after
the Closing, not in the ordinary course of business shall be treated as
occurring after the close of business on the Closing Date.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(f) The Company shall prepare and file in a timely manner, all Tax Returns
required to be filed by the Company and its Subsidiaries after the date hereof
and before the Closing Date with respect to any Tax. Buyer and the Company
shall prepare and file in a timely manner all Tax Returns to be filed for the
Stub Tax Period required to be filed on or after the Closing Date with respect
to any Tax. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared, and any positions and
elections relating thereto made, in a manner consistent with the prior
practice of the Company and its Subsidiaries to the extent permitted by law.
Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall permit Sellers to comment on any
Tax Return described in this Section 6.14(a) at least thirty (30) days prior
to filing, and shall make such revisions to such Tax Returns as are requested
by Sellers to the extent permitted by applicable law unless contrary to the
prior practice of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Unless otherwise required
by applicable law, Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not, without
the prior written consent of Sellers (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), file any amended Tax Return with respect to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries for any taxable period ending on or before the
Closing Date. Buyer and the Company hereby covenant and agree that none of
Buyer, or the Company nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall, unless
required by applicable law, retroactively apply any changes or alterations in
the Tax positions and elections taken by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries on or prior to the Closing Date to any taxable periods prior to
the Closing Date in any manner that would result in a Breach of any of the
Company's representations or warranties contained herein or would otherwise
give rise to any indemnification obligations of Sellers under Article XI or in
additional Tax liability to Sellers.

  

  

(g) Sellers and Buyer will cooperate fully with each other in connection with
(i) the preparation and filing of any U.S. federal, state, local or foreign
Tax Returns that include the business and operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries with respect to any taxable periods on or prior to the Closing
Date and (ii) any audit examination by any Governmental Body of the Tax
Returns referred to in clause (i). Such cooperation shall include, without
limitation, the furnishing or making available of records, books of account or
other materials of the Company and its Subsidiaries necessary or helpful for
the defense against assertions of any Governmental Body as to any Tax Returns
referred to in clause (i) above.

extent such persons are indemnified by the Company and/or its Subsidiaries, as
of the date of this Agreement, pursuant to the organizational documents of the
Company and/or its Subsidiaries for acts or omissions occurring on or prior to

or any of their Subsidiaries to, amend, repeal or modify any provision in the

the exculpation or indemnification of former officers, directors and managers
as in effect immediately prior to the date of this Agreement.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this
Section 7.6 shall survive the consummation of the Closing in accordance with
its terms. If Buyer or the Company, or any of their respective successors or
assigns, (i) consolidates with or merges in to any other Person, or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties or assets to any Person,
then, and in each case, Buyer or the Company, as the case may be, shall assign

10.2

  |  

EFFECT OF TERMINATION; LIQUIDATED DAMAGES

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

(a) Each party's right of termination under Section 10.1 is in addition to any
other right it may have under this Agreement (including under Section 12.16)
or otherwise, and the exercise of a party's right of termination will not
constitute an election of remedies. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to Section 10.1, this Agreement will be of no further force or effect;
provided, however, that (i) this Section 10.2 and Article 12 will survive the
termination of this Agreement and will remain in full force and effect, and
(ii) the termination of this Agreement will not relieve any party from any
liability for any Breach of this Agreement occurring prior to termination.

  

  

(b) If all conditions to Buyer's obligation to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions have been satisfied or waived by Buyer on or prior to the
Termination Date and Buyer fails to consummate Contemplated Transactions on or
prior to the Termination Date due to a failure of the Financing Sources to
fund the cash portion of the Purchase Price pursuant to the Commitment Letter,
and Buyer is unable to procure other funding on substantially similar terms
for the payment of the cash portion of the Purchase Price after exercising its
commercially reasonable best efforts (the "Failure to Fund"), then Buyer shall
pay to Sellers, as liquidated damages, an amount equal to Seven Million Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($7,500,000) (the "Liquidated Damages Amount"). The
parties acknowledge that the actual damages likely to result from the Failure
to Fund are difficult to estimate on the date of this Agreement and would be
difficult to prove. The parties intend that payment by Buyer of the Liquidated
Damages Amount would serve to compensate Sellers for any Breach by Buyer of
its obligations to consummate the Contemplated Transactions based on the
Failure to Fund and they do not intend for it to serve as punishment for any
such Breach by Buyer. Seller's right to receive payment of the Liquidated
Damages Amount shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Sellers with respect
to Buyer's failure to consummate the Contemplated Transactions based on the
Failure to Fund whether or not Sellers shall have terminated this Agreement in
accordance with Section 10.1, and all other remedies (including equitable
remedies) shall be deemed waived against Buyer for any and all Losses, damages
and expenses suffered or incurred by Sellers in connection with this Agreement
and upon payment of the Liquidated Damages Amount, Buyer and its Affiliates
shall have no further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions.

All representations, warranties, covenants, and obligations in this Agreement,
the Disclosure Letter, the supplements to the Disclosure Letter, and any
certificate, document, or other writing delivered pursuant to this Agreement
will survive the Closing and the consummation and performance of the
Contemplated Transactions, for the periods described in Section 11.5 below, to
the extent such representations, warranties, covenants, and obligations are
limited in such section. The right to indemnification, payment, reimbursement,
or other remedy based upon any such representation, warranty, covenant, or
obligation will not be affected by any investigation (including any
environmental investigation or assessment) conducted or any Knowledge acquired
at any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of,
or compliance with, such representation, warranty, covenant, or obligation.
The waiver of any condition relating to any representation, warranty,
covenant, or obligation will not affect the right to indemnification, payment,
reimbursement, or other remedy based upon such representation, warranty,
covenant, or obligation. For purposes of this Article XI, the representations
and warranties of Sellers shall not be deemed qualified by any references to
materiality or Material Adverse Effect.

property.

  |  

TIME LIMITATIONS

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

(a) If the Closing occurs, Sellers shall have liability under Section 11.2(a)
with respect to any Breach of a representation or warranty (other than those
in Sections 3.1, 3.2(a), 3.2(b), 3.3, 3.11, 3.13, 3.19, or 3.28 (collectively,
the "Fundamental Representations"), as to which a claim may be made at any
time except as set forth in the immediately succeeding two sentences), Section
11.2(e) and Section 11.2(b) (but only with respect to any Breach of a covenant
or obligation in this Agreement to be performed prior to the Closing) only if
on or before the date that is eighteen months after the Closing Date, such
claim has arisen and Buyer notifies Sellers' Representative of such claim,
specifying the factual basis of the claim in reasonable detail to the extent
known by Buyer. If the Closing occurs, Sellers shall have liability under
Section 11.3, Section 11.2(b) (with respect to any Breach of a covenant or
obligation in this Agreement to be performed after the Closing), Sections
11.2(c), (d) or (e), or Section 11.2(a) with respect to any Breach of a
Fundamental Representation, only if on or before the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations such claim has arisen and Buyer notifies
Sellers' Representative of such claim, specifying the factual basis of the
claim in reasonable detail to the extent known by Buyer.

  

  

(b) If the Closing occurs, Buyer shall have liability under Section 11.4(a)
with respect to any Breach of a representation or warranty (other than those
in Sections 4.1, 4.2, and 4.5, as to which a claim may be made at any time)
and under Section 11.4(b) (but only with respect to any Breach of a covenant
or obligation in this Agreement prior to Closing) only if on or before the
date that is eighteen months after the Closing Date, Sellers notify Buyer of a
claim specifying the factual basis of the claim in reasonable detail to the
extent known by Sellers.

  

  

    

11.6

  |  

CERTAIN LIMITATIONS

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

(a)

  

  

     |  

(i)

  |  

If the Closing occurs, Sellers shall have no liability with respect to claims
under Section 11.2(a) and Section 11.2(e) until the aggregate of all Losses
suffered by all Buyer Indemnified Persons with respect to such claims exceeds
Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars and 00/100 ($750,000.00) (it being agreed
that in the event such threshold is reached and exceeded, the Buyer
Indemnified Persons shall only be entitled to recover Losses in excess of such
amount). The limitation of the preceding sentence shall not apply to any
Breach(es) of the Fundamental Representations.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(ii)

  |  

If the Closing occurs, the aggregate liability of Sellers with respect to
Losses for claims under Section 11.2(a) and Section 11.2(e) shall not exceed
Ten Million Dollars and 00/100 ($10,000,000.00); provided, that the aggregate
liability with respect to Losses resulting from a Breach of the Fundamental
Representations and all other Losses not subject to the Ten Million Dollar and
00/100 ($10,000,000.00) limitation shall not exceed the Closing Payment.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

  

  

     |  

(iii)

  |  

For purposes of this Section 11.6, any single Loss that is less than Seven
Thousand Five Hundred Dollars and 00/100 ($7,500.00) shall be disregarded (and
Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification under
Section 11.2 with respect thereto); provided, however, that any series of
Losses arising out of the same occurrence or recurring Losses of a similar
nature shall be aggregated and treated as a single Loss.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(iv)

  |  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the limitations of this
Section 11.6 will not apply to Breaches or other Losses based on or otherwise
involving the fraud or willful misconduct of one or more Sellers.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

(b) All indemnification or reimbursement payments required pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to any Loss shall be net of amounts actually received
by an Indemnified Person with respect to such Loss (i) as proceeds of
insurance policies, but not to exceed the limits contained in the Company and
its Subsidiaries' insurance policies as of the Closing Date (the "Acquired
Companies' Insurance Policies"), and (ii) from third parties having a
contractual relationship with the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to
Closing, including through indemnification, counterclaim, reimbursement
arrangement, contract or otherwise (collectively, "Alternative Arrangements").
With respect to any Loss that is the subject of a claim for indemnity under
this Article XI, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to collect
proceeds relating to insurance policies of the Company or its Subsidiaries in
effect prior to Closing; provided however, nothing herein shall require Buyer
or an applicable Acquired Company to commence and prosecute a lawsuit or other
Proceeding against such insurer(s) as a condition of Sellers' obligation to
indemnify as provided herein, but it shall be sufficient that Buyer or the
applicable Acquired Company make demand upon such insurer(s) for such
insurance or liability or Loss, as the case may be, and subject to Sellers'
rights of reimbursement as provided below. If any amounts are received by
Buyer or any of the Acquired Companies with respect to such Losses after Buyer
or the applicable Acquired Company has received such amounts from an
indemnifying party, Buyer or the applicable Acquired Company shall promptly,
but in any event no later than ten (10) Business Days after the actual receipt
of such amounts, pay such amount to the indemnifying party up to the amount
received by Buyer or applicable Acquired Company from the indemnifying party,
subject to the limits set forth in Section 11.6(b)(i). To the extent that any
amount has been delivered or credited to an indemnifying party under this
Section 11.6(b) with respect to a Loss, such Loss shall be deemed adjusted
downward by such amount and such Loss shall not be counted in the
determination of whether any threshold or cap hereunder has been met to the
extent of the amount included in such adjustment.

  

  

(c) To the extent that any Losses which would otherwise be subject to
indemnification pursuant to this Article XI were reflected in the calculation
of the Purchase Price or for which a working capital adjustment was made
pursuant to Section 2.7, (i) Buyer Indemnified Persons shall not be able to
recover for such Losses, and (ii) such Losses shall not be counted in the
determination of whether any threshold or cap hereunder has been met, in each
case only to the extent of the amount included in such calculation or
adjustment.

  

  

    

11.7

  |  

SETOFF RIGHT

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

Once all of the General Escrow Funds have been disbursed or are exhausted
(except in the case of a claim for a Working Capital Deficit amount, which is
not subject to such condition), and upon notice to Sellers' Representative
specifying in reasonable detail the basis therefor, Buyer may set off any
amount to which it claims to be entitled from any Seller, including any
amounts that may be owed under this Article 11 or otherwise, against amounts
otherwise payable under any provision of this Agreement including amounts
payable under Section 2.6 of this Agreement. The exercise of such right of
setoff by Buyer in good faith, whether or not ultimately determined to be
justified, will not constitute a default under this Agreement regardless of
whether any Seller disputes such setoff claim or whether such setoff claim is
for a contingent or an unliquidated amount. Neither the exercise of, nor the
failure to exercise, such right of setoff will constitute an election of
remedies or limit Buyer in any manner in the enforcement of any other remedies
that may be available to it.

THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

(a) A Person benefited by Section 11.2, 11.3 or 11.4 (an "Indemnified Person")
shall give notice of the assertion of a Third-Party Claim to Sellers'
Representative or Buyer (an "Indemnifying Person"), as the case may be;
provided, however, that no failure or delay on the part of an Indemnified
Person in notifying an Indemnifying Person will relieve the Indemnifying
Person from any obligation under this Article 11 except to the extent that the
failure or delay materially prejudices the defense of the Third-Party Claim by
the Indemnifying Person.

  

  

(b) Except as provided in Section 11.8(c), the Indemnifying Person may elect
to assume the defense of the Third-Party Claim with counsel satisfactory to
the Indemnified Person by (A) giving notice to the Indemnified Person of its
election to assume the defense of the Third-Party Claim and (B) giving the
Indemnified Person evidence acceptable to the Indemnified Person that the
Indemnifying Person has adequate financial resources to defend against the
Third-Party Claim and fulfill its obligations under this Article 11, in each
case no later than 20 days after the Indemnified Person gives notice of the
assertion of a Third-Party Claim under Section 11.8(a).

  

  

     |  

(i)

  |  

If the Indemnifying Person elects to assume the defense of a Third-Party
Claim: (A) it shall diligently conduct the defense and, so long as it
diligently conducts the defense, shall not be liable to the Indemnified Person
for any Indemnified Person's fees or expenses subsequently incurred in
connection with the defense of the Third-Party Claim other than reasonable
costs of investigation; (B) the election will conclusively establish for
purposes of this Agreement that the Indemnified Person is entitled to relief
under this Agreement for any Loss arising, directly or indirectly, from or in
connection with the Third-Party Claim (subject to the provisions of Section
11.6 and provided that such election does not preclude, subject to Section
11.13, claims and defenses relating to the contribution of the Indemnified
Person to such Losses (but excluding claims for contribution relating to
actions by or on behalf of the Acquired Companies prior to the Closing)); (C)
no compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claim may be effected by the
Indemnifying Person without the Indemnified Person's consent unless (I) there
is no finding or admission of any violation by the Indemnified Person of any
Legal Requirement or any rights of any Person, (II) the Indemnified Person
receives a full release of and from any other claims that may be made against
the Indemnified Person by the Third Party bringing the Third-Party Claim, and
(III) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by
the Indemnifying Person; and (D) the Indemnifying Person shall have no
liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such claims effected
without its consent.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(ii)

  |  

If the Indemnifying Person does not assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim
in the manner and within the period provided in Section 11.8(b)(i), or if the
Indemnifying Person does not diligently conduct the defense of a Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnified Person may conduct the defense of the Third-Party Claim
at the expense of the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnifying Person shall be
bound by any determination resulting from such Third-Party Claim or any
compromise or settlement effected by the Indemnified Person.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Indemnified Person determines in good
faith that there is a reasonable probability that a Third-Party Claim may
materially and adversely affect it or any Affiliate other than as a result of
monetary damages for which it would be entitled to relief under this
Agreement, the Indemnified Person may, by notice to the Indemnifying Person,
assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise, or settle such Third-Party
Claim.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 12.13, Sellers consent to the
nonexclusive jurisdiction of any court in which a Proceeding is brought
against any Indemnified Person for purposes of determining any claim that an
Indemnified Person may have under this Agreement with respect to such
Proceeding or the matters alleged therein.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) With respect to any Third-Party Claim subject to this Article 11, both the
Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person, as the case may be, shall
render to each other such assistance as they may reasonably require of each
other and shall cooperate in good faith with each other in order to ensure the
proper and adequate defense of any Third-Party Claim.

  

  

(f) In addition to Section 7.3, with respect to any Third-Party Claim subject
to this Article 11, the parties shall cooperate in a manner to preserve in
full (to the extent possible) the confidentiality of all Confidential
Information and the attorney-client and work-product privileges. In connection
therewith, each party agrees that: (i) it shall use its commercially
reasonable best efforts, in respect of any Third-Party Claim in which it has
assumed or participated in the defense, to avoid production of Confidential
Information (consistent with applicable law and rules of procedure); and (ii)
all communications between any party and counsel responsible for or
participating in the defense of any Third-Party Claim shall, to the extent
possible, be made so as to preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-
product privilege.

  

  

    

11.9

OTHER CLAIMS

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

A claim under this Article 11 for any matter not involving a Third-Party Claim
may be made by notice to Sellers' Representative or Buyer, as the case may be,
and shall be indemnified, paid, or reimbursed promptly after such notice.

The rights set forth in Sections 11.2, 11.3 and 11.4 will be the exclusive
remedy for Breach of this Agreement (except as set forth in Sections 10.2 and
12.16 and except for indemnification for any Breach of Sellers' obligation to
pay the Working Capital Deficit), including any inaccuracy of any of the
representations and warranties contained in Articles 3 and 4 and will be in
lieu of all other remedies available at law or in equity. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will prevent any party from bringing an
action based upon fraud or willful misconduct by another party in connection
with this Agreement.

GENERAL ESCROW FUNDS

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

Any indemnification pursuant to Sections 11.2(a) and 11.2(e) other than with
respect to Fundamental Representations shall be recovered in the first
instance from, but not be limited to, the General Escrow Funds, subject to the
restrictions and limitations set forth in this Agreement including but not
limited to Section 11.6; provided, however, Buyer, in its sole and absolute
discretion, shall be entitled to recover from the General Escrow Funds for any
other indemnification claim.

STRICT LIABILITY OR INDEMNITEE NEGLIGENCE

(a) THE PROVISIONS IN THIS ARTICLE 11 SHALL BE ENFORCEABLE REGARDLESS OF
WHETHER THE LIABILITY IS BASED UPON PAST, PRESENT, OR FUTURE ACTS, CLAIMS, OR
LEGAL REQUIREMENTS (INCLUDING ANY PAST, PRESENT, OR FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL LAW,
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH LAW, OR PRODUCTS LIABILITY, SECURITIES, OR
OTHER LEGAL REQUIREMENT).

  

  

(b) THE PROVISIONS IN THIS ARTICLE 11 SHALL BE ENFORCEABLE REGARDLESS OF
WHETHER ANY PERSON (INCLUDING THE PERSON FROM WHOM RELIEF IS SOUGHT) ALLEGES
OR PROVES THE SOLE, CONCURRENT, CONTRIBUTORY, OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE OF THE
PERSON SEEKING RELIEF, OR (b) THE SOLE OR CONCURRENT STRICT LIABILITY IMPOSED
UPON THE PERSON SEEKING RELIEF. HOWEVER, FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, IN
CALCULATING LOSSES TO BE PAID BY SELLERS UNDER SECTIONS 11.2 OR 11.3, THE
PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 11.13 SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO EXCLUDE THE
CONSIDERATION OF THE EXTENT OF ANY NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT BY BUYER
AND BUYER'S SUBSIDIARIES OCCURRING AFTER THE CLOSING DATE.

Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or the other documents to be
delivered pursuant to this Agreement, each party will bear its respective fees
and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, negotiation,
execution, and performance of this Agreement and the consummation and
performance of the Contemplated Transactions, including all fees and expenses
of its Representatives. Buyer will pay one-half and Sellers will pay one-half
of (i) the HSR Act filing fee and (ii) the fees and expenses of the Escrow
Agent under the Escrow Agreement. To the extent any Acquired Company has
incurred any fees or expenses in connection with this Agreement and the
Contemplated Transactions, such fees and expenses will be paid out of the
Adjusted Closing Purchase Price at Closing pursuant to the Funds Flow Memo.
The obligation of each party to bear its own fees and expenses will be subject
to any rights of such party arising from a Breach of this Agreement by another
party. All stamp, documentary, and other transfer Taxes (including any
penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement, whether
pertaining to the Units or any assets and properties of the Acquired
Companies, will be paid by Buyer. Buyer will, at its own expense, file all

NATURE OF SELLERS' OBLIGATIONS

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

The liabilities of Sellers, other than Tech Investments, LLC and Tech
Investments II, LLC (together, "Tech Investments"), under this Agreement are
several and not joint in accordance with their respective Pro Rata
Percentages; provided that solely for purposes of determining the liability of
Tech Investments, such Sellers shall be deemed to be jointly liable. The
liability of Tech Investments under this agreement is joint and several
(which, for purposes of clarification, shall be deemed to mean that, subject
to the other restrictions and limitations set forth in this Agreement, Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to seek recovery of 100% of all Losses
from either Tech Investments, LLC or Tech Investments II, LLC, regardless of
whether any Buyer Indemnified Party has any claim against any other Seller
with respect to such Loss). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Sellers acknowledge and agree that neither Section 8.12 nor the
existence of the insurance policies described therein shall in any way limit
or otherwise affect Sellers' obligations under this Agreement, including
Article XI (but subject to the limitations of Section 11.6), and no provision
in this Agreement, including such insurance policies, the General Escrow
Funds, and the Indemnification Lock Up Agreements required under Section 8.7
to be in place after Closing with respect to Buyer's Common Stock, will,
separately or collectively, for purposes of any Legal Requirement be deemed to
constitute the making by any Seller of provision that is reasonably likely to
be sufficient to provide compensation for claims made by Buyer under Article
XI (but subject to the limitations of Section 11.6).

SELLERS' REPRESENTATIVE

(a) Each Seller constitutes and appoints Charlie Newell as its representative
(the "Sellers' Representative") and its true and lawful attorney in fact, with
full power and authority in its name and on its behalf:

  

  

     |  

(i)

  |  

to act on such Seller's behalf in the absolute discretion of Sellers'
Representative with respect to all matters relating to this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement, including execution and delivery of any amendment,
supplement, or modification of this Agreement and any waiver of any claim or
right arising out of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement;

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

61  

  

 

 

 

  

  

     |  

(ii)

  |  

to complete the Funds Flow Memo and determine the allocation of Closing
Payment among Sellers, which includes determining the Convertible Senior
Preferred Return amounts; and

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(iii)

  |  

in general, to do all things and to perform all acts, including executing and
delivering all agreements, certificates, receipts, instructions, and other
instruments contemplated by or deemed advisable to effectuate the provisions
of this Section 12.5.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

This appointment and grant of power and authority is coupled with an interest
and is in consideration of the mutual covenants made in this Agreement and is
irrevocable and will not be terminated by any act of any Seller or by
operation of law, whether by the death or incapacity of any Seller or by the
occurrence of any other event. Each Seller hereby consents to the taking of
any and all actions and the making of any decisions required or permitted to
be taken or made by Sellers' Representative pursuant to this Section 12.5.
Each Seller agrees that Sellers' Representative shall have no obligation or
liability to any Person for any action taken or omitted by Sellers'
Representative in good faith, and each Seller shall indemnify and hold
harmless Sellers' Representative from, and shall pay to Sellers'
Representative the amount of, or reimburse Sellers' Representative for, any
Loss that Sellers' Representative may suffer, sustain, or become subject to as
a result of any such action or omission by Sellers' Representative under this
Agreement. Buyer agrees to the appointment of Sellers' Representative.
Sellers' Representative shall have such powers and authority as are necessary
or appropriate to carry out the functions assigned to it under this Agreement
and the Sellers' Closing Documents. All actions, notices, communications and
determinations by Sellers' Representative to carry out such functions shall
conclusively be deemed to have been authorized by, and shall be binding upon,
the Sellers. Sellers' Representative shall be entitled to engage such counsel,
experts and other agents and consultants as it shall deem necessary in
connection with exercising its powers and performing its function hereunder
and (in the absence of bad faith on the part of Sellers' Representative) shall
be entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions and advice of such Persons.
In furtherance of the foregoing, Sellers' Representative shall have the power
and authority to set aside and retain additional funds paid to or received by
it, or direct payment of additional funds to be paid to the Sellers pursuant
to this Agreement at Closing or thereafter to satisfy such obligations
(including to establish such reserves as Sellers' Representative determines in
good faith to be appropriate for such costs and expenses that are not then
known or determinable). The relationship created herein is not to be construed
as a joint venture or any form of partnership between or among Sellers'
Representative or any Seller for any purpose of Federal or state law,
including without limitation, Federal or state income tax purposes. Neither
Sellers' Representative nor any of its Affiliates owes any fiduciary or other
duty to any Seller.

  

  

(b) Buyer shall be entitled to rely upon any document or other paper delivered
by Sellers' Representative as being authorized by Sellers, and Buyer shall not
be liable to any Seller for any action taken or omitted to be taken by Buyer
based on such reliance.

  

  

(c) Until all obligations under this Agreement shall have been discharged
(including all indemnification obligations under Article 11), Sellers who,
immediately prior to the Closing, are entitled in the aggregate to receive
more than 50% of the Purchase Price, may, from time to time upon notice to
Buyer, appoint a new Sellers' Representative upon the death, incapacity, or
resignation of Sellers' Representative. If, after the death, incapacity, or
resignation of Sellers' Representative, a successor Sellers' Representative
shall not have been appointed by Sellers within 15 Business Days after a
request by Buyer, Buyer may appoint a Sellers' Representative from among
Sellers to fill any vacancy so created by notice of such appointment to
Sellers.

is given; and (c) no notice to or demand on a party will (i) waive or

Exhibit 2.4(a)(vi)

 

  


 

  

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

  

  

LMI AEROSPACE, INC., a Missouri corporation (the "Corporation"), and Charles
M. Newell (the "Employee"), hereby agree as follows:

  

  

1. Employment. The Corporation hereby employs the Employee, and the Employee accepts employment from the Corporation, upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth. Any and all employment agreements heretofore entered into between the Corporation and the Employee are hereby terminated and cancelled, and each of the parties hereto mutually releases and discharges the other from any and all obligations and liabilities heretofore or now existing under or by virtue of any such employment agreements, it being the intention of the parties hereto that this Agreement, effective immediately, shall supersede and be in lieu of any and all prior employment agreements between them.

  


 

  

2. Term of Employment.

  

  

 

(A) The initial term of the Employee\'s employment under this Agreement shall
commence on January 1, 2013 and shall terminate as of the close of business on
January 1, 2016; provided, however, that this Agreement shall be automatically
extended for additional terms of one year each unless not later than October
31 of any year beginning in 2015, either party has given written notice to the
other party of its or the Employee's intention not to extend the term of this
Agreement; and provided, further, that the term of employment may be
terminated upon the earlier occurrence of any of the following events:

   
 

  

(1) Upon the termination of the business or corporate existence of the

  


 

  

Corporation;

  

  

(2) At the Corporation's option, in the event the Corporation determines that
the Employee is not performing the duties required of the Employee hereunder
to the satisfaction of the Corporation;

  


 

  

(3) Upon the death of the Employee;

  


 

  

(4) At the Corporation's option, if the Employee shall suffer a permanent
disability. (For the purposes of this Agreement, "permanent disability" means
any physical or mental impairment that renders the Employee unable for a
period of six (6) months or more to perform the essential job functions of the
Employee's position, even with reasonable accommodation, as determined by a
physician selected by the Corporation.) The Employee acknowledges and agrees
that the Employee shall voluntarily submit to a medical or psychological
examination for the purpose of determining the Employee's continued fitness to
perform the essential functions of the Employee's position whenever requested
to do so by the Corporation. If the Corporation elects to terminate the
employment relationship on this basis, the Corporation shall notify the
Employee or the Employee's representative in writing and the termination shall
become effective on the date that such notification is given;

  


 

  

(5) At the Corporation's option, upon ten (10) calendar days' written notice
to the Employee, in the event of any breach or default by the Employee of any
of the terms of this Agreement or of any of the Employee's duties or
obligations hereunder. In lieu of providing ten (10) calendar days' advance
written notice, the Corporation, at its sole option, may terminate the
Employee's services immediately and pay the Employee an amount that is
equivalent to ten (10) calendar days of the Employee's salary, less any
deductions required by law;

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

 

  

(6) At the Corporation's option, without any advance notice, in the event that
the Employee engages in conduct which, in the opinion of the Corporation, (1)
constitutes dishonesty of any kind (including, but not limited to, any
misrepresentation of facts or falsification of records) in the Employee's
relations, interactions or dealings with the Corporation or its customers; (2)
constitutes a felony; (3) potentially may or will expose the Corporation to
public disrepute or disgrace, or potentially may or will cause harm to the
customer relations, operations or business prospects of the Corporation; (4)
constitutes harassment or discrimination towards any person associated with
the Corporation, whether an employee, agent or customer, based upon that
person's race, color, national origin, sex, age, disability, religion, or
other protected status; (5) reflects disruptive or disorderly conduct,
including but not limited to, acts of violence, fighting, intimidation or
threats of violence against any person associated with the Corporation,
whether an employee, agent or customer, or possessing a weapon while on the
Corporation's premises or while acting on behalf of the Corporation; (6) is
indicative of abusive or illegal drug use while on the Corporation's premises
or while acting on the Corporation's behalf; or (7) constitutes a willful
violation of any governmental rules or regulations; or

  


 

  

(7) At the Employee's option, after providing the Corporation with at least
thirty (30) calendar days advance written notice of the Employee's intention
to terminate the employment relationship.

  


 

  

If employment is terminated for any of the reasons set forth in (3) through
(7) of this subsection 2(A), the Employee shall be entitled to receive only
the Base Salary (as that term is hereinafter defined) accrued but unpaid as of
the date of the termination and shall be ineligible to receive any additional
compensation or severance pay. If, on the other hand, employment is terminated
by the Corporation during the term of this Agreement for any reason other than
those set forth in (3) through (7) of this subsection

  

2(A), subject to the conditions set forth in subsections 2(C) and (D) of this
Agreement, the Corporation shall provide severance pay to the Employee in an
amount based upon his length of service with the Corporation. Specifically,
the Corporation shall provide the Employee with six (6) months of Base Salary
if he has less than five (5) years of service with the Corporation as of the
date of his termination and with twelve (12) months of Base Salary if he has
five (5) or more years of service with the Corporation as of the date of his
termination.

  


 

  

(B) If employment is terminated in conjunction with a change in the control of
the Corporation, the Corporation will provide the Employee with severance pay
under the circumstances specified in (1) and (2) of this subsection (B), and
the conditions set forth in subsections 2(C) and (D) of this Agreement. For
the purposes of this Agreement, a "Change in Control" is defined as the sale
of substantially all of the operating assets of the Corporation, the
acquisition of more than fifty percent (50%) of the stock of the Corporation
by a group of shareholders or an entity which acquires control of the
Corporation (a "Purchaser"), or a merger or consolidation of the Corporation
with any other corporation, other than a merger or consolidation which would
result in the voting securities of the Corporation outstanding immediately
prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by
being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity) fifty percent
(50%) or more of the total voting power represented by the voting securities
of the Corporation or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such
merger or consolidation.

  


 

  

(1) If the Change in Control results in the involuntary termination of the
Employee or results in the Employee electing within nine (9) months from the
date of the Change in Control to terminate the Employee's employment for Good
Reason (as defined in subsection 2(E)), the Corporation shall provide the
Employee with severance pay in an amount that is equal to two and one-half
times the Employee's annual Base Salary and shall pay the Employee any
reasonably anticipated Performance Bonus for the fiscal year in which the
Employee was terminated on a prorated basis.

  


 

  

(2) If the Employee voluntarily terminates the Employee's employment without
Good Reason (as defined in subsection 2(E)) within ninety (90) days after the
Change in Control, the Corporation shall provide the Employee with six (6)
months of Base Salary if the Employee has less than five (5) years of service
with the Corporation as of the date of the Employee's termination and with
twelve (12) months of Base Salary if the Employee has five (5) or more years
of service with the Corporation as of the date of the Employee's termination.

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

(C) The severance pay provided for in subsections 2(A) and 2(B) of this
Agreement shall be paid in equal monthly installments commencing immediately
after the termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at the time of the
Employee's termination, the Employee is considered a 'specified employee'
within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2) of the Code, and if any payment that
the Employee becomes entitled to under this Agreement would be considered
deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the code, then no such
payment shall be payable prior to the date that is earlier of (1) six months
and one day after employee's termination, or (2) the Employee's death, and the
initial payment shall include a catch-up payment covering amounts that would
otherwise have been paid during the six-month period but for application of
this provision.

  


 

  

(D) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i) the amount of severance pay
provided under this Agreement shall not under any circumstances exceed the
limitations set forth in § 280G of the Code, and (ii) the Corporation's
obligation to pay the severance pay provided for in this Section 2 shall be
conditioned on the Employee's execution of a written release satisfactory to
the Corporation.

  


 

  

(E) For the purposes of subsection 2(B), "Good Reason" shall mean the
occurrence of any of the following events: (1) a significant reduction of the
Employee's duties, authority or responsibilities relative to the Employee's
duties, authority or responsibilities as in effect immediately prior to such
reduction; (2) the Purchaser requiring the Employee to relocate his primary
work office to a facility or location more than fifty (50) miles from the
Employee's then-present location; or (3) the Purchaser refusing to offer full
time employment to the Employee on terms comparable to those provided by the
Corporation prior to the acquisition.

  

  

3. Compensation.

  

  

 

(A) The initial term of the Employee\'s employment under this Agreement shall
commence on January 1, 2013 and shall terminate as of the close of business on
January 1, 2016; provided, however, that this Agreement shall be automatically
extended for additional terms of one year each unless not later than October
31 of any year beginning in 2015, either party has given written notice to the
other party of its or the Employee's intention not to extend the term of this
Agreement; and provided, further, that the term of employment may be
terminated upon the earlier occurrence of any of the following events:

 

  

 

 

  

 

(B) During the term of this Agreement, provided that the Employee is employed
under the terms and conditions of this Agreement as of the first day of the
next fiscal year, the Corporation shall pay the Employee a "Performance
Bonus," in addition to the Employee's Base Salary, calculated as follows:

   
 

  

(1) Five percent (5%) of the Employee's Base Salary, provided the
Aerostructures Division's Annual Income from Operations for such fiscal year
is not less than sixty percent (60.0%) of its budgeted Annual Income from
Operations; plus

  

  

(2) Five percent (5%) of the Employee's Base Salary, provided the
Aerostructures Division's Annual Income from Operations for such fiscal year
is not less than one-hundred percent (100%) of its budgeted Annual Income from
Operations; plus

  

  

 

(3) Twenty-two one hundredths percent (0.22%) of the Annual Income from
Operations, provided the Corporation's Annual Income from Operations for such
fiscal year is not less than sixty percent (60%) of its budgeted Annual Income
from Operations.

 

  


 

  

For purposes of the calculation of the Performance Bonus, the Corporation's
"Annual Income from Operations" means its annual income from operations, on a
consolidated basis, for a given fiscal year, as determined by the firm of
independent certified public accountants providing auditing services to the
Corporation, using generally accepted accounting principles, consistently
applied, and calculated without regard to (a) any bonus paid pursuant to
employment contracts, (b) any income or loss attributable to any other
corporation or entity (including the assets of a corporation or entity that
constitute an operating business) acquired by or merged into the Corporation
subsequent to the effective date of this Agreement. For the fiscal year 2013
only, the annual income from operations of both the Valent Aerostructures and
TASS, Inc. subsidiaries of the corporation shall also be excluded from the
Corporation's Annual Income from Operations. 
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

 

  

The Aerostructures Division's "Annual Income from Operations" means the Income
from Operations of the Corporation, as determined in the preceding paragraph,
less the Annual Income from Operations of D3 Technologies, Inc. and TASS, Inc.
For the fiscal year 2013 only, the annual income from operations of Valent
Aerostructures shall also be excluded from the Aerostructures Division's
Annual Income from Operations.

  


 

  

The Corporation shall pay to the Employee any Performance Bonus due the
Employee hereunder not later than fifteen (15) days after the receipt by the
Corporation of its annual audited financial statements, which the Corporation
expects to receive within ninety (90) days after the end of each fiscal year
of the Corporation. The Performance Bonus will be paid in cash and/or LMI
stock, at the Employee's option. The Employee shall be required to make an
election of percentage amounts to be paid in cash and/or LMI stock
respectively, in writing, prior to the last business day of the fiscal year on
which such Performance Bonus is based. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
percentage elections involving LMI stock may not be made during a "blackout
period" as defined in the Corporation's Insider Trading Policy or while in
possession of material non-public information about the Corporation. All
elections must be reviewed and approved by the Corporation's Chief Compliance
Officer. Should the Employee fail or for any reason be unable to make a timely
election, fifty percent (50%) of the Performance Bonus will be paid in cash
and fifty percent (50%) will be paid in LMI stock. The price per share for any
LMI stock paid as part of the Performance Bonus is based on the average price
per share on the date the cash portion of the bonus is paid.

  

  

(D) In addition to the Base salary and Performance Bonus (if any), the
Employee shall be entitled to receive such bonus compensation as the Board of
Directors of the Corporation may authorize from time to time.

  


 

  

(E) The Corporation retains the right to modify or adjust the manner in which
the Performance Bonus is calculated in the event that the Corporation either
acquires the assets of another entity, or any portion thereof, or sells its
assets, or any portion thereof, to another entity.

  

  

 

(F) The Employee acknowledges his understanding that notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Section 3 or otherwise herein, any
Performance Bonus constituting incentive based compensation, for purposes of
Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
(Dodd-Frank Act) or any other compensation paid to the Employee hereunder that
constitutes incentive based compensation shall be subject to recoupment
pursuant to Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Act and the Corporations Policy for
Recoupment, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A, as such policy
may be modified from time to time to comply with Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank
Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

  

 

  

4. Duties of the Employee.

  


 

  

(A) The Employee shall serve as Co-President of the Aerostructures Division of
the Corporation or in such other positions as may be determined by the Board
of Directors of the Corporation, and the Employee shall perform such duties on
behalf of the Corporation and its subsidiaries by such means, at such
locations, and in such manner as may be specified from time to time by the
Chief Executive Officer or Board of Directors of the Corporation.

  


 

  

(B) The Employee agrees to abide by and conform to all rules established by
the Corporation applicable to its employees.

  


 

  

(C) The Employee acknowledges that the Employee is being employed as a full-
time employee, and the Employee agrees to devote so much of the Employee's
entire time, attention and energies to the business of the Corporation as is
necessary for the successful operation of the Corporation and shall endeavor
at all times to improve the business of the Corporation. The Employee shall
not accept any business commitments other than with the Corporation without
the advance written consent of the Corporation's Chief Executive Officer.

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

 

  

5. Expenses. During the period of the Employee's employment, except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, the Corporation will pay directly, or reimburse the Employee for, all items of reasonable and necessary business expenses approved in advance by the Corporation if such expenses are incurred by the Employee in the interest of the business of the Corporation. The Corporation shall also reimburse the Employee for automobile expenses incurred by the Employee in the performance of the Employee's duties hereunder. The amount of such reimbursement shall be in accordance with the automobile expense reimbursement policy adopted (and as it may be modified from time to time) by the Corporation's Board of Directors. All such expenses paid by the Employee will be reimbursed by the Corporation upon presentation by the Employee, from time to time (but not less than quarterly), of an itemized account of such expenditures in accordance with the Corporation's policy for verifying such expenditures.

  


 

  

6. Fringe Benefits.

  

  

(A) The Employee shall be entitled to participate in any health, accident and
life insurance program and other benefits which have been or may be
established by the Corporation for salaried employees of the Corporation.

  


 

  

 

(B) The Employee shall be entitled to an annual vacation without loss of
compensation for such period as may be determined by the Board of Directors of
the Corporation.

   
 

  

(C) The Corporation shall furnish to the Employee during the term of the
Employee's employment an automobile selected by the Corporation to aid the
Employee in the performance of the Employee's duties. Upon agreement of the
Corporation and the Employee, the Corporation may, in lieu of the automobile,
provide the Employee with a Six Thousand Dollar ($6,000.00) annual automobile
allowance.

  


 

  

7. Covenants of the Employee.

  

  

(A) During the term of the Employee's employment with the Corporation and for
all time thereafter Employee covenants and agrees that Employee will not in
any manner directly or indirectly, except as required in the Employee's duties
to the Corporation, disclose or divulge to any person, entity, firm or company
whatsoever, or use for the Employee's own benefit or the benefit of any other
person, entity, firm or company, directly or indirectly, any knowledge,
devices, information, trade secrets, techniques, customer lists, business
plans or other data belonging to the Corporation or developed by the Employee
on behalf of the Corporation during the Employee's employment with the
Corporation, without regard to whether all of the foregoing matters will be
deemed confidential, material or important, the parties hereto stipulating, as
between them, that the same are important, material, confidential and the
property of the Corporation (hereinafter "Confidential Information"), that
disclosure of the same to or use of the same by third parties would greatly
affect the effective and successful conduct of the business of the Corporation
and the goodwill of the Corporation, and that any breach of the terms of this
subsection (A) shall be a material breach of this Agreement.

  


 

  

(B) During the term of the Employee's employment with the Corporation and for
a period of one (1) year (the "Covenant Term") after cessation for whatever
reason of such employment (except as hereinafter provided in subsection (C) of
this Section 7, the Employee covenants and agrees that the Employee will not
in any manner directly or indirectly:

  


 

  

(1) solicit, divert, take away or interfere with any of the customers (or
their respective affiliates or successors) of the Corporation;

  


 

  

(2) engage directly or indirectly, either personally or as an employee,
partner, associate partner, officer, manager, agent, advisor, consultant or
otherwise, or by means of any corporate or other entity or device, in any
business which is competitive with the business of the Corporation. For
purposes of this covenant, a business will be deemed competitive if it is
conducted in whole or in part within any geographic area wherein the
Corporation is engaged in marketing its products, and if it involves the
design or manufacture of products for the aerospace industry that are the same
or substantially similar to those designed or manufactured by the Corporation
or if it is in any manner competitive, as of the date of cessation of the
Employee's employment, with any business then being conducted by the
Corporation or as to which the Corporation has then formulated definitive
plans to enter;

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

 

  

(3) induce any salesman, distributor, supplier, manufacturer, representative,
agent, jobber or other person transacting business with the Corporation to
terminate their relationship with the Corporation, or to represent, distribute
or sell products in competition with products of the Corporation; or

  


 

  

(4) induce or cause any employee of the Corporation to leave the employ of the
Corporation.

  


 

  

(C) The parties agree that the Covenant Term provided for in the preceding
subsection (B) shall be:

  


 

  

(1) reduced to six (6) months in event of a Change in Control (as that

  

  

term is defined in subsection 2(B) herein); or

  


 

  

(2) eliminated if the business currently operated by the Corporation is
terminated and the assets of the Corporation are liquidated.

  


 

  

(D) All the covenants of the Employee contained in this Section 7 shall be
construed as agreements independent of any other provision of this Agreement,
and the existence of any claim or cause of action against the Corporation,
whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a
defense to the enforcement by the Corporation of these covenants.

  


 

  

(E) It is the intention of the parties to restrict the activities of the
Employee under this Section 7 only to the extent necessary for the protection
of legitimate business interests of the Corporation, and the parties
specifically covenant and agree that should any of the provisions set forth
therein, under any set of circumstances not now foreseen by the parties, be
deemed too broad for such purpose, said provisions will nevertheless be valid
and enforceable to the extent necessary for such protection.

  


 

  

8. Documents. Upon cessation of the Employee's employment with the Corporation, for whatever reason, all documents, records (including without limitation, customer records), notebooks, invoices, statements or correspondence, including copies thereof, relating to the business of the Corporation then in the Employee's possession, whether prepared by the Employee or others, will be delivered to and left with the Corporation, and the Employee agrees not to retain copies of the foregoing documents without the written consent of the Corporation.

  


 

  

9. Remedies. In the event of the breach by the Employee of any of the terms of this Agreement, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Corporation may terminate the employment of the Employee in accordance with the provisions of Section 2 of this Agreement. It is further agreed that any breach or evasion of any of the terms of this Agreement by the Employee will result in immediate and irreparable injury to the Corporation and will authorize recourse to injunction and/or specific performance as well as to other legal or equitable remedies to which the Corporation may be entitled. In addition to any other remedies that it may have in law or equity, the Corporation also may require an accounting and repayment of all profits, compensation, remuneration or other benefits realized, directly or indirectly, as a result of such breaches by the Employee or by a competitor's business controlled, directly or indirectly, by the Employee. No remedy conferred by any of the specific provisions of this Agreement is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy and each and every remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity by statute or otherwise. The election of any one or more remedies by the Corporation shall not constitute a waiver of the right to pursue other available remedies. The Employee expressly agrees to pay all reasonable costs and attorneys' fees incurred by the Corporation in order to enforce the Employee's obligations under this Agreement, regardless of whether litigation is commenced or prosecuted to a judgment.

  


 

  

10. Severability. All agreements and covenants contained herein are severable, and in the event any of them shall be held to be invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, this Agreement, subject to subsection 7(E) hereof, shall continue in full force and effect and shall be interpreted as if such invalid agreements or covenants were not contained herein.

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

 

  

11. Entire Agreement. The Employee has also executed a Noncompetition and Nonsolicitation Agreement with the Valent Aerostructures subsidiary of the Corporation ("Noncompetition Agreement"). This Employment Agreement and the provisions relating to the Employee's confidentiality and restrictive covenant obligations set forth in the Noncompetition Agreement collectively constitute the entire agreement between the Corporation and the Employee with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior proposals, negotiations, representations, communications, writings, outlines and agreements between the Corporation, Valent Aerostructures and the Employee with respect to the subject matter hereof, whether oral or written, which shall be of no further force and effect. For purposes of clarification, to the extent there is an inconsistency between the restrictive covenants set forth in this Noncompetition Agreement and those contained in this Agreement, and both documents are still in effect, the restrictive covenants of the Noncompetition Agreement shall control, unless such provisions of the Noncompetition Agreement are deemed unenforceable, in which case, this Agreement shall control. However, in no event shall the Noncompetition Agreement suspend or eliminate or otherwise alter the one year Restriction Period following termination of Employee's employment or otherwise cause this Agreement's restrictive covenants and obligations not to go into effect after the Noncompetition Agreement has expired. By way of example, if the employment of the Employee is terminated with six months remaining in the term of the Noncompetition Agreement, the Noncompetition Agreement shall control for the remainder of such six months and thereafter, this Agreement shall control for the remaining six months of the Term. This Agreement may not be amended except by a written agreement executed by the party to be charged with the amendment.

  

  

No amendments to this Agreement, except as expressly provided herein to the
contrary, may be made except by a writing signed by both parties.

  


 

  

 

12. Waiver or Modification. No waiver or modification of this Agreement or of any covenant, condition or limitation herein shall be valid unless in writing and duly executed by the party to be charged therewith, and no evidence of any waiver or modification shall be offered or received in evidence in any proceeding, arbitration or litigation between the parties hereto arising out of or affecting this Agreement, or the rights or obligations of the parties hereunder, unless such waiver or modification is in writing, duly executed as aforesaid, and the parties further agree that the provisions of this section may not be waived except as herein set forth. Failure of the Corporation to exercise or otherwise act with respect to any of its rights hereunder in the event of a breach of any of the terms or conditions hereof by the Employee shall not be construed as a waiver of such breach nor prevent the Corporation from thereafter enforcing strict compliance with any and all of the terms and conditions hereof.

   
 

  

 

13. Assignability. This Agreement may be assigned by the Corporation to another entity which purchases substantially all of the assets of the Corporation or acquires a majority of the stock of the Corporation. The services to be performed by the Employee hereunder are personal in nature and, therefore, the Employee shall not assign the Employee's rights or delegate the Employee's obligations under this Agreement, and any attempted or purported assignment or delegation not herein permitted shall be null and void.

   
 

  

14. Successors. Subject to the provisions of Section 13, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Corporation and the Employee and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, legal administrators, successors and assigns.

  


 

  

15. Notices. Any notice or other communication required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given if delivered personally, by over-night courier, or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, if to the Corporation, to:

17. Venue. The parties hereto agree that any suit filed arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be brought only in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, unless that court lacks jurisdiction, in which case such action shall be brought only in the Circuit Court for St. Louis Charles County, Missouri.

  


 

  

18. Disclosure of Existence of Agreement. To preserve the Corporation's rights under this Agreement, the Corporation may advise any third party of the existence of this Agreement and its terms, and the Employee specifically releases and agrees to indemnify and hold the Corporation harmless from any liability for doing so.

  


 

  

 

19. Opportunity to Review. The Employee acknowledges his understanding that this Agreement was prepared by Polsinelli Shughart ("Polsinelli") as counsel for the Corporation and further acknowledges his understanding that in such capacity, Polsinelli has acted solely as counsel for the Corporation and does not represent the Employee. Additionally, the Employee hereby acknowledges and represents that he has had the opportunity to review this Agreement and to seek advice of counsel of his choosing to represent the interests of the Employee prior to his execution hereof.

Exhibit A

  

  

LMI Aerospace, Inc.

  

  

Policy for Recoupment of Incentive Compensation

  

  

If LMI Aerospace, Inc. (the "Corporation") is required to prepare an
accounting restatement for any fiscal quarter or year commencing after May 31,
2010 due to the material non-compliance of the Corporation with any financial
reporting requirement under the securities laws, the Corporation shall recover
any incentive-based compensation (including stock options) paid to any current
or former executive officer during the three-year period preceding the date on
which the Corporation is required to prepare a restatement. The amount to be
recovered is the excess of the amount originally paid to the executive officer
based on the incorrect financial statements over the amount that would have
been paid under the restated financials.

  

  

This Policy for Recoupment of Incentive Compensation ("Policy") is intended to
comply with Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Clawback Provision"). Accordingly, to the
extent of any inconsistency between this Policy and of the Dodd-Frank Clawback
Provision, the Dodd-Frank Clawback Provision shall prevail. Additionally, to
the extent that future rules and regulations are promulgated by the Securities
and Exchange Commission or any other federal regulatory agency that would add
to, modify or supplement the Dodd-Frank Clawback Provision (each, a
"Modification"), then this Policy shall be deemed modified to the extent
required to make this Policy consistent with the Dodd-Frank Clawback
Provision, giving effect to such revision as of the date upon which such
Modification becomes or would otherwise be deemed to be effective.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  


 Exhibit 2.4(a)(vi)

  

 


 

  

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

  

 

  

LMI AEROSPACE, INC., a Missouri corporation (the "Corporation"), and Henry H.
Newell (the "Employee"), hereby agree as follows:

  

  


 

  

1. Employment. The Corporation hereby employs the Employee, and the Employee accepts employment from the Corporation, upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth. Any and all employment agreements heretofore entered into between the Corporation and the Employee are hereby terminated and cancelled, and each of the parties hereto mutually releases and discharges the other from any and all obligations and liabilities heretofore or now existing under or by virtue of any such employment agreements, it being the intention of the parties hereto that this Agreement, effective immediately, shall supersede and be in lieu of any and all prior employment agreements between them.

  


 

  

2. Term of Employment.

  


 

  

 

(A) The initial term of the Employee\'s employment under this Agreement shall
commence on January 1, 2013 and shall terminate as of the close of business on
January 1, 2016; provided, however, that this Agreement shall be automatically
extended for additional terms of one year each unless not later than October
31 of any year beginning in 2015, either party has given written notice to the
other party of its or the Employee's intention not to extend the term of this
Agreement; and provided, further, that the term of employment may be
terminated upon the earlier occurrence of any of the following events:

   
 

  

(1) Upon the termination of the business or corporate existence of the
Corporation;

  

  

(2) At the Corporation's option, in the event the Corporation determines that
the Employee is not performing the duties required of the Employee hereunder
to the satisfaction of the Corporation;

   
 

(3) Upon the death of the Employee;

  


 

  

(4) At the Corporation's option, if the Employee shall suffer a permanent
disability. (For the purposes of this Agreement, "permanent disability" means
any physical or mental impairment that renders the Employee unable for a
period of six (6) months or more to perform the essential job functions of the
Employee's position, even with reasonable accommodation, as determined by a
physician selected by the Corporation.) The Employee acknowledges and agrees
that the Employee shall voluntarily submit to a medical or psychological
examination for the purpose of determining the Employee's continued fitness to
perform the essential functions of the Employee's position whenever requested
to do so by the Corporation. If the Corporation elects to terminate the
employment relationship on this basis, the Corporation shall notify the
Employee or the Employee's representative in writing and the termination shall
become effective on the date that such notification is given;

  


 

  

(5) At the Corporation's option, upon ten (10) calendar days' written notice
to the Employee, in the event of any breach or default by the Employee of any
of the terms of this Agreement or of any of the Employee's duties or
obligations hereunder. In lieu of providing ten (10) calendar days' advance
written notice, the Corporation, at its sole option, may terminate the
Employee's services immediately and pay the Employee an amount that is
equivalent to ten (10) calendar days of the Employee's salary, less any
deductions required by law;

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

(6) At the Corporation's option, without any advance notice, in the event that
the Employee engages in conduct which, in the opinion of the Corporation, (1)
constitutes dishonesty of any kind (including, but not limited to, any
misrepresentation of facts or falsification of records) in the Employee's
relations, interactions or dealings with the Corporation or its customers; (2)
constitutes a felony; (3) potentially may or will expose the Corporation to
public disrepute or disgrace, or potentially may or will cause harm to the
customer relations, operations or business prospects of the Corporation; (4)
constitutes harassment or discrimination towards any person associated with
the Corporation, whether an employee, agent or customer, based upon that
person's race, color, national origin, sex, age, disability, religion, or
other protected status; (5) reflects disruptive or disorderly conduct,
including but not limited to, acts of violence, fighting, intimidation or
threats of violence against any person associated with the Corporation,
whether an employee, agent or customer, or possessing a weapon while on the
Corporation's premises or while acting on behalf of the Corporation; (6) is
indicative of abusive or illegal drug use while on the Corporation's premises
or while acting on the Corporation's behalf; or (7) constitutes a willful
violation of any governmental rules or regulations; or

  


 

  

(7) At the Employee's option, after providing the Corporation with at least
thirty (30) calendar days advance written notice of the Employee's intention
to terminate the employment relationship.

  


 

  

If employment is terminated for any of the reasons set forth in (3) through
(7) of this subsection 2(A), the Employee shall be entitled to receive only
the Base Salary (as that term is hereinafter defined) accrued but unpaid as of
the date of the termination and shall be ineligible to receive any additional
compensation or severance pay. If, on the other hand, employment is terminated
by the Corporation during the term of this Agreement for any reason other than
those set forth in (3) through (7) of this subsection 2(A), subject to the
conditions set forth in subsections 2(C) and (D) of this Agreement, the
Corporation shall provide severance pay to the Employee in an amount based
upon his length of service with the Corporation. Specifically, the Corporation
shall provide the Employee with six (6) months of Base Salary if he has less
than five (5) years of service with the Corporation as of the date of his
termination and with twelve (12) months of Base Salary if he has five (5) or
more years of service with the Corporation as of the date of his termination.

  


 

  

(B) If employment is terminated in conjunction with a change in the control of
the Corporation, the Corporation will provide the Employee with severance pay
under the circumstances specified in (1) and (2) of this subsection (B), and
the conditions set forth in subsections 2(C) and (D) of this Agreement. For
the purposes of this Agreement, a "Change in Control" is defined as the sale
of substantially all of the operating assets of the Corporation, the
acquisition of more than fifty percent (50%) of the stock of the Corporation
by a group of shareholders or an entity which acquires control of the
Corporation (a "Purchaser"), or a merger or consolidation of the Corporation
with any other corporation, other than a merger or consolidation which would
result in the voting securities of the Corporation outstanding immediately
prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by
being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity) fifty percent
(50%) or more of the total voting power represented by the voting securities
of the Corporation or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such
merger or consolidation.

  


 

  

(1) If the Change in Control results in the involuntary termination of the
Employee or results in the Employee electing within nine (9) months from the
date of the Change in Control to terminate the Employee's employment for Good
Reason (as defined in subsection 2(E)), the Corporation shall provide the
Employee with severance pay in an amount that is equal to two and one-half
times the Employee's annual Base Salary and shall pay the Employee any
reasonably anticipated Performance Bonus for the fiscal year in which the
Employee was terminated on a prorated basis.

  


 

  

(2) If the Employee voluntarily terminates the Employee's employment without
Good Reason (as defined in subsection 2(E)) within ninety (90) days after the
Change in Control, the Corporation shall provide the Employee with six (6)
months of Base Salary if the Employee has less than five (5) years of service
with the Corporation as of the date of the Employee's termination and with
twelve (12) months of Base Salary if the Employee has five (5) or more years
of service with the Corporation as of the date of the Employee's termination.

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

(C) The severance pay provided for in subsections 2(A) and 2(B) of this
Agreement shall be paid in equal monthly installments commencing immediately
after the termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at the time of the
Employee's termination, the Employee is considered a 'specified employee'
within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2) of the Code, and if any payment that
the Employee becomes entitled to under this Agreement would be considered
deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the code, then no such
payment shall be payable prior to the date that is earlier of (1) six months
and one day after employee's termination, or (2) the Employee's death, and the
initial payment shall include a catch-up payment covering amounts that would
otherwise have been paid during the six-month period but for application of
this provision.

  


 

  

(D) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i) the amount of severance pay
provided under this Agreement shall not under any circumstances exceed the
limitations set forth in § 280G of the Code, and (ii) the Corporation's
obligation to pay the severance pay provided for in this Section 2 shall be
conditioned on the Employee's execution of a written release satisfactory to
the Corporation.

  


 

  

(E) For the purposes of subsection 2(B), "Good Reason" shall mean the
occurrence of any of the following events: (1) a significant reduction of the
Employee's duties, authority or responsibilities relative to the Employee's
duties, authority or responsibilities as in effect immediately prior to such
reduction; (2) the Purchaser requiring the Employee to relocate his primary
work office to a facility or location more than fifty (50) miles from the
Employee's then-present location; or (3) the Purchaser refusing to offer full
time employment to the Employee on terms comparable to those provided by the
Corporation prior to the acquisition.

  

  

3. Compensation.

  


 

  

 

(A) During the period from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013 the
Corporation shall compensate the Employee for the Employee's services rendered
hereunder by paying to the Employee an annual salary (the "Base Salary") of
Three Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($350,000.00), less any authorized or
required payroll deductions. During the period from January 1, 2014 to
December 31, 2014, the Employee's Base Salary shall be Three Hundred Sixty
Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($360,500.00), less any authorized or required
payroll deductions. During the period from January 1, 2015 to December 31,
2015, the Employee's Base Salary shall be Three Hundred Seventy-One Thousand
Three Hundred Fifteen Dollars ($371,315.00), less any authorized or required
payroll deductions. Thereafter, as long as this Agreement remains in effect,
the annual Base Salary that the Corporation shall pay to the Employee for the
Employee's services rendered hereunder will be Three Hundred Seventy-One
Thousand Three Hundred Fifteen Dollars ($371,315.00), less any authorized or
required payroll deductions.

  

  

(B) During the term of this Agreement, provided that the Employee is employed
under the terms and conditions of this Agreement as of the first day of the
next fiscal year, the Corporation shall pay the Employee a "Performance
Bonus," in addition to the Employee's Base Salary, calculated as follows:

 

   
 

(1) Five percent (5%) of the Employee's Base Salary, provided the
Aerostructures Division's Annual Income from Operations for such fiscal year
is not less than sixty percent (60.0%) of its budgeted Annual Income from
Operations; plus

  

  

(2) Five percent (5%) of the Employee's Base Salary, provided the
Aerostructures Division's Annual Income from Operations for such fiscal year
is not less than one-hundred percent (100%) of its budgeted Annual Income from
Operations; plus

  

  

(3) Twenty-two one hundredths percent (0.22%) of the Annual Income from
Operations, provided the Corporation's Annual Income from Operations for such
fiscal year is not less than sixty percent (60%) of its budgeted Annual Income
from Operations.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

 

  

For purposes of the calculation of the Performance Bonus, the Corporation's
"Annual Income from Operations" means its annual income from operations, on a
consolidated basis, for a given fiscal year, as determined by the firm of
independent certified public accountants providing auditing services to the
Corporation, using generally accepted accounting principles, consistently
applied, and calculated without regard to (a) any bonus paid pursuant to
employment contracts, (b) any income or loss attributable to any other
corporation or entity (including the assets of a corporation or entity that
constitute an operating business) acquired by or merged into the Corporation
subsequent to the effective date of this Agreement. For the fiscal year 2013
only, the annual income from operations of both the Valent Aerostructures and
TASS, Inc. subsidiaries of the corporation shall also be excluded from the
Corporation's Annual Income from Operations.

  

  

The Aerostructures Division's "Annual Income from Operations" means the Income
from Operations of the Corporation, as determined in the preceding paragraph,
less the Annual Income from Operations of D3 Technologies, Inc. and TASS, Inc.
For the fiscal year 2013 only, the annual income from operations of Valent
Aerostructures shall also be excluded from the Aerostructures Division's
Annual Income from Operations.

  


 

  

The Corporation shall pay to the Employee any Performance Bonus due the
Employee hereunder not later than fifteen (15) days after the receipt by the
Corporation of its annual audited financial statements, which the Corporation
expects to receive within ninety (90) days after the end of each fiscal year
of the Corporation. The Performance Bonus will be paid in cash and/or LMI
stock, at the Employee's option. The Employee shall be required to make an
election of percentage amounts to be paid in cash and/or LMI stock
respectively, in writing, prior to the last business day of the fiscal year on
which such Performance Bonus is based. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
percentage elections involving LMI stock may not be made during a "blackout
period" as defined in the Corporation's Insider Trading Policy or while in
possession of material non-public information about the Corporation. All
elections must be reviewed and approved by the Corporation's Chief Compliance
Officer. Should the Employee fail or for any reason be unable to make a timely
election, fifty percent (50%) of the Performance Bonus will be paid in cash
and fifty percent (50%) will be paid in LMI stock. The price per share for any
LMI stock paid as part of the Performance Bonus is based on the average price
per share on the date the cash portion of the bonus is paid.

  

  

(D) In addition to the Base salary and Performance Bonus (if any), the
Employee shall be entitled to receive such bonus compensation as the Board of
Directors of the Corporation may authorize from time to time.

  


 

  

(E) The Corporation retains the right to modify or adjust the manner in which
the Performance Bonus is calculated in the event that the Corporation either
acquires the assets of another entity, or any portion thereof, or sells its
assets, or any portion thereof, to another entity.

  

  

(F) The Employee acknowledges his understanding that notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Section 3 or otherwise herein, any
Performance Bonus constituting "incentive based compensation," for purposes of
Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
("Dodd-Frank Act") or any other compensation paid to the Employee hereunder
that constitutes "incentive based compensation" shall be subject to recoupment
pursuant to Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Act and the Corporation's Policy for
Recoupment, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A, as such policy
may be modified from time to time to comply with Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank
Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

   
 

4. Duties of the Employee.

  


 

  

(A) The Employee shall serve as Co-President of the Aerostructures Division of
the Corporation or in such other positions as may be determined by the Board
of Directors of the Corporation, and the Employee shall perform such duties on
behalf of the Corporation and its subsidiaries by such means, at such
locations, and in such manner as may be specified from time to time by the
Chief Executive Officer or Board of Directors of the Corporation.

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

 

  

(B) The Employee agrees to abide by and conform to all rules established by
the Corporation applicable to its employees.

  


 

  

(C) The Employee acknowledges that the Employee is being employed as a full-
time employee, and the Employee agrees to devote so much of the Employee's
entire time, attention and energies to the business of the Corporation as is
necessary for the successful operation of the Corporation and shall endeavor
at all times to improve the business of the Corporation. The Employee shall
not accept any business commitments other than with the Corporation without
the advance written consent of the Corporation's Chief Executive Officer.

  

  

5. Expenses. During the period of the Employee's employment, except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, the Corporation will pay directly, or reimburse the Employee for, all items of reasonable and necessary business expenses approved in advance by the Corporation if such expenses are incurred by the Employee in the interest of the business of the Corporation. The Corporation shall also reimburse the Employee for automobile expenses incurred by the Employee in the performance of the Employee's duties hereunder. The amount of such reimbursement shall be in accordance with the automobile expense reimbursement policy adopted (and as it may be modified from time to time) by the Corporation's Board of Directors. All such expenses paid by the Employee will be reimbursed by the Corporation upon presentation by the Employee, from time to time (but not less than quarterly), of an itemized account of such expenditures in accordance with the Corporation's policy for verifying such expenditures.

  


 

  

6. Fringe Benefits.

  

  

(A) The Employee shall be entitled to participate in any health, accident and
life insurance program and other benefits which have been or may be
established by the Corporation for salaried employees of the Corporation.

  


 

  

 

(B) The Employee shall be entitled to an annual vacation without loss of
compensation for such period as may be determined by the Board of Directors of
the Corporation.

   
 

  

(C) The Corporation shall furnish to the Employee during the term of the
Employee's employment an automobile selected by the Corporation to aid the
Employee in the performance of the Employee's duties. Upon agreement of the
Corporation and the Employee, the Corporation may, in lieu of the automobile,
provide the Employee with a Six Thousand Dollar ($6,000.00) annual automobile
allowance.

  

  

7. Covenants of the Employee.

  

  

(A) During the term of the Employee's employment with the Corporation and for
all time thereafter Employee covenants and agrees that Employee will not in
any manner directly or indirectly, except as required in the Employee's duties
to the Corporation, disclose or divulge to any person, entity, firm or company
whatsoever, or use for the Employee's own benefit or the benefit of any other
person, entity, firm or company, directly or indirectly, any knowledge,
devices, information, trade secrets, techniques, customer lists, business
plans or other data belonging to the Corporation or developed by the Employee
on behalf of the Corporation during the Employee's employment with the
Corporation, without regard to whether all of the foregoing matters will be
deemed confidential, material or important, the parties hereto stipulating, as
between them, that the same are important, material, confidential and the
property of the Corporation (hereinafter "Confidential Information"), that
disclosure of the same to or use of the same by third parties would greatly
affect the effective and successful conduct of the business of the Corporation
and the goodwill of the Corporation, and that any breach of the terms of this
subsection (A) shall be a material breach of this Agreement.

  


 

  

(B) During the term of the Employee's employment with the Corporation and for
a period of one (1) year (the "Covenant Term") after cessation for whatever
reason of such employment (except as hereinafter provided in subsection (C) of
this Section 7, the Employee covenants and agrees that the Employee will not
in any manner directly or indirectly:

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

 

  

(1) solicit, divert, take away or interfere with any of the customers (or
their respective affiliates or successors) of the Corporation;

  


 

  

(2) engage directly or indirectly, either personally or as an employee,
partner, associate partner, officer, manager, agent, advisor, consultant or
otherwise, or by means of any corporate or other entity or device, in any
business which is competitive with the business of the Corporation. For
purposes of this covenant, a business will be deemed competitive if it is
conducted in whole or in part within any geographic area wherein the
Corporation is engaged in marketing its products, and if it involves the
design or manufacture of products for the aerospace industry that are the same
or substantially similar to those designed or manufactured by the Corporation
or if it is in any manner competitive, as of the date of cessation of the
Employee's employment, with any business then being conducted by the
Corporation or as to which the Corporation has then formulated definitive
plans to enter;

  


 

  

(3) induce any salesman, distributor, supplier, manufacturer, representative,
agent, jobber or other person transacting business with the Corporation to
terminate their relationship with the Corporation, or to represent, distribute
or sell products in competition with products of the Corporation; or

  


 

  

(4) induce or cause any employee of the Corporation to leave the employ of the
Corporation.

  


 

  

(C) The parties agree that the Covenant Term provided for in the preceding
subsection (B) shall be:

  


 

  

(1) reduced to six (6) months in event of a Change in Control (as that

  

  

term is defined in subsection 2(B) herein); or

  


 

  

(2) eliminated if the business currently operated by the Corporation is
terminated and the assets of the Corporation are liquidated.

  


 

  

(D) All the covenants of the Employee contained in this Section 7 shall be
construed as agreements independent of any other provision of this Agreement,
and the existence of any claim or cause of action against the Corporation,
whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a
defense to the enforcement by the Corporation of these covenants.

  


 

  

(E) It is the intention of the parties to restrict the activities of the
Employee under this Section 7 only to the extent necessary for the protection
of legitimate business interests of the Corporation, and the parties
specifically covenant and agree that should any of the provisions set forth
therein, under any set of circumstances not now foreseen by the parties, be
deemed too broad for such purpose, said provisions will nevertheless be valid
and enforceable to the extent necessary for such protection.

  


 

  

8. Documents. Upon cessation of the Employee's employment with the Corporation, for whatever reason, all documents, records (including without limitation, customer records), notebooks, invoices, statements or correspondence, including copies thereof, relating to the business of the Corporation then in the Employee's possession, whether prepared by the Employee or others, will be delivered to and left with the Corporation, and the Employee agrees not to retain copies of the foregoing documents without the written consent of the Corporation.

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

 

  

9. Remedies. In the event of the breach by the Employee of any of the terms of this Agreement, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Corporation may terminate the employment of the Employee in accordance with the provisions of Section 2 of this Agreement. It is further agreed that any breach or evasion of any of the terms of this Agreement by the Employee will result in immediate and irreparable injury to the Corporation and will authorize recourse to injunction and/or specific performance as well as to other legal or equitable remedies to which the Corporation may be entitled. In addition to any other remedies that it may have in law or equity, the Corporation also may require an accounting and repayment of all profits, compensation, remuneration or other benefits realized, directly or indirectly, as a result of such breaches by the Employee or by a competitor's business controlled, directly or indirectly, by the Employee. No remedy conferred by any of the specific provisions of this Agreement is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy and each and every remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity by statute or otherwise. The election of any one or more remedies by the Corporation shall not constitute a waiver of the right to pursue other available remedies. The Employee expressly agrees to pay all reasonable costs and attorneys' fees incurred by the Corporation in order to enforce the Employee's obligations under this Agreement, regardless of whether litigation is commenced or prosecuted to a judgment.

  


 

  

10. Severability. All agreements and covenants contained herein are severable, and in the event any of them shall be held to be invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, this Agreement, subject to subsection 7(E) hereof, shall continue in full force and effect and shall be interpreted as if such invalid agreements or covenants were not contained herein.

  


 

  

11. Entire Agreement. The Employee has also executed a Noncompetition and Nonsolicitation Agreement with the Valent Aerostructures subsidiary of the Corporation ("Noncompetition Agreement"). This Employment Agreement and the provisions relating to the Employee's confidentiality and restrictive covenant obligations set forth in the Noncompetition Agreement collectively constitute the entire agreement between the Corporation and the Employee with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior proposals, negotiations, representations, communications, writings, outlines and agreements between the Corporation, Valent Aerostructures and the Employee with respect to the subject matter hereof, whether oral or written, which shall be of no further force and effect. For purposes of clarification, to the extent there is an inconsistency between the restrictive covenants set forth in this Noncompetition Agreement and those contained in this Agreement, and both documents are still in effect, the restrictive covenants of the Noncompetition Agreement shall control, unless such provisions of the Noncompetition Agreement are deemed unenforceable, in which case, this Agreement shall control. However, in no event shall the Noncompetition Agreement suspend or eliminate or otherwise alter the one year Restriction Period following termination of Employee's employment or otherwise cause this Agreement's restrictive covenants and obligations not to go into effect after the Noncompetition Agreement has expired. By way of example, if the employment of the Employee is terminated with six months remaining in the term of the Noncompetition Agreement, the Noncompetition Agreement shall control for the remainder of such six months and thereafter, this Agreement shall control for the remaining six months of the Term. This Agreement may not be amended except by a written agreement executed by the party to be charged with the amendment.

  

  

No amendments to this Agreement, except as expressly provided herein to the
contrary, may be made except by a writing signed by both parties.

  


 

  

 

12. Waiver or Modification. No waiver or modification of this Agreement or of any covenant, condition or limitation herein shall be valid unless in writing and duly executed by the party to be charged therewith, and no evidence of any waiver or modification shall be offered or received in evidence in any proceeding, arbitration or litigation between the parties hereto arising out of or affecting this Agreement, or the rights or obligations of the parties hereunder, unless such waiver or modification is in writing, duly executed as aforesaid, and the parties further agree that the provisions of this section may not be waived except as herein set forth. Failure of the Corporation to exercise or otherwise act with respect to any of its rights hereunder in the event of a breach of any of the terms or conditions hereof by the Employee shall not be construed as a waiver of such breach nor prevent the Corporation from thereafter enforcing strict compliance with any and all of the terms and conditions hereof.

   
 

  

 

13. Assignability. This Agreement may be assigned by the Corporation to another entity which purchases substantially all of the assets of the Corporation or acquires a majority of the stock of the Corporation. The services to be performed by the Employee hereunder are personal in nature and, therefore, the Employee shall not assign the Employee's rights or delegate the Employee's obligations under this Agreement, and any attempted or purported assignment or delegation not herein permitted shall be null and void.

   
 

  

14. Successors. Subject to the provisions of Section 13, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Corporation and the Employee and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, legal administrators, successors and assigns.

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

15. Notices. Any notice or other communication required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given if delivered personally, by over-night courier, or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, if to the Corporation, to:

Exhibit A

  


 LMI Aerospace, Inc.

  

  

Policy for Recoupment of Incentive Compensation 
 

  

If LMI Aerospace, Inc. (the "Corporation") is required to prepare an
accounting restatement for any fiscal quarter or year commencing after May 31,
2010 due to the material non-compliance of the Corporation with any financial
reporting requirement under the securities laws, the Corporation shall recover
any incentive-based compensation (including stock options) paid to any current
or former executive officer during the three-year period preceding the date on
which the Corporation is required to prepare a restatement. The amount to be
recovered is the excess of the amount originally paid to the executive officer
based on the incorrect financial statements over the amount that would have
been paid under the restated financials.

  

  

This Policy for Recoupment of Incentive Compensation ("Policy") is intended to
comply with Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Clawback Provision"). Accordingly, to the
extent of any inconsistency between this Policy and of the Dodd-Frank Clawback
Provision, the Dodd-Frank Clawback Provision shall prevail. Additionally, to
the extent that future rules and regulations are promulgated by the Securities
and Exchange Commission or any other federal regulatory agency that would add
to, modify or supplement the Dodd-Frank Clawback Provision (each, a
"Modification"), then this Policy shall be deemed modified to the extent
required to make this Policy consistent with the Dodd-Frank Clawback
Provision, giving effect to such revision as of the date upon which such
Modification becomes or would otherwise be deemed to be effective.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

 

  

Exhibit 2.4(a)(vi)

  


 

  

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

  

  

VALENT AEROSTRUCTURES, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Company"),
a wholly-owned subsidiary of LMI AEROSPACE, INC., a Missouri Corporation
("Parent"), and Bruce R. Breckenridge (the "Employee"), hereby agree as
follows:

  

  


 

  

1. Employment. The Company hereby employs the Employee, and the Employee accepts employment from the Company, upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth. Any and all employment agreements heretofore entered into between the Company and the Employee are hereby terminated and cancelled, and each of the parties hereto mutually releases and discharges the other from any and all obligations and liabilities heretofore or now existing under or by virtue of any such employment agreements, it being the intention of the parties hereto that this Agreement, effective immediately, shall supersede and be in lieu of any and all prior employment agreements between them.

  


 

  

2. Term of Employment.

  

  

 

(A) The initial term of the Employee\'s employment under this Agreement shall
commence on January 1, 2013 and shall terminate as of the close of business on
January 1, 2016; provided, however, that this Agreement shall be automatically
extended for additional terms of one year each unless not later than October
31 of any year beginning in 2015, either party has given written notice to the
other party of its or the Employee's intention not to extend the term of this
Agreement; and provided, further, that the term of employment may be
terminated upon the earlier occurrence of any of the following events:

  

 

  

(1) Upon the termination of the business or corporate existence of the
Company;

  

  

(2) At the Company's option, in the event the Company determines that the
Employee is not performing the duties required of the Employee hereunder to
the satisfaction of the Company;

   
 

(3) Upon the death of the Employee;

  


 

  

(4) At the Company's option, if the Employee shall suffer a permanent
disability. (For the purposes of this Agreement, "permanent disability" means
any physical or mental impairment that renders the Employee unable for a
period of six (6) months or more to perform the essential job functions of the
Employee's position, even with reasonable accommodation, as determined by a
physician selected by the Company.) The Employee acknowledges and agrees that
the Employee shall voluntarily submit to a medical or psychological
examination for the purpose of determining the Employee's continued fitness to
perform the essential functions of the Employee's position whenever requested
to do so by the Company. If the Company elects to terminate the employment
relationship on this basis, the Company shall notify the Employee or the
Employee's representative in writing and the termination shall become
effective on the date that such notification is given;

  


 

  

(5) At the Company's option, upon ten (10) calendar days' written notice to
the Employee, in the event of any breach or default by the Employee of any of
the terms of this Agreement or of any of the Employee's duties or obligations
hereunder. In lieu of providing ten (10) calendar days' advance written
notice, the Company, at its sole option, may terminate the Employee's services
immediately and pay the Employee an amount that is equivalent to ten (10)
calendar days of the Employee's salary, less any deductions required by law;

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

 

  

(6) At the Company's option, without any advance notice, in the event that the
Employee engages in conduct which, in the opinion of the Company, (1)
constitutes dishonesty of any kind (including, but not limited to, any
misrepresentation of facts or falsification of records) in the Employee's
relations, interactions or dealings with the Company or its customers; (2)
constitutes a felony; (3) potentially may or will expose the Company to public
disrepute or disgrace, or potentially may or will cause harm to the customer
relations, operations or business prospects of the Company; (4) constitutes
harassment or discrimination towards any person associated with the Company,
whether an employee, agent or customer, based upon that person's race, color,
national origin, sex, age, disability, religion, or other protected status;
(5) reflects disruptive or disorderly conduct, including but not limited to,
acts of violence, fighting, intimidation or threats of violence against any
person associated with the Company, whether an employee, agent or customer, or
possessing a weapon while on the Company's premises or while acting on behalf
of the Company; (6) is indicative of abusive or illegal drug use while on the
Company's premises or while acting on the Company's behalf; or (7) constitutes
a willful violation of any governmental rules or regulations; or

  


 

  

(7) At the Employee's option, after providing the Company with at least thirty
(30) calendar days advance written notice of the Employee's intention to
terminate the employment relationship.

  


 

  

If employment is terminated for any of the reasons set forth in (3) through
(7) of this subsection 2(A), the Employee shall be entitled to receive only
the Base Salary (as that term is hereinafter defined) accrued but unpaid as of
the date of the termination and shall be ineligible to receive any additional
compensation or severance pay. If, on the other hand, employment is terminated
by the Company during the term of this Agreement for any reason other than
those set forth in (3) through (7) of this subsection

  

2(A), subject to the conditions set forth in subsections 2(C) and (D) of this
Agreement, the Company shall provide severance pay to the Employee in an
amount based upon his length of service with the Company. Specifically, the
Company shall provide the Employee with six (6) months of Base Salary if he
has less than five (5) years of service with the Company as of the date of his
termination and with twelve (12) months of Base Salary if he has five (5) or
more years of service with the Company as of the date of his termination.

  


 

  

(B) If employment is terminated in conjunction with a change in the control of
the Company or the Parent, the Company will provide the Employee with
severance pay under the circumstances specified in (1) and (2) of this
subsection (B), and the conditions set forth in subsections 2(C) and (D) of
this Agreement. For the purposes of this Agreement, a "Change in Control" is
defined as the sale of substantially all of the operating assets of the
Company or the Parent, the acquisition of more than fifty percent (50%) of the
stock of the Company or the Parent by a group of shareholders or an entity
which acquires control of the Company or Parent (a "Purchaser"), or a merger
or consolidation of the Company or Parent with any other corporation, other
than a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting securities of
the Parent outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent
(either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities
of the surviving entity) fifty percent (50%) or more of the total voting power
represented by the voting securities of the Parent or such surviving entity
outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation.

  


 

  

(1) If the Change in Control results in the involuntary termination of the
Employee or results in the Employee electing within nine (9) months from the
date of the Change in Control to terminate the Employee's employment for Good
Reason (as defined in subsection 2(E)), the Company shall provide the Employee
with severance pay in an amount that is equal to two and one-half times the
Employee's annual Base Salary and shall pay the Employee any reasonably
anticipated Performance Bonus for the fiscal year in which the Employee was
terminated on a prorated basis.

  


 

  

(2) If the Employee voluntarily terminates the Employee's employment without
Good Reason (as defined in subsection 2(E)) within ninety (90) days after the
Change in Control, the Company shall provide the Employee with six (6) months
of Base Salary if the Employee has less than five (5) years of service with
the Company as of the date of the Employee's termination and with twelve (12)
months of Base Salary if the Employee has five (5) or more years of service
with the Company as of the date of the Employee's termination.

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

 

  

(C) The severance pay provided for in subsections 2(A) and 2(B) of this
Agreement shall be paid in equal monthly installments commencing immediately
after the termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at the time of the
Employee's termination, the Employee is considered a 'specified employee'
within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2) of the Code, and if any payment that
the Employee becomes entitled to under this Agreement would be considered
deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the code, then no such
payment shall be payable prior to the date that is earlier of (1) six months
and one day after employee's termination, or (2) the Employee's death, and the
initial payment shall include a catch-up payment covering amounts that would
otherwise have been paid during the six-month period but for application of
this provision.

  


 

  

(D) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i) the amount of severance pay
provided under this Agreement shall not under any circumstances exceed the
limitations set forth in § 280G of the Code, and (ii) the Company's obligation
to pay the severance pay provided for in this Section 2 shall be conditioned
on the Employee's execution of a written release satisfactory to the Company.

  


 

  

(E) For the purposes of subsection 2(B), "Good Reason" shall mean the
occurrence of any of the following events: (1) a significant reduction of the
Employee's duties, authority or responsibilities relative to the Employee's
duties, authority or responsibilities as in effect immediately prior to such
reduction; (2) the Purchaser requiring the Employee to relocate his primary
work office to a facility or location more than fifty (50) miles from the
Employee's then-present location; or (3) the Purchaser refusing to offer full
time employment to the Employee on terms comparable to those provided by the
Company prior to the acquisition.

  

  

3. Compensation.

  

  

 

(A) During the period from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013 the Company
shall compensate the Employee for the Employee's services rendered hereunder
by paying to the Employee an annual salary (the "Base Salary") of Two Hundred
Sixty Thousand Dollars ($260,000.00), less any authorized or required payroll
deductions. During the period from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014, the
Employee's Base Salary shall be Two Hundred Sixty-seven Thousand Eight Hundred
Dollars ($267,800.00), less any authorized or required payroll deductions.
During the period from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015, the Employee's
Base Salary shall be Two Hundred Seventy-five Thousand Eight Hundred Thirty-
four Dollars ($275,834.00), less any authorized or required payroll
deductions. Thereafter, as long as this Agreement remains in effect, the
annual Base Salary that the Company shall pay to the Employee for the
Employee's services rendered hereunder will be Two Hundred Seventy-five
Thousand Eight Hundred Thirty-four Dollars ($275,834.00), less any authorized
or required payroll deductions.

  

 

  

(B) For fiscal year 2013 of the Company during the term of this Agreement,
provided that the Employee is employed under the terms of this Agreement as of
the first day of the next fiscal year, the Company shall pay the Employee a
"Performance Bonus," in addition to the Employee's Base Salary, calculated
consistent with the methodology utilized by the Company in 2012.

  


 

  

 

(C) This Agreement shall be amended on or before October 31, 2013 to provide
Employee a Performance Bonus formula for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 of the
Company. The Performance Bonus formula shall be consistent with the
Performance Bonus formula used for employees at a similar level and position
as Employee within the Company or the Parent, and will be designed to create a
bonus payment of approximately 25-30% of base pay if the Company and Parent
meet their targets for income from operations for the year. Payment of any
Performance Bonus shall be contingent upon on the financial performance of
both the Company and the Parent and provided that the Employee is employed
under the terms of this Agreement as of the first day of the next fiscal year.

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

(D) The Company shall pay to the Employee any Performance Bonus due the
Employee hereunder not later than fifteen (15) days after the receipt by the
Company of its annual audited financial statements, which the Company expects
to receive within ninety (90) days after the end of each fiscal year of the
Company. The Performance Bonus will be paid in cash, less any authorized or
required payroll deductions.

  

  

(D) In addition to the Base salary and Performance Bonus (if any), the
Employee shall be entitled to receive such bonus compensation as the Board of
Directors of the Parent may authorize from time to time.

  


 

  

(E) The Parent retains the right to modify or adjust the manner in which the
Performance Bonus is calculated in the event that the Company or the Parent
either acquires the assets of another entity, or any portion thereof, or sells
its assets, or any portion thereof, to another entity.

  


 

  

 

(F) The Employee acknowledges his understanding that notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Section 3 or otherwise herein, any
Performance Bonus constituting "incentive based compensation," for purposes of
Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
("Dodd-Frank Act") or any other compensation paid to the Employee hereunder
that constitutes "incentive based compensation" shall be subject to recoupment
pursuant to Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Act and the Company's Policy for
Recoupment, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A, as such policy
may be modified from time to time to comply with Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank
Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

   
 

  

4. Duties of the Employee.

  


 

  

(A) The Employee shall serve as the Executive Vice President, Business
Development of the Company or in such other positions as may be determined by
the Board of Directors of the Parent, and the Employee shall perform such
duties on behalf of the Company by such means, at such locations, and in such
manner as may be specified from time to time by the Chief Executive Officer or
Board of Directors of the Parent.

  


 

  

(B) The Employee agrees to abide by and conform to all rules established by
the Company applicable to its employees.

  


 

  

(C) The Employee acknowledges that the Employee is being employed as a full-
time employee, and the Employee agrees to devote so much of the Employee's
entire time, attention and energies to the business of the Company as is
necessary for the successful operation of the Company and shall endeavor at
all times to improve the business of the Company. The Employee shall not
accept any business commitments other than with the Company without the
advance written consent of the Parent's Chief Executive Officer.

  

  

5. Expenses. During the period of the Employee's employment, except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, the Company will pay directly, or reimburse the Employee for, all items of reasonable and necessary business expenses approved in advance by the Company if such expenses are incurred by the Employee in the interest of the business of the Company. The Company shall also reimburse the Employee for automobile expenses incurred by the Employee in the performance of the Employee's duties hereunder. The amount of such reimbursement shall be in accordance with the automobile expense reimbursement policy adopted (and as it may be modified from time to time) by the Parent's Board of Directors. All such expenses paid by the Employee will be reimbursed by the Company upon presentation by the Employee, from time to time (but not less than quarterly), of an itemized account of such expenditures in accordance with the Company's policy for verifying such expenditures.

  


 

  

6. Fringe Benefits.

  

  

(A) The Employee shall be entitled to participate in any health, accident and
life insurance program and other benefits which have been or may be
established by the Company for salaried employees of the Company.

  


 

  

 

(B) The Employee shall be entitled to an annual vacation without loss of
compensation for such period as may be determined by the Board of Directors of
the Company.

   
 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

 

  

(C) The Company shall furnish to the Employee during the term of the
Employee's employment an automobile selected by the Company to aid the
Employee in the performance of the Employee's duties. Upon agreement of the
Company and the Employee, the Company may, in lieu of the automobile, provide
the Employee with a Six Thousand Dollar ($6,000.00) annual automobile
allowance.

  


 

  

7. Covenants of the Employee.

  

  

(A) During the term of the Employee's employment with the Company and for all
time thereafter Employee covenants and agrees that Employee will not in any
manner directly or indirectly, except as required in the Employee's duties to
the Company, disclose or divulge to any person, entity, firm or company
whatsoever, or use for the Employee's own benefit or the benefit of any other
person, entity, firm or company, directly or indirectly, any knowledge,
devices, information, trade secrets, techniques, customer lists, business
plans or other data belonging to the Company or the Parent or developed by the
Employee on behalf of the Company or the Parent during the Employee's
employment with the Company, without regard to whether all of the foregoing
matters will be deemed confidential, material or important, the parties hereto
stipulating, as between them, that the same are important, material,
confidential and the property of the Company (hereinafter "Confidential
Information"), that disclosure of the same to or use of the same by third
parties would greatly affect the effective and successful conduct of the
business of the Company or the Parent and the goodwill of the Company or
Parent, and that any breach of the terms of this subsection (A) shall be a
material breach of this Agreement.

  


 

  

(B) During the term of the Employee's employment with the Company and for a
period of one (1) year (the "Covenant Term") after cessation for whatever
reason of such employment (except as hereinafter provided in subsection (C) of
this Section 7, the Employee covenants and agrees that the Employee will not
in any manner directly or indirectly:

  


 

  

(1) solicit, divert, take away or interfere with any of the customers (or
their respective affiliates or successors) of the Company or the Parent;

  


 

  

(2) engage directly or indirectly, either personally or as an employee,
partner, associate partner, officer, manager, agent, advisor, consultant or
otherwise, or by means of any corporate or other entity or device, in any
business which is competitive with the business of the Company. For purposes
of this covenant, a business will be deemed competitive if it is conducted in
whole or in part within any geographic area wherein the Company or the Parent
is engaged in marketing its products, and if it involves the design or
manufacture of products for the aerospace industry that are the same or
substantially similar to those designed or manufactured by the Company or the
Parent or if it is in any manner competitive, as of the date of cessation of
the Employee's employment, with any business then being conducted by the
Company or the Parent or as to which the Company or the Parent has then
formulated definitive plans to enter;

  


 

  

(3) induce any salesman, distributor, supplier, manufacturer, representative,
agent, jobber or other person transacting business with the Company or the
Parent to terminate their relationship with the Company or the Parent, or to
represent, distribute or sell products in competition with products of the
Company or the Parent; or

  


 

  

(4) induce or cause any employee of the Company or the Parent to leave the
employ of the Company or the Parent.

  


 

  

(C) The parties agree that the Covenant Term provided for in the preceding
subsection (B) shall be:

  


 

  

(1) reduced to six (6) months in event of a Change in Control (as that term is
defined in subsection 2(B) herein); or

  


 

  

(2) eliminated if the business currently operated by the Company or the Parent
is terminated and the assets of the Company or the Parent are liquidated.

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

 

  

 

(D) All the covenants of the Employee contained in this Section 7 shall be
construed as agreements independent of any other provision of this Agreement,
and the existence of any claim or cause of action against the Company, whether
predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to
the enforcement by the Company of these covenants.

  

 

  

(E) It is the intention of the parties to restrict the activities of the
Employee under this Section 7 only to the extent necessary for the protection
of legitimate business interests of the Company and the Parent, and the
parties specifically covenant and agree that should any of the provisions set
forth therein, under any set of circumstances not now foreseen by the parties,
be deemed too broad for such purpose, said provisions will nevertheless be
valid and enforceable to the extent necessary for such protection.

  


 

  

8. Documents. Upon cessation of the Employee's employment with the Company, for whatever reason, all documents, records (including without limitation, customer records), notebooks, invoices, statements or correspondence, including copies thereof, relating to the business of the Company then in the Employee's possession, whether prepared by the Employee or others, will be delivered to and left with the Company, and the Employee agrees not to retain copies of the foregoing documents without the written consent of the Company.

  


 

  

9. Remedies. In the event of the breach by the Employee of any of the terms of this Agreement, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company may terminate the employment of the Employee in accordance with the provisions of Section 2 of this Agreement. It is further agreed that any breach or evasion of any of the terms of this Agreement by the Employee will result in immediate and irreparable injury to the Company and will authorize recourse to injunction and/or specific performance as well as to other legal or equitable remedies to which the Company may be entitled. In addition to any other remedies that it may have in law or equity, the Company also may require an accounting and repayment of all profits, compensation, remuneration or other benefits realized, directly or indirectly, as a result of such breaches by the Employee or by a competitor's business controlled, directly or indirectly, by the Employee. No remedy conferred by any of the specific provisions of this Agreement is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy and each and every remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity by statute or otherwise. The election of any one or more remedies by the Company or the Parent shall not constitute a waiver of the right to pursue other available remedies. The Employee expressly agrees to pay all reasonable costs and attorneys' fees incurred by the Company or the Parent in order to enforce the Employee's obligations under this Agreement, regardless of whether litigation is commenced or prosecuted to a judgment.

  


 

  

10. Severability. All agreements and covenants contained herein are severable, and in the event any of them shall be held to be invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, this Agreement, subject to subsection 7(E) hereof, shall continue in full force and effect and shall be interpreted as if such invalid agreements or covenants were not contained herein.

  


 

  

11. Entire Agreement. The Employee has also executed a Noncompetition and Nonsolicitation Agreement with the Company ("Noncompetition Agreement"). This Employment Agreement and the provisions relating to the Employee's confidentiality and restrictive covenant obligations set forth in the Noncompetition Agreement collectively constitute the entire agreement between the Company and the Employee with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior proposals, negotiations, representations, communications, writings, outlines and agreements between the Company and the Employee with respect to the subject matter hereof, whether oral or written, which shall be of no further force and effect. For purposes of clarification, to the extent there is an inconsistency between the restrictive covenants set forth in this Noncompetition Agreement and those contained in this Agreement, and both documents are still in effect, the restrictive covenants of the Noncompetition Agreement shall control, unless such provisions of the Noncompetition Agreement are deemed unenforceable, in which case, this Agreement shall control. However, in no event shall the Noncompetition Agreement suspend or eliminate or otherwise alter the one year Restriction Period following termination of Employee's employment or otherwise cause this Agreement's restrictive covenants and obligations not to go into effect after the Noncompetition Agreement has expired. By way of example, if the employment of the Employee is terminated with six months remaining in the term of the Noncompetition Agreement, the Noncompetition Agreement shall control for the remainder of such six months and thereafter, this Agreement shall control for the remaining six months of the Term. This Agreement may not be amended except by a written agreement executed by the party to be charged with the amendment.

  


 

  

No amendments to this Agreement, except as expressly provided herein to the
contrary, may be made except by a writing signed by both parties.

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

 

  

12. Waiver or Modification. No waiver or modification of this Agreement or of any covenant, condition or limitation herein shall be valid unless in writing and duly executed by the party to be charged therewith, and no evidence of any waiver or modification shall be offered or received in evidence in any proceeding, arbitration or litigation between the parties hereto arising out of or affecting this Agreement, or the rights or obligations of the parties hereunder, unless such waiver or modification is in writing, duly executed as aforesaid, and the parties further agree that the provisions of this section may not be waived except as herein set forth. Failure of the Company to exercise or otherwise act with respect to any of its rights hereunder in the event of a breach of any of the terms or conditions hereof by the Employee shall not be construed as a waiver of such breach nor prevent the Company from thereafter enforcing strict compliance with any and all of the terms and conditions hereof.

  

  

13. Assignability. This Agreement may be assigned by the Company to another entity which purchases substantially all of the assets of the Company or the Parent or acquires a majority of the stock of the Company or the Parent. The services to be performed by the Employee hereunder are personal in nature and, therefore, the Employee shall not assign the Employee's rights or delegate the Employee's obligations under this Agreement, and any attempted or purported assignment or delegation not herein permitted shall be null and void.

   
 

14. Successors. Subject to the provisions of Section 13, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Company and the Employee and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, legal administrators, successors and assigns.

  


 

  

15. Notices. Any notice or other communication required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given if delivered personally, by over-night courier, or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, if to the Company, to:

Exhibit A

 

  

  

LMI Aerospace, Inc.

  

  

Policy for Recoupment of Incentive Compensation

  

  

If LMI Aerospace, Inc. (the "Parent") is required to prepare an accounting
restatement for any fiscal quarter or year commencing after May 31, 2010 due
to the material non-compliance of the Parent with any financial reporting
requirement under the securities laws, the Parent shall recover any incentive-
based compensation (including stock options) paid to any current or former
executive officer during the three-year period preceding the date on which the
Company is required to prepare a restatement. The amount to be recovered is
the excess of the amount originally paid to the executive officer based on the
incorrect financial statements over the amount that would have been paid under
the restated financials.

  

  

This Policy for Recoupment of Incentive Compensation ("Policy") is intended to
comply with Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Clawback Provision"). Accordingly, to the
extent of any inconsistency between this Policy and of the Dodd-Frank Clawback
Provision, the Dodd-Frank Clawback Provision shall prevail. Additionally, to
the extent that future rules and regulations are promulgated by the Securities
and Exchange Commission or any other federal regulatory agency that would add
to, modify or supplement the Dodd-Frank Clawback Provision (each, a
"Modification"), then this Policy shall be deemed modified to the extent
required to make this Policy consistent with the Dodd-Frank Clawback
Provision, giving effect to such revision as of the date upon which such
Modification becomes or would otherwise be deemed to be effective.
