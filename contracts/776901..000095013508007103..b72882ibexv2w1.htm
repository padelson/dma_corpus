   ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE I 

   

THE MERGER  

  

 Section 1.01 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into Company in accordance with the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act and the requirements of the Massachusetts Board of Bank Incorporation. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Company shall survive and continue to exist as a corporation incorporated under the General Laws of Massachusetts (Buyer, as the surviving entity in the Merger, sometimes being referred to herein as the "Surviving Entity"). 

   

 Section 1.02 _Articles of Organization and Bylaws_. The Articles of Organization and Bylaws of the Surviving Entity upon consummation of the Merger shall be the Articles of Organization and Bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to consummation of the Merger. 

   

 Section 1.03 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Entity_. The directors of the Surviving Entity immediately after the Merger shall be the directors of Merger Sub in office immediately prior to the Effective Time. The executive officers of the Surviving Entity immediately after the Merger shall be the executive officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Merger. Each of the directors and executive officers of the Surviving Entity immediately after the Merger shall hold office until his or her successor is elected and qualified or otherwise in accordance with the Articles of Organization and Bylaws of the Surviving Entity. 

   

 Section 1.04 _Effective Time; Closing_. 

   

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer, Merger Sub and Company will make all such filings as may be required to consummate the Merger by applicable laws and regulations. The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the articles of merger related to the Merger (the "Articles of Merger") that shall be filed with the Massachusetts Secretary of State on the Closing Date. The "Effective Time" of the Merger shall be the date and time when the Merger becomes effective as set forth in the Articles of Merger. 

   

 (b) A closing (the "Closing") shall take place immediately prior to the Effective Time at the offices of Hogan and Hartson LLP, 555 Thirteenth Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20004, or such other place or on such other date as the parties may mutually agree upon (such date, the "Closing Date"). At the Closing, there shall be delivered to Buyer and Company the certificates and other documents required to be delivered under Article VI hereof. 

   

 Section 1.05 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code, and that the Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code. 

   

ARTICLE II 

   

MERGER CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES  

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 2.01 _Merger Consideration_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Buyer, Company or any shareholder of Company: 

   

 (a) Each share of Buyer Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding following the Effective Time and shall be unchanged by the Merger. 

   

 (b) Each share of Merger Sub Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired at the Effective Time and automatically converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Entity. Each certificate evidencing ownership of a number of shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall be deemed to evidence ownership of the same number of shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Entity. 

   

 (c) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become and be converted into, as provided in and subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, the right to receive 0.59 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of Buyer Common Stock (the "Merger Consideration"). 

   

 Section 2.02 _Rights as Shareholders; Stock Transfers_. All shares of Company Common Stock, when converted as provided in Section 2.01(c), shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each Certificate previously evidencing such shares shall thereafter represent only the right to receive for each such share of Company Common Stock, the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock in accordance with this Article II and the right to receive any unpaid dividend with respect to the Company Common Stock with a record date occurring prior to the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, holders of Company Common Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, shareholders of Company, other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock as provided under this Article II and the right to receive any unpaid dividend with respect to the Company Common Stock with a record date occurring prior to the Effective Time. After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Company of shares of Company Common Stock, other than transfers of Company Common Stock that have occurred prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 Section 2.03 _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock and no certificates or scrip therefor, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the Merger. In lieu thereof, Buyer shall pay to each holder of a fractional share of Buyer Common Stock an amount of cash (without interest) determined by multiplying the fractional share interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled by the average of the last sale prices of Buyer Common Stock, as reported on The Nasdaq Global Select Market ("Nasdaq") (as reported in The Wall Street Journal or, if not reported therein, in another authoritative source), for the twenty-five (25) Nasdaq trading days ending on the fifth trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date, rounded to the nearest whole cent (the "Average Closing Price"). 

   

 Section 2.04 _Exchange Procedures_. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (a) On or before the Closing Date, for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, (i) Buyer shall cause to be delivered to the Exchange Agent, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, certificates representing the shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Article II ("New Certificates") and (ii) Buyer shall deliver, or shall cause to be delivered, to the Exchange Agent an estimated amount of cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock (such cash and New Certificates, being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). 

   

 (b) As promptly as practicable, but in any event no later than five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time, and provided that Company has delivered, or caused to be delivered, to the Exchange Agent all information that is necessary for the Exchange Agent to perform its obligations as specified herein, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates who has not previously surrendered such Certificate or Certificates, a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to Sections 2.01, 2.03 and 2.04 of this Agreement. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a New Certificate representing that number of shares of Buyer Common Stock to which such former holder of Company Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to this Agreement and/or (ii) a check representing the amount of cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Buyer Common Stock which such former holder has the right to receive in respect of the Certificate surrendered pursuant to this Agreement, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any cash to be issued in lieu of fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to holders of Certificates. For shares of Company Common stock held in book entry form, Buyer shall establish procedures for delivery of such shares, which procedures shall be reasonably acceptable to Company. 

   

 (c) No dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time with respect to Buyer Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.04. After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.04, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to shares of Buyer Common Stock represented by such Certificate. None of Buyer, Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of Company Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

   

 (d) The Exchange Agent and Buyer, as the case may be, shall not be obligated to deliver cash and/or a New Certificate or New Certificates representing shares of Buyer Common Stock to which a holder of Company Common Stock would otherwise be entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders the Certificate or Certificates representing the shares of Company Common Stock for exchange as provided in this Section 2.04, or, an 

   ##### 

  

   

appropriate affidavit of loss and indemnity agreement and/or a bond in such
amount as may be required in each case by Buyer (but not more than the amount
required under Buyers contract with its transfer agent). If any New
Certificates evidencing shares of Buyer Common Stock are to be issued in a
name other than that in which the Certificate evidencing Company Common
Stock surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition
of the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or accompanied by an executed form of assignment separate from the
Certificate and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the Person
requesting such exchange pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other tax
required by reason of the issuance of a New Certificate for shares of Buyer
Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered or otherwise establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable. 

   

 (e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of Company for six (6) months after the Effective Time (as well as any interest or proceeds from any investment thereof) shall be delivered by the Exchange Agent to Buyer. Any shareholders of Company who have not theretofore complied with Section 2.04(b) shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Entity for the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case without any interest thereon. If outstanding Certificates for shares of Company Common Stock are not surrendered or the payment for them is not claimed prior to the date on which such shares of Buyer Common Stock or cash would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental unit or agency, the unclaimed items shall, to the extent permitted by abandoned property and any other applicable law, become the property of Buyer (and to the extent not in its possession shall be delivered to it), free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled to such property. Neither the Exchange Agent nor any party to this Agreement shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock represented by any Certificate for any consideration paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Buyer and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer books of Company to establish the identity of those Persons entitled to receive the Merger Consideration specified in this Agreement, which books shall be conclusive with respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of any shares of Company Common Stock represented by any Certificate, Buyer and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to tender to the custody of any court of competent jurisdiction any Merger Consideration represented by such Certificate and file legal proceedings interpleading all parties to such dispute, and will thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims thereto. 

   

 (f) Buyer (through the Exchange Agent, if applicable) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as Buyer is required to deduct and withhold under applicable law. Any amounts so deducted and withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Buyer. 

   

 Section 2.05 _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. In the event Buyer changes (or establishes a record date for changing) the number of, or provides for the exchange of, shares of Buyer Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, or similar transaction with 

   ##### 

  

   

respect to the outstanding Buyer Common Stock, the Exchange Ratio shall be
proportionately and appropriately adjusted for purposes of determining the
Merger Consideration and (if applicable) the Average Closing Price shall be
appropriately adjusted for purposes of determining the amount of cash paid in
lieu of fractional shares and upon cancellation of Options in accordance with
Section 2.06; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, no such adjustment
shall be made with regard to the Buyer Common Stock if (i) Buyer issues

 Section 2.06 _Options and Restricted Stock_. 

   

 (a) Each option to purchase Company Common Stock (collectively, the "Options") granted under Companys 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Company Equity Plan"), whether vested or unvested, which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which has not been exercised or canceled prior thereto shall, at the Effective Time, be canceled and, on the Closing Date, Company or Company Bank shall pay to the holder thereof cash in an amount equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock provided for in such Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock provided for in such Option, which cash payment shall be made without interest and shall be net of all applicable withholding taxes. "Per Share Merger Consideration" shall be calculated by multiplying the Average Closing Price by the Exchange Ratio. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.06(a), in the event that a holder of Options (other than Thomas R. Venables and Claire S. Bean for whom all Options will be canceled and paid in accordance with Section 2.06(a)) so elects pursuant to a written election submitted to the Company at least one business day prior to the Closing Date ("Assumption Election"), which shall be in such form as shall be prescribed by the Company and reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, each Option held by such holder which is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested and exercisable, shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall be converted automatically into an option to purchase shares of Buyer Common Stock, and Buyer shall assume each Option, in accordance with the terms of the Company Equity Plan and stock option or other agreement by which it is evidenced, except that from and after the Effective Time, (i) Buyer, Buyers Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee of its Board of Directors shall be substituted for the Company, Companys Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors, (ii) each Option assumed by Buyer may be exercised solely for shares of Buyer Common Stock, (iii) the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock subject to such Option shall be equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, provided that any fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest share, (iv) the per share exercise price under each such Option shall be adjusted by dividing the per share exercise price under each such Option by the Exchange Ratio, provided that such exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest cent, and (v) the termination provisions of such Option shall be amended to provide that such Option shall remain outstanding until the expiration date thereof, regardless of continuation of the holders employment or other

services to Buyer. Buyer and Company agree to take all necessary steps to
effect the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.06(b). 

   

 (c) At least 30 days prior to the date of the Company Meeting, Company shall provide written notice to each holder of a then-outstanding Option (which shall be in such form as prescribed by the Company and reasonably satisfactory to Buyer) describing the holders right to make an Assumption Election, indicating that the Company will provide the holder with a calculation of the Average Closing Price four (4) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, and notifying each holder (i) that the vesting of all Options will accelerate upon approval of the Merger by the Companys shareholders, and (ii) that all Options that remain unexercised as of close of business on the day prior to the Effective Date of the Merger for which no Assumption Election has been timely received will be cancelled as of the effective date of the Merger and the holders thereof will receive payment for such cancelled Option in accordance with the terms of Section 2.06(a). Such written notice will disclose the tax ramifications of receiving payment in accordance with Section 2.06(a), making an Assumption Election, and exercising the Option prior to the Closing Date, and will request each holder of an Option who does not intend to exercise his or her Options or to make an Assumption Election to provide a written acknowledgement of the cancellation of such Options and payment in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.06. 

   

 (d) All unvested shares of restricted Company Common Stock awarded under the Company Equity Plan shall automatically vest in full upon the approval of the Merger by the Companys shareholders according to the terms governing such award as of the Effective Time, to the extent not previously forfeited. At the Effective Time, the Company Equity Plan shall terminate and the provisions in any other plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock of Company shall be of no further force and effect and shall be deemed to be deleted.

 (e) The unpaid Taxes of Buyer (i) did not, as of the end of the most recent period covered by the Buyer SEC Documents filed on or prior to the date hereof, exceed the reserve for Tax liability (which reserve is distinct and different from any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the financial statements included in the Buyer SEC Documents filed on or prior to the date hereof (rather than in any notes thereto), and (ii) do not exceed that reserve as adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing Date in accordance with the past custom and practice of Buyer in filing its Tax Returns. Since the end of the most recent period covered by the Buyer SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof, Buyer has not incurred any liability for Taxes arising from extraordinary gains or losses, as that term is used in GAAP, outside the ordinary course of business consistent with past custom and practice.

Bank or any bank examiner, together with the principal amount of and accrued
and unpaid interest on each such Loan and the identity of the borrower
thereunder, and (y) each asset of Buyer that as of September 30, 2008 was
classified as other real estate owned ("OREO") and the book value thereof as
of the date of this Agreement. 

   

 (b) Each Loan (i) is evidenced by notes, agreements or other evidences of indebtedness that are true, genuine and what they purport to be, (ii) to the extent secured, has been secured by valid Liens which have been perfected and (iii) to the Knowledge of Buyer, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the obligor named therein, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles.

Neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement with any individual or group regarding Community Reinvestment Act matters and Buyer is not aware of, and none of Buyer and its Subsidiaries has been advised of, or has any reason to believe (because of the Buyer Banks Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data for the year ended December 31, 2007, filed with the FDIC, or otherwise) that any facts or circumstances exist, which would cause Buyer Bank: (i) to be deemed not to be in satisfactory compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, or to be assigned a rating for Community Reinvestment Act purposes by federal or state bank regulators of lower than "satisfactory;" or (ii) to be deemed to be operating in violation of the Bank Secrecy Act and its implementing regulations (31 C.F.R. Part 103), the USA Patriot Act, any order issued with respect to anti-money laundering by the U.S. Department of Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control, or any other applicable anti-money laundering statute.

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Buyer (the "Indemnifying Party") shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of Company, as applicable, determined as of the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Parties") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred after the Effective Time in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, arising in whole or in part out of or pertaining to the fact that he or she was a director or officer of Company or is or was serving at the request of Company as a director, officer, employee or other agent of any other organization or in any capacity with respect to any employee benefit plan of Company, including without limitation matters related to the negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, to the full extent to which such Indemnified Parties would be entitled under the Bylaws of Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement as though such Bylaws continue to remain in effect after the Effective Time (subject to applicable Law). 

   

 (b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 5.10, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party if such failure does not actually prejudice the Indemnifying Party. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel which is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnifying Party shall pay, promptly as statements therefor are received, the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties (which may not exceed one firm in any jurisdiction), (ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter, (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent and (iv) the Indemnifying Party shall have no obligation hereunder in the event that a federal or state banking agency or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that indemnification of an Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable laws and regulations.

    ##### 

  

    

misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter
claimed against a director or officer of Company or any of its Subsidiaries
by reason of him or her serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at

or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby); provided, however, that
in no event shall Company expend, or Buyer or the Surviving Entity be
required to expend, for such "tail" policy a premium amount in excess of an
amount equal to (x) 225% of the annual premiums paid by Company for DandO
Insurance in effect as of the date of this Agreement. 

   

 (d) If Buyer or any of its successors or assigns shall consolidate with or merge into any other entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any other entity, then and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.10. 

   

 Section 5.11 _Employees; Benefit Plans_. 

   

 (a) Buyer shall retain all Company Employees who accept employment with Buyer Bank under the terms and conditions specified by Buyer; provided, that continued retention by Buyer Bank of such employees subsequent to the Merger shall be subject to Buyer Banks normal and customary employment procedures and practices, including customary background screening and evaluation procedures, and satisfactory employment performance. In addition, Company and Company Bank agree, upon Buyers reasonable request, to facilitate discussions between Buyer and Company Employees regarding employment, consulting or other arrangements to be effective prior to or following the Merger. Any interaction between Buyer and Companys employees shall be coordinated by Company. 

   

 (b) Following the Closing Date, Buyer may choose to maintain any or all of Company Benefit Plans in its sole discretion, subject to the last sentence of this Section 5.11(b). However, for any Company Benefit Plan terminated for which there is a comparable Buyer Benefit Plan of general applicability, Company Employees shall be entitled to participate in such Buyer Benefit Plan to the same extent as similarly-situated employees of Buyer or Buyer Bank (it being understood that inclusion of Company Employees in the Buyer Benefit Plans may occur, if at all, at different times with respect to different plans). Nothing herein shall limit the ability of Buyer or Buyer Bank to amend or terminate any of the Company Benefit Plans or Buyer Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms at any time; provided, however, that (i) within one year of the Closing Date all Company Employees shall be entitled to participate in all benefit plans of general applicability then maintained by Buyer or Buyer Bank to the same extent as similarly-situated employees of Buyer and Buyer Bank, and (ii) Buyer will not terminate any Company Benefit Plan that is a medical or dental insurance plan if such termination would shorten the period during which any Company Employee would otherwise (if such Company Benefit Plan had not been terminated) have had COBRA benefits, as contemplated under the Companys Severance Pay Plan. 

   

 (c) If employees of Company or any of its Subsidiaries become eligible to participate in a medical, dental or health plan of Buyer or Buyer Bank upon termination of such plan of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each such plan to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations to the extent such 

    ##### 

  

    

conditions are covered under the applicable medical, health or dental plans of
Buyer or Buyer Bank, (ii) provide full credit under such plans for any
deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the employees
and their beneficiaries during the portion of the calendar year prior to such
participation and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence
of insurability requirement which would otherwise be applicable to such
employee on or after the Effective Time, in each case to the extent such
employee had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an
analogous Plan prior to the Effective Time for the plan year in which
the Effective Time occurs. 

   

 (d) Buyer shall honor, and the Surviving Entity shall continue to be obligated to perform, in accordance with their terms, all vested benefit obligations to, and contractual rights of, current and former employees and directors of the Company existing as of the Effective Date, as well as all employment, severance, deferred compensation, retirement or "change-in-control" agreements, plans or policies of the Company, but only if such obligations, rights, agreements, plans or policies are set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule. Buyer acknowledges that the consummation of the Merger will constitute a "change-in-control" of the Company for purposes of any benefit plans, agreements and arrangements of the Company. Nothing herein shall limit the ability of Buyer or Buyer Bank to amend or terminate any of the Company Benefit Plans or Buyer Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms at any time, subject to vested rights of employees and directors that may not be terminated pursuant to the terms of such Company Benefit Plans and subject to the last sentence of Section 5.11(b). 

   

 (e) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan subject to Section 409A of the Code, Company agrees to amend each such plan or cause each such plan to be amended to the extent, in Buyers reasonable judgment, such an amendment is necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or the deadline imposed by the IRS. Such amendments shall be provided to Buyer and its counsel at least ten days prior to their proposed adoption by Company or Company Bank and shall be subject to the prior approval of Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

   

 (f) During the one-year period commencing as of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, Buyer shall honor the Company Severance Pay Plan in connection with the termination of employment of any Company Employee (excluding any employee who is party to an employment agreement, change-in-control agreement or any other agreement which provides for severance payments), in such amounts, at such times and upon such conditions as set forth in the Company Severance Pay Plan. 

   

 (g) Nothing in this Section 5.11, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 5.11. Without limiting the foregoing, no provision of this Section 5.11 will create any third party beneficiary rights in any current or former employee, director or consultant of Company or its Subsidiaries in respect of continued employment (or resumed employment) or any other matter. Nothing in this Section 5.11 is intended (i) to amend any Buyer Benefit Plan, (ii) interfere with Buyers or the Surviving Entitys right from and after the Closing Date to amend or terminate any Buyer Benefit Plan or (iii) interfere with Buyers or the Surviving Entitys right from and after the Effective Time to terminate the employment or provision of services by any director, employee, independent contractor or consultant.

Prior to the Effective Time, Company, and following the Effective Time, Buyer shall use their respective best efforts in good faith to obtain such favorable determination letter (including, but not limited to, making such changes to the ESOP and the proposed allocations as may be requested by the IRS as a condition to its issuance of a favorable determination letter). Company and following the Effective Time, Buyer, will adopt such amendments to the ESOP as may be reasonably required by the IRS as a condition to granting such favorable determination letter on termination. Neither Company, nor following the Effective Time, Buyer shall make any distribution from the ESOP except as may be required by applicable law until receipt of such favorable determination letter. In the case of a conflict between the terms of this Section 5.11(i) and the terms of the ESOP, the terms of the ESOP shall control however, in the event of any such conflict, Company before the Merger, and Buyer after the Merger, shall use their best efforts to cause the ESOP to be amended to conform to the requirements of this Section 5.11(i). 

   

 Section 5.12 _Notification of Certain Changes_. Buyer and Company shall promptly advise the other party of any change or event having, or which could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect with respect to it or which it believes would, or which could reasonably be expected to, cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained herein.

EXHIBIT A 

    

VOTING AGREEMENT 

   

 This VOTING AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is dated as of November ___, 2008, by and between the undersigned holder ("Shareholder") of Company Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Brady Bancorp., a Massachusetts corporation ("Company"), and Independent Bank Corp., a Massachusetts corporation ("Buyer"). All capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Merger Agreement (defined below). 

  

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Buyer, Rockland Trust Company, a Massachusetts-chartered trust company, Company and Brady Savings Bank, a Massachusetts-chartered savings bank, are entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as such agreement may be subsequently amended or modified, the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which Company shall merge with and into Buyer and, in connection therewith, each outstanding share of Company Common Stock will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration; 

  

 WHEREAS, Shareholder beneficially owns and has sole or shared voting power with respect to the number of shares of Company Common Stock identified on _Exhibit A_ hereto (such shares, together with all shares of Company Common Stock subsequently acquired by Shareholder during the term of this Agreement, including through the exercise of any stock option or other equity award, warrant or similar instrument, being referred to as the "Shares"), and holds stock options or other rights to acquire the number of shares of Company Common Stock identified on _Exhibit A_ hereto; and 

  

 WHEREAS, it is a condition to the willingness of Buyer to enter into the Merger Agreement that Shareholder execute and deliver this Agreement. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of, and as a condition to, Buyer entering into the Merger Agreement and proceeding with the transactions contemplated thereby, and in consideration of the expenses incurred and to be incurred by Buyer in connection therewith, Shareholder and Buyer agree as follows: 

  

 Section 1\. _Agreement to Vote Shares_. Shareholder agrees that, while this Agreement is in effect, at any meeting of shareholders of Company, however called, or at any adjournment thereof, or in any other circumstances in which Shareholder is entitled to vote, consent or give any other approval, except as otherwise agreed to in writing in advance by Buyer, Shareholder shall: 

  

       | (a)  |   | appear at each such meeting or otherwise cause
the Shares to be counted as present thereat for purposes of calculating a
quorum; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | vote (or cause to be voted), in person or by proxy, all
the Shares that are beneficially owned by Shareholder or as to which
Shareholder has, directly or indirectly, the right to vote or direct the
voting, (i) in favor of adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby; (ii) against any action or agreement that
would result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any
other obligation or agreement of Company  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   | contained in the Merger Agreement or of Shareholder
contained in this Agreement; and (iii) against any Acquisition Proposal or
any other action, agreement or transaction that is intended, or could
reasonably be expected, to materially impede, interfere or be inconsistent
with, delay, postpone, discourage or materially and adversely affect
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or
of this Agreement.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

 Section 2\. _No Transfers_ While this Agreement is in effect, Shareholder agrees not to, directly or indirectly, sell transfer, pledge, assign or otherwise dispose of, or enter into any contract option, commitment or other arrangement or understanding with respect to the sale, transfer, pledge, assignment or other disposition of, any of the Shares, except the following transfers shall be permitted: (a) transfers by will or operation of law, in which case this Agreement shall bind the transferee, (b) transfers pursuant to any pledge agreement, subject to the pledgee agreeing in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, (c) transfers in connection with estate and tax planning purposes, including transfers to relatives, trusts and charitable organizations, subject to the transferee agreeing in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, and (d) such transfers as Buyer may otherwise permit in its sole discretion. Any transfer or other disposition in violation of the terms of this Section 2 shall be null and void. 

  

 Section 3\. _Representations and Warranties of Shareholder_. Shareholder represents and warrants to and agrees with Buyer as follows: 

  

       | (a)  |   | Shareholder has all requisite capacity and
authority to enter into and perform his, her or its obligations under this
Agreement.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
Shareholder, and assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by
Buyer, constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of Shareholder
enforceable against Shareholder in accordance with its terms, subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors
rights and to general equity principles.  
      
    | (c)  |   | The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Shareholder does not, and the performance by Shareholder of his, her or its
obligations hereunder and the consummation by Shareholder of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not, violate or conflict with, or constitute a
default under, any agreement, instrument, contract or other obligation or any
order, arbitration award, judgment or decree to which Shareholder is a party
or by which Shareholder is bound, or any statute, rule or regulation to which
Shareholder is subject or, in the event that Shareholder is a corporation,
partnership, trust or other entity, any charter, bylaw or
other organizational document of Shareholder.  
      
    | (d)  |   | Shareholder is the record and beneficial owner of, or
is the trustee that is the record holder of, and whose beneficiaries are the
beneficial owners of, and has good title to all of the Shares and options set
forth on _Exhibit A_ hereto, and the Shares and options are so owned free
and clear of any liens, security interests,  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   | charges or other encumbrances except as otherwise
described on _Exhibit A_ hereto. Shareholder does not own, of record or
beneficially, any shares of capital stock of Company other than the Shares
(other than shares of capital stock subject to stock options over which
Shareholder will have no voting rights until the exercise of such stock
options). The Shares do not include shares over which Shareholder exercises
control in a fiduciary capacity and no representation by Shareholder is made
thereby pursuant to the terms hereof. Shareholder has the right to vote the
Shares, and none of the Shares is subject to any voting trust or
other agreement, arrangement or restriction with respect to the voting of the
Shares, except as contemplated by this Agreement.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

 Section 4\. _Irrevocable Proxy_. Subject to the last sentence of this Section 4, by execution of this Agreement, Shareholder does hereby appoint Buyer with full power of substitution and resubstitution, as Shareholders true and lawful attorney and irrevocable proxy, to the full extent of Shareholders rights with respect to the Shares, to vote, if Shareholder is unable to perform his, her or its obligations under this Agreement, each of such Shares that Shareholder shall be entitled to so vote with respect to the matters set forth in Section 1 hereof at any meeting of the shareholders of Company, and at any adjournment or postponement thereof, and in connection with any action of the shareholders of Company taken by written consent. Shareholder intends this proxy to be irrevocable and coupled with an interest hereafter until the termination of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of Section 7 hereof and hereby revokes any proxy previously granted by Shareholder with respect to the Shares. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, this irrevocable proxy shall automatically terminate upon the termination of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 5\. _No Solicitation_. Except as otherwise expressly permitted under Section 5.09 of the Merger Agreement, from and after the date hereof until the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7 hereof, Shareholder, in his, her or its capacity as a shareholder of Company, shall not, nor shall such Shareholder authorize any partner, officer, director, advisor or representative of, such Shareholder or any of his, her or its affiliates to (and, to the extent applicable to Shareholder, such Shareholder shall use reasonable best efforts to prohibit any of his, her or its representatives or affiliates to), (a) initiate, solicit, induce or knowingly encourage, or knowingly take any action to facilitate the making of, any inquiry, offer or proposal which constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (b) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal, or furnish, or otherwise afford access, to any person (other than Buyer) any information or data with respect to Company or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal, (c) enter into any agreement, agreement in principle, letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or similar arrangement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, (d) solicit proxies or become a "participant" in a "solicitation" (as such terms are defined in Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act) with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (other than the Merger Agreement) or otherwise encourage or assist any party in taking or planning any action that would compete with, restrain or otherwise serve to interfere with or inhibit the timely consummation of the Merger in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, (e) initiate a shareholders vote or action by consent of Companys shareholders with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, or (f) except by reason of this Agreement, become a member of a "group" (as such term is used in Section 13(d) 

   ##### 

  

    

of the Exchange Act) with respect to any voting securities of Company that
takes any action in support of an Acquisition Proposal. 

  

 Section 6\. _Specific Performance; Remedies; Attorneys Fees_. Shareholder acknowledges that it is a condition to the willingness of Buyer to enter into the Merger Agreement that Shareholder execute and deliver this Agreement and that it will be impossible to measure in money the damage to Buyer if Shareholder fails to comply with the obligations imposed by this Agreement and that, in the event of any such failure, Buyer will not have an adequate remedy at law or in equity. Accordingly, Shareholder agrees that injunctive relief or other equitable remedy is the appropriate remedy for any such failure and will not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that Buyer has an adequate remedy at law. Shareholder further agrees that Shareholder will not seek, and agrees to waive any requirement for, the securing or posting of a bond in connection with Buyers seeking or obtaining such equitable relief. In addition, after discussing the matter with Shareholder, Buyer shall have the right to inform any third party that Buyer reasonably believes to be, or to be contemplating, participating with Shareholder or receiving from Shareholder assistance in violation of this Agreement, of the terms of this Agreement and of the rights of Buyer hereunder, and that participation by any such persons with Shareholder in activities in violation of Shareholders agreement with Buyer set forth in this Agreement may give rise to claims by Buyer against such third party. 

  

 Section 7\. _Term of Agreement; Termination_. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date hereof. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement by the written consent of the parties hereto, and shall be automatically terminated in the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. Upon such termination, no party shall have any further obligations or liabilities hereunder; provided, however, such termination shall not relieve any party from liability for any willful breach of this Agreement prior to such termination. 

  

 Section 8\. _Entire Agreement; Amendments_. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and contains the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or modified, and no provisions hereof may be modified or waived, except by an instrument in writing signed by each party hereto. No waiver of any provisions hereof by either party shall be deemed a waiver of any other provision hereof by any such party, nor shall any such waiver be deemed a continuing waiver of any provision hereof by such party. 

  

 Section 10\. _Severability_. In the event that any one or more provisions of this Agreement shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, by any court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Agreement and the parties shall use their reasonable efforts to substitute a valid, legal and enforceable provision which, insofar as practical, implements the purposes and intents of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 11\. _Capacity as Shareholder_. The covenants contained herein shall apply to Shareholder solely in his or her capacity as a shareholder of Company, and no covenant 

   ##### 

  

    

contained herein shall apply to Shareholder in his or her capacity as a
director, officer or employee of Company or in any other capacity. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to apply to, or limit in any
manner, the obligations of Shareholder to comply with his or her fiduciary
duties as a director of Company. 

  

 Section 12\. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without regard for conflict of law provisions.

FORM OF SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT 

   

 This Settlement Agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into as of November ___, 2008 by and among _ _ _ _(the "Executive"), Independent Bank Corp. and Rockland Trust Company (collectively, the "Buyer"), Benjamin Franklin Bancorp, Inc. (the "Seller") and Benjamin Franklin Bank (the "Seller Bank"). 

  

WITNESSETH: 

   

 WHEREAS, Buyer, Seller and Seller Bank are entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of November ___, 2008 (the "Merger Agreement"); and 

  

 WHEREAS, the Buyer, Seller, Seller Bank and the Executive desire to enter into this Agreement, which shall terminate the Amended and Restated Employment Agreement by and among Seller, the Seller Bank and the Executive dated March 26, 2008, (the "Employment Agreement") effective immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, and in lieu of any rights and payments under the Employment Agreement, the Executive shall be entitled to the rights and payments set forth herein; 

   

 NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and other good and valuable consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Executive, Buyer, Seller, and the Seller Bank agree as follows: 

  

 1. _Employment Agreement_. 

  

 1.1. On the Closing Date, provided (i) the Executive is still employed by Seller Bank immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger and (ii) the Executive has not revoked the release contained in Section 3 hereof, Seller Bank shall make an irrevocable lump sum contribution to the SERP Trust (as defined in Section 4) in an amount equal to the total of: 

   

       | _(a)_   |   | $ _ _ _;_   
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | _(b)_   |   | a _pro rata_ bonus for the year 2009 equal to $ _
_ _ _times the percentage of the calendar year 2009
during which Executive is employed by Seller or Seller Bank;  
      
    | _(c)_   |   | six months of interest on (a) and (b) above at the
Seller Banks prime rate in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time of
the Merger; and  
      
    | _(d)_   |   | a Gross-Up Payment pursuant to Section 13.1 of the
Employment Agreement and as calculated in the manner set forth at pages 1 and
2 of Schedule 3.14(i) to the Merger Agreement, provided however that the
amount shown on this Schedule 3.14(i) shall be adjusted pursuant to Section
1.3 below;  
   

  

     

  ##### 

  

   

     

 

all less applicable tax withholdings (the total of such sum, the "Employment
Agreement Amount"). 

  

The parties hereby agree that the Employment Agreement Amount as determined in
the manner provided under this Section 1.1 is final and binding on all
parties and shall not be subject to further adjustment, except with respect
to any adjustment to the Gross-Up Payment required pursuant to Section 1.3
below, and that the Employment Agreement Amount shall not be paid until the
waiting period described in Section 1.2 below has passed. In consideration of
the contribution of the Employment Agreement Amount to the SERP Trust, and
the other provisions of this Agreement, including but not limited to the
obligations of Buyer pursuant to Section 1.3 below, Executive, Buyer, Seller
and Seller Bank hereby agree that the Employment Agreement shall terminate
without any further action of any of the parties hereto, effective
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger. The Executive agrees
that the Employment Agreement Amount, together with satisfaction of the
obligations set forth in this Agreement, shall be in complete satisfaction
of all rights to payments or benefits under the Employment Agreement or any
other severance program except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement.
Seller and Seller Bank agree to accrue the amounts payable under this Section
1.1 on their financial statements as of the Closing Date as reasonably
directed by Buyer. 

   

 1.2. Executive acknowledges that the Employment Agreement Amount may be deemed to be "deferred compensation" and that Executive is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, and therefore payment of the Employment Agreement Amount shall be made by the SERP Trust to Executive on the date that is six months after the date of Separation of Service. For purposes of this Section 1.2, Separation of Service shall mean any termination of employment with the Seller, Seller Bank or any successor by Merger pursuant to which the aggregate level of services provided by the Executive to such entity (whether as an employee, director or a consultant) is permanently reduced to a level of services that is 49% or less than the level of services provided in the immediately preceding 12 months. Executive acknowledges that Executives employment with the Seller and/or Seller Bank will be terminated in connection with the Merger, effective immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, and that such termination will be a Separation from Service. 

   

 1.3. Buyer, Seller, Seller Bank and the Executive understand and agree that the amount of the Gross-Up Payment shown on Schedule 3.14(i) of the Merger Agreement is subject to change based upon one or more of the following: (i) a change in the amount of the _pro rata_ bonus paid for the year 2009 based on a change in closing date of the Merger; (ii) a change in the value of option acceleration and restricted stock acceleration based upon a change in closing date, interest rate, volatility, or share price; (iii) a change in the interest rate used to calculate the interest payable for the six month delay of payments required pursuant to Section 409A of the Code; or (iv) a change in the tax rates in effect for the calendar year in which the Excise Tax is payable. The amount of the Gross-Up payment shall be recalculated with respect to items (i) through (iv) above as applicable in order to determine the amount of the Gross-Up Payment (the "Initial Gross-Up Payment") to be included in the lump sum payment to be made to the SERP 

    ##### 

  

    

Trust pursuant to Section 1.1 above. In addition, to the extent that there is
any change described in (iv) above during the six month period following the
Effective Date of the Merger, a further recalculation of the Gross-Up Payment
shall be made by Tax Counsel (as defined in the Employment Agreement) (the
resulting amount, the "Adjusted Gross-Up Payment"), and (A) if the Adjusted
Gross-Up Payment is more than the Initial Gross-Up Payment, an amount equal to
the difference shall be paid by Buyer to the Executive, and (B) if the
Adjusted Gross-Up Payment is less than the Initial Gross-Up Payment, an
amount equal to the difference shall be paid by the Executive to Buyer. Any
such payment of the difference between the Initial Gross-Up Payment and the
Adjusted Gross-Up Payment shall be paid within thirty (30) days of the date of
payment of the Employment Agreement Amount by the SERP Trust to the
Executive. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein is intended to release
Buyer from the obligations of Section 13 of the Employment Agreement (and
following the Effective Time of the Merger, all references to Holding Company
in such Section 13 shall be deemed to refer to Buyer, except that references
to Holding Company with respect to "compensation made or provided to the
Executive by the Holding Company" shall be deemed to refer to "Holding
Company" and/or Buyer"). 

   

 2. _Fringe Benefits_. Buyer agrees to provide the Executive with continued health and dental insurance coverage pursuant to the policies currently offered by Seller Bank (or comparable policies offered to similarly-situated employees of Buyer) during the period of thirty-six (36) calendar months following the Effective Time, subject to the terms and conditions of such policies, with the Executive responsible for paying the same share of any premiums, copayments or deductibles as he was paying as an employee immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, except as set forth below in this Section 2\. Such insurance coverage shall include any dependents of the Executive who are covered as of the Effective Time of the Merger. In the event the Executives participation in any such plan is barred, Buyer shall arrange to provide the Executive with benefits substantially similar to those which the Executive would otherwise have received under such plan from which his continued participation is barred or provide their economic equivalent. 

  

 3. _Releases_. Upon payment of the Employment Agreement Amount, the Executive, for himself and for his heirs, successors and assigns, does hereby release completely and forever discharge Buyer, Seller and Seller Bank, their respective affiliates and successors and the current and former directors, officers, employees and agents of each of them (any and all of which are referred to below as the "Releasees") from any obligation under the Employment Agreement, except for: (i) the obligations of Buyer pursuant to Section 1.3 above; (ii) the obligations of Buyer to provide benefits pursuant to Section 2 above which shall continue for the period specified therein; and (iii) the obligations of Buyer to indemnify Executive pursuant to Sections 13 and 16.1 of the Employment Agreement; provided that with respect to each such sections, all obligations of Holding Company shall be deemed to be obligations of Buyer _._ This Agreement shall not release Buyer, Seller or Seller Bank, as applicable, from any of the following: (a) obligations to pay to the Executive wages and make payments for accrued but unused vacation earned up to the Effective Time of the Merger to the extent required by applicable law; (b) the payment of any of the Executives vested benefits under the tax-qualified plans of Seller or 

   ##### 

  

    

Seller Bank; (c) the SERP funding pursuant to Section 4 below; (d) the
payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to the Executives common
stock of Seller or payments with respect to Seller stock options as
contemplated by the Merger Agreement; or (e) the obligations of Buyer under
the indemnity provisions of Section 5.10 of the Merger Agreement. 

  

 4. _SERP Funding_. On the Closing Date, Seller Bank shall make an irrevocable contribution to the trust (the "SERP Trust") to be established pursuant to Section 2.3 of the Amended and Restated Supplemental Executive Retirement Agreement between Executive and Seller Bank dated as of March 26, 2008 (the "SERP") in an amount equal to $[ _ _ _ _] _,_ plus (i) six months interest thereon at the interest rate in effect under Section 417(e) of the Code as of the Effective Time of the Merger, and (ii) the amount of $ _ _ for fees and expenses related to the SERP Trust pursuant to Section 2.3 of the SERP (the "SERP Amount"). The parties hereby agree that the SERP Amount, as described above, is final and binding on all parties and shall not be subject to further adjustment. After the contribution of the SERP Amount to the SERP Trust, Executive agrees that none of Buyer, Seller, Seller Bank or any affiliate or subsidiary of any of these shall have any obligation to make any contributions or payments of any kind related to the SERP, the SERP Trust or any other non-qualified benefit plan maintained for the Executive including any Benefit Restoration Plan. Payments to the Executive from the SERP Trust shall be made by the trustee of the SERP Trust on the date that is six months after the date of Separation of Service. 

  

 5. _Protective Covenants: Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation_. The Executive agrees that during the one-year period following the Closing Date (the "Noncompetition Period"), the Executive will not, directly or indirectly, (i) become a director, officer, employee, principal, agent, consultant or independent contractor (collectively referred to herein as "being employed by") of any insured depository institution, trust company or parent holding company of any such institution or company which has an office in any city or town in which Seller or Seller Bank maintain an office (a "Competing Business"), _provided, however_ , that this provision shall not prohibit the Executive from (x) owning bonds, non-voting preferred stock or up to five percent (5%) of the outstanding common stock of any such entity if such common stock is publicly traded and (y) being employed by a Competing Business outside of such cities and towns so long as the Executive is in compliance with the provisions of the remainder of this Section 5\. During the Noncompetition Period, the Executive will not, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit or encourage any person who was employed by Buyer, Seller or Seller Bank (each, an "Applicable Bank") on the date of termination of the Executives employment to leave his or her employment at any Applicable Bank, or (ii) encourage or assist any person with whom the Executive has an employment or consulting or other similar relationship in identifying, recruiting or soliciting any commercial loan officer or relationship manager who was employed by any Applicable Bank on the date of termination of the Executives employment ("Termination Date"), or (iii) assist such person in formulating an employment package for such officer or manager to the extent such assistance involves the use of Confidential Information. For purposes of this Section 5, Confidential Information includes, without limitation, financial information, business plans, prospects and opportunities (such as lending relationships, financial product developments, or possible acquisitions or dispositions of business or facilities) which have been 

   ##### 

  

    

discussed or considered by the management of the Seller or Seller Bank but
does not include any information which has become part of the public domain by
means other than the Executives nonobservance of the Executives obligations
hereunder. The provisions of this Section 5 shall not be construed to
prohibit any person who employs the Executive as an employee or consultant
from advertising generally for employees in the markets served by any
Applicable Bank or from hiring any candidate, whether or not such person was
employed by an Applicable Bank, so long as the Executive does not breach the
covenants set forth in this Section 5\. During the Noncompetition Period,
the Executive will not, directly or indirectly, solicit or encourage or
assist others to solicit any business from any person or entity which,
together with its affiliates, had commercial loans outstanding from an
Applicable Bank which in the aggregate amounted to $1,000,000 or more at
any time within the six-month period prior to the Termination Date
("Commercial Loan Customers"). This Section 5 shall not be construed to
prohibit any of the Executives future employers from making general public
announcements to the effect that the Executive has become affiliated with such
new employer or holding receptions to introduce the Executive to persons
other than Commercial Loan Customers. The Executive agrees to inform any
potential new employer of the covenant set forth in this Section 5 prior to
accepting employment during the Noncompetition Period. The Executive agrees
that the restrictions of this Section 5 are reasonable in scope and duration
and that, in the event of breach of this Section 5, Buyer shall be entitled
to terminate the payments made pursuant to this Section 5 and seek a
temporary restraining order and an injunction restraining Executive from
breaching such covenants. The Executive shall be paid an aggregate amount
of $[ _ _ _ _] payable in equal
monthly installments in arrears, less any applicable tax withholdings, if
any, in consideration for the restrictions imposed by this Section 5. 

  

 6. _General_. 

  

 (a) _Heirs, Successors and Assigns_. The terms of this Agreement shall be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective heirs, successors and assigns. 

   

 (b) _Final Agreement_. This Agreement represents the entire understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior understandings, written or oral. The terms of this Agreement may be changed, modified or discharged only by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto. 

   

 (c) _Withholdings_. Seller, Seller Bank and Buyer may withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement such federal, state, or local taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to applicable law or regulation. 

   

 (d) _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be construed, enforced and interpreted in accordance with and governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without reference to its principles of conflicts of law, except to the extent that federal law shall be deemed to preempt such state laws.  

   

 (e) _Defined Terms_. Any capitalized terms not defined in this Agreement shall have as their meaning the definitions contained in the Merger Agreement. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (f) _Voluntary Action and Waiver_. The Executive acknowledges that by his free and voluntary act of signing below, the Executive agrees to all of the terms of this Agreement and intends to be legally bound thereby. The Executive acknowledges that he has been advised to consult with an attorney prior to executing this Agreement. 

   

 (g) _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 

   

 7. _Effectiveness_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this Agreement shall be subject to consummation of the Merger in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, as the same may be amended by the parties thereto in accordance with its terms. In the event the Merger Agreement is terminated for any reason, this Agreement shall be deemed null and void with respect to all actions not yet taken pursuant to this Agreement.

EXHIBIT C

 

FORM OF SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT FOR CHANGE IN CONTROL 

   

 This Settlement Agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into as of November ___, 2008 by and among _ _ (the "Executive"), Independent Bank Corp. and Rockland Trust Company (collectively, the "Buyer"), Benjamin Franklin Bancorp, Inc. (the "Seller") and Benjamin Franklin Bank (the "Seller Bank"). 

  

WITNESSETH: 

   

 WHEREAS, Buyer, Seller and Seller Bank are entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of November ___, 2008 (the "Merger Agreement"); and 

  

 WHEREAS, the Buyer, Seller, Seller Bank and the Executive desire to enter into this Agreement, which shall terminate the Amended and Restated Change of Control Agreement by and among Seller, the Seller Bank and the Executive dated March 26, 2008, (the "Change in Control Agreement") as of the Effective Time of the Merger, and in lieu of any rights and payments under the Change in Control Agreement, the Executive shall be entitled to the rights and payments set forth herein; 

  

 NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and other good and valuable consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Executive, Buyer, Seller, and the Seller Bank agree as follows: 

  

 1. _Agreement Amount_. On the Closing Date, provided (i) the Executive is still employed by Seller Bank immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger and (ii) the Executive has not revoked the release contained in Section 3 hereof, Seller Bank shall pay to the Executive a lump sum equal to $ _ _, less applicable tax withholdings (the "Agreement Amount"). The parties hereby agree that the Agreement Amount is final and binding on all parties, except to the extent that reduction is required pursuant to Section 4\. In consideration of such payment and the other provisions of this Agreement, the Executive, Buyer, Seller and Seller Bank hereby agree that the Change in Control Agreement shall be terminated without any further action of any of the parties hereto, effective immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger. The Executive agrees that the above Agreement Amount shall be in complete satisfaction of all rights to payments or benefits under the Change in Control Agreement or any other severance program except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement. Executive acknowledges that Executives employment with the Seller and/or Seller Bank will be terminated in connection with the Merger. 

  

 2. _Fringe Benefits_. Buyer agrees to provide the Executive with continued health and dental insurance coverage pursuant to the policies currently offered by Seller Bank (or comparable policies offered to similarly-situated employees of Buyer) during the period of [twenty-four (24)/twelve (12)] calendar months following the Effective Time of the Merger, subject to the terms and conditions of such policies, with the Executive responsible for paying the same share of any premiums, copayments or deductibles as he was paying as an employee 

   ##### 

  

    

immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, except as set forth
below in this Section 2. Such insurance coverage shall include any dependents
of the Executive who are covered as of the Effective Time of the Merger. In
the event the Executives participation in any such plan is barred, Buyer
shall arrange to provide the Executive with benefits substantially similar to
those which the Executive would otherwise have received under such plan from
which his continued participation is barred or provide their economic
equivalent. In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, if the provision of
any of the benefits covered by this Section 2 would trigger the 20% tax and
interest penalties under Section 409A of the Code, then the benefit(s) that
would trigger such tax and interest penalties shall not be provided
(collectively, the "Excluded Benefits"), and in lieu of the Excluded Benefits
Buyer shall pay to the Executive, in a lump sum within 30 days following
termination of employment or within 30 days after such determination should it
occur after termination of employment, a cash amount equal to the economic
equivalent of such Excluded Benefits. 

  

 3. _Releases_. Upon payment of the Agreement Amount, the Executive, for himself and for his heirs, successors and assigns, does hereby release completely and forever discharge Buyer, Seller and Seller Bank, their respective affiliates and successors and the current and former directors, officers, employees and agents of each of them (any and all of which are referred to below as the "Releasees") from any obligation under the Change in Control Agreement (other than the obligations of Buyer to provide benefits pursuant to Section 2 above which shall continue for the period specified therein). This Agreement shall not release Buyer, Seller or Seller Bank, as applicable, from any of the following: (a) obligations to pay to the Executive wages and make payment for accrued but unused vacation earned up to the Effective Time of the Merger to the extent required by applicable law; (b) the payment of any of the Executives vested benefits under the tax-qualified plans of Seller or Seller Bank; (c) the payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to the Executives common stock of Seller or payments or the obligation to provide substitute options with respect to Seller stock options as contemplated by the Merger Agreement, or (d) the obligations of Buyer, if any, under the indemnity provisions of the Merger Agreement. 

  

 4. _Section 280G Cut-Back_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall any payments be made or benefits provided under this Agreement, when combined with all other payments and benefits to the Executive, be allowed to render any such payment or benefit nondeductible under Section 280G of the Code or to trigger an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code. In such event, the payments and/or benefits to be provided under this Agreement shall be reduced, but not below zero, such that the aggregate benefits to be provided to the Executive do not exceed 2.99 multiplied by the Executives "base amount" (as such term is defined in Section 280G of the Code). If any reduction is to be made under this Section 4, the Executive may specify by written notice which payments and benefits shall be reduced (i.e., the Executive may elect whether to have reductions made from either the Agreement Amount or Section 2 hereof). 

   ##### 

  

  

 5. _General_. 

  

 (a) _Heirs, Successors and Assigns_. The terms of this Agreement shall be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective heirs, successors and assigns. 

  

 (b) _Final Agreement_. This Agreement represents the entire understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior understandings, written or oral. The terms of this Agreement may be changed, modified or discharged only by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto. 

  

 (c) _Withholdings_. Seller, Seller Bank and Buyer may withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement such federal, state, or local taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to applicable law or regulation. 

  

 (d) _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be construed, enforced and interpreted in accordance with and governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without reference to its principles of conflicts of law, except to the extent that federal law shall be deemed to preempt such state laws. 

  

 (e) _Defined Terms_. Any capitalized terms not defined in this Agreement shall have as their meaning the definitions contained in the Merger Agreement. 

  

 (f) _Voluntary Action and Waiver_. The Executive acknowledges that by his free and voluntary act of signing below, the Executive agrees to all of the terms of this Agreement and intends to be legally bound thereby. The Executive acknowledges that he has been advised to consult with an attorney prior to executing this Agreement. 

  

 (g) _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 

  

 5. _Effectiveness_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this Agreement shall be subject to consummation of the Merger in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, as the same may be amended by the parties thereto in accordance with its terms. In the event the Merger Agreement is terminated for any reason, this Agreement shall be deemed null and void with respect to all actions not yet taken pursuant to this Agreement.
