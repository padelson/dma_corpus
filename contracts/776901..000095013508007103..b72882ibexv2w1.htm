appropriate remedy for any such failure and will not oppose the granting of such relief on the
basis that Buyer has an adequate remedy at law. Shareholder further agrees that Shareholder will
not seek, and agrees to waive any requirement for, the securing or posting of a bond in connection
with Buyer&#146;s seeking or obtaining such equitable relief. In addition, after discussing the matter
with Shareholder, Buyer shall have the right to inform any third party that Buyer reasonably
believes to be, or to be contemplating, participating with Shareholder or receiving from
Shareholder assistance in violation of this Agreement, of the terms of this Agreement and of the

shall be automatically terminated in the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms. Upon such termination, no party shall have any further obligations or

Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or modified, and no provisions hereof may be modified or

under this Section&nbsp;1.1 is final and binding on all parties and shall not be subject to further
adjustment, except with respect to any adjustment to the Gross-Up Payment required pursuant to
Section&nbsp;1.3 below, and that the Employment Agreement Amount shall not be paid until the waiting

Employment Agreement Amount to the SERP Trust, and the other provisions of this Agreement,
including but not limited to the obligations of Buyer pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.3 below, Executive,
Buyer, Seller and Seller Bank hereby agree that the Employment Agreement shall terminate without
any further action of any of the parties hereto, effective immediately prior to the Effective Time

satisfaction of the obligations set forth in this Agreement, shall be in complete satisfaction of
all rights to payments or benefits under the Employment Agreement or any other severance program

the Code, and therefore payment of the Employment Agreement Amount shall be made by the SERP Trust
to Executive on the date that is six months after the date of Separation of Service. For purposes
of this Section&nbsp;1.2, Separation of Service shall mean any termination of employment with the
Seller, Seller Bank or any successor by Merger pursuant to which the aggregate level of services
provided by the Executive to such entity (whether as an employee, director or a consultant) is
permanently reduced to a level of services that is 49% or less than the level of services provided

Seller and/or Seller Bank will be terminated in connection with the Merger, effective immediately
prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, and that such termination will be a Separation from
Service.

one or more of the following: (i)&nbsp;a change in the amount of the <I>pro rata </I>bonus paid for the year
2009 based on a change in closing date of the Merger; (ii)&nbsp;a change in the value of option
acceleration and restricted stock acceleration based upon a change in closing date, interest rate,

payable for the six month delay of payments required pursuant to Section&nbsp;409A of the Code; or (iv)
a change in the tax rates in effect for the calendar year in which the Excise Tax is payable. The
amount of the Gross-Up payment shall be recalculated with respect to items (i)&nbsp;through (iv)&nbsp;above
as applicable in order to determine the amount of the Gross-Up Payment (the &#147;Initial Gross-Up

in (iv)&nbsp;above during the six month period following the Effective Date of the Merger, a
further recalculation of the Gross-Up Payment shall be made by Tax Counsel (as defined in the
Employment Agreement) (the resulting amount, the &#147;Adjusted Gross-Up Payment&#148;), and (A)&nbsp;if the
Adjusted Gross-Up Payment is more than the Initial Gross-Up Payment, an amount equal to the
difference shall be paid by Buyer to the Executive, and (B)&nbsp;if the Adjusted Gross-Up Payment is
less than the Initial Gross-Up Payment, an amount equal to the difference shall be paid by the
Executive to Buyer. Any such payment of the difference between the Initial Gross-Up Payment and
the Adjusted Gross-Up Payment shall be paid within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of the date of payment of the
Employment Agreement Amount by the SERP Trust to the Executive. Notwithstanding the above, nothing
herein is intended to release Buyer from the obligations of Section&nbsp;13 of the Employment Agreement

13 shall be deemed to refer to Buyer, except that references to Holding Company with respect to

as he was paying as an employee immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, except as
set forth below in this Section&nbsp;2. Such insurance coverage shall include any dependents of the
Executive who are covered as of the Effective Time of the Merger. In the event the Executive&#146;s
participation in any such plan is barred, Buyer shall arrange to provide the Executive with
benefits substantially similar to those which the Executive would otherwise have received under
such plan from which his continued participation is barred or provide their economic equivalent.

Company shall be deemed to be obligations of Buyer<B><I>. </I></B>This Agreement shall not release Buyer,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, Buyer, Seller and Seller Bank are entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger,
dated as of November &#95;&#95;&#95;, 2008 (the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;); and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Buyer, Seller, Seller Bank and the Executive desire to enter into this Agreement,
which shall terminate the Amended and Restated Change of Control Agreement by and among Seller, the
Seller Bank and the Executive dated March&nbsp;26, 2008, (the &#147;Change in Control Agreement&#148;) as of the
Effective Time of the Merger, and in lieu of any rights and payments under the Change in Control
Agreement, the Executive shall be entitled to the rights and payments set forth herein;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and other good and valuable consideration the
receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Executive, Buyer, Seller, and the
Seller Bank agree as follows:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;<U>Agreement Amount</U>. On the Closing Date, provided (i)&nbsp;the Executive is still
employed by Seller Bank immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger and (ii)&nbsp;the
Executive has not revoked the release contained in Section&nbsp;3 hereof, Seller Bank shall pay to the
Executive a lump sum equal to $<U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U>, less applicable tax withholdings (the &#147;Agreement
Amount&#148;). <B>The parties hereby agree that the Agreement Amount is final and binding on all parties,
except to the extent that reduction is required pursuant to Section&nbsp;4. </B>In consideration of such
payment and the other provisions of this Agreement, the Executive, Buyer, Seller and Seller Bank
hereby agree that the Change in Control Agreement shall be terminated without any further action of
any of the parties hereto, effective immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger. The
Executive agrees that the above Agreement Amount shall be in complete satisfaction of all rights to
payments or benefits under the Change in Control Agreement or any other severance program except as
otherwise set forth in this Agreement. Executive acknowledges that Executive&#146;s employment with the
Seller and/or Seller Bank will be terminated in connection with the Merger.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;<U>Fringe Benefits</U>. Buyer agrees to provide the Executive with continued health and
dental insurance coverage pursuant to the policies currently offered by Seller Bank (or comparable
policies offered to similarly-situated employees of Buyer) during the period of &#091;twenty-four
(24)/twelve (12)&#093; calendar months following the Effective Time of the Merger, subject to the terms
and conditions of such policies, with the Executive responsible for paying the same share of any
premiums, copayments or deductibles as he was paying as an employee

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, except as set forth below in this Section&nbsp;2.
Such insurance coverage shall include any dependents of the Executive who are covered as of the
Effective Time of the Merger. In the event the Executive&#146;s participation in any such plan is
barred, Buyer shall arrange to provide the Executive with benefits substantially similar to those
which the Executive would otherwise have received under such plan from which his continued
participation is barred or provide their economic equivalent. In addition, notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the provision of any of the benefits covered by this Section&nbsp;2 would trigger the 20%
tax and interest penalties under Section&nbsp;409A of the Code, then the benefit(s) that would trigger
such tax and interest penalties shall not be provided (collectively, the &#147;Excluded Benefits&#148;), and
in lieu of the Excluded Benefits Buyer shall pay to the Executive, in a lump sum within 30&nbsp;days
following termination of employment or within 30&nbsp;days after such determination should it occur
after termination of employment, a cash amount equal to the economic equivalent of such Excluded
Benefits.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;<U>Releases</U>. Upon payment of the Agreement Amount, the Executive, for himself and for
his heirs, successors and assigns, does hereby release completely and forever discharge Buyer,
Seller and Seller Bank, their respective affiliates and successors and the current and former
directors, officers, employees and agents of each of them (any and all of which are referred to
below as the &#147;Releasees&#148;) from any obligation under the Change in Control Agreement (other than the
obligations of Buyer to provide benefits pursuant to Section&nbsp;2 above which shall continue for the
period specified therein). This Agreement shall not release Buyer, Seller or Seller Bank, as
applicable, from any of the following: (a)&nbsp;obligations to pay to the Executive wages and make
payment for accrued but unused vacation earned up to the Effective Time of the Merger to the extent
required by applicable law; (b)&nbsp;the payment of any of the Executive&#146;s vested benefits under the
tax-qualified plans of Seller or Seller Bank; (c)&nbsp;the payment of the Merger Consideration with
respect to the Executive&#146;s common stock of Seller or payments or the obligation to provide
substitute options with respect to Seller stock options as contemplated by the Merger Agreement, or
(d)&nbsp;the obligations of Buyer, if any, under the indemnity provisions of the Merger Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;<U>Section&nbsp;280G Cut-Back</U>. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
in no event shall any payments be made or benefits provided under this Agreement, when combined
with all other payments and benefits to the Executive, be allowed to render any such payment or
benefit nondeductible under Section&nbsp;280G of the Code or to trigger an excise tax under Section&nbsp;4999
of the Code. In such event, the payments and/or benefits to be provided under this Agreement shall
be reduced, but not below zero, such that the aggregate benefits to be provided to the Executive do
not exceed 2.99 multiplied by the Executive&#146;s &#147;base amount&#148; (as such term is defined in Section
280G of the Code). If any reduction is to be made under this Section&nbsp;4, the Executive may specify
by written notice which payments and benefits shall be reduced (i.e., the Executive may elect
whether to have reductions made from either the Agreement Amount or Section&nbsp;2 hereof).
