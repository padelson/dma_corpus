ARTICLE 5 
TITLE MATTERS

5.1 Defensible Title. The term "Defensible Title" means, with respect to each
Lease, such record title of Seller in and to the Lease that, subject to and
except for the Permitted Encumbrances:

a. entitles Seller to receive not less than the net revenue interest ("NRI")
described in Exhibit D share of production allocated to such Lease (except as
such NRI may be reduced after the Execution Date in accordance with Section
8.1(h) due to the exercise of non-consent rights under applicable operating
and similar agreements or applicable state Law);

b. obligates Seller to bear a percentage of the costs and expenses allocated
to such Lease in an amount not greater than the working interest percentage
("WI") described in Exhibit D, without a corresponding increase in the NRI
(except as such WI may be adjusted after the Execution Date in accordance with
Section 8.1(h) due to the exercise of non-consent rights under applicable
operating and similar agreements or applicable state Law);

c. with respect to each Lease, entitles Seller to not less than the Net Acres
set forth on Exhibit D for such Lease; and

d. is free and clear of any and all liens (including liens for delinquent

5.2 Permitted Encumbrances. The term "Permitted Encumbrances" shall mean:

a. Royalties, overriding royalties, reversionary interests, net profit
interests, production payments, carried interests, and other burdens, to the
extent that any such burden does not reduce the NRI below that shown in
Exhibit D, or increase the WI above that shown in Exhibit D, without a
proportionate increase in the NRI;

b. The Assumed Contracts to the extent that they do not, individually or in
the aggregate, reduce the NRI below that shown in Exhibit D, or increase the
WI above that shown in Exhibit D, as applicable, without a proportionate
increase in the NRI;

c. Liens for current taxes or assessments not yet delinquent or, if
delinquent, being contested in good faith by appropriate actions, as set forth
in Section 5.2 of the Disclosure Schedule;

being contested in good faith (which are listed in Section 5.2 of the
Disclosure Schedule);



e. All rights to consent by, required notices to, filings with, or other
actions by any Governmental Body having jurisdiction in connection with the
sale or conveyance of the Assets pursuant to this or to any future transaction

leasehold interest to the holders of such reassignment rights prior to
surrendering or releasing such leasehold interest;

rights in respect of surface operations, to the extent that they do not (i)
reduce the NRI below that shown in Exhibit D, (ii) increase the WI above that

detract in any material respect from the value of, or interfere in any
material respect with the use, ownership or operation of the Assets subject
thereto or affected thereby (as currently used, owned and operated) and which
would be considered acceptable by a reasonably prudent purchaser engaged in
the business of owning and operating oil and gas properties;

h. All rights reserved to or vested in any Governmental Body to control or
regulate any of the Assets in any manner, and all obligations and duties under
all applicable laws or under any franchise, grant, license or permit issued by
any such Governmental Body; and

i. Any other encumbrance, defect or irregularity affecting any Asset the
enforcement of which is barred under applicable statutes of limitation, or the
following matters unless such matter can reasonably be expected to result in
another Person's superior claim of title to the affected Lease: (i) lack of
corporate authorization, (ii) failure to recite marital status in documents,
(iii) omission of heirship or succession proceedings older than 10 years from
the Closing Date, (iv) the failure to record releases of liens, production
payments or deeds of trust that have expired according to their own terms, and
(v) minor defects or irregularities in title which would be considered
acceptable by a reasonably prudent purchaser engaged in the business of owning
and operating oil and gas properties and do not affect the ability to drill or
operate a well.

The transfer of the Assets by Seller to Buyer shall be by warranty of
Defensible Title, by, through and under Seller and its Affiliates, but not
otherwise, subject to the Permitted Encumbrances (the "Special Warranty").

5.3 Notice of Title Defects. Buyer shall give Seller written notice of all
Title Defects discovered by Buyer by delivering to Seller a written "Notice of
Title Defects" setting forth such Title Defects. The Notice of Title Defects
shall (a) describe the Title Defect, (b) describe the basis of the Title
Defect, (c) include copies of any title opinion, title memoranda and other
documentation supporting the basis of the Title Defect, (d) describe in
general terms the curative action that Buyer reasonably anticipates would need
to be taken in order to cure such Title Defect, and (e) describe Buyer's good
faith estimate of the reduction in the Allocated Property's Allocated Value
caused by the Title Defect ("Title Defect Value") (provided that the Title
Defect Value, together with the aggregate Title Defect Values attributable to
any other Title Defects affecting such Allocated Property, shall not exceed
the Allocated Property's Allocated Value) and associated calculations and
documentation. The final Notice of Title Defects shall be delivered on or
before the Defect



Notice Deadline. Except with respect to the provisions set forth in the last
sentence of Section 5.10, Buyer will be deemed to have conclusively waived (i)
other than with respect to the Special Warranty to be provided in the
Assignment, Bill of Sale and Conveyance to be delivered at Closing, any Title
Defect about which it fails to notify Seller in writing prior to the Defect
Notice Deadline and (ii) any Title Defect (other than Title Defects arising
by, through or under Seller and its Affiliates) with respect to which the
Title Defect Value is less than the Title Defect Threshold; provided, that the
Title Defect Values of all Title Defects affecting any single Lease shall be
aggregated for purposes of determining whether the Title Defect Threshold has
been reached for such Lease.

5.4 Defect Adjustments and Deductibles. Seller and Buyer shall proceed as
follows with respect to an asserted Title Defect:

a. Seller shall have the option until two Business Days prior to the Closing
Date to cure any Title Defect affecting any Allocated Property that is timely
identified under Section 5.3.

b. If a Title Defect timely asserted by Buyer affecting an Allocated Property
is not cured or waived on or before two Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, Buyer and Seller shall attempt in good faith to reach agreement, on or
before Closing, on the existence of the Title Defect and the Title Defect
Value, and, if they reach agreement, such Title Defect Value shall be included
in determining the Title Defect Adjustment, if any, under Section 5.4(c). In
the event that Buyer and Seller do not reach such an agreement by Closing,
Seller shall elect to either (i) include the subject Allocated Property in the
Assets to be conveyed at Closing, in which case the Title Defect Value
asserted by Buyer with respect thereto shall be delivered to the Escrow Agent
by Buyer at Closing, such amount of the Title Defect Value shall be included
in Section 5.4(c)(i) for purposes of determining the Title Defect Adjustment,
if any, under Section 5.4(c) to be reflected in the Settlement Statement, and
the existence of the Title Defect and Title Defect Value shall be determined
by the Title Expert pursuant to Section 5.6, or (ii) exclude the subject
Allocated Property from the Assets, in which case the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the Allocated Value of the excluded Allocated Property (a "Title
Defect Exclusion").

c. The "Title Defect Adjustment" shall be the amount, if any, by which (i) the
aggregate amount of all Title Defect Values with respect to uncured and
unwaived Title Defects affecting Allocated Properties that are not Title
Defect Exclusions exceeds (ii) the Title Defect Deductible Amount. The
Purchase Price shall be reduced pursuant to Section 3.3(b)(i) by the Title
Defect Exclusions and the Title Defect Adjustment.

5.5 Post-Closing Cure of Title Defects. In the event that the Title Defect
giving rise to the exclusion of an Allocated Property from this Agreement as a
Title Defect Exclusion, or to a Purchase Price reduction for the Title Defect
Value, is cured by Seller (provided Seller shall have no obligation to attempt
to cure Title Defects) such that the post-curative Title Defect Value, if any,
is less than the Title Defect Threshold and Seller delivers to Buyer pertinent
information reasonably necessary to document the curative action within 60
days after the Closing Date (or if such condition is satisfied based on the
determination of the Title Expert pursuant to Section 5.6 whether such
determination occurs before or after such 60 day period), then (i) in the case
of a Title Defect associated with an Allocated Property that is not a Title
Defect Exclusion, Buyer shall pay or the Parties shall cause the Escrow Agent
to pay, as applicable, to Seller an amount equal to the Title



Defect Value or (ii) in the case of an Allocated Property that is a Title
Defect Exclusion, Seller shall have the option to put the excluded Allocated
Property to Buyer, such put option shall be exercised by Seller delivering
written notice to Buyer of Seller's election to put the excluded Allocated
Property to Buyer within 60 days after the Closing Date (or, if later, 15 days
after receipt of the Title Expert's determination), and if such exercise
notice is given, then, within 15 days after Buyer\'s receipt of such notice,
Seller shall assign such Allocated Property to Buyer by an assignment in the
form of Exhibit E and Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the
Allocated Value of such Allocated Property, adjusted as provided in Section
3.3. Any dispute regarding matters arising under this Section 5.5 shall be
resolved exclusively by expert determination using the procedures specified in
Section 5.6.

5.6 Post-Closing Expert Determination of Title Defects. Seller and Buyer shall
each have the right to submit the validity of any asserted Title Defect or
Title Defect Value, or the adequacy of any title curative action, to expert
determination pursuant to this Section 5.6, which shall be the Parties' sole
remedy with respect to such matters. Any such expert determination shall be
commenced, if at all, within 90 days after the Closing Date.



a. The Title Expert shall be a neutral attorney who does not represent and has
not recently represented either Party and who has at least 10 years of
experience in oil and gas title Law and, if such an attorney is available,
preferably in Texas oil and gas title Law, as applicable (the "Title Expert").

b. The Parties shall attempt to mutually agree on the Title Expert; provided
if the Parties do not mutually agree on the Title Expert within 15 Business
Days after the other Party's receipt of a Party's election to submit a matter
to expert determination, then, within five Business Days after the end of such
15 Business Day period, each Party shall submit to the other Party the name(s)
of at least one, but not more than three, potential Title Experts having the
qualifications outlined in Section 5.6(a). If there is one common name on the
Parties' lists, that Person shall be the Title Expert; but if there is more
than one common name on the Parties' lists, the Title Expert shall be selected
from the common names on the Parties' lists by the mutual agreement of the
Parties, or in absence of such agreement, by drawing straws.

c. In the event there are no common names on the Parties' lists, the lists of
potential Title Experts submitted by the Parties shall be submitted to the
Houston, Texas office of the AAA on or before five Business Days after the
submission of the Parties' respective lists, and the AAA shall select the
Title Expert from the Parties' lists.

d. Within 20 Business Days after the selection of the Title Expert, the
Parties shall provide to the Title Expert the following materials:

(i) Buyer's Notice of Title Defects and all documentation provided therewith
or referred to therein shall be provided to the Title Expert, and Seller shall
provide such evidence as Seller deems appropriate to dispute the Title Defect
and the



Title Defect Value as assigned thereto by Buyer in the Notice of Title Defects
and to substantiate any title curative actions undertaken by Seller, together
with Seller's proposed Title Defect Value, if any after giving effect to any
such curative actions; and

(ii) Article 5 of this Agreement, and Exhibits A-2, and D to this Agreement,
together with any definitions of terms used in such Article and Exhibits, but
no other provisions of this Agreement.

e. The Title Expert, once appointed, shall have no ex parte communications
with any of the Parties concerning the determination required hereunder. All
communications between any Party and the Title Expert shall be conducted in
writing, with copies sent simultaneously to the other Party in the same
manner, or at a meeting in Houston, Texas to which the representatives of both
Parties have been invited and of which such parties have been provided at
least five days' notice.

f. The Title Expert shall make his or her determination and provide to the
Parties written findings within 20 Business Days after he or she has received
the materials under Section 5.6(d). The decision of the Title Expert shall be
final, binding on the Parties and non-appealable and, with respect to a Title
Defect Value, shall be limited to awarding only the Title Defect Value
asserted by Buyer in its Title Defect Notice or Seller's proposed Title Defect
Value furnished pursuant to Section 5.6(d)(i) (or the other Party's proposed
Title Defect Value furnished pursuant to Section 5.6(d)(i)). The Title Expert
shall make a separate determination with respect to each Title Defect
submitted. Within the 10 Business Days of receiving the written findings of
the Title Expert with respect to a Title Defect, the Parties shall execute and
deliver to the Escrow Agent joint written instructions directing the Escrow
Agent to deliver the cash held in escrow with respect to such Title Defect
consistent with the decision of the Title Expert.

g. Each Party shall pay and bear the costs of its attorneys and experts.
Seller shall pay 50% and Buyer shall pay 50% of the costs of the Title Expert.

h. The written finding of the Title Expert (i) need only set forth the Title
Expert's finding as to whether the subject Title Defect exists or has been
cured and the Title Defect Value, and not the Title Expert's rationale for the
award, and (ii) shall set forth the allocation of costs pursuant to Section
5.6(g).

i. The Title Expert shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of
determining the specific matters disputed and shall not act as an arbitrator,
and may not award damages, interest or penalties to either Party with respect
to any matter.

5.7 Consents. Seller shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to obtain all
consents set forth in Section 6.17 of the Disclosure Schedule prior to Closing
relating to a transfer of its interest in the Assets. Seller shall provide
within five days after the Execution Date all notices required to be obtained
in compliance with the contractual provisions applicable thereto. If Seller or
Buyer discovers other affected Assets that are subject to a consent to
transfer requirement, Seller shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to
obtain such consents prior to Closing.



a. Required Consents. That portion of the Assets for which a consent has not
been obtained and if such lack of consent would (i) invalidate an attempted
conveyance of the Assets to Buyer or (ii) cause a termination of the Asset
being conveyed (each, a "Required Consent") shall be excluded from the Assets
conveyed at the Closing and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
Allocated Value of the excluded Allocated Properties. Seller may (but is not
obligated to) use its reasonable commercial efforts to obtain any such
Required Consent following Closing for a period of one year and if a Required
Consent is obtained within one year after the Closing, then, within 30 days
after receipt of such consent, Seller may assign such excluded portion of the
Assets to Buyer using an assignment in the form of Exhibit E in exchange for a
payment by wire transfer from Buyer equal to the Allocated Value of the
applicable Allocated Property, subject to the adjustments described in Section
3.3. Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with Seller in obtaining any Required
Consent but shall not be required to expend funds in connection therewith.

b. Non-Required Consents. The following types of consents shall not constitute
Required Consents: (i) consents to transfers of title by the State of Texas or
any county, (ii) consents set forth in, or arising out of, a farmout or
similar agreement pursuant to which Seller has already satisfied all
conditions for earning any interests that constitute a part of the Assets and
Seller has received the earned interests under such agreement, and (iii) any
other consents that are not Required Consents. If a consent is not a Required
Consent and it has not been obtained as of the Closing Date, then the affected
Assets shall nevertheless be conveyed at the Closing as part of the Assets
without a reduction to the Purchase Price.

5.8 Preferential Purchase Rights. Seller shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to comply with all preferential right to purchase provisions
(including those set forth in Section 6.17 of the Disclosure Schedule)
relative to its interest in the Assets by sending notice of this Agreement,
within five days after the Execution Date, to all Persons holding preferential
rights, offering to sell to each such Person that portion of the Assets for
which such a preferential right is held for an amount equal to the Allocated
Values of the subject Allocated Properties, subject to all other terms and
conditions of this Agreement and in compliance with the contractual provisions
applicable to such preferential rights. If Seller or Buyer discovers any
additional preferential rights, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to comply therewith in accordance with the terms of the preceding
sentence. If, prior to Closing, any of such persons asserting a preferential
purchase right notifies Seller that it intends to consummate the purchase of
that portion of the Assets to which it holds a preferential purchase right
pursuant to the terms and conditions of such notice and this Agreement, then
such Assets shall be excluded from the Assets identified in this Agreement and
the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Values of the excluded
Allocated Properties; provided, however, that if the holder of such
preferential right is required to but fails to consummate the purchase of such
Assets on or prior to the Closing Date, then Seller shall notify Buyer, and
Seller shall sell to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase from Seller, the Assets
to which the preferential purchase right was asserted for such Allocated
Values. All Assets for which a preferential purchase right has not been
asserted prior to Closing and the period for exercise has expired, or with
respect to which closing does not occur on or before the Closing Date
following the assertion of a preferential purchase right other than as a
result of Seller's default for which Closing should have occurred prior to the
Closing Date, shall be sold to Buyer at Closing pursuant to the provisions of
this Agreement.



5.9 Casualty Loss. Prior to Closing, if any material portion of an Allocated
Property is destroyed by fire or other casualty or if a portion of an
Allocated Property is taken or threatened to be taken in condemnation or under
the right of eminent domain ("Casualty Loss"), such Allocated Property shall
be excluded from this Agreement and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
Allocated Value of the excluded Allocated Property, unless Buyer and Seller
agree upon the estimated cost to repair such Allocated Property (with
equipment of similar utility) or other appropriate reduction to the Purchase
Price, not to exceed the Allocated Value of the Allocated Property (the
Purchase Price adjustment, whether from excluding the Allocated Property or
agreement upon an appropriate adjustment, is herein called the "Net Casualty
Loss") and Seller shall retain all insurance proceeds and all claims against
third parties with respect to the Casualty Loss; provided, however, that if
the aggregate Net Casualty Loss is less than 2% of the unadjusted Purchase
Price: (a) the Net Casualty Loss will be deemed to be $0; (b) the affected
Allocated Properties will be assigned to Buyer at Closing to the extent still
owned by Seller; and (c) Seller will assign to Buyer all rights to insurance
proceeds and condemnation and taking proceeds at Closing or pay over such
proceeds if already received. Seller, at its option, may elect to cure such
Casualty Loss prior to the Closing. If Seller elects to cure such Casualty
Loss, Seller may replace any personal property that is the subject of a
Casualty Loss with equipment of similar grade and utility, or replace any
personal property with personal property of similar nature and kind if such
property is acceptable to Buyer in its reasonable discretion. If Seller elects
to cure the Casualty Loss, and in fact does cure the Casualty Loss prior to
the Closing to the reasonable satisfaction of Buyer, there shall be no
adjustment to the Purchase Price.

5.10 Title Waiver. Except for claims, damages, liabilities, costs or expenses
Buyer asserts under the Special Warranty, all Title Defects not properly and
timely claimed in accordance with Section 5.3, above shall be waived by Buyer
for all purposes, and Buyer shall have no right to seek an adjustment to the
Purchase Price, make a Claim against Seller, monetary, legal or otherwise, or
seek indemnification from Seller associated with the same. For the avoidance
of doubt, the terms of Sections 6.9, 6.10, 6.16, 6.17, 6.20, 6.22 and 6.26
shall not be affected by the terms of this Section 5.10.

all approvals from Governmental Bodies required for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except consents and approvals of
assignments by Governmental Bodies that are customarily obtained after
Closing, shall have been granted, or the necessary waiting period shall have
expired, or early termination of the waiting period shall have been granted.

f. Encana Contract. The Bankruptcy Court shall have entered an order
authorizing the rejection of the Encana Contract, which shall remain in effect
and not be stayed.

g. Encana Adversary Proceeding. The Bankruptcy Court shall have entered an
order dismissing claims and causes of action asserted with respect to the
Assets in the Encana Complaint or any amended complaint filed by Encana, which
shall remain in effect and not be stayed; provided that, this condition shall
be deemed satisfied if the Bankruptcy Court enters an order authorizing the
sale of the Assets to Buyer free and clear of all claims and causes of action
against the Assets asserted by Encana, regardless of whether the Encana
Complaint or any amended complaint filed by Encana has been dismissed. For the
avoidance of doubt, it is acknowledged that the claims and causes of action
with respect to the Assets contained in the Encana Complaint as of



the date hereof consist of the Fourth Claim for Relief, Fifth Claim for
Relief, and Sixth Claim for Relief in the Encana Complaint.

h. Sale Order. The Bankruptcy Court shall have entered the Sale Order which
shall remain in effect and not be subject to any stay.

ARTICLE 10 
RIGHT OF TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT

10.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated prior to the Closing as
follows:

(a) by Buyer or Seller, if the Closing has not occurred by the close of
business on the 90th day following the Execution Date (the "Termination
Date"); provided, however, that, if the Closing has not occurred on or before
the Termination Date primarily due to a material breach of any
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement by Buyer or Seller, then the breaching party may not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(a);

(b) by mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer;

(c) by Buyer, if any condition to the obligations of Buyer set forth in
Section 9.2 has become incapable of fulfillment as a result of Seller's
material breach, and other than as a result of a breach by Buyer of any
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, and such condition is not
waived by Buyer;

(d) by Seller, if any condition to the obligations of Seller set forth in
Section 9.1 has become incapable of fulfillment as a result of Buyer's
material breach, and other than as a result of a breach by Seller of any
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, and such condition is not
waived by Seller;

(e) by Buyer, if Seller breaches any representation or warranty or any
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, such breach would result in
a failure of a condition set forth in Section 9.2 and, if such breach is
curable, such breach has not been cured by the earlier of (i) 30 days after
the giving of written notice by Buyer to Seller of such breach, and (ii) the
Termination Date;

(f) by Seller, if Buyer breaches any representation or warranty or any
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, such breach would result in
a failure of a condition set forth in Section 9.1, and, if such breach is
curable, such breach has not been cured by the earlier of (i) 30 days after
the giving of written notice by Seller to Buyer of such breach, and (ii) the
Termination Date;

(g) by Buyer, if the Bidding Procedures Order is not approved by the
Bankruptcy Court within 30 days of the execution of this Agreement or if the
Bidding Procedures Order is amended, modified, or vacated in any manner
without Buyer's consent (not to be unreasonably withheld);



(h) by Seller or Buyer, if there is in effect a final non-appealable order of
a Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby; it being agreed that the Parties will promptly appeal any adverse
determination that is not non-appealable and pursue such appeal with
reasonable diligence;

(i) by Buyer if the Bankruptcy Court enters an order dismissing or converting
the Bankruptcy Case to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code;

(j) by Buyer if the Bankruptcy Court enters an order appointing a trustee,
receiver or examiner with expanded powers;

(k) by Buyer, if an order authorizing the rejection of the Encana Contract has
not been entered within 60 days of the Execution Date;

(l) if the Sale Order does not authorize the sale of the Assets to Buyer free
and clear of all claims and causes of action against the Assets asserted by
Encana in the Encana Complaint or any amended complaint filed by Encana within
60 days of the Execution Date; or

(m) by Buyer or Seller, if Seller selects or accepts a Competing Transaction
as the highest or otherwise best bid made in accordance with the Bidding
Procedures Order.

10.2 Procedure Upon Termination. In the event of termination pursuant to
Section 10.1 hereof, written notice thereof will forthwith be given to the
other Party, and this Agreement will terminate, and the purchase of the Assets
hereunder will be abandoned, without further action by Buyer or Seller. If
this Agreement is terminated as provided herein, each Party will redeliver all
confidential information of any other Party relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby, whether so obtained before or after the execution hereof,
to the Party furnishing the same, and no later than five days after such
termination the Parties shall execute joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent to disburse the Deposit to the applicable Party entitled to receive such
amount according to Section 3.2.

10.3 Effect of Termination.

a. In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated as provided herein,
then each of the Parties will be relieved of its duties and obligations
arising under this Agreement after the date of such termination and such
termination will be without liability to Buyer or Seller; provided, however,
that the provisions of Section 3.2, Section 10.2, this Section 10.3, and
Article 15 hereof and, to the extent necessary to effectuate the foregoing
enumerated provisions, Sections 1.1, and 1.2 hereof, will survive any such
termination and will be enforceable hereunder; provided, further, that nothing
in this Section 10.3 will be deemed to release any Party from liability for
any breach of its obligations under this Agreement.

b. Notwithstanding Section 10.3(a), if this Agreement is validly terminated in
accordance with Section 10.1(m), then Buyer shall be entitled to (and Seller
shall pay or cause to be paid to Buyer) the Break-Up Fee on the earliest of
(i) immediately following consummation of



the Competing Transaction that was the basis for the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 10.1(m) hereof, (ii) if Seller does not
consummate the Competing Transaction that was the basis for the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with Section 10.1(m) hereof, then upon
termination of such Competing Transaction, and (iii) 60 days after the
termination of this Agreement. Moreover, if this Agreement is validly
terminated for any reason other than in accordance with Section 10.1(b),
Section 10.1(d), Section 10.1(f), Section 10.1(g), or Section 10.1(h), then
Buyer shall be entitled to (and Seller shall pay or cause to be paid to Buyer)
the Expense Reimbursement Amount within five Business Days after the
termination giving rise to such payment, provided, that if the termination of
this Agreement is effected in accordance with Section 10.1(m), the Expense
Reimbursement shall be paid at the same time as the Break-up Fee. In the event
any portion of the Expense Reimbursement Amount is contested as to
reasonableness, all amounts not so contested will be paid forthwith. Seller's
obligation to pay the Break-Up Fee and/or Expense Reimbursement Amount
pursuant to this Section 10.3(b) shall survive the termination of this
Agreement and shall constitute an administrative expense of Seller. If and to
the extent applicable, the Parties shall jointly instruct, pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent to release funds to Buyer to satisfy such
amounts owed. Buyer's retention of the Deposit and the payment of Seller to
Buyer of the Break-Up Fee and/or Expense Reimbursement Amount shall constitute
liquidated damages under this Agreement, which remedy shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy available to Buyer for any such failure of Seller prior to
Closing. Seller and Buyer acknowledge and agree that (A) Buyer's actual
damages upon the event of such a termination are difficult to ascertain with
any certainty, (B) the return of the Deposit and the payment by Seller to
Buyer of the Break-Up Fee and/or Expense Reimbursement Amount is a fair and
reasonable estimate by the Parties of such aggregate actual damages of Buyer,
and (C) such liquidated damages do not constitute a penalty. Each Party
acknowledges that the agreements contained in Article 2, Article 3 and this
Article 10 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that without these agreements such Party would not have entered
into this Agreement.

ARTICLE 11

j. Pending Claims. Buyer and its Affiliates shall release the Pending Claims

ARTICLE 12 
POST-CLOSING OBLIGATIONS



12.1 Expert Determination of Settlement Statement Disputes. If the Parties are
not able to agree to changes to the Settlement Statement prior to Closing, the
Settlement Statement prepared by Seller shall control at Closing, as set forth
in Section 3.3, and the Parties shall continue to work to resolve such dispute
within 30 days after Closing. If the Parties are not able to resolve such
dispute within 30 days after Closing:

a. Except with respect to matters subject to expert determination under
Section 5.6, on or before 15 days after the expiration of such 30-day period,
the Parties shall exchange their final positions regarding the disputed
amounts and such disputed amounts shall be finally resolved by expert
determination in Houston, Texas, with the office of Ernst and Young LLP, acting
as the "Accounting Expert."

b. If Ernst and Young LLP refuses to act as the Accounting Expert, the Parties
shall attempt to mutually agree on the Accounting Expert; provided if the
Parties are not able to mutually agree on the Accounting Expert within 15
Business Days after the determination to submit a matter to expert
determination under this Section, then, within five Business Days after the
end of such 15 Business Day period, each Party shall submit to the other Party
the name(s) of at least one, but not more than three, potential Accounting
Experts. If there is one common name on the Parties' lists, that Person shall
be the Accounting Expert; but if there is more than one common name on the
Parties' lists, the Accounting Expert shall be selected from the common names
on the Parties' lists by the mutual agreement of the Parties, or in absence of
such agreement, by drawing straws.

c. In the event there are no common names on the Parties' lists, the lists of
potential Accounting Experts submitted by the Parties shall be submitted to
the Houston, Texas office of the AAA on or before five Business Days after the
submission of the Parties' respective lists, and the AAA shall select the
Accounting Expert from the Parties' lists.

d. Within 20 Business Days after the selection of the Accounting Expert, the
Parties shall provide to the Accounting Expert the following materials:

(i) The list of disputed amounts, each Party's final proposal with respect to
each disputed amount under Section 12.1(a), and evidence as each Party deems
appropriate to support its position with respect to each disputed amount; and

(ii) Article 3, Section 12.1 and Article 13 of this Agreement, and Exhibits
A-2, B, and D to this Agreement, together with any definitions of terms used
in such Article, Sections and Exhibits, but no other provisions of this
Agreement.

e. The Accounting Expert, once appointed, shall have no ex parte
communications with any of the Parties concerning the determination required
hereunder. All communications between any Party and the Accounting Expert
shall be conducted in writing, with copies sent simultaneously to the other
Party in the same manner, or at a meeting in Houston, Texas, to which the
representatives of both Parties have been invited and of which such parties
have been provided at least five days' notice.



f. The Accounting Expert shall make its determination and provide to the
Parties written findings within 20 Business Days after it has received the
materials under Section 12.1(d). The decision of the Accounting Expert shall
be final, binding on the Parties and non-appealable (absent fraud or manifest
error) and shall be limited to awarding only Seller's or Buyer's final
proposal with respect to each disputed amount (as exchanged by the Parties as
provided in Section 12.1(a)). The Accounting Expert shall make a separate
determination with respect to each disputed amount submitted. For the
avoidance of doubt, the independent accounting firm shall not make any
determination with respect to any matter other than those matters affecting
the calculations of the Settlement Statement that remain in dispute.

g. Each Party shall pay and bear the costs of its attorneys and experts.
Seller shall pay 50% and Buyer shall pay 50% of the costs of the Accounting
Expert.

h. The written finding of the Accounting Expert (i) need only set forth the
Accounting Expert's finding as to each disputed amount and not the Accounting
Expert's rationale for the award, and (ii) shall set forth the allocation of
costs pursuant to Section 12.1(g). The Accounting Expert shall act as an
expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific matters disputed
and shall not act as an arbitrator, and may not award damages, interest or
penalties to either Party with respect to any matter.

12.2 Further Assurances. From time to time after Closing, Seller and Buyer
shall each execute, acknowledge and deliver to the other such further
instruments and take such other actions as may be reasonably requested in
order more effectively to assure to the other the full beneficial use and
enjoyment of the Assets and otherwise to accomplish the purposes of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including Buyer's execution of
separate letters assuming specific contracts included in the Assets as may be
required to comply with the assignment or assumption provisions of such
contracts in lieu of furnishing a copy of this Agreement to the counterparty
to such contract.

ARTICLE 13 
TAXES

13.1 Apportionment of Taxes. Seller shall provide written evidence to Buyer
that it has paid all Taxes for periods prior to the Closing Date that are
payable prior to the Closing Date including a certificate (under Section 31.08
of the Texas Tax Code) issued by the collector of each taxing unit having
jurisdiction to impose Property Taxes on any Asset reflecting with respect to
such Asset that no delinquent taxes, penalties, interest, or costs or expenses
under Section 33.48 of the Texas Tax Code are due to any taxing unit for which
such collector collects Taxes. All Asset Taxes shall be prorated between
Seller and Buyer as of the Closing Date for all taxable periods that include
the Closing Date, and, after Closing, Seller shall be liable for all
obligations and liabilities for all Asset Taxes with respect to its interest
in the Assets that are due in periods prior to the Closing Date (to the extent
not taken into account in preparing the Settlement Statement), and Buyer shall
be liable for all obligations and liabilities for all Asset Taxes with respect
to the Assets that are due for periods on or after the Closing Date. To the
extent the actual amount of an Asset Tax is not determinable at Closing, upon
the later determination of the actual amount of such Asset Tax, timely



payments will be made from one Party to the other to the extent necessary to
cause each Party to bear the amount of such Asset Tax that is allocable to
such Party under this Section 13.1.

a. Severance Taxes based on or measured by the production of Hydrocarbons or
the value thereof shall be deemed attributable to the period when such
production occurred notwithstanding that such taxes are not assessed or
payable until a subsequent period, and liability therefor shall be allocated
to Seller for pre-Closing Date Severance Taxes and to Buyer for Severance
Taxes on the Closing Date and thereafter.

b. Property Taxes shall be deemed attributable to the period during which
ownership of the applicable Assets gives rise to liability for such Property
Taxes, and liability therefor allocated to Seller for (1) all taxable periods
ending prior to the Closing Date and (2) the portion of any Straddle Period
ending on the date before the Closing Date, and to Buyer for (x) all taxable
periods beginning on or after the Closing Date and (y) the portion of any
Straddle Period beginning on the Closing Date. Property Taxes with respect to
a Straddle Period shall be allocated pro rata per day between the portion of
such Straddle Period ending on the day before the Closing Date and the portion
of such Straddle Period beginning on the Closing Date based on the full year
ad valorem tax values applied to the Assets for calendar year 2016. The amount
of Straddle Period Property Taxes allocated to Seller shall be taken into
account as a downward adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section
3.3(b)(v).

c. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller shall
retain responsibility for, and shall bear and pay, all Income Taxes incurred
by or imposed on it, its direct or indirect owners or Affiliates, or any
combined, unitary, or consolidated group of which any of the foregoing is or
was a member, and no such Taxes shall be taken into account as adjustments to
the Purchase Price under this Agreement.

13.2 Transfer Taxes. Each of Seller and Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts and cooperate in good faith to exempt the sale and transfer
of the Assets from Transfer Taxes, including under Section 1146(a) of the
Bankruptcy Code. The Parties shall cooperate in good faith with one another in
the preparation of any Tax Returns and other related documentation with
respect to such Transfer Taxes (including any exemption certificates and forms
as each may request to establish an exemption from (or otherwise reduce) or
make a report with respect to such Transfer Taxes). If a determination is ever
made that a Transfer Tax applies, Seller and Buyer will each bear 50% of such
Transfer Tax.

13.3 Tax Reports and Returns. Except as required by applicable Law, in respect
of Asset Taxes, (i) Seller shall be responsible for the preparation and timely
filing of, and (subject to Seller's right to reimbursement by Buyer under
Section 13.1) the payment to the applicable taxing authority of all Asset
Taxes that become due and payable with respect to, (A) all Tax Returns due
prior to the Closing Date, and (B) all Tax Returns with respect to taxable
periods ending prior to the Closing Date (regardless of when due), and (ii)
Buyer shall be responsible for the preparation and timely filing of all other
Tax Returns and (subject to Buyer's right to reimbursement by Seller under
Section 13.1) the payment to the applicable taxing authority of all Asset
Taxes that become due and payable with respect to such Tax Returns. Each Party
shall indemnify and hold the other Party harmless for any failure to file such
Tax Returns and to make such payments. Buyer shall



prepare all such Tax Returns relating to any Straddle Period on a basis
consistent with past practice except to the extent otherwise required by
applicable Law.

13.4 Allocations for U.S. Federal Income Tax Purposes. Seller and Buyer agree
that the transaction under this Agreement is not subject to the reporting
requirement of Section 1060 of the Code and that, therefore, IRS Form 8594
(Asset Acquisition Statement Under Section 1060) is not required to be and
will not be filed for this transaction. In the event that any taxing authority
disagrees with that position or if the Seller and Buyer mutually agree that a
filing of Form 8594 is required, Seller and Buyer will confer and cooperate in
the preparation and filing of their respective forms to reflect a consistent
reporting of the agreed upon allocation. In the event that the allocation is
disputed by any taxing authority, the Party receiving notice of such dispute
will promptly notify and consult with the other Party and keep the other Party
apprised of material developments concerning resolution of such dispute.

13.5 Like-Kind Exchange. If Buyer elects (the "Electing Party") to accomplish
the transaction contemplated by this Agreement in a manner that will comply,
either in whole or in part, with the requirements of a like-kind exchange
pursuant to Section 1031 of the Code (a "Like-Kind Exchange"), the Electing
Party shall so notify the other Party hereto in writing, and such other Party
hereto (the "Cooperating Party") agrees to cooperate, as set forth below, with
the Electing Party in complying with the requirements under Section 1031 of
the Code to effect a Like-Kind Exchange. In the event of such an election, the
Electing Party agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the Cooperating Party
harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, causes of action,
liabilities, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and
costs of litigation, that the Cooperating Party may suffer or incur by reason
of such cooperation or Like-Kind Exchange. Buyer expressly reserves the right
to assign its rights, but not its obligations, hereunder to a Qualified
Intermediary as provided in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4) or
an Exchange Accommodation Titleholder as provided in Rev. Proc. 2000-37,
2000-2 C.B. 308 on or before the Closing. The Cooperating Party agrees to
cooperate, but at no cost, expense or risk to the Cooperating Party, and take
any actions reasonably requested by the Electing Party, to cause the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, in whole or in part, to be
consummated as and to qualify as a Like-Kind Exchange, including (a)
permitting this Agreement to be assigned to a Qualified Intermediary or
Exchange Accommodation Titleholder and (b) conveying the Assets to, or at the
direction of, the Qualified Intermediary or Exchange Accommodation
Titleholder. In no event, however, shall (i) any Like-Kind Exchange extend,
delay or otherwise adversely affect the Closing, (ii) the Cooperating Party be
required to take title to any other property in connection with such Like-Kind
Exchange, or (iii) any of the foregoing release any Party from, or modify, any
of the Parties' respective liabilities and obligations (including indemnity
obligations to each other) under this Agreement.



13.6 Cooperation. The Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably

requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and
any audit, litigation, or other proceeding with respect to Taxes relating to
the Assets. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other
Party's request) the provision of records and information that are relevant to
any such Tax Return or audit, litigation or other proceeding and making
employees



available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided under this Agreement. Seller and the
Buyer agree to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Assets relating to any taxable period beginning before the
Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations of the
respective taxable periods and to abide by all record retention agreements
entered into with any Governmental Body.



13.7 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. Except as required by
applicable Law, the Parties shall treat any indemnification payment or amount
paid pursuant to Article 14 as adjustments to the Purchase Price under this
Agreement.



ARTICLE 14 
ASSUMPTION AND RETENTION OF 
OBLIGATIONS; INDEMNIFICATION

14.1 Buyer's Assumption of Liabilities and Obligations. Except to the extent
covered by Seller's indemnification of Buyer under Section 14.2(a), upon
Closing, Buyer shall assume all claims, costs, expenses, liabilities and
obligations relating to the ownership or operation of the Assets attributable
to the period from and after the Closing Date (collectively, the "Assumed
Liabilities"), and Seller shall be exclusively and solely responsible for all
claims, costs, expenses, liabilities and obligations relating to the ownership
or operation of the Assets attributable to the period prior to the Closing
Date.

14.2 Indemnification. After the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify Seller, and
Seller shall indemnify Buyer, as follows:

a. Seller's Indemnification of Buyer. Subject to the limitations set forth
below, Seller shall indemnify, defend and save and hold harmless Buyer, its
officers, directors, members, managers, employees, representatives, attorneys
and agents (the "Buyer Indemnified Parties"), from and against any and all
Losses, whether or not involving a third party claim, attributable to or which
arise from or in connection with:

(i) (Retained Liabilities) the ownership or operation of the Assets
attributable to the period prior to the Closing Date; provided Seller shall
not have any liability for claims made under this clause (i) after three years
from the Closing Date;

(ii) (Excluded Assets) any Excluded Assets, including any Excluded Well
Incident;

(iii) (Taxes) any and all Seller Taxes; and

(iv) (Covenants and Agreements) any breach by Seller of its covenants or
agreements under this Agreement;

provided, with respect to Section 14.2(a)(ii) and (iv), subject to Section
8.9(a), (b) and (c), if Buyer is party to any operating agreement with respect
to an Excluded Well and Buyer owns a working



interest in such Excluded Well, Buyer shall be responsible for its share
(proportionate to the percentage of its working interest in such Excluded
Well) of the liabilities and costs relating solely to such Excluded Well in
accordance with the terms of such operating agreement.

b. Buyer's Indemnification of Seller. Subject to Section 14.2(a), Buyer
assumes all risk, liability, obligation and Losses in connection with, and
shall defend, indemnify, and save and hold harmless Seller, its Affiliates and
its and their respective officers, directors, shareholders, members, managers,
partners, employees, representatives, attorneys and agents (the "Seller
Indemnified Parties"), from and against any and all Losses, whether or not
involving a third party claim, attributable to or which arise from or in
connection with (i) the Assumed Liabilities, (ii) any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Buyer in this
Agreement, and (iii) any matter for which Buyer has agreed to indemnify Seller
under this Agreement. The indemnification obligations of Buyer shall survive
the Closing without any time limitation.

c. Scope. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED HEREIN, THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE INDEMNIFIED PERSON'S SOLE,
JOINT OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, GROSS NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER
FAULT.

d. Waiver of Consequential Damages. EACH PARTY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL
RIGHTS TO SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, AND LOSS OF
PROFITS RESULTING FROM BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT; provided however, that any
special, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, and loss of profits
recovered by a third party against a Party entitled to indemnity pursuant to
this Article 14 shall be included in the Losses recoverable under such
indemnity.

14.3 Procedure. The indemnification obligations contained in Section 14.2
shall be implemented as follows:

a. Coverage. Such indemnity shall extend to all Losses suffered or incurred by
the indemnified Party.

b. Claim Notice. The Party seeking indemnification under the terms of this
Agreement (the "Indemnified Party") shall submit a written "Claim Notice" to
the other Party (the "Indemnifying Party") which, to be effective, must state:
(i) the amount of each payment claimed by an Indemnified Party to be owing,
(ii) the basis for such claim, with available supporting documentation, and
(iii) a list identifying to the extent reasonably possible each separate item
of Loss for which payment is so claimed. The amount claimed shall be paid by
the Indemnifying Party to the extent required herein within 10 days after the
later of (x) receipt of the Claim Notice and (y) the date that the amount of
such payment has been finally established.

c. Notification of Claims. For third party claims, within 60 days after the
Indemnified Party receives notice of a claim or legal action that may result
in a Loss for which indemnification may be sought under this Article 14
("Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall give written notice of such Claim to
the Indemnifying Party. The failure of any Indemnified Party to



give notice of a third party claim as provided in this Section 14.3 shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Section 14.3
except to the extent such failure results in insufficient time being available
to permit the Indemnifying Party to effectively defend against the third party
claim or participate in the Proceeding or otherwise materially prejudices the
Indemnifying Party's ability to defend against the third party claim or
participate in the Proceeding. If the Indemnifying Party or its counsel so
requests, the Indemnified Party shall furnish the Indemnifying Party with
copies of all pleadings and other information with respect to such Claim. At
the election of the Indemnifying Party made within 60 days after receipt of
such notice, the Indemnified Party shall permit the Indemnifying Party to
assume control of such Claim (to the extent only that such Claim, legal action
or other matter relates to a Loss for which the Indemnifying Party is liable),
including the determination of all appropriate actions, the negotiation of
settlements on behalf of the Indemnified Party, and the conduct of litigation
through attorneys of the Indemnifying Party's choice; provided, however, that
no such settlement can result in any obligation, liability or cost to the
Indemnified Party without its consent not to be unreasonably withheld. If the
Indemnifying Party elects to assume control of a claim or legal action, (i)
any expense incurred by the Indemnified Party thereafter for investigation or
defense of the matter shall be borne by the Indemnified Party, and (ii) the
Indemnified Party shall give all reasonable information and assistance, other
than pecuniary, that the Indemnifying Party shall deem necessary to the proper
defense of such Claim, legal action, or other matter. In the absence of such
an election, the Indemnified Party will use its reasonable efforts to defend,
at the Indemnifying Party's expense, any claim, legal action or other matter
to which such other Party's indemnification under this Article 14 applies
until the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, and, if the Indemnifying
Party fails to assume such defense within the time period provided above,
settle the same in the Indemnified Party's reasonable discretion at the
Indemnifying Party's expense. If such a Claim requires immediate action, both
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party will cooperate in good faith
to take appropriate action so as not to jeopardize defense of such Claim or
either Party's position with respect to such Claim.

d. Claims between the Parties. A claim for indemnification for any matter not
involving a third party claim may be asserted by notice to the Party from whom
indemnification is sought.

14.4 Reservation as to Non-Parties. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to
limit or otherwise waive any recourse Buyer or Seller may have against any
Person not a party to this Agreement for any obligations or liabilities that
may be incurred with respect to the Assets.

14.5 Exclusive Remedy. Except with respect to Seller's fraud or willful
misconduct, the sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer with respect to the Assets
shall be pursuant to the express provisions of this Agreement. Without
limitation of the foregoing, if the Closing occurs, other than with respect to
the Excluded Assets (including any Excluded Well Incident) or Seller's fraud
or willful misconduct, the sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer for any and all:
(a) claims relating to any representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements that are contained in this Agreement or in any certificate
delivered at Closing, (b) other claims pursuant to or in connection with this
Agreement, and (c) other claims relating to the Assets and the purchase and
sale thereof, shall be any right to the limited indemnification from such
claims that is expressly provided herein and in



the Assignment, Bill of Sale and Conveyance, and if no such right of
indemnification is expressly provided herein or therein, then such claims are
hereby waived to the fullest extent permitted by Law.

14.6 Waiver of Right to Rescission. Seller and Buyer acknowledge that the
payment of money (as limited by Section 14.2 and the other provisions of this
Agreement) shall be adequate compensation for breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein or for any other claim
arising in connection with or with respect to the transactions contemplated in
this Agreement. As the payment of money shall be adequate compensation, Buyer
and Seller waive any right to rescind this Agreement, the sale of the Assets
to Buyer, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

exclusive jurisdiction of the appropriate State of Texas court located in
Harris County, Texas, or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the
federal courts in the Southern District of Texas and any appellate court from
any thereof, for the resolution of any such claim or dispute. The Parties
hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
any objection that they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of

for the maintenance of such dispute. Each Party agrees that a judgment in any
such dispute may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or
in any other manner provided by Law.

provisions of this Agreement, shall be construed in accordance with, and
governed by, the Laws of the State of Texas without regard to its conflict of

respective permitted successors and assigns.

15.15 Severability. It is the intent of the Parties that the provisions
contained in this Agreement shall be severable. Should any provision, in whole
or in part, be held invalid as a matter of law, such holding shall not affect
the other provisions of this Agreement, and such provisions that are not
invalid shall be given effect without the invalid provision.

giving such notice or taking such action (or the expiration date of such
period during which notice is required to be given or action taken) shall be
