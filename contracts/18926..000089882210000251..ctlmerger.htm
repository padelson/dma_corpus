_Qwest_ "), CENTURYTEL, INC., a Louisiana corporation (" _CenturyLink_ "), and
SB44 Acquisition Company, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary
of CenturyLink (" _Merger Sub_ ").

 

WHEREAS the Board of Directors of Qwest, the Board of Directors of
CenturyLink, and the Board of Directors of Merger Sub have approved this
Agreement, determined that the terms of this Agreement are in the best
interests of Qwest, CenturyLink or Merger Sub, as applicable, and their
respective stockholders or shareholders, as applicable, and declared the
advisability of this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS the Board of Directors of Qwest and the Board of Directors of Merger
Sub have recommended adoption or approval, as applicable, of this Agreement by
their respective stockholders, as applicable;

 

WHEREAS for U.S. Federal income Tax purposes, the Merger is intended to
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code
(the " _Intended Tax Treatment_ "), and this Agreement is intended to be, and
is adopted as, a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354, 361
and 368 of the Code; and

 

WHEREAS Qwest, CenturyLink and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties and covenants herein and intending to be legally bound, the parties
hereto agree as follows:

 

# ARTICLE I _ 
  
 The Merger_

## SECTION 1.01. _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), on the Closing Date, Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into Qwest (the " _Merger_ "). At the Effective
Time, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Qwest
shall continue as the surviving company in the Merger (the " _Surviving
Company_ ").

## SECTION 1.02. _Closing_. The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the Merger
shall take place at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51 West
52nd Street, New York, New York 10019 at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on a
date to be specified by Qwest and CenturyLink, which shall be no later than
the tenth Business Day following the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted
by Law) waiver by the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof of the
conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
(to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions), or at such other
place, time and date as shall be agreed in writing between

 

 

   

 



 

## Qwest and CenturyLink; _provided_ , _however_ , that if all the conditions
set forth in Article VII shall not have been satisfied or (to the extent
permitted by Law) waived on such tenth Business Day, then the Closing shall
take place on the tenth Business Day on which all such conditions shall have
been satisfied or (to the extent permitted by Law) waived, or at such other
place, time and date as shall be agreed in writing between Qwest and
CenturyLink. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Closing Date_."

## SECTION 1.03. _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware the certificate of merger
relating to the Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), executed and
acknowledged in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, and, as
soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date, shall make all other filings
required under the DGCL or by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at the time
that the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as Qwest and CenturyLink shall
agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes
effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").

## SECTION 1.04. _Effects_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
this Agreement and Section 259 of the DGCL.

## SECTION 1.05. _Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws_. The
certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Company until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law, except that the name of the Surviving Company shall be QWEST
COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC. The by-laws of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the by-laws of the Surviving
Company until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law, except that references to the name of Merger Sub shall be
replaced by references to the name of the Surviving Company.

## SECTION 1.06. _Directors and Officers of Surviving Company_. The
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
directors of the Surviving Company until the earlier of their resignation or
removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified,
as the case may be. The officers of Qwest immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Company until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.

# ARTICLE II _ 
  
 Effect on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Entities; Exchange of
Certificates_

## SECTION 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Qwest, CenturyLink,
Merger Sub or the holder of any shares of Qwest Common Stock or Merger Sub
Common Stock:

####

 

 

-2-   

 



 

#### (i) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, in Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub
Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into 1 fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Company with the same
rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute
the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Company. From
and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing shares of Merger
Sub Common Stock shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of
shares of common stock of the Surviving Company into which they were converted
in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

#### (ii) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and CenturyLink-Owned
Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01, of Qwest (the " _Qwest
Common Stock_ ") that is owned by Qwest as treasury stock and each share of
Qwest Common Stock that is owned by CenturyLink or Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor.

#### (iii) _Conversion of Qwest Common Stock_. Subject to Section
2.02, each share of Qwest Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance
with Section 2.01(ii)) shall be converted into the right to receive 0.1664 of
a fully paid and nonassessable share (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of CenturyLink
Common Stock (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All such shares of Qwest
Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form) that immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Qwest Common Stock (each,
a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of CenturyLink Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor and any dividends or other distributions to which
holders become entitled upon the surrender of such Certificate in accordance
with Section 2.02, without interest. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_CenturyLink Common Stock_ " means the common stock, par value $1.00 per
share, of CenturyLink. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding shares of CenturyLink
Common Stock or Qwest Common Stock shall have been changed into a different
number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or
exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then any number
or amount contained herein which is based upon the number of shares of
CenturyLink Common Stock or Qwest Common Stock, as the case may be, will be
appropriately adjusted to provide to CenturyLink and the holders of Qwest
Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior
to such event. As provided in Section 2.02(j), the right of any holder of a
Certificate to receive the Merger Consideration shall be subject to and
reduced by the amount of any withholding under applicable Tax Law.

##

 

 

-3-   

 



 

## SECTION 2.02. _Exchange of Certificates_. (a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior
to the Effective Time, CenturyLink shall appoint a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to Qwest to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange
Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration. At or prior to the
Effective Time, CenturyLink shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the
benefit of the holders of Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this
Article II through the Exchange Agent, certificates representing the shares of
CenturyLink Common Stock to be issued as Merger Consideration and cash
sufficient to make payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section
2.02(f). All such CenturyLink Common Stock and cash deposited with the
Exchange Agent is hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_."

### (b) _Letter of Transmittal_. As promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, CenturyLink shall cause the Exchange
Agent to mail to each holder of record of Qwest Common Stock a form of letter
of transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions (including customary
provisions with respect to delivery of an "agents message" with respect to
shares held in book-entry form) as CenturyLink may specify subject to Qwests
reasonable approval), together with instructions thereto.

### (c) _Merger Consideration Received in Connection with
Exchange_. Upon (i) in the case of shares of Qwest Common Stock represented
by a Certificate, the surrender of such Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, or (ii) in the case of shares of Qwest Common Stock held in
book-entry form, the receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent, in
each case together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly, completely and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of
such shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) the Merger
Consideration into which such shares of Qwest Common Stock have been converted
pursuant to Section 2.01 and (ii) any cash in lieu of fractional shares which
the holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(f) and in respect
of any dividends or other distributions which the holder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 2.02(d). In the event of a transfer of ownership
of Qwest Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of
Qwest, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of CenturyLink
Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.01 and cash in lieu of fractional shares
which the holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(f) and in
respect of any dividends or other distributions which the holder has the right
to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(d) may be issued to a transferee if the
Certificate representing such Qwest Common Stock (or, if such Qwest Common
Stock is held in book-entry form, proper evidence of such transfer) is
presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock
transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.02(c), each share of Qwest Common Stock, and any Certificate with
respect thereto, shall be deemed at any time from and after the Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration which the holders of shares of Qwest Common Stock were entitled
to receive in respect of such shares pursuant to Section 2.01 (and cash in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.02(f) and in respect of any
dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.02(d)). No interest
shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any
Certificate (or shares of Qwest Common Stock held in book-entry form).

###

 

 

-4-   

 



 

### (d) _Treatment of Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or
other distributions declared or made with respect to CenturyLink Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate (or shares of Qwest Common Stock held in book-entry
form) with respect to the shares of CenturyLink Common Stock issuable upon
surrender thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be
paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.02(f), until the surrender of
such Certificate (or shares of Qwest Common Stock held in book-entry form) in
accordance with this Article II. Subject to escheat, Tax or other applicable
Law, following surrender of any such Certificate (or shares of Qwest Common
Stock held in book-entry form), there shall be paid to the holder of the
certificate representing whole shares of CenturyLink Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the
amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of CenturyLink Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(f) and the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of
CenturyLink Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount
of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such
surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of CenturyLink Common
Stock.

### (e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Qwest Common Stock_.
The shares of CenturyLink Common Stock issued and cash paid in accordance with
the terms of this Article II upon conversion of any shares of Qwest Common
Stock (including any cash paid pursuant to subsection (f) of this Section
2.02) shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such shares of Qwest Common Stock. From and after the
Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Company of shares of Qwest Common Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing shares of Qwest Common
Stock (or shares of Qwest Common Stock held in book-entry form) are presented
to CenturyLink or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

### (f) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip
representing fractional shares of CenturyLink Common Stock shall be issued
upon the conversion of Qwest Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.01.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares
of Qwest Common Stock converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise
have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of CenturyLink Common
Stock (after taking into account all shares of Qwest Common Stock exchanged by
such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an
amount equal to such fractional amount multiplied by the last reported sale
price of CenturyLink Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_
") (as reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ or, if not reported therein, in
another authoritative source mutually selected by CenturyLink and Qwest) on
the last complete trading day prior to the date of the Effective Time (the "
_CenturyLink Closing Price_ ").

### (g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund (including any interest received with respect thereto) that
remains undistributed to the holders of Qwest Common Stock for 180 days after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to CenturyLink and any holder of Qwest
Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this Article II

 

 

-5-   

 



 

### shall thereafter look only to CenturyLink for payment of its claim for
Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends
and distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Article
II, in each case without any interest thereon.

### (h) _No Liability_. None of Qwest, CenturyLink, Merger Sub
or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion
of the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for two years after
the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which the
Exchange Fund would otherwise escheat to, or become the property of, any
Governmental Entity), shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become
the property of CenturyLink, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

### (i) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent
shall invest any cash in the Exchange Fund as directed by CenturyLink. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
CenturyLink.

### (j) _Withholding Rights_. Each of CenturyLink and the
Exchange Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Qwest Common Stock
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax Law.
Amounts so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of Qwest Common Stock in respect of which such deduction or withholding was
made.

### (k) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by CenturyLink, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable and customary amount as CenturyLink may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares and any dividends and distributions on the Certificate
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

# ARTICLE III _ 
  
 Representations and Warranties of CenturyLink and Merger Sub_

 

CenturyLink and Merger Sub jointly and severally represent and warrant to
Qwest that the statements contained in this Article III are true and correct
except as set forth in the CenturyLink SEC Documents filed and publicly
available after January 1, 2010 and prior to the date of this Agreement (the "
_Filed CenturyLink SEC Documents_ ") (excluding any disclosures in the Filed
CenturyLink SEC Documents in any risk factors section, in any section related
to forward looking statements and other disclosures that are predictive or
forward-looking in nature) or in the disclosure letter delivered by
CenturyLink to Qwest at or before the execution and delivery by CenturyLink
and Merger Sub of this Agreement (the " _CenturyLink Disclosure Letter_ ").
The CenturyLink Disclosure Letter shall be arranged in numbered and lettered
sections   corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections contained in
this Article III, and the disclosure in any section shall be deemed to qualify
other sections in this Article III to the extent (and only to the extent) that
it is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure that such
disclosure also qualifies or applies to such other sections.

## SECTION 3.01. _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of CenturyLink
and each of CenturyLinks Subsidiaries (the " _CenturyLink Subsidiaries_ ") is
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is organized (in the case of good standing, to the
extent such jurisdiction recognizes such concept), except, in the case of the
CenturyLink Subsidiaries, where the failure to be so organized, existing or in

5-percent shareholders (as defined in Section 382 of the Code and accompanying
Treasury Regulations) has increased by less than 26 percentage points over the
lowest percentage of Qwest Common Stock held by such 5-percent shareholders

Qwest Benefit Plan or trust, (vi) there has not been any "reportable event"

payment or vesting, or trigger any payment or funding, of any compensation or
benefits or trigger any other material obligation under any Qwest Benefit Plan

## SECTION 5.02. _No Solicitation by CenturyLink; CenturyLink Board

or employees or any of their respective investment bankers, accountants,
attorneys or other advisors, agents or representatives (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") to, (i) directly or indirectly solicit or initiate, or
knowingly encourage, induce or facilitate any CenturyLink Takeover Proposal or
any inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be expected to lead to a
CenturyLink Takeover Proposal or (ii) directly or indirectly participate in
any discussions or negotiations with any Person regarding, or furnish to any

may reasonably be expected to lead to a CenturyLink Takeover Proposal.
CenturyLink shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their respective
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing
discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect
to any CenturyLink Takeover Proposal, or any inquiry or proposal that may
reasonably be expected to lead to a CenturyLink Takeover Proposal, request the
prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously
furnished and immediately terminate all physical and electronic data room
access previously granted to any such Person or its Representatives.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the CenturyLink
Shareholder Approval, in response to a bona fide written CenturyLink Takeover
Proposal that the CenturyLink Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior CenturyLink Proposal, and which CenturyLink Takeover Proposal was not
solicited after the date of this Agreement and was made after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the CenturyLink Shareholders Meeting and did not
otherwise result from a breach of this Section 5.02(a), CenturyLink may,
subject to compliance with Section 5.02(c), (x) furnish information with
respect to CenturyLink and the CenturyLink Subsidiaries to the Person making

 

 

-55-   

 



 

## such CenturyLink Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives and any
financing sources) ( _provided_ that all such information has previously been
provided to Qwest or is provided to Qwest prior to or substantially concurrent
with the time it is provided to such Person) pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement with the Person making such CenturyLink Takeover
Proposal (or with one or more of its financing sources) not less restrictive
of such Person as to the use of such information than the Confidentiality
Agreement, and (y) participate in discussions regarding the terms of such
CenturyLink Takeover Proposal and the negotiation of such terms with, and only
with, the Person making such CenturyLink Takeover Proposal (and such Persons
Representatives and any financing sources). Without limiting the foregoing,
it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section
5.02(a) by any Representative of CenturyLink or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates shall constitute a breach of this Section 5.02(a) by CenturyLink.

### (b) Except as set forth below, neither the CenturyLink Board
nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in any manner
adverse to Qwest), or propose publicly to withdraw (or modify in any manner
adverse to Qwest), the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability
by the CenturyLink Board or any such committee thereof with respect to this
Agreement or (B) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly
to approve, recommend or declare advisable, any CenturyLink Takeover Proposal
(any action in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _CenturyLink Adverse

_Acquisition Agreement_ ") constituting or related to, or that is intended to
or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any CenturyLink Takeover Proposal,
or requiring, or reasonably expected to cause, CenturyLink or Merger Sub to
abandon, terminate, delay or fail to consummate, or that would otherwise
impede, interfere with or be inconsistent with, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or requiring, or reasonably
expected to cause, CenturyLink or Merger Sub to fail to comply with this
Agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section
5.02(a)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the
CenturyLink Shareholder Approval, the CenturyLink Board may make a CenturyLink
Adverse Recommendation Change if the CenturyLink Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that CenturyLink shall not be entitled to exercise its right to
make a CenturyLink Adverse Recommendation Change until after the fifth
Business Day following Qwests receipt of written notice (a " _CenturyLink
Notice of Recommendation Change_ ") from CenturyLink advising Qwest that the
CenturyLink Board intends to take such action and specifying the reasons
therefor, including in the case of a Superior CenturyLink Proposal, the terms
and conditions of any Superior CenturyLink Proposal that is the basis of the
proposed action by the CenturyLink Board (it being understood and agreed that
any amendment to any material term of such Superior CenturyLink Proposal shall
require a new CenturyLink Notice of Recommendation Change and a new five
business-day period). In determining whether to make a CenturyLink Adverse
Recommendation Change, the CenturyLink Board shall

### take into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by

conditions of any such CenturyLink Takeover Proposal (including any changes
thereto) and the identity of the person making any such CenturyLink Takeover
Proposal. CenturyLink shall (x) keep Qwest informed in all material respects
and on a reasonably current basis of the status and details (including any
change to the terms thereof) of any CenturyLink Takeover Proposal, and (y)
provide to Qwest as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof
copies of all correspondence and other written material exchanged between
CenturyLink or any of its Subsidiaries and any Person that describes any of

### (d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.02 shall prohibit
CenturyLink from (x) taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (y) making
any disclosure to the shareholders of CenturyLink if, in the good faith
judgment of the CenturyLink Board (after consultation with outside counsel)
failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such disclosure that
addresses or relates to the approval, recommendation or declaration of
advisability by the CenturyLink Board with respect to this Agreement or a
CenturyLink Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be a CenturyLink Adverse
Recommendation Change unless the CenturyLink Board in connection with such
communication publicly states that its recommendation with respect to this
Agreement has not changed; _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall
CenturyLink or the CenturyLink Board or any committee thereof take, or agree
or resolve to take, any action, or make any statement, that would violate
Section 5.02(b).

CenturyLink Common Stock or substantially all of the assets of CenturyLink and
the CenturyLink Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (i) on terms which the
CenturyLink Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside

may reasonably be expected to lead to a Qwest Takeover Proposal. Qwest shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives
to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or
negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Qwest
Takeover Proposal, or any inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be expected

after the date of this Agreement and was made after the date of this Agreement
and prior to the Qwest Stockholders Meeting and did not otherwise result from
a breach of this Section 5.03(a), Qwest may, subject to compliance with
Section 5.03(c), (x) furnish information with respect to Qwest and the Qwest
Subsidiaries to the Person making such Qwest Takeover Proposal (and its
Representatives and any financing sources) ( _provided_ that all such
information has previously been provided to CenturyLink or is provided to
CenturyLink prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is provided
to such Person) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement (or with one
or more of its financing sources) not less restrictive of such Person as to
the use of such information than the Confidentiality Agreement, and (y)

and the negotiation of such terms with, and only with, the Person making such
Qwest Takeover Proposal (and such Persons Representatives and any

violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.03(a) by any
Representative of Qwest or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall
constitute a breach of this Section 5.03(a) by Qwest.

### (b) Except as set forth below, neither the Qwest Board nor
any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse

Agreement, or requiring, or reasonably expected to cause, Qwest to fail to
comply with this Agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to

obtaining the Qwest Stockholder Approval, the Qwest Board may make a Qwest
Adverse Recommendation Change if the Qwest Board determines in good faith

required Consents or nonactions from such Governmental Entities and eliminate

Qwest shall be required pursuant to this Section 6.03(c) to commit to or
effect any action that is not conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger
or that would or would reasonably be expected to result in a Substantial
Detriment. If the actions taken by CenturyLink and Qwest pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence do not result in the conditions set forth in
Section 7.01(d), (e) and (f) being satisfied, then, during the term of this
Agreement, each of CenturyLink and Qwest shall jointly (to the extent

any Governmental Entity in order to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated,
overturned or terminated, including by appeal if necessary, any Legal
Restraint resulting from any suit, action or other legal proceeding that would
cause any condition set forth in Section 7.01(d), (e) or (f) not to be
satisfied; _provided_ that CenturyLink and Qwest shall

Time, the Qwest Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt
such resolutions as are necessary to effect the following:

#### (i) adjust the terms of all outstanding Qwest Stock
Options to provide that, at the Effective Time, each Qwest Stock Option
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into an
option (a " _Converted CenturyLink Option_ ") to acquire, on the same terms
and conditions as were applicable under such Qwest Stock Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time, a number of shares of CenturyLink Common Stock
determined by multiplying the number of shares of Qwest Common Stock subject
to such Qwest Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share, at a per share
exercise price determined by dividing the per share exercise price of such
Qwest Stock Option by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole
cent; _provided_ , _however_ , that each Qwest Stock Option (x) which is an
"incentive stock option" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be
adjusted in accordance with the requirements of Section 424 of the Code and
(y) shall be adjusted in a manner which complies with Section 409A of the
Code;

#### (ii) adjust the terms of all other outstanding awards under
the Qwest Stock Plans to provide that, at the Effective Time, each such award
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall represent,
immediately after the Effective Time, the right to receive, on the same terms
and conditions (other than the terms and conditions relating to the
achievement of performance goals) as were applicable under such award
immediately prior to the Effective Time, a number of shares of CenturyLink
Common Stock, rounded up to the nearest whole share, equal to the product of
(1) the applicable number of shares of Qwest Common Stock subject to such
award, multiplied by (2) the Exchange Ratio (a " _Converted Qwest Stock Award_
"); _provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that
acceleration of vesting of such award as of the Effective Time causes such
award to be settled for shares of Qwest Common Stock at the Effective Time,
such shares of Qwest Common Stock shall be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.10(c); and

#### (iii) provide that with respect to the Qwest ESPP, (A) each
purchase period through the Effective Time will be no longer than one calendar
month, (B) each purchase right under the Qwest ESPP outstanding on the day
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically suspended and
any contributions made for the then-current Offer (as defined in the Qwest
ESPP) will be applied toward the purchase of either, at CenturyLinks option,
(I) CenturyLink Common Stock, effective at or as soon as practicable following
the

 

 

-67-   

 



 

#### Effective Time, or (II) Qwest Common Stock, effective immediately prior
to the Effective Time, in which case each such share of Qwest Common Stock
shall be treated in accordance with Section 2.01(iii), and (C) the Qwest ESPP
shall terminate, effective immediately prior to the Effective Time.

### (b) At the Effective Time, CenturyLink shall assume all the
obligations of Qwest under the Qwest Stock Plans, each outstanding Converted
CenturyLink Option and Converted Qwest Stock Award and the agreements
evidencing the grants thereof. As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, CenturyLink shall deliver to the holders of Converted CenturyLink Stock
Options and Converted Qwest Stock Awards appropriate notices setting forth
such holders rights, and the agreements evidencing the grants of such
Converted CenturyLink Options and Converted Qwest Stock Awards shall continue

Stock for delivery upon exercise or settlement of the Converted CenturyLink
Options and Converted Qwest Stock Awards in accordance with this Section 6.04.

the Effective Time, CenturyLink shall file a registration statement on Form
S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate form) with respect to the shares of
CenturyLink Common Stock subject to Converted CenturyLink Options and
Converted Qwest Stock Awards and shall use its reasonable commercial efforts

provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or by-laws (or
comparable organizational documents) and any indemnification or other similar
agreements of Qwest or any of the Qwest Subsidiaries, in each case as in
effect on the date of this Agreement, shall continue in full force and effect
in accordance with their terms. From and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Company agrees that it will indemnify and hold harmless each
individual who is as of the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to
the Effective Time, a director or officer of Qwest or any of the Qwest
Subsidiaries or who is as of the date of this Agreement, or who thereafter
commences prior to the Effective Time, serving at the request of Qwest of any
of the Qwest Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another Person (the
"Qwest Indemnified Parties"), against all claims, losses, liabilities,
damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses,
including attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any
claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (including with respect to matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time (including this Agreement and the transactions and
actions contemplated hereby)), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that
the Qwest Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of Qwest or any
Qwest Subsidiary or is or was serving at the request of Qwest or any Qwest

## Subsidiary as a director or officer of another Person, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law. In the event of any such claim, action, suit
or proceeding, (x) each Qwest Indemnified Party will be entitled to
advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any such claim, action,
suit or proceeding from the Surviving Company within ten business days of
receipt by the Surviving Company from the Qwest Indemnified Party of a request
therefor; provided that any person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking, if and only to the extent required by the DGCL or the Surviving
Companys certificate of incorporation or by-laws, to repay such advances if
it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to
indemnification and (y) the Surviving Company shall cooperate in the defense
of any such matter.

### (b) In the event that the Surviving Company or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, the
Surviving Company shall cause proper provision to be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Company assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.05.

### (c) For a period of six years from and after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Company shall either cause to be maintained in effect the
current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by Qwest or its Subsidiaries or provide
substitute polices for Qwest and its current and former directors and officers
who are currently covered by the directors and officers and fiduciary
liability insurance coverage currently maintained by Qwest in either case, of
not less than the existing coverage and have other terms not less favorable to
the insured persons than the directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by Qwest with
respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the
Effective Time, except that in no event shall the Surviving Company be
required to pay with respect to such insurance policies in respect of any one
policy year more than 300% of the annual premium payable by Qwest for such
insurance for the year ending June 30, 2010 (the " _Maximum Amount_ "), and if
the Surviving Company is unable to obtain the insurance required by this
Section 6.05 it shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for the
years within such six-year period for an annual premium equal to the Maximum
Amount, in respect of each policy year within such period. In lieu of such
insurance, prior to the Closing Date Qwest may, following consultation with
CenturyLink, purchase a "tail" directors and officers liability insurance
policy and fiduciary liability insurance policy for Qwest and its current and
former directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors and
officers and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by
Qwest for up to $15 million in the aggregate, in which event the Surviving
Company shall cease to have any obligations under the first sentence of this
Section 6.05(c). The Surviving Company shall maintain such policies in full
force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

### (d) The provisions of this Section 6.05(i) shall survive
consummation of the Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and
will be enforceable by, each indemnified or insured party (including the Qwest
Indemnified Parties), his or her heirs and his or her representatives and
(iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or
otherwise.

included in the certificates described in this Section 6.07.

## SECTION 6.08. _Transaction Litigation_. CenturyLink shall give Qwest

shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Qwest shall give
CenturyLink the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any

Effective Time shall be treated as service with CenturyLink or the CenturyLink
Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding that Qwest
service shall be recognized by CenturyLink benefit plans in accordance with
the forgoing, the date of initial participation of each Continuing Employee in
any CenturyLink benefit plan shall be no earlier than the Effective Time;
further _provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not be recognized to
the extent that (i) such CenturyLink employee benefit plan does not recognize
service of similarly situated employees of CenturyLink or (ii) such
recognition would result in any duplication of benefits.

### (c) Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 6.13,
(i) nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and Qwest shall
take no action that would have the effect of requiring, CenturyLink to
continue any specific plans or to continue the employment, or any changes to
the terms and conditions of the employment, of any specific person and (ii) no
provision of this Agreement shall be construed as prohibiting or limiting the
ability of CenturyLink to amend, modify or terminate any employee benefit

analogous welfare plans of Qwest and the Qwest Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any
co-payments and deductibles paid and for out-of-pocket maximums incurred prior

payment), with the amounts of such bonuses being prorated for the portion of
2010 prior to the Effective Time if the Effective Time occurs in 2010; (ii) if
the Effective Time occurs in the first quarter of 2011, (A) target bonus
amounts will be established consistent with past practice and (B) target bonus

to, directly or indirectly, solicit for hire or hire any director-level or
more senior employee of the other party or its Subsidiaries; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing provision will not prohibit such party from (i)
hiring any such person who has not been employed by the other party during the

### (i) Nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or
shall be construed to constitute an amendment to any CenturyLink Benefit Plan

prior to or following the Effective Time.

### (j) From and after the Effective Time, CenturyLink, or the

### Section 4.19 of this Agreement and any collective bargaining agreements
entered into or amended pursuant to Section 5.01(b)(xii) of this Agreement.

### (k) Each of CenturyLink and Qwest agrees that, for purposes
of each Qwest Benefit Plan, the transactions contemplated by the Agreement
shall constitute a "change in control," "change of control" or "corporate
change," as applicable.

## SECTION 6.14. _Control of Operations_. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give CenturyLink or Qwest, directly or indirectly, the right
to control or direct the other partys operations prior to the Effective Time.

## SECTION 6.15. _Coordination of Dividends_.

dividend during any calendar quarter.

 

## SECTION 6.16. _Qwest Convertible Notes_. Qwest agrees to take all
necessary action to redeem all outstanding Qwest Convertible Notes at a
redemption price in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof,
together with accrued and unpaid interest, on November 20, 2010. If any
holder of Qwest Convertible Notes exercises its conversion rights with respect
to any such Qwest Convertible Notes, Qwest shall exercise its right to pay
cash in lieu of all "Residual Value Shares" (as defined in the supplemental
indenture governing the terms of the Qwest Convertible Notes) issuable upon
such conversion. If the Qwest Convertible Notes remain outstanding as of the
Effective Time, CenturyLink agrees to execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, by or on behalf of the Surviving Company, at or prior
to the Effective Time, one or more supplemental indentures and other
instruments required for the due assumption of the outstanding Qwest
Convertible Notes to the extent required by the terms of the Qwest Convertible
Notes.

 



 

## SECTION 6.17. _Coordination of Qwest Stock Issuances_. In the event
that at any time between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date,
Qwest anticipates issuing Qwest Common Stock, Qwest shall inform CenturyLink
and the parties shall cooperate in good faith to attempt to ensure that any
such issuance would not cause all of the holders of Qwest Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time to receive in exchange for such Qwest
Common Stock at the Effective Time a number of shares of CenturyLink Common
Stock that amount to greater than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding
CenturyLink Common Stock. If, at the Effective Time, the number of shares of
CenturyLink Common Stock to be issued to holders of Qwest Common Stock in the
Merger (" _New CenturyLink Shares_ ") would be equal to or greater than the
number of then-outstanding shares of CenturyLink Common Stock, Qwest shall,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, repurchase a sufficient number of
shares of Qwest Common Stock to cause the number of New CenturyLink Shares to
be approximately 49.9% (and in any case, less than 50%) of the shares of
CenturyLink Common Stock that would be outstanding immediately after the
Effective Time (after taking such repurchase into account). The parties
acknowledge and agree that any such repurchase shall not be a violation of
Section 5.01(b).

Agreement to an Article, a Section or an Exhibit, such reference shall be to
an Article, a Section or an Exhibit of or to this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. The table of contents, index of defined terms and headings
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Any
capitalized term used in any Exhibit but not otherwise defined therein shall
have the meaning assigned to such term in this Agreement. Whenever the words
"include", "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be
deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof",
"hereto", "hereby", "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when
used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement. The term "or" is not exclusive. The
word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a
subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if."
The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as
well as the plural forms of such terms. Any agreement, instrument or Law
defined or referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or Law as from
time to time amended, modified or supplemented, unless otherwise specifically
indicated. References to a Person are also to its permitted successors and
assigns. Unless otherwise specifically indicated, all references to "dollars"
and "$" will be deemed references to the lawful money of the United States of
America.

## SECTION 9.05. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or
Law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as either the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party or such party waives
its rights under this Section 9.05 with respect thereto. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that transactions
contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

## SECTION 9.06. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement, and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties.

Agreement, taken together with the CenturyLink Disclosure Letter and the Qwest
Disclosure Letter and the Confidentiality Agreement, (a) constitutes the

remedies.

## SECTION 9.09. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in
whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties
without the prior written consent of the other parties; _provided_ that the
rights, interests and obligations of Merger Sub may be assigned to another
wholly owned subsidiary of CenturyLink. Any purported assignment without such
consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement
will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the
parties and their respective successors and assigns.

## SECTION 9.10. _Specific Enforcement_. The parties acknowledge and agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would
not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that the parties
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of terms and provisions
of this Agreement in any court referred to in clause (a) below, without proof
of actual damages (and each party hereby waives any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement
is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor
to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy
for any such breach. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a) consents to
submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any Delaware state court or any
Federal court located in the State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises
out of this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or
defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court and (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to
this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in any court other than any Delaware state court or any Federal
court sitting in the State of Delaware.

## SECTION 9.11. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereto hereby waives,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a
trial by jury in respect of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out
of this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Each party hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent
or attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that
such party would not, in the event of any action, suit or proceeding, seek to
enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other
parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other
things, the mutual waiver and certifications in this Section 9.11.
