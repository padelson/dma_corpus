THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is entered into as of
March 28, 2007, by and among Roche Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the "Buyer"), 13 Acquisitions, Inc., a Delaware corporation and an indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Buyer (the "Transitory Subsidiary") and 454
Life Sciences Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company").

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Transitory Subsidiary
deem it advisable and in the best interests of each corporation and their
respective stockholders that an acquisition of the Company be consummated as
provided herein; and

WHEREAS, the acquisition of the Company shall be effected through a merger
(the "Merger") of the Transitory Subsidiary with and into the Company in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), as a result of which the Company shall become an
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Buyer and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Roche Diagnostics Operations, Inc., which will own Transitory Subsidiary
prior to the Effective Time.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth below, and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary and the
Company agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER 

1.1 _Effective Time of the Merger_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, prior to the Closing, the Buyer and the Company shall jointly
prepare, and immediately following the Closing the Surviving Corporation shall
cause to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, a
certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") in such form as is
required by, and executed by the Company in accordance with, the relevant
provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings required
under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or
at such later time as is established by the Buyer and the Company and set
forth in the Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time").

1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at
10:00 a.m., Eastern time, on a date to be specified by the Buyer and the
Company (the "Closing Date"), which shall be no later than the second business
day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII
(other than delivery of items to be delivered at the Closing and other than
satisfaction of those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing, it being understood that the occurrence of the Closing shall
remain subject to the delivery of such items and the satisfaction or waiver
of such conditions at the Closing), at the offices of Wilmer Cutler Pickering
Hale and Dorr LLP, 60 State Street, Boston, Massachusetts, unless another
date, place or time is agreed to in writing by the Buyer and the Company. For
purposes of this Agreement, a    business day shall be any day other than (a) a Saturday or Sunday or (b) a
day on which banking institutions in New York, New York are permitted
or required by law, executive order or governmental decree to remain closed.

1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time (a) the separate existence
of the Transitory Subsidiary shall cease and the Transitory Subsidiary shall
be merged with and into the Company (the Company following the Merger is
sometimes referred to herein as the "Surviving Corporation") and (b) the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company as in effect on the date of this
Agreement shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation, until further amended in accordance with the DGCL. In addition,
the Buyer shall cause the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation to be amended
and restated in their entirety so that, immediately following the Effective
Time, they are identical to the By-laws of the Transitory Subsidiary as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that all references to
the name of the Transitory Subsidiary therein shall be changed to refer to the
name of the Company, and, as so amended and restated, such By-laws shall be
the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation, until further amended in accordance
with the DGCL. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 259 of
the DGCL.

1.4 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_.

(a) The directors of the Transitory Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation,
each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and
By-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in
accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation.

ARTICLE II

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

2.1  _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
the capital stock of the Company or capital stock of the Transitory
Subsidiary:

(a) _Capital Stock of the Transitory Subsidiary_. Each share of the common
stock of the Transitory Subsidiary issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Buyer-Owned Stock_. All shares of
common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Company ("Company Common
Stock"), Series A Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Company
("Company Series A Preferred Stock"), Series B Preferred Stock, $0.01 par
value per share, of the Company ("Company Series B Preferred Stock"), Series
C Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Company ("Company Series
C Preferred Stock"), and Series D Preferred Stock, $0.01 par  



 

2  value per share, of the Company ("Company Series D Preferred Stock") (the
Company Series A Preferred Stock, Company Series B Preferred Stock, Company
Series C Preferred Stock and Company Series D Preferred Stock are collectively
referred so as the "Preferred Stock," and the Company Common Stock and the
Preferred Stock are collectively referred to as the "Company Stock"), that
are owned by the Company as treasury stock and any shares of Company Stock
owned by the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no payment or
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) _Conversion of Company Stock_. Subject to Section 2.5, other than shares
of Company Stock to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and
Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 2.7(a) below), each share of:

(i) Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be automatically converted into the right to receive
an amount in cash equal to the Equity Consideration (as defined below);

(ii) Company Series A Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the Equity Consideration
and (2) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon conversion
of one share of Company Series A Preferred Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time;

(iii) Company Series B Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the Equity Consideration
and (2) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon conversion
of one share of Company Series B Preferred Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time;

(iv) Company Series C Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the Equity Consideration
and (2) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon conversion
of one share of Company Series C Preferred Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time; and

(v) Company Series D Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the Equity
Consideration and (2) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of one share of Company Series D Preferred Stock immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

In each case, the per share price payable in respect of the Company Common
Stock, Company Series A Preferred Stock, Company Series B Preferred Stock,
Company Series C Preferred Stock and Company Series D Preferred Stock, as the
case may be, is referred to as the "Merger Consideration". As of the Effective
Time, all such shares of Company Stock shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
a certificate representing any such shares of Company Stock shall cease to
have any rights with  



 

3  respect thereto, except the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.1(c), upon the surrender of such
certificate in accordance with Section 2.5, without interest. The Merger
Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any
reclassification, stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company
Stock occurring (or for which a record date is established) after the date
hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following
meanings:

"Equity Consideration" means the amount (rounded to the nearest $0.00001)
equal to the quotient of:

(i) the sum of (a) the excess of the Closing Amount over the aggregate
Transaction Costs paid by the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.2(c) plus
(b) the Balance Sheet Adjustment, if positive, plus (c) the Indemnity
Adjustment, if any,

_divided by_

(ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock (other than shares of
Company Common Stock to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b))
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (assuming for these
purposes the conversion of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock into
Company Common Stock at the then applicable conversion rate for each series
of Preferred Stock and including all shares of Company Common Stock issued
upon exercise of Company Stock Options prior to the Effective Time).

The parties agree that the Balance Sheet Adjustment, if any, and the Indemnity
Adjustment, if any, will be treated, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration.

 

2.2 _Calculation of Closing Amount; Escrow Arrangements_.

(a) As promptly as practicable and in any event at least 5 business days prior
to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Buyer a certificate setting
forth a schedule of all Transaction Costs (including reasonable evidence that
such amounts represent the total amount due to each such payee).

(b) At the Effective Time, Buyer shall pay: 

(i) the Closing Amount to the Exchange Agent as provided in Section 2.5; and

(ii) $25 million (the "Escrow Amount") to an escrow agent mutually agreeable
to Buyer and Sellers Representative (the "Escrow Agent").

Prior to the Effective Time, Buyer, Sellers Representative and the Escrow
Agent shall execute and deliver an escrow agreement in a form agreed between
such parties (the  



 

4  "Escrow Agreement"). The Escrow Amount shall be held by the Escrow Agent
under the Escrow Agreement pursuant to the terms thereof until paid as
provided in Sections 2.3(e), 2.4 and 9.2(b).

(c) Prior to making any payments to holders of Company Stock, the Exchange
Agent shall deduct the aggregate Transaction Costs set forth in the
certificate delivered pursuant to Section 2.2(a) from the amount paid to it
pursuant to Section 2.2(b)(i), and pay such Transaction Costs to the parties
entitled thereto as and when such payments are due.

For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following
meanings:

"Closing Amount" means an amount equal to:

(i) $115 million; plus

(ii) the aggregate exercise price actually received by the Company in cash
upon the exercise of any Company Stock Options exercised after the date hereof
and prior to the Closing (the "Exercise Amount").

"Closing Net Debt" means (a) Debt of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
less (b) cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable
securities of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case, determined on a
consolidated basis as of the Effective Time based on the Closing Balance
Sheet.

"Closing Working Capital" means (a) current assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, less (b) the current liabilities of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, in each case, determined on a consolidated basis as of the
Effective Time based on the Closing Balance Sheet, with the following
adjustments:

(i) current assets shall exclude all cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments and marketable securities and any deferred tax assets or other
accrued balances relating to taxes; and

(ii) current liabilities shall exclude any Debt taken into account in
determining Closing Net Debt and any deferred tax liabilities or other accrued
balances relating to taxes.

"Debt" of any person means, without duplication, the sum of:

(i) all obligations of such person for borrowed money including the amount of
any recourse factored receivables;

(ii) all obligations of such person evidenced by bonds, debentures, notes or
other similar instruments;

(iii) all obligations of such person to pay the deferred purchase price of
property or services, except trade accounts payable arising in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practices;



 

5 (iv) all obligations of such person as lessee which are required to be
capitalized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in
the United States ("GAAP");

(v) all non-contingent obligations of such person to reimburse any bank or
other person in respect of amounts paid under a letter of credit or similar
instrument;

(vi) all guarantees by such person of obligations of the type referred to
above of another person;

(vii) all obligations of the type referred to above secured by a Lien on any
asset of such person, whether or not such obligation is otherwise an
obligation of such person;

(viii) all amounts due to CuraGen Corporation ("CuraGen") as of the Effective
Time;

(ix) any long-term liabilities (excluding any such liabilities related to

the employment agreements with Christopher McLeod, Peter Dacey, Michael
Egholm, Marcel Margulies, Mary Schramke, David Smith and Katherine Webster

become payable under the employment agreements with the Management Team as a

2.3 _Balance Sheet Adjustment_.

(a) As promptly as practicable, but no later than 60 days after the Effective
Time, Buyer will cause to be prepared and delivered to Sellers Representative
the Closing Balance Sheet and a certificate based on such Closing Balance
Sheet setting forth Buyers calculation of Closing Working Capital and Closing
Net Debt. The Closing Balance Sheet (the "Closing Balance Sheet") shall (x)
fairly present the financial position of the Company as of the Effective Time
in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis with the Company Balance
Sheet, (y) be prepared in accordance with accounting policies and practices
consistent with those used in the preparation of the Company Balance Sheet,
and (z) include line items substantially consistent with those in the Company
Balance Sheet.

(b) If Sellers Representative disagrees with the Closing Balance Sheet or
the Buyers calculation of Closing Working Capital or Closing Net Debt
delivered pursuant to Section 2.3(a), Sellers Representative may, within 20
days after delivery thereof, deliver a notice to Buyer disagreeing with such
calculation and setting forth its calculation of such amount and the grounds
for such disagreement. Any such notice of disagreement shall specify those
items or amounts as to which Sellers Representative disagrees, and Sellers
Representative shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts
contained in the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of Closing Working
Capital and Closing Net Debt delivered pursuant to Section 2.3(a).



 

7 (c) If a notice of disagreement shall be duly delivered pursuant to Section
2.3(b), Buyer and Sellers Representative shall, during the 15 days following
such delivery, use their best efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items
or amounts in order to determine, as may be required, the amount of Closing
Working Capital and Closing Net Debt. If Buyer and Sellers Representative
are unable to reach an agreement during such period, they shall promptly
thereafter cause independent accountants of nationally recognized standing
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and Sellers Representative (who shall not
have any material relationship with Buyer or any of the stockholders of the
Company prior to the Effective Time), promptly to review this Agreement and
the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of calculating Closing Working
Capital and Closing Net Debt, as applicable. In making such calculation, such
independent accountants shall consider only those items or amounts in the
Closing Balance Sheet or Buyers calculation of Closing Working Capital or
Closing Net Debt as to which Sellers Representative has disagreed. Such
independent accountants shall deliver to Buyer and Sellers Representative, as
promptly as practicable, a report setting forth its calculation of
the disputed amount(s), which amount(s) shall be consistent with the proviso
in the last sentence of this subsection. The cost of such review and report
shall be paid 50% by Buyer and 50% shall be deducted from the Escrow Amount.
"Final Working Capital" and "Final Net Debt" mean the Closing Working Capital
and Closing Net Debt, respectively, (i) as shown in Buyers calculation
delivered pursuant to Section 2.3(a), if no notice of disagreement
with respect thereto is duly delivered pursuant to 2.3(b); or (ii) if such a
notice of disagreement is delivered, as agreed by Buyer and Sellers
Representative or, in the absence of such agreement, as shown in the
independent accountants calculation delivered pursuant to 2.3(c); _provided_
that Final Working Capital shall not be less than the Buyers calculation
delivered pursuant to Section 2.3(a) or more than the Sellers
Representatives calculation delivered pursuant to Section 2.3(b), and Final
Net Debt shall not be more than the Buyers calculation delivered pursuant to
Section 2.3(a) or less than the Sellers Representatives calculation
delivered pursuant to Section 2.3(b).

(d) Buyer and Sellers Representative agree to cooperate and assist in the
preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of Closing
Working Capital and Closing Net Debt, including the making available to the
extent necessary of books, records and personnel.

(e) As promptly as practicable but not later than two business days after
Final Working Capital and Final Net Debt have been determined:

(i) if Final Working Capital minus $10 million minus Final Net Debt (the
"Balance Sheet Adjustment") is greater than zero, such amount shall be paid by
Buyer to Sellers Representative for distribution to the Companys
securityholders as of the Effective Time (the "Holders"); or

(ii) if the Balance Sheet Adjustment is less than zero, the absolute value of
such amount shall be paid by the Escrow Agent to Buyer.

2.4 _Indemnity Adjustment_. As promptly as practicable but not later than two
business days after the date that is 15 months after the Effective Time, the
Escrow Agent shall pay to Sellers Representative for distribution to the
Holders, an amount (the "Indemnity Adjustment") equal to the excess, if any,
of the then remaining Escrow Amount (together with  



 

8  any earnings thereon) over the sum of the amount of any Damages as to which
Buyer is entitled pursuant to Article IX but has not been paid plus the
Claim Amounts (as defined below) of all claims by Buyer for which a Claim
Notice (as defined below) has been delivered prior to the expiration of such
15 month period but has not been resolved pursuant to Article IX ("Pending
Indemnity Claims"). As promptly as practicable but not later than two
business days after any Pending Indemnity Claims have been resolved pursuant
to Article IX (on a claim-by-claim basis), the Escrow Agent shall pay to
Sellers Representative for distribution to the Holders the excess, if any,
of the Indemnity Adjustment (determined as provided above after taking account
of the then current status of all Pending Indemnity Claims) over all amounts
previously paid to the Sellers Representative in respect of the Indemnity
Adjustment.

2.5 _Exchange Fund_. The procedures for exchanging outstanding shares
of Company Stock for the consideration to be paid to the holders of such
securities in connection with Merger are as follows:

(a) _Exchange Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Buyer shall
deposit with American Stock Transfer and Trust Company or another bank or trust
company mutually acceptable to the Buyer and the Company (the "Exchange
Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of such securities for payment
through the Exchange Agent in accordance with this Section 2.5, cash in an
amount equal to the Closing Amount (the "Exchange Fund").

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly (and in any event within two business
days) after the Effective Time, the Buyer shall cause the Exchange Agent to
mail to each holder of record of a certificate which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Stock (each, a
"Certificate") a letter of transmittal in customary form that
includes instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the applicable Merger Consideration and an unconditional waiver
of any and all legal claims (contractual or otherwise) that the party
executing such letter may have against the Company other than pursuant to
this Agreement or in connection with the employment of such person by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, _provided_ that the Company shall, to the
extent practicable, implement arrangements for the delivery of such materials
at the Effective Time to all holders of Company Stock to facilitate the
payment of the applicable Merger Consideration to such stockholders as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be paid promptly in
exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to the applicable Merger
Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of this Article II in respect of the Company Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
immediately be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the
applicable Merger Consideration may be paid to a person other than the person
in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such
Certificate is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.5, each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Section 2.5.



 

9 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. All Merger Consideration
paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates evidencing shares of
Company Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been
paid in satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Stock.
From and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
shares of Company Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Stock for six months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Buyer, upon demand, and any holder
of Company Stock who has not previously complied with this Section 2.5 shall
be entitled to receive only from the Buyer payment of its claim for Merger
Consideration. In addition, any portion of the Exchange Fund which would have
been distributed to holders of Company Stock but for the fact that the shares
of Company Stock held by such holders are Dissenting Shares (as defined below)
shall be delivered to the Buyer upon demand. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Buyer shall not be liable to any holders of Company Stock for any amounts
paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Company Stock
two years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior
to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Entity) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, the property of the Buyer free and clear of any claims or interest of
any person previously entitled thereto.

(e) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted by applicable law, none of
the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary, the Company, the Surviving Corporation,
the Exchange Agent or the Escrow Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares
of Company Stock for any amount delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any person or entity such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any
other applicable state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or the Buyer, as the case may be,
such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by the Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and
(ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid
to any such person or entity in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or the Buyer, as the case
may be.

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the  



 

10  Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant
to this Agreement.

2.6 _Company Stock Plans_. Prior to the Effective Time, the vesting of all
outstanding employee or director options to purchase Common Stock ("Company
Stock Options") issued by the Company pursuant to the Companys 2000 Employee,
Director and Consultant Stock Plan, 2006 Equity Incentive Plan or otherwise
(collectively, the "Company Stock Plans") shall be accelerated such that all
outstanding Company Stock Options are exercisable in full for a specified
period of time prior to the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, each
outstanding Company Stock Option shall expire unless previously exercised.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions pursuant to
the Company Stock Plans required to give effect to the foregoing and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that all holders of Company Stock
Options are able to exercise such options prior to the Effective Time
(including but not limited to providing reasonable notice); _provided_ that
the Company shall not be under any obligation to provide financial assistance
to holders of Company Stock Options to enable such persons to exercise any
Company Stock Options.

2.7 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
shares of Company Stock held by a holder who has made a demand for
appraisal of such shares of Company Stock in accordance with the DGCL (any
such shares being referred to as "Dissenting Shares" until such time as such
holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights
under the DGCL with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into or
represent the right to receive Merger Consideration in accordance with Section
2.1, but shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a
holder of Dissenting Shares. The Company shall pay any amounts payable to
holders of Dissenting Shares in accordance with the DGCL subject to its rights
to indemnification as provided in Section 9.1(d).

(b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure
to perfect or otherwise), then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the
date of loss of such status, such shares shall automatically be converted into
and shall represent only the right to receive Merger Consideration in
accordance with Sections 2.1 and 2.5, without interest thereon, upon surrender
of the Certificate formerly representing such shares and such shares shall no
longer be Dissenting Shares.

(c) The Company shall give the Buyer: (i) prompt notice of any written demand
for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to
the DGCL, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or
instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to
the DGCL that relate to such demand; and (ii) the opportunity to participate
in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice or
instrument. The Company shall not make any payment or settlement offer prior
to the Effective Time with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument
unless the Buyer shall have given its written consent to such payment or
settlement offer.

(d) From and after the Effective Time, no shareholder who has properly
exercised and perfected appraisal rights pursuant to the DGCL shall be
entitled to vote his or her  



 

11  shares for any purpose or receive payment of dividends or distributions with
respect to his or her shares (except dividends and distributions payable
to shareholders of record at a date which is prior to the Effective Time).

2.8 _Sellers  Representative_.

(a) CuraGen shall be the representative of the holders of Company Stock as
provided herein (the "Sellers Representative"). The holders of Company Stock
by the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger authorize the
Sellers Representative (i) to take all action necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and take such actions as it may determine
pursuant to Sections 2.3 and 2.4 and Article IX hereof, (ii) to give and
receive all notices required to be given under this Agreement, and (iii) to
take any and all additional action as is contemplated to be taken by or
on behalf of the holders of Company Stock by the terms of this Agreement.

(b) All decisions and actions by the Sellers Representative, including
without limitation any agreement between the Sellers Representative and the
Buyer relating to Sections 2.3 or 2.4 or Article IX hereof, shall be binding
upon all of the holders of the Company Stock, and no holder of Company
Stock shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest
the same.

(c) The Sellers Representative shall not have any liability to any of the
parties hereto or the holders of Company Stock for any act done or omitted
hereunder as Sellers Representative while acting in good faith and in the
exercise of reasonable judgment, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the
advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. The holders
of Company Stock shall severally indemnify the Sellers Representative and
hold it harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without
gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the Sellers Representative and
arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of its
duties hereunder; _provided_ that the liability of a holder of Company Stock
to the Sellers Representative shall not exceed the total amount of the
Equity Consideration received by such holder for such holders shares of
Company Stock pursuant to this Agreement.

(d) By his, her or its approval of the Merger and this Agreement each holder
of Company Stock agrees, in addition to the foregoing, that:

(i) the Buyer shall be entitled to rely conclusively on the instructions and
decisions of the Sellers Representative as to matters relating to Sections
2.3 or 2.4 or Article IX hereof, or any other actions required or permitted to
be taken by the Sellers Representative hereunder, and no party hereunder
shall have any cause of action against the Buyer for any action taken by the
Buyer in reliance upon the instructions or decisions of the Sellers
Representative;

(ii) all actions, decisions and instructions of the Sellers Representative
shall be conclusive and binding upon all of the holders of Company Stock and
no holders of Company Stock shall have any cause of action against the
Sellers Representative for any action taken, decision made or instruction
given by the Sellers Representative under this Agreement,  



 

12  except for fraud or willful misconduct by the Sellers Representative in
connection with the matters described in this Section 2.8;

(iii) the provisions of this Section 2.8 are independent and severable, are
irrevocable and coupled with an interest and shall be
enforceable notwithstanding any rights or remedies that any holder of Company
Stock may have in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;

(iv) remedies available at law for any breach of the provisions of this
Section 2.8 are inadequate; therefore, the Buyer shall be entitled to seek
temporary and permanent injunctive relief without the necessity of proving
damages if the Buyer brings an action to enforce the provisions of this
Section 2.8; and

(v) the provisions of this Section 2.8 shall be binding upon the executors,
heirs, legal representatives, personal representatives, successor trustees and
successors of each holder of Company Stock, and any references in this
Agreement to a holder of Company Stock or the holders of Company Stock shall
mean and include the successors to the rights of the holders of Company Stock
hereunder, whether pursuant to testamentary disposition, the laws of descent
and distribution or otherwise.

ARTICLE III

The Company represents and warrants to the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary
that as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date the statements
contained in this Article III are true and correct, except as set forth herein
or in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to the Buyer and the
Transitory Subsidiary and dated as of the date of this Agreement (the
"Company Disclosure Schedule").

3.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_. The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Delaware, has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now
being conducted. The Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation and, where applicable as a legal concept, is in good standing as a
foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which the character of the
properties it owns, operates or leases or the nature of its activities makes
such qualification necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failures to
be qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company has heretofore delivered to Buyer true
and complete copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Company as currently in effect.

For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Company Material Adverse Effect"
means a material adverse effect on the business, operations, results of
operations, assets, liabilities or condition (financial or otherwise) of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than any effect
arising out of or resulting from:



 

13 (i) changes in the general economic or political conditions in the United
States or the United States financing or capital markets in general or
changes in currency exchange rates;

(ii) changes in GAAP;

Subsidiaries operate (including changes in law) and not specifically relating
to, or having a materially disproportionate effect on, the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole;

(iv) any losses of existing or prospective collaborators, customers, strategic
partners or suppliers as a result of the announcement or pendency of this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated thereby (including the
Merger);

(v) any natural disaster, sabotage, terrorism, military action or war (whether
or not declared); or 

(vi) any action required to be taken pursuant to this Agreement or at the
request of Buyer.

outstanding shares of Company Stock are owned of record by the holders and in
the respective amounts set forth on Section 3.2(b)(iii) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. The  



 

14  Company has made available to the Buyer a complete and accurate copy of the
Company Stock Plans and the forms of all stock option agreements
evidencing Company Stock Options.

(c) Except (i) as set forth in this Section 3.2 and (ii) issuance of shares of

issue, exchange, transfer, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, exchanged,
transferred, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital stock or other
equity interests of the Company or any security or rights convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for any such shares or other equity interests,

items in Sections (c)(ii)(A) and (B) being referred to collectively as the
"Company Securities"). The Company does not have any outstanding stock
appreciation rights, phantom stock, performance based equity rights or similar
equity rights or obligations. Except as set forth on Section 3.2(c) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor, to the Companys
Knowledge, any of its Affiliates (as defined below), is a party to or is bound
by any agreements or understandings with respect to the voting (including
voting trusts and proxies) or sale or transfer (including agreements imposing
transfer restrictions) of any shares of capital stock or other equity
interests of the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, the
term "Affiliate" when used with respect to any party shall mean any other
person who directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under
common control with such party.

(d) All outstanding shares of Company Stock are, and all shares of Company
Common Stock subject to issuance as specified in Section 3.2(b) above, upon
issuance on the terms and conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to
which they are issuable, will be, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable and not subject to or issued in violation of any purchase
option, call option, right of first refusal, preemptive right or subscription
right under any provision of the DGCL, the Companys Certificate of
Incorporation or By-laws or any agreement to which the Company or, to the
Companys Knowledge, any other party is a party or is otherwise bound.

(e) Except as may be set forth on Section 3.2(e) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, there are no obligations, contingent or otherwise, of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any
shares of Company Stock or the capital stock of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

3.3 _Subsidiaries_.

(a) Section 3.3 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of the date
of this Agreement, for each Subsidiary of the Company: (i) its name; (ii) the
number and type of outstanding equity securities and a list of the
holders thereof; and (iii) the jurisdiction of  



 

15  organization. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Subsidiary" means,
with respect to any party, any corporation, partnership, trust, limited
liability company or other non-corporate business enterprise in which such
party (or another Subsidiary of such party) holds stock or other ownership
interests representing (A) more that 50% of the voting power of all
outstanding stock or ownership interests of such entity or (B) the right to
receive more than 50% of the net assets of such entity available for
distribution to the holders of outstanding stock or ownership interests upon a
liquidation or dissolution of such entity.

(b) Each Subsidiary of the Company is a corporation or similar entity duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing (to the extent such concepts
are applicable) under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and
has all requisite corporate power and authority required to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now being
conducted and as proposed to be conducted. Each such Subsidiary is duly
qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing as a
foreign corporation (to the extent such concepts are applicable) in each
jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except for such failures
to be so organized, qualified or in good standing, individually or in the
aggregate, that would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(c) The Company has made available to the Buyer complete and accurate copies
of the charter, by-laws or other organizational documents of each
Subsidiary of the Company.

(d) All of the outstanding capital stock or other voting securities or equity
interests in each Subsidiary of the Company is owned by the Company, directly
or indirectly, free and clear of any Lien and free of any other limitation or
restriction (including any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise
dispose of such capital stock or other voting securities). There are no
outstanding (i) securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock or voting
securities of any Subsidiary of the Company or (ii) options or other rights to
acquire from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or other obligation of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, any capital stock, voting
securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for capital stock or
voting securities of any Subsidiary of the Company (the items in Sections
3.3(d)(i) and 3.3(d)(ii) being referred to collectively as the "Subsidiary
Securities"). There are no outstanding obligations of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any outstanding
Subsidiary Securities.

3.4 _Authority; No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_. 

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into
this Agreement and, subject to the adoption of this Agreement by the
Companys Stockholders under the DGCL and the Companys Certificate of
Incorporation (which must be approved by the holders of Company Stock
representing at least a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares
of Company Stock, voting together as a single class) (the "Company
Stockholder Approval"), to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by the Company have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action on the part of the Company, subject only to the required receipt  



 

16  of the Company Stockholder Approval. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by the Company and constitutes the valid and binding obligation
of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors rights and to general equity principles (the "Bankruptcy and

commercially reasonable efforts to furnish to each other all information
required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant to the rules
and regulations of any applicable law in connection with the transactions

and (b) the Buyer and the Company shall consult with the other party before
issuing any other press release or otherwise making any public statement with
respect to the Merger or this Agreement.

6.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the
Buyer shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall
give prompt notice to the Buyer, of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur,
of any event, which occurrence or failure to occur is reasonably likely to
cause any representation or warranty of such party contained in this  



 

39  Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, in each case
at any time from and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective
Time, (b) any material failure of the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary or
the Company, as the case may be, or of any officer, director, employee or
agent thereof, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement
to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement or (c) the
institution of or the written threat of institution of any legal proceeding

other employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as in effect at the
Effective Time; _provided_ that no individual employee shall have the right to

amended to limit what constitutes "Good Reason" under such agreement as

respective Subsidiaries who shall have been an employee of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time ("Continuing
Employees") full credit for prior service with the Company or its Subsidiaries
for purposes of (i) eligibility under any employee benefit plans and (ii)
determination of benefit levels relating to vacation or severance plans and
policies, in each case for which the Continuing Employee is otherwise eligible
and in which the Continuing Employee is offered participation, except if such
credit would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, the
Buyer shall waive, or cause to be waived, any limitations on benefits
relating to pre-existing conditions to the same extent such limitations are
waived under any comparable plan of the Company prior to the Closing Date and
use commercially reasonable efforts to recognize for purposes of annual
deductible and out-of-pocket limits under its medical and dental plans,
deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid by Continuing Employees in the
calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs. For a period of one year
following the Effective Time, Buyer shall provide the Continuing Employees who
are employed by Buyer or one of its Subsidiaries during such period with base
salary or base wages and benefits (other than equity-based compensation and
the Company Retention Plan and Senior Incentive Plan) that is in the aggregate
substantially equivalent to such salary or wages and benefits as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

indemnified pursuant to Article IX, Buyer, and the Company, after the

remediation or any other action required by the CTA or the CDEP at any
Connecticut Property; _provided_ that Buyer will (i) upon request by the
Sellers Representative, provide to the Sellers Representative all material
documents it possesses relating to such investigation, remediation or action
and (ii) give the Sellers Representative reasonable advance notice of, and
the right to participate in, any of its material discussions or negotiations
with any Governmental Entity concerning such investigation, remediation or
action.

for the purpose of satisfying such conditions, and _provided_ that the right
to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(c) shall not be available

jurisdiction shall have issued a nonappealable final order, decree or

8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement as
provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall immediately become void and

ARTICLE IX

INDEMNIFICATION

9.1 _Damages_. Subject to the terms and conditions of Section 2.4 and this
Article IX, from and after the Effective Time, the Buyer shall, to the extent
of the Escrow Amount, be indemnified in respect of and held harmless against
any and all liabilities, damages, losses, fines, fees, penalties, costs and
expenses (including without limitation reasonable expenses of investigation
and reasonable attorneys fees) (collectively, "Damages") incurred or suffered
by the Buyer, any Affiliate of the Buyer, the Company, any Subsidiary of the
Company or any of their respective successors and assignees resulting from or
constituting:

(a) any breach of a representation or warranty of the Company contained in
this Agreement (determined without regard to any qualification or exception
contained therein relating to materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect
or any similar qualification or standard);

(b) any failure by the Company to perform any covenant or agreement contained
in this Agreement;

(c) compliance with the CTA, including any costs or expenses relating to any
investigation or remediation required by the CTA or the CDEP (except to the
extent such Damages were paid by the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.2(c)
or deducted in calculating Final Net Debt);

(d) any documented costs incurred by the Buyer or the Company with respect to
any demands for appraisal as contemplated by Section 2.7 and any amounts paid
to a holder of Company Stock who has made a demand for appraisal in excess of
the Merger Consideration which would otherwise have been receivable by such
holder; or

(e) any unpaid Transaction Costs that were not deducted in calculating Final
Net Debt,  



 

45  regardless of whether such Damages arise as a result of negligence, strict
liability or any other liability under any theory of law or equity.

9.2 _Claims_.

(a) _Third Party Claims_. All claims for indemnification made under this
Agreement resulting from, related to or arising out of a third-party claim
shall be made in accordance with the following procedures. The Buyer shall
give prompt written notification to the Sellers Representative of the
commencement of any action, suit or proceeding relating to a third party claim
for which indemnification may be sought or, if earlier, upon the assertion of
any such claim by a third party; _provided, however,_ that failure to provide
such notice to the Sellers Representative shall not eliminate the Buyers
right to indemnification, except to the extent the Holders are materially and
adversely prejudiced thereby. Such notification shall include a description
in reasonable detail (to the extent known by the Buyer) of the facts
constituting the basis for such third party claim and the amount of the
Damages claimed. Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.8, within 30 days
after delivery of such notification, the Sellers Representative may, upon
written notice thereof to the Buyer, assume control of the defense of such
action, suit, proceeding or claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
the Buyer so long as the economic risk of the Holders is greater than that of
the Buyer. If the Sellers Representative does not assume control of such
defense, the Buyer shall control such defense. The party not controlling such
defense may participate therein at its own expense, provided that if the
Sellers Representative assumes control of such defense and the Buyer
reasonably concludes, based on advice from counsel, that the Holders and the
Buyer have conflicting interests with respect to such action, suit,
proceeding or claim, the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Buyer
solely in connection therewith shall be considered "Damages" for purposes of
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Buyer be
indemnified for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel. The party
controlling such defense shall keep the other party advised of the status of
such action, suit, proceeding or claim and the defense thereof and shall
consider recommendations made by the other party with respect thereto. Neither
party may agree to any settlement of such action, suit, proceeding or claim
without the prior written consent of the other party, such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_ that the Sellers
Representative may agree to such settlement without such consent if there are
no Damages as to which the Buyer is entitled pursuant to this Article IX which
have not been paid, there are no Pending Indemnity Claims and the period
within which the Buyer is entitled to deliver a Claim Notice has expired. The
Sellers Representative shall not agree to any settlement of such action,
suit, proceeding or claim that does not include a complete release of the
Buyer (or, if relevant, the Company) from all liability with respect thereto.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Sellers
Representative will be entitled to control the defense of any demand for
appraisal so long as Sellers Representative complies with all the
requirements of this Section 9.2(a) and considers in good faith all reasonable
recommendations made by the Buyer with respect thereto.

(b) _Procedure for Claims_. If the Buyer wishes to assert a claim for
indemnification under this Article IX, the Buyer shall deliver to
the Sellers Representative a written notice (a "Claim Notice") which
contains (i) a description and the amount (the "Claim Amount") of any Damages
incurred by the Buyer and (ii) a statement that the Buyer is entitled to
indemnification under this Article IX and a reasonable explanation of the
basis therefor.  



 

46  Within 30 days after delivery of a Claim Notice, the Sellers Representative
shall deliver to the Buyer a written response in which the
Sellers Representative shall: (A) agree that the Buyer is entitled to
receive all of the Claim Amount, (B) agree that the Buyer is entitled to
receive part, but not all, of the Claim Amount (the "Agreed Amount"), or (C)
contest that the Buyer is entitled to receive any of the Claim Amount. If the
Sellers Representative in such response contests the payment of all or part
of the Claim Amount, the Sellers Representative and the Buyer shall use good
faith efforts to resolve such dispute. If such dispute is not resolved within
60 days following the delivery by the Sellers Representative of such
response, the Sellers Representative and the Buyer shall each have the right
to submit such dispute to a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance
with the provisions of Section 10.10. As promptly as practicable but not later
than two business days after the date on which it has been determined that the
Buyer is entitled to be paid any amount pursuant to this Article IX, the
Escrow Agent shall pay such amount to the Buyer.

9.3 _Survival_. 

(a) The representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and continue until 15 months after the Effective Time, at
which time they shall expire.

(b) If an indemnification claim is properly asserted in writing pursuant to
Section 9.2 prior to the expiration as provided in Section 9.3(a) of the
representation or warranty that is the basis for such claim, then such
representation or warranty shall survive until, but only for the purpose of,
the resolution of such claim.

9.4 _Limitations_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,

(i) no individual claim (or series of related claims) for indemnification
under this Article IX shall be valid and assertable unless it is (or they
are) for an amount in excess of $50,000;

(ii) the aggregate Damages under this Article IX shall not exceed the Escrow
Amount and the Buyer is not entitled to any recovery of Damages from the
Holders other than pursuant to the Escrow Amount; and

(iii) the Buyer shall not be indemnified for Damages under Section 9.1(a)
(excluding any claims disallowed under Section 9.4(a)(i)) until such Damages,
in the aggregate, exceed $1,000,000, in which case, Buyer shall be entitled
to be indemnified for the full amount of such Damages.

(b) The amount of Damages recoverable under this Article IX with respect to
an indemnity claim shall be reduced by the amount of any payment received by
the Buyer or any of its Affiliates, with respect to the Damages to which such
indemnity claim relates, from an insurance carrier under an insurance policy
held by the Company as of the Effective Time (or as such policy may be
renewed, extended or modified at no cost to the Buyer or the Company).  



 

47  The Buyer shall use reasonable commercial efforts to pursue, and to cause
its Affiliates to pursue, all such insurance claims, and the Parties
shall cooperate with each other in pursuing such claims. If the Buyer (or an
Affiliate) receives any such insurance payment in connection with any claim
for Damages for which it has already received an indemnification payment under
this Article IX, it shall pay to Sellers Representative for distribution to
the Holders, within 30 days, the amount of the excess, if any, of the sum of
such insurance payment and the amount previously received by the Buyer under
this Article IX with respect to such claim over the amount of Damages
incurred with respect to such claim.

(c) Except with respect to claims for equitable relief made with respect to
breaches of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, (i) the
rights of the Buyer under this Article IX shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Buyer and its Affiliates with respect to claims under,
or otherwise relating to the transactions that are the subject of, this
Agreement and (ii) the Escrow Amount shall be the sole and exclusive means for
the Buyer to collect any Damages for which it is entitled to indemnification
under this Article IX or otherwise in connection with the transactions that
are the subject of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, in no event shall any party, its successors or permitted assigns be
entitled to claim or seek rescission of the transactions consummated by this
Agreement.

(d) The Sellers Representative shall have full power and authority on behalf
of each Holder to take any and all actions on behalf of, execute any and all
instruments on behalf of, and execute or waive any and all rights of, the
Holders under this Article IX. The Sellers Representative shall have no
liability to any Holders for any action taken or omitted on behalf of the
Holders pursuant to this Article IX.

Any party to this Agreement may give any notice or other communication
hereunder using any other means (including personal delivery, messenger
service, telex, ordinary mail or electronic mail), but no such notice or other
communication shall be deemed to have been duly given unless and until it
actually is received by the party for whom it is intended. Any party to this
Agreement may change the address to which notices and other communications
hereunder are to be delivered by giving the other parties to this Agreement
notice in the manner herein set forth.

10.2 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Schedules and Exhibits
hereto and the documents and instruments referred to herein that are to be
delivered at the Closing) constitutes the entire agreement among the parties
to this Agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any
prior understandings, agreements or representations by or  



 

49  among the parties hereto, or any of them, written or oral, provided that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its
terms. 

10.3 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except for the rights of the Holders to
receive after the Effective Time the payments to which they are entitled
under Article II, this Agreement is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to
confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the parties hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns, to create
any agreement of employment with any person or to otherwise create any third-
party beneficiary hereto.

10.4 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such assignment
without such prior written consent shall be null and void, except that the
Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary may transfer or assign its rights and
obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in part,
to (i) one or more of their Affiliates at any time and (ii) after the
Effective Time, to any person; _provided_ that such transfer or assignment
shall not relieve the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary of its obligations
hereunder or enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any other party
hereto or due to the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns.

10.5 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid
or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In
the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior
sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or
provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term.

10.6 _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by
facsimile or other electronic transmission.

10.7 _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement to an Article
or a Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of this
Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, table of defined
terms and headings contained in this  



 

50  Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The language used in
this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties
hereto to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction
shall be applied against any party. Whenever the context may require, any
pronouns used in this Agreement shall include the corresponding masculine,
feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of nouns and pronouns shall
include the plural, and vice versa. Any reference to any federal, state, local
or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise.
Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." No summary of this Agreement prepared by any party shall affect
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

10.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of Delaware.

10.9 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such
party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

10.10  _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties to this Agreement
(a) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any state or
federal court located in the State of Delaware in any action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in respect of such
action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court, (c) agrees
that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by
motion or other request for leave from any such court, and (d) agrees not to
bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any other court.
Each of the parties hereto waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety
or other security that might be required of any other party with respect
thereto. Any party hereto may make service on another party by sending or
delivering a copy of the process to the party to be served at the address and
in the manner provided for the giving of notices in Section 10.1. Nothing
in this Section 10.10, however, shall affect the right of any party to serve
legal process in any other manner permitted by law.

10.11  _Disclosure Schedules_. The Company Disclosure Schedule and the Buyer
Disclosure Schedule shall each be arranged in Sections corresponding to the
numbered Sections  



 

51  contained in Article III, in the case of the Company Disclosure Schedule, or
Article IV, in the case of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, and the disclosure
in any Section shall qualify (a) the corresponding Section in Article III or
Article IV, as the case may be, and (b) the other Sections in Article III or
Article IV, as the case may be, to the extent that it is reasonably apparent
from a reading of such disclosure that it also qualifies or applies to such
other Sections. The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure
Schedule or the Buyer Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to be an
admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself, that such information is
required by the terms hereof to be disclosed, is material, has resulted in or
would result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Buyer Material Adverse
Effect, or is outside the ordinary course of business.

10.12 _Company s Knowledge_. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Companys Knowledge" means the actual knowledge of the individuals
identified in Schedule 10.12 to the Company Disclosure Schedule after
reasonable inquiry.
