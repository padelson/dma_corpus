ARTICLE I

_THE MERGER_

 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective
Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, and the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, and the Company shall
be the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of Kirkland and Ellis LLP, 601 Lexington Avenue, New
York, New York 10022 at 10:00 a.m. (local time) on the date that is two (2)
Business Days following the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by
applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable
Law) of those conditions at such time), or such other date, time or place is
agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. The date on which the Closing
occurs is referred to herein as the "Closing Date."

 

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, on
the Closing Date the parties hereto shall file with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware a certificate of merger, executed in accordance with,
and in such form as is required by, the relevant provisions of the DGCL with
respect to the Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") and shall make all
other filings or recordings required under the DGCL to be made on the Closing
Date in connection with the Transactions. The Merger shall become effective
upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger or at such later time as
is agreed to by the parties hereto and specified in the Certificate of Merger
(the time at which the Merger becomes effective being referred to herein as
the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

Section 1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation_. At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time to be in the form of
(except with respect to the name of the Company (which shall be "Furiex
Pharmaceuticals, Inc.") and any changes necessary so that they shall be in
compliance with _Section 5.8_) the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
Merger Sub as of the date hereof and as so amended shall be the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended
as provided therein or by applicable Law (and subject to _Section 5.8_).

 



2 Section 1.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_.

 

(a) Each of the parties hereto shall take all necessary action to cause the
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time to be the

qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with
the DGCL and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation.

(b) The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors
are duly appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the DGCL and the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

ARTICLE II __

 

 _EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK_

 

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or the holder of any shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of
the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") or any shares of capital stock of
Merger Sub:

 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub._ Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(b)  _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock._ Any shares of
Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock, and any
shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent or of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock._ Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares to be canceled in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and Dissenting
Shares) shall thereupon be converted automatically into and shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive (i) an amount in cash equal to $95.00
without interest (the " _Cash Consideration_ ") and (ii) one contractual
contingent value right (a " _CVR_ "), which shall represent the right to
receive a contingent payment upon the achievement of one of certain
milestones set forth in, and subject to and in accordance with the terms and
conditions of, the CVR Agreement (the " _CVR Consideration_ ", and together
with the Cash Consideration, collectively, the " _Merger Consideration_ ").
As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and the holders immediately prior to the Effective Time of shares of
Company Common Stock not represented by certificates (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ")
and the holders of certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_
") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except only the right
to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor upon
surrender of such Book-Entry Share or Certificate in accordance with _Section
2.2(b)_ without interest (subject to any applicable withholding Taxes).

 



3 Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent._ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange
Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging shares of Company Common Stock for the
Merger Consideration and enter into a customary agreement reasonably
acceptable to the Company with the Exchange Agent relating to the services to
be performed by the Exchange Agent. Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, (i) with the Exchange Agent, at or prior to the Effective Time,
funds in an amount equal to the aggregate Cash Consideration (the "
_Exchange Fund_ ") and (ii) with the Rights Agent, when required pursuant to
the terms of the CVR Agreement, funds in an amount equal to the aggregate CVR
Consideration, in each case, payable in accordance with _Section 2.1(c)_
to holders of Company Common Stock. The Exchange Fund deposited with the
Exchange Agent shall, pending its disbursement to such holders, be invested by
the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent. Any interest and other income from
such investments shall be payable to Parent. No investment by the Exchange
Agent of the Exchange Fund shall relieve Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent from making the payments required by this _Article II_ and
Parent shall promptly replace any funds deposited with the Exchange Agent
lost through any investment made pursuant to this _Section 2.2(a)_. No
investment by the Exchange Agent of the Exchange Fund shall have maturities
that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement.
Following the Effective Time, Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange
Agent, from time to time as needed, additional cash to pay the Cash
Consideration as contemplated by this _Article II_ without interest. At or
prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Rights Agent shall enter into the
CVR Agreement.

(b) _Payment Procedures._  Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event
more than five (5) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of Company Common
Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which, in the case of shares of Company
Common Stock represented by Certificates, shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or, in the
case of Book-Entry Shares, receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange
Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may
reasonably request), together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions (and such other
customary documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent),
the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor, subject to any required withholding Taxes, the
Merger Consideration, without interest, for each share of Company Common Stock
surrendered, and any Certificates surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. If
payment of the Merger Consideration (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
payment in the form of or with respect to the CVRs) is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry
Share in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of payment
that (A) the

 



4  Person requesting such exchange present proper evidence of transfer or such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and (B) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share surrendered or shall have established to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been
paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section_ 2.2, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Article II_ , without interest.
No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any cash payable to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this _Article
II_.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock._ The
Merger Consideration paid in respect of shares of Company Common Stock upon
the surrender for exchange of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares in accordance
with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
theretofore represented by such Certificates or book entries, and at the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
that evidenced ownership of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such shares of Company Common Stock other than the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, except as otherwise provided by applicable
Law. If, at any time after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall
be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_ , except as
otherwise provided by applicable Law.

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will, subject to such Persons compliance with the exchange
procedures set forth in _Section 2.2(b)_, pay, in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be
paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by
such Certificate, as contemplated by this _Article II_.

(e) _Termination of Fund._ At any time following the first (1st) anniversary
of the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require
the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest or other
income received with respect thereto) that had been made available to the
Exchange Agent and which have not been disbursed in accordance with this
_Article II_ , and thereafter Persons entitled to receive payment pursuant to,
and who have not theretofore complied with, this _Article II_  shall be
entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with
respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration that may be payable 

 



5  upon surrender of any Company Common Stock held by such holders, as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders immediately prior to such time at
which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(f) _No Liability._ Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Company
or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

(g) _Withholding Taxes._ Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the
contrary, each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to
this Agreement (including upon the issuance of, or payment with respect to,
the CVRs) such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
(the " _Code_ "), or under any applicable provision of state, local or
foreign Law related to Taxes. To the extent amounts are so deducted and
withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority responsible
for the Taxes, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made. If any withholding obligation may be
avoided by the provision of customary withholding certificates or similar
documentation, Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to request such certificates or documentation
from the applicable holders in the instructions contemplated by _Section
2.2(b)(ii)_.

 

Section 2.3 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time which are held by a stockholder who
did not vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement (or consent thereto in
writing) and who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
shares pursuant to, and complies in all respects with, the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") shall not be
converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the
Merger Consideration (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), but instead such
Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to receive such consideration as may
be determined to be due to such Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to Section 262
of the DGCL (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and such Dissenting Stockholder shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the rights set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL),
unless and until such Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or
shall have effectively withdrawn or lost rights to appraisal under the DGCL.
If any Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost such right, such Dissenting Stockholders shares
of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be treated as if they had been
converted into and become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the
Effective Time, the Merger Consideration for each such share of Company Common
Stock, in accordance with _Section 2.1_, without any interest thereon and
less any applicable withholding Taxes. The Company shall give Parent prompt
notice of any written demands for appraisal of any shares of

 



6  Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating
to stockholders rights of appraisal, and Parent shall have the right to
participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or

(a) As soon as practicable following the date hereof (and, in any event, prior
to the Effective Time), the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee
thereof administering the Company Stock Plans) shall take all actions as may
be required to provide that (i) each holder of an option that represents the
right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not then
vested or exercisable) (each, an " _Option_ ") shall be provided with notice
pursuant to which all outstanding Options held by such holder shall become
fully vested and may be exercised (contingent on the consummation of the
Merger) by such holder beginning on the date of such notice through the date
that is five (5) Business Days prior to the Effective Time in accordance with
the terms and conditions of the applicable Company Stock Plan under which
such Option was granted and (ii) to the extent that any outstanding Option is
not so exercised on or prior to the Effective Time, such Option shall, at the
Effective Time, be canceled and terminated in exchange for (A) an amount in
cash equal to the product of (I) the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to the Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
_multiplied by_ (II) the excess, if any, of the per share Cash Consideration
_over_ the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock under such Option
and (B) one CVR _multiplied by_ the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to the Option (assuming full vesting of the Option) had the
holder exercised such Option in full immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock issued pursuant to any Company Stock
Plan that is subject to specified vesting criteria (each, a share of "
_Restricted Stock_ ") and is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall at the Effective Time become fully vested and all restrictions
thereon shall lapse, and each such share of Restricted Stock shall be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance
with _Section 2.1_, subject to the procedures, terms and
conditions applicable to shares of Company Common Stock under this Agreement.

(c) Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the contrary, each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this _Section
2.4_ to any holder of Options and shares of Restricted Stock (including upon
the issuance of, or payment with respect to, the CVRs) such amounts as may be
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any applicable provision of state, local or foreign
Law related to Taxes, and the Surviving Corporation shall make any required
filings with and payments to the appropriate Governmental Authorities relating
to any such deduction or withholding for Taxes. To the extent that amounts are
so deducted and withheld and paid over to the appropriate

 



7  Governmental Authority responsible for the Taxes, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of Options or Restricted Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

(d) At or as soon after the Effective Time as shall be reasonably
practicable, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to the
Surviving Corporation all funds necessary to fulfill the obligations under
this _Section 2.4_. All payments required under this _Section 2.4_ shall be
made, without interest, as soon after the Effective Time as shall be
reasonably practicable.

Section 2.5 _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this
Agreement, if at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock,
or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of
capital stock, of the Company shall occur, including as a result of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock
split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, merger, issuer
tender or exchange offer, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a
record date during such period, but excluding any change that results from any
issuance of shares of capital stock permitted by _Section 5.1(a)(i)_, the
Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing in this _Section 2.5_ shall be deemed to permit or authorize any
party hereto to effect any such change that it is not otherwise authorized or
permitted to undertake pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 2.6 _Tax Treatment_. Except to the extent any portion of the Milestone
Payment (as such term is defined in the CVR Agreement) is required to be
treated as imputed interest pursuant to applicable Law, the recipients of the
CVRs and the parties hereto agree to treat the CVRs and the Milestone Payment
for all Tax purposes as additional consideration for the shares of Company
Common Stock, Options and shares of Restricted Stock pursuant to the Merger
Agreement and none of the beneficial owners of Company Common Stock,
Restricted Stock or any Option and the parties hereto will take any position
to the contrary on any Tax Return or for other Tax purposes except as required
by applicable Law. Parent and the Company shall report imputed interest on the
CVRs pursuant to Section 483 of the Code.

standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted
by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned, leased

on the rights of the Company to amend or terminate any Company Plan, or (vi)
entitle the recipient of any payment or benefit to receive a "gross up"

opportunity to participate in the Companys response to those comments and to
provide comments on such response (to which reasonable and good faith
consideration shall be given), including, to the extent reasonably
practicable, by participating with the Company or its counsel in any
discussions or meetings with the SEC. The Company and Parent shall cooperate
with one another (i) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or
additional filings with, the SEC is required in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions and (ii) in taking such actions or making any
such filings, furnishing information required in connection therewith and
seeking timely to obtain any such actions or make such filings. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate with the Company in connection with the
preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement, including promptly furnishing
to the Company in writing upon request any and all information relating to
it as may be required to be set forth in the Proxy Statement under applicable
Law. Parent agrees that such information supplied by it in writing for
inclusion (or incorporation by reference) in the Proxy Statement will not, on
the date it is first mailed to stockholders of the Company and at the time of
the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. If, at any time
prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to Parent or its
Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by Parent which
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so
that the Proxy Statement would not include any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, Parent shall promptly notify the Company so that it may file with
the SEC an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information
and, to the extent required by Law, disseminate such amendment or supplement
to the stockholders of the Company.

(b) The Company shall, as soon as reasonably possible after the SEC confirms
that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement or that the Company may
commence mailing the Proxy Statement for the purpose of voting on the approval
and adoption of this Agreement, in accordance with applicable Law, the
Company Charter Documents and the NASDAQ rules, duly give notice of, convene
and hold a meeting of its stockholders to consider the adoption of this
Agreement and such other matters as may be then legally required (including
any adjournment or postponement thereof, the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_
"). Any adjournment, delay or postponement of the Company Stockholders Meeting
shall require the prior written consent of Parent; _provided,_ _however_ ,
that the Company shall be permitted to adjourn, delay or postpone the Company
Stockholders Meeting without such consent of Parent (i) for the absence of a
quorum or (ii) after consultation with Parent, solely to the extent necessary
to allow reasonable additional time for any supplemental or amended
disclosure which the Company has determined in good faith (after consultation
with outside legal counsel) is necessary under applicable Law and for such
supplemental or amended disclosure to be 

 



36  disseminated and reviewed by the Companys stockholders prior to the Company
Stockholders Meeting. Parent may require the Company to adjourn, delay or
postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting once for a period not to exceed
thirty (30) calendar days (but prior to the date that is two (2) Business Days
prior to the End Date) to allow additional solicitation of votes in order to
obtain the Company Stockholder Approval. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the date hereof, the Company shall, in accordance with applicable
Law, the Company Charter Documents and the NASDAQ rules, establish a record
date for the Company Stockholders Meeting. Without the prior written consent
of Parent, the adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (including the Merger) shall be the only matter (other than matters of
procedure and matters required by applicable Law to be voted on by
the Companys stockholders in connection with the adoption of this Agreement
and the Transactions) that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the
Companys stockholders at the Company Stockholders Meeting. Unless a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) solicit from the Companys stockholders proxies
in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and (ii) obtain the Company
Stockholder Approval.

(c) The Company shall, through the Company Board (or a duly authorized
committee thereof), but subject to the right of the Company Board to make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section 5.3_, (i)
recommend to its stockholders that the Company Stockholder Approval be given
(the " _Company Board Recommendation_ "), and (ii) include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement.

(d) Notwithstanding (i) any Company Adverse Recommendation Change, (ii) the
public proposal or announcement or other submission to the Company or any of
its Representatives of a Takeover Proposal or (iii) anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its
terms, the obligations of the Company under this _Section 5.2_ shall continue
in full force and effect.

 

Section 5.3 _No Solicitation; Change in Recommendation_.

 

(a) The Company agrees that it shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its
and their respective directors, officers and employees to, and shall direct
and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries
respective other Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any and all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person
and its Representatives conducted heretofore with respect to any Takeover
Proposal and shall promptly request that any such Person (and its
Representatives) in possession of confidential information heretofore
furnished by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (and all
analyses and other materials prepared by or on behalf of such Person that
contains, reflects or analyzes that information) to return or destroy all such
information as promptly as reasonably practicable and in accordance with the
terms of any confidentiality or similar agreement in place with such Person.
At all times from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to  _Section 7.1_, the Company shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors, officers and employees
not to, and shall direct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and
its Subsidiaries respective other Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or take any action to encourage or
facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) any

 



37  inquiries or the submission of any proposal that constitutes any Takeover
Proposal or the making or consummation thereof; (ii) enter into, continue or
otherwise participate in any discussions (except to notify such Person of the
existence of the provisions of this _Section 5.3_) or negotiations regarding,
or furnish to any Person any information or data relating to, afford access to
the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries in connection with, or for the purpose of encouraging or
facilitating, any Takeover Proposal; (iii) approve any transaction under, or
any Person becoming an "interested stockholder" under, Section 203 of the
DGCL, or (iv) enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term
sheet, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other
similar instrument providing for a Takeover Proposal.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of its or their respective Representatives,
receives an unsolicited written Takeover Proposal made after the date hereof
in circumstances not involving a material breach of this  _Section 5.3_, the
Company, the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) and their
Representatives may at any time prior to the receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval engage in negotiations and discussions with, or furnish
any information and other access to, any Person making such Takeover Proposal
and any of its Representatives if the Company Board reasonably determines in
good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal and
financial advisors, that such Takeover Proposal is or could reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and with respect to which the Company
Board reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys outside legal advisors, that the failure to take such action would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
Company Board under applicable law; _provided_ that (i) at least forty-eight
(48) hours prior to entering into such negotiations or discussions with or
furnishing any such information or access to, any such Person, the Company
provides written notice to Parent of the identity of such Person and of the
Companys intention to enter into negotiations or discussions with, or
furnish information or other access to such Person, and the Company receives
from the Person making such Takeover Proposal an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement, and (ii) the Company concurrently furnishes all such written
information and access, and a summary of all such material non-written
information, provided to such Person to Parent (to the extent such information
or access has not been previously furnished or made available by the Company
to Parent or Parents Representatives). The Company shall provide Parent with
an accurate and complete copy of any Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
entered into pursuant to this _Section 5.3(b)_ within forty-eight (48) hours
of execution thereof. The Company will promptly (and in any event no later
than forty-eight (48) hours after receipt thereof) notify Parent, in writing,
of the receipt of such Takeover Proposal, or any inquiry, proposal or offer
that expressly provides for or could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Takeover Proposal, and shall, in any such notice to Parent, identify the
Person making such Takeover Proposal, inquiry, proposal or offer, communicate
the material terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal, inquiry,
proposal or offer (including any subsequent material amendment or other
modification to such terms and conditions) and provide to Parent copies of any
written materials received from or on behalf of such Person relating to
such inquiry, proposal or offer. The Company will (i) keep Parent reasonably
and promptly apprised of the status and terms of any such Takeover Proposal,
inquiry, proposal or offer and regarding the status of any discussions or
negotiations with the Person making such Takeover Proposal, inquiry, proposal
or offer or any of its Representatives and (ii) provide

 



38  Parent with copies of any material additional written materials received
that relate to such Takeover Proposal, inquiry, proposal or offer within
forty-eight (48) hours after receipt or delivery thereof. The Company shall
not terminate, amend, modify, waive or fail to enforce any (i) material
provision of an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into pursuant to
this _Section 5.3(b)_ or (ii) provision of any "standstill" or similar
obligation of any Person unless, in the case of either clause (i) or clause
(ii), the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the
failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; _provided_ that, with respect
to any "standstill" or similar obligation, upon such termination, amendment,
modification, waiver or failure to enforce, the Company shall, simultaneously
and on substantially the same terms, terminate, amend, modify, waive or fail
to enforce any corresponding provision of any "standstill" or similar
obligation of Parent.

(c) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the Company
Board shall not (i)(A) withhold, fail to include in (or remove from) the
Proxy Statement, withdraw, qualify or modify, or publicly propose or resolve
to withhold, fail to include in (or remove from) the Proxy Statement,
withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board
Recommendation, (B) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or
recommend to the stockholders of the Company, a Takeover Proposal, or (C) at
any time after receipt or public announcement of a Takeover Proposal, fail to
reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within five (5) Business Days after
receipt of any written request to do so by Parent (but, if the End Date is
fewer than five (5) Business Days after the Companys receipt of such
request, by the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding
the End Date) (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to
herein as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ "); or (ii) adopt,
approve, recommend, submit to the stockholders of the Company or declare
advisable, or publicly propose or resolve to adopt, approve, recommend, submit
to the stockholders of the Company or declare advisable), or allow the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into any merger
agreement, agreement in principle, letter of intent or other similar Contract
providing for a Takeover Proposal (any such Contract, an " _Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_ "), other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
referred to in _Section 5.3(b)_ entered into in compliance with _Section
5.3(b)_. Parent shall be entitled to make a written request for reaffirmation
of the type contemplated by _Section 5.3(c)(i)(C)_ up to two (2) times in
respect of each Takeover Proposal received by the Company and up to two (2)
additional times in respect of each material revision or amendment to the
terms of such Takeover Proposal. Parent shall not be entitled to make such a
written request for reaffirmation if Parent has received from the Company a
Change of Recommendation Notice and the applicable Notice Period with respect
to such Change of Recommendation Notice has not ended.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 5.3_, if at any
time prior to receipt of Company Stockholder Approval the Company receives a
Takeover Proposal or an Intervening Event occurs, the Company Board (or a duly
authorized committee thereof) may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
(and, solely with respect to a Superior Proposal, terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_), if, (i) the Company is not in material
breach of this _Section 5.3_; (ii) the Company Board (or a duly authorized
committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably
be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary

 



39  duties under applicable law; (iii) if such Company Adverse Recommendation
Change or termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ is
to be taken in circumstances involving or relating to a Takeover Proposal,
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal and financial advisors, that such Takeover Proposal is a
Superior Proposal; (iv) (A) the Company provides Parent prior written notice
of its intent to make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ at least four (4) Business
Days (the " _Notice Period_ ") prior to taking such action (a " _Change of
Recommendation Notice_ "), which notice shall specify the basis for such
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or termination, including (I) in the
case of any action intended to be taken in circumstances involving or
relating to a Takeover Proposal, the material terms of such Takeover Proposal,
including the most current version of the proposed agreement under which the
Takeover Proposal is proposed to be consummated and the identity of the
Person making the Takeover Proposal, or (II) in the case of any action
intended to be taken in circumstances involving or relating to an Intervening
Event, a reasonably detailed description of the Intervening Event giving rise
to such action (it being understood that such Change of Recommendation Notice
shall not in itself be deemed a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and that
any material revision or amendment to the terms of any Takeover Proposal shall
require a new notice and, in such case, the Notice Period shall be deemed to
be two (2) Business Days); (B) during the period described in clause (A), the
Company shall have made its Representatives reasonably available to discuss
with Parents Representatives proposed modifications to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, and the Company shall have, if required by
Parent, negotiated in good faith with Parent with respect to such proposed
modifications; and (C) Parent has not, within the Notice Period, made a _bona
fide_ offer capable of being accepted by the Company to modify the terms or
conditions of this Agreement or any other proposal such that (I) in the case
of any action intended to be taken in circumstances involving or relating to
a Takeover Proposal, the Company Board, after taking into account any
modifications to the terms of this Agreement and the Merger agreed to by
Parent and Merger Sub and after consultation with its outside legal and
financial advisors, continues to believe in good faith that such Takeover
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and determines in good faith that the
failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to  _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ would reasonably be expected to
be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under
applicable law or (II) in the case of any action intended to be taken in
circumstances involving or relating to an Intervening Event, the Company
Board, after taking into account any modifications to the terms of this
Agreement and the Merger agreed to by Parent and Merger Sub and after
consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors, determines
in good faith that the failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
Company Board under applicable law.

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) from (i) taking and
disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated by Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, (ii) making
any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company with respect to a Takeover
Proposal or an Intervening Event if the Company Board (or a duly authorized
committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that

 



40  the failure to make such disclosure would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, (iii) informing
any Person of the existence of the provisions contained in this _Section
5.3_ or (iv) making any "stop, look and listen" communication to the
stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act
(or any similar communication to the stockholders of the Company); _provided_
that the foregoing shall in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any
such disclosure or communication would otherwise have under this Agreement.
Any disclosure made pursuant to this  _Section 5.3(e)_ (other than that
described in clause (iii) or (iv) hereof) shall be deemed to be a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Company Board, if Parent so requests
in writing, reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such disclosure.

(f) As used in this Agreement, " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall mean any _bona
fide_  inquiry, proposal or offer (whether or not in writing) from any Person
(other than Parent, Merger Sub and any of their Affiliates) to purchase or
otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, in a single transaction or series
of related transactions, including by way of any merger, consolidation,
tender offer, exchange offer, stock acquisition, asset acquisition, share
exchange, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, business combination,
dissolution, joint venture, license or similar transaction, (i) assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (including securities of Subsidiaries) that
account for 15% or more of the Companys and its Subsidiaries consolidated
assets or from which 15% or more of the Companys revenues or earnings on a
consolidated basis are derived, (ii) 15% or more of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock or any other class of capital stock of, or other equity
or voting interests in, the Company or any if its Subsidiaries which, in the
aggregate, directly or indirectly hold the assets referred to in clause (i)
above or (iii) any combination of the foregoing.

 

(g) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any _bona
fide_ unsolicited written Takeover Proposal made by any Person after the date
hereof and not as a result of the Companys material breach of this _Section
5.3_ on terms which the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof)
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal
counsel and independent financial advisors, to be more favorable to the
holders of Company Common Stock from a financial point of view than the
Transactions (after taking into account the terms of any _bona fide_ offer by
Parent capable of being accepted by the Company to modify the terms of the
Transactions) and is reasonably likely to be consummated on the terms
proposed, taking into account, to the extent applicable and considered
relevant by the Company Board, all legal, financial, regulatory and other
aspects of such Takeover Proposal, including any conditions to consummation,
the anticipated timing of closing, the risk of non-consummation, the identity
of the Person making the Takeover Proposal and such Persons ability to
finance the transaction, any required approvals, authorizations or other third
party consents and any applicable break-up fees or expense reimbursement
provisions; _provided_ that for purposes of the definition of Superior
Proposal, the references to "15%" in the definition of Takeover Proposal shall
be deemed to be references to "50%."

 

Section 5.4 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use its respective reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause
to be done, and cooperate with the other parties in

 



41  doing, all things necessary, proper and advisable under applicable Law to
cause the Transactions to be consummated as soon as practicable, including to
(i) prepare and make as promptly as practicable and advisable any required

(collectively, " _Authorizations_ "), in each case, including
under applicable Antitrust Laws, from, and promptly deliver all required
notices to, any Governmental Authority necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law to consummate the Transactions as soon as practicable. For
purposes hereof, " _Antitrust Laws_ " means the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act,
the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, any Foreign Antitrust Laws, and
all other applicable Laws issued by a Governmental Authority that are designed
or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of competition
through merger or acquisition. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i)
solely for purposes of this  _Section 5.4_, the term Governmental Authority
shall not include the SEC, and (ii) the terms and conditions of this _Section
5.4_ shall not apply to any actions in respect of the SEC (including, without
limitation, any actions in connection with filings or submissions with the
SEC), which are addressed in _Section 5.2_.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing: (i) each party
hereto agrees to (A) make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report
Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions within ten (10)
Business Days after the date hereof (unless otherwise agreed by the parties),
(B) supply as soon as practicable and advisable any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act or any
other applicable Antitrust Laws and (C) use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all other actions consistent with this _Section
5.4_ necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting periods under the HSR Act (including any extensions thereof) as soon
as practicable and advisable and (ii) each party hereto agrees to (A) make the
appropriate filings under any other applicable Antitrust Laws as soon as
practicable and advisable so that all clearances, no actions or other
requirements necessary to consummate the Transactions are received no later
than three (3) Business Days before the End Date, (B) supply as soon as
practical and advisable any additional information and documentary material
that may be required or requested by any Governmental Authority under such
Antitrust Laws and (C) use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be
taken all other actions consistent with this _Section 5.4_ as necessary to
obtain any necessary Authorizations from each such Governmental Authority as
soon as practicable.

(c) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall: (i) promptly notify the other
parties hereto of, and if in writing, furnish the others with copies of (or,
in the case of oral communications, advise the others of the contents of) any
communication received from, or given to, any Governmental Authority relating
to any submissions, filings or Authorizations under applicable Antitrust Laws
with respect to the Transactions, (ii) subject to applicable Law, permit the
others to review and discuss in advance (and to consider in good faith any

Authorizations under applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the
Transactions, (iii) keep the others reasonably informed of any developments,
meetings or discussions with any Governmental Authority in respect of any
filings, investigation or inquiry under applicable Antitrust Laws concerning
the Transactions, and (iv) furnish the other parties with non-
confidential copies of all correspondence, filings and written communications
between them and their Affiliates and their respective Representatives, on the
one hand, and any such Governmental Authority or its staff, on the other hand,
relating to any submissions, filings or Authorizations under applicable
Antitrust Laws with respect to the Transactions. However, each of Parent and
the Company may designate any non-public information provided to any
Governmental Authority under applicable Antitrust Laws as restricted to
"Outside Counsel" only and any such information shall not be shared with
employees, officers or directors or their equivalents of the other party
without approval of the party providing the non-public information.

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, if and to the
extent necessary to obtain any Authorization that may be required by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions under the HSR Act and
any other Antitrust Laws applicable to the Transactions, Parent and Merger Sub
shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to commit to and effect,
by consent decree, hold separate orders, trust or otherwise, (i) the sale,
license, holding separate or other disposition of assets or businesses of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) terminating,
relinquishing, modifying, or waiving existing relationships, ventures,
contractual rights, obligations or other arrangements of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries and (iii) creating any relationships, ventures, contractual
rights, obligations or other arrangements of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (each a " _Remedial Action_ "); _provided,_ _however_ , that any
Remedial Action may, at the discretion of the Company, be conditioned upon
consummation of the Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Parent and Merger Sub shall not
be required to take any Remedial Action that would be materially adverse to
the business, results of operations or financial condition of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Parent or
Merger Sub be obligated to, and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not,
without the prior written consent of Parent, agree to or proffer any Remedial
Action with respect to the assets, businesses, relationships, ventures,
contractual rights, obligations or other arrangements of Parent or any of its
Affiliates.

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, in the event that
any litigation or other administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
commenced, threatened or is foreseeable challenging any of the Transactions
and such litigation, action or proceeding seeks, or would reasonably be
expected to seek, to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the
consummation of the Transactions, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to
take any and all action, including a Remedial Action (subject to the last
sentence of _Section 5.4(d)_), to avoid or resolve any such litigation,
action or proceeding and each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall
cooperate with each other and use its respective reasonable best efforts to
contest and resist any such litigation, action or proceeding and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Transactions as
promptly as practicable and in any event no later than three (3) Business
Days prior to the End Date.

 



43 (f) To the extent requested by Parent, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to seek the waiver or consent of any Person required in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions under any Contract to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is party with such Person;
_provided_ that the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, agree to or proffer any consent fee, concession or modification to, or
waiver of, the terms and conditions of any Contract in order to obtain any
such waiver or consent.

 

Section 5.5 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Following such initial press
release, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing,
and give each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any
press release or other public statements with respect to the Transactions and
shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior
to such consultation, except as such party may reasonably conclude may be
required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange or national securities
quotation system (and then only after as much advance notice and consultation
as is feasible); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the restrictions set forth in
this _Section 5.5_ shall not apply to any release or public statement (a)
made or proposed to be made by the Company in connection with a Takeover
Proposal, a Superior Proposal or a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
any action taken pursuant thereto (so long as any such release or public
statement is made in compliance with _Section 5.3_) or (b) in connection with
any dispute between the parties regarding this Agreement or the Transactions;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing shall not limit the ability of any
party hereto to make internal announcements to their respective employees and
other stockholders that are not inconsistent in any material respects with
the prior public disclosures regarding the Transactions.

Section 5.6 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

(a) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, from
the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date on which
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries, and shall direct and use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries to,
(i) afford to Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives (and, to
the extent relating to the Revenue Rights, RPI, its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives) reasonable access during normal business hours
and upon reasonable advance notice to the Companys books, Contracts, records
officers, employees, agents, properties, facilities and other assets, (ii)
furnish promptly to Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives
(and, to the extent relating to the Revenue Rights, RPI, its Affiliates and
their respective Representatives) such financial and operating data and such
other information concerning its business and properties as such Persons
may reasonably request, and (iii) instruct the Representatives of the Company
and its Subsidiaries to cooperate with Parent (and to the extent related to
the Revenue Rights, RPI) in its investigation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries;  _provided_ that Parent, Merger Sub, RPI and its Affiliates and
their respective Representatives shall conduct any such

 



44  activities in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the
business or operations of the Company; _provided,_ _further_ , that the
Company shall not be obligated to provide such access or information if the
Company determines, in its reasonable judgment, that doing so would violate
applicable Law or a Contract or obligation of confidentiality owing to a
third-party ( _provided_ that the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of any such third-party to the
disclosure of such information), jeopardize the protection of the attorney-
client privilege ( _provided_ that the Company will nonetheless use its
reasonable best efforts to provide Parent, Merger Sub or RPI, as applicable,
and their respective Representatives with such reasonably requested
information regarding the factual basis underlying any circumstances that
resulted in the preparation of such privileged analyses to the extent such
provision would not otherwise jeopardize the protection of such attorney-
client privilege), or expose such party to risk of liability for disclosure of
sensitive or personal information. Until the Effective Time, the information
provided will be subject to the terms of the confidentiality letter agreement,
dated as of October 14, 2013, between Parent and the Company (as it may be
amended from time to time, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and, without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub shall not, and
shall cause their respective Representatives not to, use such information for
any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the Transactions.

(b) Parent acknowledges and agrees that it (i) had an opportunity to discuss
the business of the Company with the management of the Company, (ii) has had
access to the books and records, facilities, Contracts and other assets of the
Company which it and its Representatives have requested to review, (iii) has
been afforded the opportunity to ask questions of and receive answers from
officers of the Company, and (iv) has conducted its own independent
investigation of the Company, its businesses and the Transactions (which
investigation shall not, for the avoidance of doubt, limit the effect of the
Companys representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement or
Parents ability to rely on such representations and warranties).

 

(c) Prior to the submission of any applications, filings or other materials
with the FDA (including any New Drug Application), the FTC, the DEA or any
other similar Governmental Authority, in each case, relating to any Product or
any other product the Company or its Subsidiaries may develop after the date
hereof, the Company shall (i) provide drafts of such applications, filings
or other materials to Parent reasonably sufficiently in advance of submission
and (ii) consider in good faith any comments, concerns and recommendations
made, or changes requested, by Parent reasonably promptly in relation thereto
prior to such submission.

Section 5.7 _Takeover Laws_. The Company and the Company Board shall each (a)
use its reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary to ensure that
no state "control share acquisition," "fair price," "moratorium" or other
anti-takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes
applicable to the Transactions and (b) if any such anti-takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to the Transactions, use its
reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary to ensure that such
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to take all such other actions
are reasonably necessary to eliminate or minimize the effect of such statute
or regulation on the Transactions.

 



45 Section 5.8 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) indemnify, defend and hold
harmless each individual who, at or any time prior to the Effective Time, is
or was a director or officer of, or who served as a director, officer, member,
trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise if such service
was at the request or for the benefit of, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the "
_Indemnitees_ ") against all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments,
fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise)
and expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection
with any actual or threatened claim, suit, action, proceeding or
investigation (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative)
(each, a " _Claim_ "), whenever asserted, arising out of, relating to or in
connection with any action or omission relating to their position with the
Company or its Subsidiaries occurring or alleged to have occurred before or at
the Effective Time (including any Claim relating in whole or in part to the
Agreement or the Transactions), to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, (ii) assume all obligations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in respect of limitation of liability,
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses as provided in the
Company Charter Documents and the Subsidiary Charter Documents as currently
in effect on the date hereof which shall survive the Transactions and continue
in full force and effect to the extent permitted by applicable Law and (iii)
without limiting the foregoing, at the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to
include provisions for limitation of liabilities of directors and officers,
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of the Indemnitees no
less favorable to the Indemnitees than as set forth in the Company Charter
Documents in effect on the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees except as required by
applicable Law.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, pay and advance to an Indemnitee any reasonable
expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) incurred by any
Indemnitee in connection with any Claim for which such Indemnitee is eligible
to be indemnified pursuant to _Section 5.8(a)_ or the enforcement of
an Indemnitees rights under this _Section 5.8_ as and when incurred to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, _provided_ that the Indemnitee
to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
expenses if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled
to indemnification (but only to the extent required by applicable Law, the
Company Charter Documents, applicable Subsidiary Charter Documents or
applicable indemnification agreements).

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 5.8_,
Parent shall not (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to)
settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek
termination with respect to any Claim for which indemnification may be sought
under this Agreement, unless such settlement, compromise, consent or
termination includes an unconditional release of all of the Indemnitees
covered by the Claim and entitled to indemnification hereunder from all
liability arising out of such Claim. Nothing in this _Section 5.8(c)_ shall
relieve Parent or the Surviving Corporation of its obligations set forth in
_Section 5.8_.

 



46 (d) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
to be maintained in effect the coverage provided by the policies (accurate
and complete copies of which have been previously made available to Parent) of
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
in effect as of the date hereof maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries only with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective
Time either through the Companys existing insurance provider or another
provider reasonably selected by Parent;  _provided,_ _however_ , that, Parent
may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms no less advantageous to such former directors or officers so
long as such substitution does not result in gaps or lapses of coverage with
respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time, _provided_ ,
_further_ , that Parent shall not be required to pay annual premiums in excess
of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date
hereof in respect of the coverage required to be obtained pursuant hereto
(which amount is set forth in _Section 5.8(d)_ of the Company Matters
Letter), but in such case shall purchase for such six-year period as much
coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount. In lieu of the foregoing
insurance coverage, at or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall have
the option to cause coverage to be extended through the purchase of "tail"
insurance coverage at an aggregate cost no greater than 600% of the last
annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of such
coverage. If such "tail" coverage have been obtained at or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
cause such coverage to remain in full force and effect for its full term, and
continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 5.8_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs
and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for or limitation of, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise.
The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this _Section
5.8_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely
affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this _Section 5.8_ applies
unless (A) such termination or modification is required by applicable Law or
(B) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such
termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to
whom this  _Section 5.8_ applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this
_Section 5.8_).

(f) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the
obligations thereof set forth in this _Section 5.8_.

Section 5.9 _Transaction Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent (a) the
opportunity to participate in, but not control, the defense or settlement of
any stockholder litigation against the Company or any of its directors or
officers relating to this Agreement or the Transactions (and, in any event, no
such settlement of any stockholder litigation shall be agreed

 



47  to without Parents prior written consent, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and (b) the right to review and
comment on all material filings or responses to be made by the Company in
connection with any such stockholder litigation (and the Company will give
reasonable consideration to such comments). Each of Parent and the Company
shall notify the other promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) of the
commencement of any such stockholder litigation of which it has received
notice, and shall keep the other reasonably informed regarding any such
stockholder litigation.

 

Section 5.10 _Section 16_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to cause the
Transactions, including any dispositions of equity securities of the Company
(including derivative securities with respect to such equity securities of the
Company) by each individual who is or will be subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Companys equity securities, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 5.11 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Until December 31, 2014, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be
provided, to each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) as of the Effective Time that
continues employment with the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
following the Effective Time (" _Company Employees_ "), for so long as such
person continues employment compensation and benefits (including annual base
salary and base wages, cash incentive compensation opportunities), and
employee benefits (including severance benefits) that are comparable in the
aggregate to the base salary, base wages, cash incentive compensation
opportunities and employee benefits provided to each such Company Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(b) For purposes of vesting and eligibility to participate (but not for
purposes of benefit accrual) under the employee benefit plans of Parent and
its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employee after the
Effective Time (including the Company Plans) (the " _New Plans_ "), each
Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with
the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the
Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled,
before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar
Company employee benefit plan in which such Company Employee participated or
was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time,
_provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its
application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the
same period of service. In addition, and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the
extent coverage under such New Plan is replacing comparable coverage under a
Company Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before
the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii)
for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical
and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New
Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents, to the extent such conditions were inapplicable or waived under
the comparable Old Plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such
Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent

 



48  shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by any Company Employee and his
or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan
ending on the date such Company Employees participation in the corresponding
New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
New Plan.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor all obligations under the Company
Plans and compensation and severance arrangements and agreements in accordance
with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time and the
Transactions shall be deemed to constitute a "change in control," "change of
control" or "corporate transaction" (or other similar term) under such Company
Plans, arrangements or agreements.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i)
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each Company Employee
employed by Parent or its Affiliates on December 31, 2014 such Company
Employees annual incentive bonus in cash in an amount no less than at the
applicable target level for such employee under the Companys current annual
incentive plan or other annual bonus plan, as applicable (the " _Target Bonus_
"), and (ii) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each
Company Employee terminated without Cause or with Good Reason (each such term
as defined in _Section 5.11(d)_ of the Company Matters Letter) on or after
the Effective Time a pro-rata portion of any Target Bonus in respect of 2014
that such Company Employee would have been entitled to receive under the
Companys annual incentive plan or other annual bonus plan, as applicable.

(e) Unless otherwise directed in writing by Parent at least five (5) Business
Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board will authorize the full
vesting of all benefits under and termination of any and all Company Plans
intended to qualify as a qualified cash or deferred arrangement under Section
401(k) of the Code (the " _401(k) Plans_ "), effective no later than the day
immediately preceding the Effective Time. The Company shall provide Parent
evidence that such resolutions to terminate the 401(k) Plans of the Company
have been adopted by the Company Board. The form and substance of such
resolutions shall be subject to the reasonable approval of Parent. The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to take such other actions in
furtherance of terminating any such 401(k) Plans as Parent may request.
Immediately prior to such termination, the Company will make, or cause to be
made, all necessary payments to fund the contributions (i) necessary or
required to maintain the tax-qualified status of any such 401(k) Plan, (ii)
for elective deferrals made pursuant to any such 401(k) Plan for the period
prior to termination, and (iii) for employer contributions, if any, for the
period prior to termination determined as though the Effective Time were the
last day of the relevant plan year. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts
to cause the 401(k) Plans of Parent or its affiliates to accept any
distribution from the Companys 401(k) Plans as a rollover contribution, if
so directed by a Company Employee.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this Agreement shall (i) be treated as an amendment to
any Company Plan, (ii) obligate Parent or the Surviving Corporation to (A)
maintain any particular benefit plan or arrangement or (B) retain the
employment of any particular employee or (iii) prevent Parent or the Surviving
Corporation from amending or terminating any benefit plan or arrangement in
accordance with the terms of such plan or arrangement.

herein to the contrary, nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to

Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and
supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

 

Section 5.14 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub shall give prompt notice to the other parties hereto upon

Knowledge, threatened by or against, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, in each case, that relate to this Agreement or the consummation
of the Transactions; (ii) the occurrence or existence of any Company Material
Adverse Effect or the occurrence or existence of any event which would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect; (iii) the occurrence or existence of any Parent
Material Adverse Effect or the occurrence or existence of any event which
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect; and (iv) any event, condition, fact or
circumstance that could reasonably be expected to result in any condition set
forth in _Article VI_ not being satisfied prior to the End Date; _provided_
that the delivery of notice pursuant to this _Section 5.14_ shall not limit
or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the Company or Parent.

 

Section 5.15 _Deregistration; Stock Exchange Delisting_. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its
part under applicable Law and rules and policies of NASDAQ to enable and
facilitate the delisting of the Company Common Stock from NASDAQ by the
Surviving Corporation as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time and

any event, within two (2) Business Days) after the date hereof, the Company
shall provide to Parent solely for informational purposes an accurate and
complete copy of the executed written opinion of Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
Fenner and Smith Incorporated described in _Section 3.17_.

 

Section 5.17 _Further Assurances_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each party hereto, at the reasonable request of another party
hereto and at the

 



50  expense of the party so requesting, shall execute and deliver such documents
and take such actions as may be necessary or desirable for the purpose of
facilitating the consummation of the Transactions.

Subsidiaries to, perform the covenants set forth on _Annex B_ hereto, which
covenants are incorporated by reference herein. In addition, Parent shall have
received, at least three (3) and not more than five (5) Business Days prior to

ARTICLE VII

Section 7.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Transactions abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether
before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval:

(b) by either of the Company or Parent:

 

(i) if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before October 27,
2014 (the " _End Date_ ");  _provided_ , that if on the End Date the
condition set forth in _Section 6.1(b)_ and/or the condition set forth in
_Section 6.1(c)_ (if the applicable Restraint is an order or injunction of a

Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 7.1(b)(_i) shall not be available to a party if the

be in effect and shall have become final and non-appealable; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section

postponements thereof) shall have concluded and the Company Stockholder
Approval contemplated by this Agreement shall not have been obtained; or

 



53 (c) by Parent:

 

(i) if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this

respectively, and (B) cannot be cured by the Company by the End Date or, if
capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within thirty (30) calendar

execute or enter into) any Alternative Acquisition Agreement (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, would not include an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement), or (D) a tender offer or exchange offer which constitutes a
Takeover Proposal shall have been commenced by a Person unaffiliated with
Parent and the Company shall not have sent to the Companys stockholders

(or, if the End Date is fewer than five (5) Business Days after such offer is
first published, sent or given, by the close of business on the Business Day
immediately preceding the End Date) after such tender offer or exchange offer
is first published, sent or given, and Parent has so requested in writing, a
statement reaffirming the Company Board Recommendation and recommending that
the Companys stockholders reject such tender or exchange offer; or

 

(d) by the Company:

 

(i) if Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in _Section 6.3(a)_ or _Section 6.3(b)_,
respectively, and (B) cannot be cured by Parent or Merger Sub by the End Date
or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within thirty (30)
calendar days following receipt of written notice from the Company stating the
Companys intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
7.1(d)(i)_ and the basis for such termination;

(ii) in order to enter into a transaction that is a Superior Proposal, in
accordance with _Section 5.3_, if (A) such Superior Proposal shall not have

acquisition agreement providing for the consummation of a transaction
constituting a Superior Proposal;  _provided_ that the right to terminate

_MISCELLANEOUS _

Section 8.1 _No Survival of Representations and Warranties_. None of the
representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time. This
_Section 8.1_ shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the parties that
by its terms contemplates performance in whole or in part after the Effective
Time. The Confidentiality Agreement shall (a) survive termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms and (b) terminate as of the Effective
Time.

 

Section 8.2 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as provided in _Section 7.3_, whether
or not the Transactions are consummated, all fees and expenses incurred in

incurring or required to incur such fees or expenses.

Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects,
whether before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, by
written agreement of the parties hereto and

 



56  delivered by duly authorized officers of the respective parties; _provided_
, _however_ , that following approval of the Transactions by the stockholders
of the Company, there shall be no amendment or change to the provisions
hereof which by Law would require further approval by the stockholders of the
Company without such approval having first been obtained.

 

Section 8.4 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party
(other than Parent with respect to Merger Sub, or Merger Sub with respect to
Parent) may, subject to applicable Law, (a) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of any other party hereto, (b) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of any other party

contained herein or, except as otherwise provided herein, waive any of such

the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if expressly set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party; and any such waiver
shall not be applicable or have any effect except in the specific instance in
which it is given unless otherwise expressly stated herein.

Section 8.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by

null and void. No assignment by any party shall relieve such party of any of
its obligations hereunder. The reorganization, consolidation or change of
control of Parent and/or Merger Sub shall be deemed an assignment hereunder
unless the ultimate parent entity controlling Parent and/or Merger Sub
following such reorganization, consolidation or change of control assumes the
obligations of Parent and/or Merger Sub hereunder. In addition, Parent hereby
agrees that, prior to entering into any transaction or series of related
transactions involving all or substantially all of Parents assets (whether
structured as an asset sale, restructuring, liquidation or other similar
transfer of assets of Parent), Parent will arrange for either the assignment
of Parents obligations pursuant to this Agreement to the assignee, transferee
or other recipient of Parents assets in connection therewith or such
alternative means reasonably satisfactory to the Company of providing for the
satisfaction of Parents obligations under this Agreement.

Section 8.6 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts

and holders of Options and Restricted Stock to receive the Merger

set forth in this Agreement and the covenants of the Company set forth on

other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that (i) all actions and
proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and
determined in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware and any state
appellate court therefrom sitting in New Castle County in the State of
Delaware (or, if the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware declines to
accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court
within the State of Delaware), (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or

any such action or proceeding by mailing copies thereof by registered or
certified United States mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to
its address as specified in or pursuant to this _Article VIII_. However, the
foregoing shall not limit the right of a party to effect service of process on
the other party by any other legally available method.

 

Section 8.9 _Specific Enforcement_. The parties agree that immediate,
extensive and irreparable damage would occur for which monetary damages would
not be an adequate remedy in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are
otherwise breached. Accordingly, the parties agree that, if for any
reason Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall have failed to perform its
obligations under this Agreement or otherwise breached this Agreement, then
the party seeking to enforce this Agreement against such nonperforming party
under this Agreement shall be entitled to specific performance and the
issuance of immediate injunctive and other equitable relief without the
necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy, and the
parties further agree to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with the obtaining of any such injunctive or other
equitable relief, this being in addition to and not in limitation of any other
remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.

SECTION 2 CONTINGENT VALUE RIGHTS

(a) As provided in the Merger Agreement, each Holder shall be entitled to one
CVR for each share of Company Common Stock outstanding or underlying each
Option and share of Restricted Stock that is owned by or has been issued to
such Holder as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and is converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to the
Merger Agreement.

(b) Parent hereby appoints the Rights Agent to act as rights agent for Parent
in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, and
the Rights Agent hereby accepts such appointment.

2.2 Nontransferable. The CVRs shall not be sold, assigned, transferred,
pledged, encumbered or in any other manner transferred or disposed of, in
whole or in part, other than pursuant to a Permitted Transfer.

 

2.3 No Certificate; Registration; Registration of Transfer; Change of Address.

 

(a) The CVRs shall not be evidenced by a certificate or other instrument.

 

(b) The Rights Agent shall keep a register (the " _CVR Register_ ") for the
purposes of (i) identifying the Holders of CVRs and (ii) registering CVRs and
Permitted Transfers thereof.

(c) Subject to the restrictions on transferability set forth in Section 2.2,
every request made to transfer a CVR must be in writing and accompanied by a
written instrument of transfer and other requested documentation in form
reasonably satisfactory to the Rights Agent, duly executed by the Holder or
Holders thereof, or by the duly appointed legal representative, personal
representative or survivor of such Holder or Holders, setting forth in
reasonable detail the circumstances relating to the transfer. Upon receipt of
such written notice, the Rights Agent shall, subject to its reasonable
determination that the transfer instrument is in proper form and the

 



75  transfer otherwise complies with the other terms and conditions of this
Agreement (including the provisions of Section 2.2), register the transfer of
the applicable CVRs in the CVR Register. All duly transferred CVRs registered
in the CVR Register shall be the valid obligations of Parent, evidencing the
same right, and shall entitle the transferee to the same benefits and rights
under this Agreement, as those held by the transferor. No transfer of a CVR
shall be valid until registered in the CVR Register, and any transfer not duly
registered in the CVR Register will be void ab initio. Any transfer or
assignment of the CVRs shall be without charge (other than the cost of
any transfer tax) to the applicable Holder.

(d) A Holder may make a written request to the Rights Agent to change such
Holders address of record in the CVR Register. The written request must be
duly executed by the Holder. Upon receipt of such written notice, the Rights
Agent shall promptly record the change of address in the CVR Register.

 

2.4 Payment Procedures.

 

(a) If a Milestone occurs, then on a date (the " _Milestone Payment Date_ ")
that is within 10 Business Days following such event, Parent shall deliver to
the Rights Agent (i) a notice (the " _Milestone Satisfaction Notice_ ") which
shall be in the form of an Officers Certificate stating the date of the
satisfaction of such Milestone and that the Holders are entitled to receive
the applicable Milestone Payment and (ii) cash in the aggregate amount of the
Milestone Payment payable to the Holders. In no event shall payment be made
with respect to more than a single Milestone.

 

(b) The Rights Agent shall promptly, and in no event later than 10 Business
Days after receipt, (i) send each Holder at its address set forth in the CVR
Register a copy of the Milestone Satisfaction Notice and (ii) pay the
Milestone Payment to each of the Holders (the amount which each Holder is
entitled to receive, subject to Section 2.4(c), will be based on the
applicable Milestone Payment multiplied by the number of CVRs held by such
Holder at the time of such payment as reflected on the CVR Register) by check
mailed to the address of each Holder as set forth in the CVR Register as of
the close of business on the first Business Day prior to the Milestone
Payment Date.

(c) Except to the extent any portion of the Milestone Payment is required to
be treated as imputed interest pursuant to applicable Law, the Holders and the
parties hereto agree to treat the CVRs and the Milestone Payment for all Tax
purposes as additional consideration for the shares of Common Stock, Options
and shares of Restricted Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and none of
the Holders and the parties hereto will take any position to the contrary on
any Tax Return or for other Tax purposes except as required by applicable Law.
Parent and the Company shall report imputed interest on the CVRs pursuant to
Section 483 of the Code.

and withheld, from the Milestone Payment otherwise payable pursuant to this

to the making of such payment under any provision of applicable Law relating
to Taxes. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld and paid
over to or deposited with the relevant Governmental Authority,

 



76  such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Holder in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made. Prior to making any such tax withholdings or causing
any such tax withholdings to be made with respect to any Holder, the Rights
Agent shall, to the extent practicable, provide notice to the Holder of such
potential withholding and a reasonable opportunity for the Holder to provide
any necessary tax forms (including an IRS Form W-9 or an applicable IRS Form
W-8) in order to avoid or reduce such withholding amounts; _provided_ that the
time period for payment of a Milestone Payment by the Rights Agent set forth
in Section 2.4(b) shall be extended by a period equal to any delay caused by
the Holder providing such forms.

(e) Any portion of the Milestone Payment that remains undistributed to the
Holders for six months after the Milestone Payment Date shall be delivered by
the Rights Agent to Parent, upon demand, and any Holder shall thereafter look
only to Parent for payment of such Milestone Payment, but shall have no
greater rights against Parent than may be accorded to general unsecured
creditors of Parent under applicable Law.

 

(f) Neither Parent nor the Rights Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of a Milestone Payment delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar legal requirement under
applicable Law. If the Milestone Payment (or portion thereof) made by Parent
remains unclaimed by a Holder two years after the applicable Milestone
Payment Date (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which the
Milestone Payment would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority), any such Milestone Payment (or portion thereof)
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of
Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

2.5 No Voting, Dividends or Interest; No Equity or Ownership Interest in
Parent.

(a) The CVRs shall not have any voting or dividend rights, and interest shall
not accrue on any amounts payable in respect of the CVRs.

(b) The CVRs shall not represent any equity or ownership interest in Parent,
in any constituent company to the Merger or any of their respective
Affiliates.

2.6 Ability To Abandon The CVR. The Holder of a CVR may at any time, at such
Holders option, abandon all of such Holders remaining rights in a CVR by
transferring such CVR to Parent without consideration therefor. Nothing in
this Agreement is intended to prohibit Parent from offering to acquire CVRs
for consideration in its sole discretion.

SECTION 3 THE RIGHTS AGENT

 

3.1 Certain Duties And Responsibilities.

 

(a) The Rights Agent shall not have any liability for any actions taken or not
taken in connection with this Agreement, except to the extent of its willful
misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence.

 



77 (b) The Acting Holders may direct the Rights Agent to act on behalf of the
Holders in enforcing any of their rights hereunder. The Rights Agent shall be
under no obligation to institute any action, suit or proceeding, or to take
any other action likely to result in the incurrence of material expenses by
the Rights Agent, unless the Acting Holders (on behalf of the Holders) shall
furnish the Rights Agent with reasonable security and indemnity for any costs
and expenses that may be incurred. All rights of action under this Agreement
may be enforced by the Rights Agent, any action, suit or proceeding
instituted by the Rights Agent shall be brought in its name as the Rights
Agent and any recovery in connection therewith shall be for the proportionate
benefit of all the Holders, as their respective rights or interests may
appear.

3.2 Certain Rights of Rights Agent.

 

(a) The Rights Agent undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as
are specifically set forth in this Agreement, and no implied covenants or
obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Rights Agent.

(b) The Rights Agent may rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining
from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion,
report, notice, request, direction, consent, order or other paper or document
believed by it in good faith to be genuine and to have been signed or
presented by the proper party or parties.

(c) Whenever the Rights Agent shall deem it desirable that a matter be proved
or established prior to taking, suffering or omitting any action hereunder,
the Rights Agent may, in the absence of bad faith, gross negligence or willful
misconduct on its part, rely upon an Officers Certificate.

 

(d) The Rights Agent may engage and consult with counsel of its selection and
the written advice or opinion of such counsel shall be full and complete
authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or
omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon.

 

(e) Any permissive rights of the Rights Agent hereunder shall not be construed
as a duty.

 

(f) The Rights Agent shall not be required to give any note or surety in
respect of the execution of such powers or otherwise in respect of the
premises.

(g) Parent agrees to indemnify Rights Agent for, and hold Rights Agent
harmless from and against, any loss, liability, damage or expense (" _Loss_
") suffered or incurred by the Rights Agent and arising out of or in
connection with Rights Agents performance of its obligations under this
Agreement, including the reasonable costs and expenses of defending the
Rights Agent against any claims, charges, demands, actions or suits arising
out of or in connection with such performance, except to the extent such Loss
shall have been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have
result from the Rights Agents gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct. Parents obligations under this Section 3.2(g) to indemnify the
Rights Agent shall survive the resignation or removal of any Rights Agent
and the termination of this Agreement.

 



78 (h) In addition to the indemnification provided under Section 3.2(g), Parent
agrees (i) to pay the fees and expenses of the Rights Agent in connection
with the Rights Agents performance of its obligations hereunder, as agreed
upon in writing by Rights Agent and Parent on or prior to the date of this
Agreement, and (ii) to reimburse the Rights Agent promptly upon demand for
all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses, including all Taxes
(other than income, receipt, franchise or similar Taxes) and governmental
charges, incurred by the Rights Agent in the performance of its obligations
under this Agreement.

3.3 Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor.

 

(a) The Rights Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof
to Parent and the Holders specifying a date when such resignation shall take
effect, which notice shall be sent at least 60 days prior to the date so
specified (or, if earlier, the appointment of the successor Rights Agent).

 

(b) Parent shall have the right to remove the Rights Agent at any time by a
Board Resolution specifying a date when such removal shall take effect.
Notice of such removal shall be given by Parent to Rights Agent, which notice
shall be sent at least 60 days prior to the date so specified (or, if earlier,
the appointment of the successor Rights Agent).

 

(c) If the Rights Agent shall resign, be removed or become incapable of
acting, Parent shall promptly appoint a qualified successor Rights Agent by a
Board Resolution. The successor Rights Agent so appointed shall, forthwith
upon its acceptance of such appointment in accordance with this Section 3.3(c)
and Section 3.4, become the successor Rights Agent for all
purposes hereunder.

(d) Any Person into which the Rights Agent may be merged or with which it may
be consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger, conversion or
consolidation to which the Rights Agent shall be a party, or any Person
succeeding to the corporate trust or stockholder services business of the
Rights Agent, shall be the successor to the Rights Agent under this Agreement
without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of
any of the parties hereto.

(e) Parent shall give notice of each resignation or removal of the Rights
Agent and each appointment of a successor Rights Agent by mailing written
notice of such event by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Holders as
their names and addresses appear in the CVR Register. Each notice shall
include the name and address of the successor Rights Agent. If Parent fails to
send such notice within 10 Business Days after acceptance of appointment by a
successor Rights Agent, the successor Rights Agent shall cause the notice to
be mailed at the expense of Parent.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.3, unless

successor Rights Agent any Person that is not a stock transfer agent or the
corporate trust department of a commercial bank, in either case of national
reputation. 

3.4 Acceptance of Appointment By Successor. Every successor Rights Agent
appointed hereunder shall, at or prior to such appointment, execute,
acknowledge and deliver to

 



79  Parent and to the retiring Rights Agent an instrument accepting such
appointment and a counterpart of this Agreement, and thereupon such successor
Rights Agent, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become
vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Rights
Agent; _provided_ that upon the request of Parent or the successor Rights
Agent, such resigning or removed Rights Agent shall execute and deliver an
instrument transferring to such successor Rights Agent all the rights, powers
and trusts of such resigning or removed Rights Agent.

SECTION 4 COVENANTS

4.1 List of Holders. Parent shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the

understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. This Agreement may be
executed in counterparts (each of which shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement)
and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties and delivered (by electronic communication, facsimile or
otherwise) to the other parties. Until and unless each party has received a

Holder affected by such event, at his, her or its address as it appears in the
CVR Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the
earliest date, prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case where

upon, and shall be enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of, the
Holders and the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.
The Rights Agent may not assign this Agreement without Parents prior written

consent of the Acting Holders. Any attempted assignment of this Agreement or
any of such rights in violation of this Section 6.4 shall be void and of no
effect.

6.5 Benefits of Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied,
shall give to any Person (other than the parties hereto, the Holders and their
permitted successors and assigns hereunder) any rights, remedies, benefits,
obligations, liabilities or claims under this Agreement or under any covenant
or provision herein contained, all such covenants and provisions being for the
sole benefit of the parties hereto, the Holders and their permitted successors
and assigns. The Holders shall have no rights hereunder except as are
expressly set forth herein and in the Merger Agreement.

6.6 Governing Law; Jurisdiction.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or
conflict of laws provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that (i) all actions and
proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and
determined in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware and any state
appellate court therefrom sitting in New Castle County in the State of
Delaware (or, if the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware declines to
accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court
within the State of Delaware), (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or
defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court, and (iii) a final Judgment in any action or proceeding shall
be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
Judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

 

(c) Each party irrevocably consents to the service of process outside the
territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in this Section 6.6 in any
such action or proceeding by mailing copies thereof by registered or certified
United States mail, postage

of a party to effect service of process on the other party by any other
legally available method.

AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES
HERETO ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT.

6.8 Legal Holidays. In the event that a Milestone Payment Date shall not be a
Business Day, then, notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, any payment required to be made in respect of the CVRs on such date
need not be made on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding
Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the applicable
Milestone Payment Date.

 

6.9 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental
Authority to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
law or public policy, all other terms, provisions and conditions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon
such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in a
mutually acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

6.10 Termination. This Agreement shall be terminated and of no force or
effect, the parties hereto shall have no liability hereunder, and no payments
shall be required to be made, upon the earlier to occur of (a) the payment of
the Milestone Payment required to be paid under the terms of this Agreement
and (b) a Termination Event. The termination of this Agreement shall not
affect or limit the right to receive the Milestone Payment under Section 2.4
to the extent earned prior to termination of this Agreement and the provisions
applicable thereto shall survive the expiration or termination of this
Agreement. 

6.11 Enforcement of Agreement. In the event that a Holder is required to take
any action to enforce such Holders rights hereunder, such Holder, in
addition to all other rights and remedies available hereunder, shall have the
right to recover from Parent all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees) incurred in connection therewith.

 

6.12 Construction. When a reference is made in this Agreement to a Section,
such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used
in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar
import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole
and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The definitions
contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the
plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine

 



84  and neuter genders of such term. Any agreement, instrument or statute
defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is
referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or statute as from time
to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of
agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of statutes)
by succession of comparable successor statutes and references to
all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder. References to a Person are also to its
permitted assigns and successors.

 

6.13 No Obligation. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, in no event shall Parent or any of its Affiliates, be required to
undertake any level of efforts, or employ any level of resources, to develop,
market, or commercialize Eluxadoline or any product containing Eluxadoline.
