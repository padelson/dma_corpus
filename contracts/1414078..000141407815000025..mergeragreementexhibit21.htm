AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of July 10,
2015, is made by and among SITEL Worldwide Corporation, a Delaware corporation
(the "Company"), Onex American Holdings Subco LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (in its capacity as the representative of the Stockholders,
the "Stockholder Representative" and in all other capacities hereunder,
"Onex"), Groupe Acticall S.A., a Luxembourg societe anonyme (the "Purchaser")
and Saturn Merger Sub Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly owned
subsidiary of the Purchaser (the "Merger Sub"). Capitalized terms used and not
otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in Article XII.

WHEREAS, the Purchaser desires to acquire one hundred percent (100%) of the
issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company in a reverse subsidiary
merger pursuant to which the Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein (the "Merger");
and

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors (or the equivalent governing
bodies) of the Purchaser, the Merger Sub and the Company have approved this
Agreement, the Merger and the related transactions contemplated hereby, upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

Article I

THE MERGER

1.01 The Merger.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
at the Effective Time, the Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company in
accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (as amended, the "DGCL"),
whereupon the separate existence of the Merger Sub shall cease and the Company
shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation") and a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Purchaser.

(b) At the Closing, the Company and the Merger Sub shall cause a certificate
of merger substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto (the "Certificate of
Merger") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware and shall make all other filings or recordings required
by the DGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective
at such time (the "Effective Time") as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as
the Purchaser and the Company mutually agree and specify in the Certificate of
Merger.

1 

(c) The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the
applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, at the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall succeed to
all the assets, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises and
become subject to all of the liabilities, restrictions, disabilities and
duties of the Company and the Merger Sub, all as provided under the DGCL.

1.02 Conversion of Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of any party:

(a) Each share of the Company's 12% Cumulative Participating Preferred Stock,
Series B, par value $0.01 per share (the "Series B Preferred Stock"), issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (but excluding any
such shares held immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Company as
treasury stock or by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or by the
Purchaser or the Merger Sub and excluding any Dissenting Shares) shall be
converted into the right to receive, without interest, (i) in cash at the
Closing, the greater of (x) the Series B Liquidation Value and (y) such
share's Closing Conversion Value, in either case which shall be payable to the
holder thereof in accordance with Section 1.04, plus (ii) such share's
Additional Per Share Consideration, if any (subject to, and without limiting
any rights or remedies of the Indemnified Parties under this Agreement or
otherwise as a result of, the obligation of the Stockholder that owns such
share immediately prior to the Effective Time to return to the applicable
Indemnified Parties the amount so received as a result of such conversion to
the extent such Stockholder has, at any time and from time to time, any
unsatisfied payment obligations to such Indemnified Parties pursuant to, and
subject to the terms and conditions of, Article IX). The aggregate
consideration to which holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock become
entitled in respect of such shares pursuant to clause (i)(x) of this Section
1.02(a) is referred to herein as the "Series B Liquidation Amount," which for
the avoidance of doubt shall be equal to zero in the event the Closing
Conversion Value exceeds the Series B Liquidation Value for all shares of
Series B Preferred Stock. For the avoidance of doubt, the amount payable
pursuant to this Section 1.02(a) may be zero, in which case the shares of
Series B Preferred Stock issued outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be canceled and no consideration shall be paid with respect
thereto.

(b) Each share of the Company's 16% Cumulative Participating Preferred Stock,
Series C, par value $0.01 per share (the "Series C Preferred Stock") issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (but excluding any
such shares held immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Company as
treasury stock or by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or by the
Purchaser or the Merger Sub and excluding any Dissenting Shares) shall be
converted into the right to receive, without interest, (i) in cash at the
Closing, the greater of (x) the Series C Liquidation Value and (y) such
share's Closing Conversion Value, in either case which shall be payable to the
holder thereof in accordance with Section 1.04, plus (ii) such share's
Additional Per Share Consideration, if any (subject to, and without limiting
any rights or remedies of the Indemnified Parties under this Agreement or
otherwise as a result of, the obligation of the Stockholder that owns such
share immediately prior to the Effective Time to return to the applicable
Indemnified Parties the 

amount so received as a result of such conversion to the extent such
Stockholder has, at any time and from time to time, any unsatisfied payment
obligations to such Indemnified Parties pursuant to, and subject to the terms
and conditions of, Article IX). The aggregate consideration to which holders
of shares of Series C Preferred Stock become entitled in respect of such
shares pursuant to clause (i)(x) of this Section 1.02(b) is referred to herein
as the "Series C Liquidation Amount," which for the avoidance of doubt shall
be equal to zero in the event the Closing Conversion Value exceeds the Series
C Liquidation Value for all shares of Series C Preferred Stock. For the
avoidance of doubt, the amount payable pursuant to this Section 1.02(b) may be
zero, in which case the shares of Series C Preferred Stock issued outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and no consideration
shall be paid with respect thereto.

(c) Each share of the Company's 16% Cumulative Participating Preferred Stock,
Series D, par value $0.01 per share (the "Series D Preferred Stock") issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (but excluding any
such shares held immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Company as
treasury stock or by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or by the
Purchaser or the Merger Sub and excluding any Dissenting Shares) shall be
converted into the right to receive, without interest, (i) in cash at the
Closing, the greater of (x) the Series D Liquidation Value and (y) such
share's Closing Conversion Value, in either case which shall be payable to the
holder thereof in accordance with Section 1.04, plus (ii) such share's
Additional Per Share Consideration, if any (subject to, and without limiting
any rights or remedies of the Indemnified Parties under this Agreement or
otherwise as a result of, the obligation of the Stockholder that owns such
share immediately prior to the Effective Time to return to the applicable
Indemnified Parties the amount so received as a result of such conversion to
the extent such Stockholder has, at any time and from time to time, any
unsatisfied payment obligations to such Indemnified Parties pursuant to, and
subject to the terms and conditions of, Article IX). The aggregate
consideration to which holders of shares of Series D Preferred Stock become
entitled in respect of such shares pursuant to clause (i)(x) of this Section
1.02(c) is referred to herein as the "Series D Liquidation Amount," which for
the avoidance of doubt shall be equal to zero in the event the Closing
Conversion Value exceeds the Series D Liquidation Value for all shares of
Series D Preferred Stock. For the avoidance of doubt, the amount payable
pursuant to this Section 1.02(c) may be zero, in which case the shares of
Series D Preferred Stock issued outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be canceled and no consideration shall be paid with respect
thereto.

(d) Each share of the Company's Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share,
including Restricted Shares and shares of Common Stock issued under Section
1.06 for Exchangeable Shares (the "Common Stock"), issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (but excluding any such shares held
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Company as treasury stock or by
any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or by the Purchaser or the Merger
Sub and excluding any Dissenting Shares), shall be converted into the right to
receive in cash at the Closing, without interest, an amount equal to the Per
Share Portion multiplied by the Closing Common Merger Consideration, which
shall be payable to the holder thereof in accordance with Section 1.04, plus
(ii) such share's 

Additional Per Share Consideration, if any (subject to, and without limiting
any rights or remedies of the Indemnified Parties under this Agreement or
otherwise as a result of, the obligation of the Stockholder that owns such
share immediately prior to the Effective Time to return to the applicable
Indemnified Parties the amount so received as a result of such conversion to
the extent such Stockholder has, at any time and from time to time, any
unsatisfied payment obligations to such Indemnified Parties pursuant to, and
subject to the terms and conditions of, Article IX). For the avoidance of
doubt, the amount payable pursuant to this Section 1.02(d) may be zero, in
which case the shares of Common Stock issued outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be canceled and no consideration shall be paid with
respect thereto. The aggregate consideration to which holders of Common Stock
and Preferred Stock become entitled at the Closing pursuant to Sections
1.02(a) through 1.02(d), inclusive, (together with the Canada Dividend Amount)
is referred to herein as the "Merger Consideration." The Common Stock, the
Preferred Stock and all other series and classes of capital stock of the
Company are sometimes referred to herein collectively as the "Company Stock."

(e) Each share of Company Stock held immediately prior to the Effective Time
by the Company as treasury stock or by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company or by the Purchaser or the Merger Sub shall be canceled and
extinguished and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

(f) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into or represent the right to
receive any portion of the Merger Consideration or any Additional Per Share
Consideration. Each holder of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only to such
rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Shares, unless and
until such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses
its appraisal rights under the DGCL. All Dissenting Shares held by
Stockholders that shall have failed to perfect or that effectively shall have
withdrawn or lost their right to appraisal of such shares of Company Stock
under the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to
have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive
(i) the consideration to which such Stockholders become entitled at the
Closing pursuant to Sections 1.02(a) through 1.02(d), without interest, in
accordance with Section 1.04, plus (ii) such share's Additional Per Share
Consideration. The Company shall give the Purchaser (i) prompt notice of any
demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands,
and any other related instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by
the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The
Purchaser and the Company shall keep one another reasonably informed regarding
any such negotiations, proceedings or demands and shall give due consideration
to the other's advice with respect thereto. The Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of the Purchaser, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer
to settle or settle any such demands.

(g) From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Company Stock (whether
or not represented by certificates evidencing ownership of Company Stock)
outstanding 

immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Company Stock except as otherwise provided for herein or under
applicable Law. The portion of the Merger Consideration and the Additional Per
Share Consideration paid or payable pursuant to Section 1.02 in respect of
shares of Company Stock shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Stock, and from and after
the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfer on the
records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(h) Each share of the Merger Sub's common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non‑assessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation. Each stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any
shares of common stock shall continue to evidence ownership of such share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(i) In the event that the Closing Conversion Value of any share of Preferred
Stock (other than any share held immediately prior to the Effective Time by
the Company as treasury stock or by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company
or by the Purchaser or the Merger Sub) would exceed the Liquidation Value of
such share as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, then the number of
shares of Common Stock that such share of Preferred Stock would be convertible
into (as set forth in the definition of Closing Conversion Value) shall be
deemed outstanding for purposes of the definition of Per Share Portion.

1.03 Merger Consideration.

(a) At least two (2) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, the
Company shall deliver to the Purchaser its statement setting forth its good
faith determination of the Transaction Expenses (the "Transaction Expense
Statement," which shall be deemed to update the Transaction Expenses Schedule)
and its statement setting forth its good faith determination of the Closing
Net Indebtedness (the "Closing Net Indebtedness Statement" ).

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Closing Common Merger
Consideration" means (i) the Adjusted Consideration, minus (ii) the Series B
Liquidation Amount, minus (iii) the Series C Liquidation Amount, minus (iv)
the Series D Liquidation Amount, minus (v) the Canada Dividend Amount;
provided that if the Closing Common Merger Consideration would be a negative
amount, the Closing Common Merger Consideration shall be zero. The Cash and
Indebtedness Schedule sets forth the amount of Cash and Indebtedness of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (which for the avoidance of doubt shall include
the aggregate amount of all prepayment premiums, penalties or breakage costs
that would arise upon prepayment of such Indebtedness on the Closing Date), in
each case as of the date of the Latest Balance Sheet (such amounts, the "Cash
Adjustment" and "Indebtedness Adjustment," respectively). For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Per Share Portion" means a fraction, the numerator of
which is one, and the denominator of which is equal to (i) the number of
shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than shares held immediately prior to the 

Effective Time by the Company as treasury stock or by any wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company or by the Purchaser or the Merger Sub), including
Restricted Shares and shares of Common Stock issued under Section 1.06 for
Exchangeable Shares, plus (ii) the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock
deemed outstanding pursuant to Section 1.02(i).

1.04 Company Stock Exchange.

(a) The Stockholder Representative will effect the exchange of cash for shares
of Company Stock which are entitled to payment pursuant to Section 1.02. Any
fees or expenses of the Stockholder Representative in this capacity shall be
deemed to be Transaction Expenses for all purposes hereunder.

(b) In connection with such exchange, by no later than ten (10) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, the Stockholder Representative shall provide the
Stockholders who or which are reasonably likely to be entitled to any portion
of the Merger Consideration with a Letter of Transmittal, substantially in the
form of Exhibit B attached hereto (the "Letter of Transmittal"), at their
respective addresses to be provided to the Stockholder Representative by the
Company no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. The
Stockholder Representative shall pay each holder of Company Stock (including
holders of Restricted Shares) as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(each, a "Stockholder") who has surrendered to the Company the certificates
representing his, her or its shares of Company Stock, or an affidavit
contemplated by Section 1.04(e), for cancellation together with a duly
executed and completed Letter of Transmittal, the amount of cash to which such
Stockholder is entitled at the Closing under Section 1.02 in respect of such
shares of Company Stock. No portion of the Merger Consideration shall be paid
to any Stockholder unless and until such Stockholder shall have surrendered to
the Company the certificates representing his, her or its shares of Company
Stock, or an affidavit contemplated by Section 1.04(e), for cancellation
together with a duly executed and completed Letter of Transmittal. The Company
shall promptly upon receipt provide the Stockholder Representative with copies
of any such certificates, Letters of Transmittal or affidavits.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Purchaser shall transfer to the
Stockholder Representative via wire transfer of immediately available funds.
in accordance with wire transfer instructions provided to the Purchaser by the
Stockholder Representative no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration (less any
amounts contemplated to be paid through the payroll system of the Surviving
Corporation pursuant to the proviso to Section 2.02(c)). Any amounts payable
with respect to the Exchangeable Shares pursuant to Section 1.06 (including
the Canada Dividend Amount) shall be deposited by the Stockholder
Representative with the Canada Exchange Subsidiary, pursuant to the Articles
of Incorporation of such entity, in accordance with wire transfer instructions
provided to the Stockholder Representative by the Company no later than three
(3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. The Stockholder Representative
shall hold all funds deposited with it and deliver them in accordance with the
terms and conditions hereof. 

(d) Surrendered shares of Company Stock shall forthwith be canceled. Until so
surrendered and exchanged, each share of Company Stock shall from and after
the Effective Time (subject, in the case of Dissenting Shares, to appraisal
rights under the DGCL) represent solely the right to receive the portion of
the Merger Consideration into which it was converted pursuant to Section 1.02.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any certificate representing one or more
shares of Company Stock shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then, upon
the making of an affidavit of such fact by the Stockholder claiming such
certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed to the Company, the Stockholder
Representative shall (subject to such conditions as the Stockholder
Representative may reasonably impose) issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed certificate, the portion of the Merger Consideration to be paid
in respect of the shares of Company Stock represented by such certificate, as
contemplated by this Article I.

(f) If a cash payment pursuant to Section 1.02 is to be made to a Person other
than the Person whose name is reflected on the certificate representing shares
of Company Stock surrendered in exchange therefor, it will be a condition of
the issuance of such payment that the certificate so surrendered be properly
endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting such exchange will have (i) paid to the Company or any agent
designated by it any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment
of any portion of the Merger Consideration in any name other than that of the
registered holder of the certificate surrendered or (ii) established to the
satisfaction of the Company or any agent designated by it that such Tax has
been paid or is not payable.

(g) Any portion of the Merger Consideration that remains unclaimed by the
former holders of Company Stock for twelve (12) months after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to the Purchaser. Any former holder of Company Stock
that has not complied with this Section 1.04 prior to the end of such twelve
(12) month period shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
thereafter look only to the Purchaser (subject to abandoned property, escheat
or other similar Laws) but only as a general creditor thereof for payment of
its claim for its portion of the Merger Consideration. To the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, any portion of the Merger Consideration that
remains unclaimed immediately prior to the date on which it would otherwise
become subject to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law shall become
the property of the Stockholders as Additional Consideration and, to the
extent such portion had been delivered to the Purchaser pursuant to the first
sentence of this Section 1.04(g), and except as otherwise contemplated by the
last sentence of this Section 1.04(g), the Purchaser shall pay such portion to
the Stockholder Representative for distribution as such, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Any former
holder of Company Stock that has not complied with this Section 1.04 prior to
the date of such payment shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, thereafter look only (except as otherwise contemplated by the last
sentence of this Section 1.04(g)) to the Stockholder Representative (subject
to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) but only as a general
creditor thereof for payment of its claim for its portion of the Merger
Consideration. No interest 

shall be payable for the cash amounts delivered to the Purchaser pursuant to
this Section 1.04 which are subsequently delivered to holders of Company
Stock. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.04, none of
the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or any other party hereto shall be
liable to any Stockholder for any amount paid to a public official pursuant to
any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any Additional Consideration
payable hereunder (including pursuant to Section 11.10) shall be paid in the
same manner as the Merger Consideration (including through the payroll system
of the Surviving Corporation pursuant to the proviso in Section 2.02(c) if
applicable).

(h) The Stockholder Representative shall act as agent in effecting the
exchange of the applicable Merger Consideration in return for the Company
Stock.

Plans, shall automatically become fully vested and free of any forfeiture
restrictions, and each Restricted Share shall be considered an outstanding

to receive the Per Share Portion multiplied by the Closing Common Merger
Consideration plus such Restricted Share's Additional Per Share Consideration,
in each case in accordance with and subject to the provisions of Section
1.02(d).

of the Redemption Call Right (as defined in the Articles of Incorporation of

to take such actions as may be necessary or desirable to facilitate the
exercise of the Redemption Call Right. The payment of the Redemption Call
Purchase Price in respect of each Exchangeable Share acquired by the Company
pursuant to the exercise of the Redemption Call Right shall be satisfied on
the basis of (i) one share of Common Stock issued in satisfaction of the
Current Market Price (as defined in the Articles of Incorporation of the
Canada Exchange Subsidiary) for such Exchangeable Share (and such Common Stock
shall be outstanding at the Effective Time for all purposes of this Agreement
(including Section 1.02(d)) and (ii) the Redemption Dividend Amount (as
defined in the Articles of Incorporation of the Canada Exchange Subsidiary)
for such Exchangeable Share, which shall be payable to the holder thereof in
accordance with Section 1.04. The aggregate amount of such Redemption Dividend
Amounts shall be referred to herein as the "Canada Dividend Amount."

Employee Benefits Schedule is not required to include any Cash Bonus Plans,
offer letters or employment agreements with Employees or Independent
Contractors with annual base salary or base wages of less than $200,000,
except for any Employee who is (i) at the Vice President employment level or
above and (ii) entitled to severance or other notice benefits that are
materially more beneficial than those severance or notice benefits required
under applicable Law. With respect to each Plan required to be set forth on
the Employee Benefits Schedule, the Company has made available to the
Purchaser prior to the date hereof (or, if entered into after the date hereof,

applicable, true and complete copies of (i) the most recent plan and trust
documents and any amendments thereto, or summary of the plan to the extent not

of such letter that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
qualified status of such Plan. In all material respects, the Plans comply in
form, administration and operation with their terms and with the requirements
of the Code and ERISA and other applicable Laws.

(c) With respect to the Plans and the Foreign Plans, all material
contributions and premium payments (including in respect of pension guarantee
funds) required by the terms of a Plan, a Foreign Plan or applicable Law have
been timely made or, to the extent not yet due, have been properly accrued in

combination with any other event, will not accelerate the time of payment or
vesting or increase the amount 

of compensation or benefits due under any Plan or Foreign Plan. None of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether alone or in combination
with any other event, will result in any excess parachute payment giving rise

Section 280G of the Code. No employee, director or consultant is entitled to
be grossed up or otherwise reimbursed or made whole by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries for any Taxes that may arise pursuant to Sections 409A, 4999
and 280G of the Code.

(e) No Plan is under audit or is the subject of an investigation by the

respects in accordance with its terms and the requirements of applicable Law

6.07 Merger Sub. The Merger Sub is a newly organized corporation, formed
solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Prior to the date hereof, the Merger Sub has not engaged in any
business activities or conducted any operations other 

than in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Merger Sub is a wholly owned Subsidiary of the Purchaser.

6.08 Financing.

(a) The Purchaser has received and accepted executed commitment letters dated
July 10, 2015 (the "Debt Commitment Letters") from Societe Generale, SG
Americas Securities, LLC, BNP Paribas and BNP Paribas Securities Corp,
relating to the commitment of the Lenders party thereto to provide, subject to
the terms and conditions thereof, the full amount of the debt financing stated
therein (the "Debt Financing"). The Purchaser has also received and accepted
an executed commitment letter dated July 10, 2015 (the "Equity Commitment
Letter" and together with the Debt Commitment Letters, the "Commitment
Letters") from the Creadev, a French societe par actions simplifiee (the
"Investor"), relating to the commitment by the Investor to provide or cause to
be provided, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, equity financing in
an aggregate amount of $400,000,000 (the "Equity Financing" and together with
the Debt Financing, the "Financing").

(b) On or prior to the date hereof, the Purchaser has delivered to the Company
true and correct copies of the executed Equity Commitment Letter and Debt
Commitment Letters as in effect on the date hereof (including, the exhibits
and annexes thereto), and any fee letters (the "Fee Letters") related thereto
(with only fee amounts, dates and certain other economic terms, including in
respect of the "market flex" and "securities demand" provisions (none of which
would adversely affect the amount or availability of the Debt Financing),
redacted).

(c) Except as set forth in the Commitment Letters, there are no conditions
precedent to the obligations of the Investor to provide the Equity Financing
or the Lenders to provide the Debt Financing or any contingencies. Other than
the Debt Commitment Letters and the Fee Letters, there are no side letters or
other agreements, contracts or arrangements (except for customary engagement
letters) that would increase the conditionality or reduce the amount of the
Debt Financing.

(d) Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions in Section 3.01, the Debt
Financing, when funded in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letters, and the
Equity Financing, when funded in accordance with the Equity Commitment Letter,
together with available cash on hand (taking into account any restrictions on
use and costs of repatriation), will provide Purchaser with cash proceeds on
the Closing Date in an amount sufficient to pay any amounts required to be
paid pursuant to Article II, including the payment of the Merger
Consideration, and to pay related fees and expenses.

(e) Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions in Section 3.01, as of the
date hereof, (i) to the knowledge of the Purchaser, there is no fact or
occurrence that would cause the conditions to funding of the Equity Financing
or Debt Financing not to be satisfied at or before the Closing, and (ii)
Purchaser has no reason to believe that the commitments under the Commitment
Letters will not be funded on the Closing Date. 

(f) As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letters are valid, binding and
enforceable against the Purchaser, and to the Purchaser's knowledge, the other
parties thereto, in accordance with their respective terms (subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and other laws affecting creditors' rights generally and general
principles of equity), and are in full force and effect, and assuming the
accuracy of the Company's representations and warranties contained in Article
IV, no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or
both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the
part of the Purchaser under the terms and conditions of the Commitment
Letters. As of the date hereof, neither the Equity Commitment Letter nor any
Debt Commitment Letter nor Fee Letter has been amended, restated or otherwise
modified or waived, and the respective commitments contained in the Commitment
Letters have not been withdrawn, modified or rescinded. Purchaser has paid in
full any and all commitment fees or other fees or expenses required to be paid
pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letters on or before the date of this
Agreement. The Equity Commitment Letter provides, and will continue to
provide, that the Company is a third party beneficiary thereof and is entitled
to enforce such agreement solely to the extent expressly provided therein.

(g) In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing by
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or any other financing or other
transactions be a condition to any of the Purchaser's or the Merger Sub's
obligations hereunder.

6.09 Solvency. Assuming (i) the representations and warranties of the Company
contained in this Agreement are true and correct in all material respects,
(ii) the Company has complied in all material respects with its obligations
under this Agreement and (iii) the accuracy of Section 4.05, immediately after
giving effect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will be Solvent.
For purposes of this Section 6.09, "Solvent" means, with respect to Purchaser
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that:

(a) The fair value of the assets of the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, shall be greater than the total amount of the liabilities,
subordinated, contingent or otherwise, of the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole;

(b) Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are able to pay their
debts and liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such
liabilities become absolute and matured; and

(c) Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are not engaged in, and
are not about to engage in, business for which they have unreasonably small
capital.

its Subsidiaries, (b) such access shall occur in such a manner as the Company
reasonably determines to be appropriate to protect the confidentiality of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (c) nothing herein shall

any such access or information and thereafter shall cooperate with the
Purchaser and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such access or

Representatives in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to cause any
such competitive harm (including by entering in to a "clean team" or similar
agreement), result in any such waiver of legal privilege (including by
entering into a common interest or joint defense agreement) or violate any
such Law or the provisions of any such agreement. The Purchaser acknowledges
that the Purchaser is and remains bound by the Confidentiality Agreement,
between the Purchaser and the Company dated March 9, 2015 (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"). The access and information provided pursuant to

Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated herein, (2)

any analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion
or proposal made or submitted to a Governmental Entity in connection with any
suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding under or relating to any
Antitrust Law or other Law applicable to the Company for the consummation of

Entity or Third Party consents, waivers, authorizations or approvals which may
be required to be obtained by the Purchaser or its Affiliates in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby (which assistance and cooperation
shall include timely furnishing to the Purchaser all information concerning
the Company and/or its Affiliates that counsel to the Purchaser reasonably
determines is required to be included in such documents or would be helpful in
obtaining such required consent, waiver, authorization or approval), but
subject to the exceptions set forth in the proviso of Section 7.02. The
Purchaser shall be responsible for one hundred percent (100%) of all fees,
expenses or other payments in order to obtain any consents or approvals or to
give notices in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
including any filing fees under the HSR Act, other Antitrust 

Laws and all other Laws or regulations applicable to the Purchaser or the
Company for the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein, except
as otherwise provided in Section 7.16. The Company shall not, without the
written consent of the Purchaser, which shall not be unreasonably conditioned,

any such body), necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, which will include any required notifications and consultations.
Each of the Company and the Purchaser will, and will cause its Affiliates to,
render full good faith cooperation to the other in providing in due time all
information required by Law or reasonably requested by applicable works
councils, labor unions and employee representatives with respect to (i) the

Subsidiaries, (iii) the material consequences of the transaction to the
Employees and (iv) the compensation and benefits to be provided to Employees

commercially reasonable efforts to (i) issue notices of optional redemption
(the "Redemption Notices") for the outstanding principal amounts of the notes
thereunder or (ii) take actions that are reasonably necessary for the
satisfaction, discharge and/or defeasance of such notes, and shall redeem or
satisfy, discharge and/or defease, as applicable, such notes at the Closing
(the "Notes Redemptions"); provided that to the extent that any action
described in clause (i) or (ii) can be conditioned on the occurrence of the
Closing, it will be so conditioned, and, prior to the Company being required
to take any of the actions described in clause (ii) above, the Purchaser shall
deposit with the trustees under the Existing Indentures the amounts sufficient
to effect such redemption, satisfaction, discharge and/or defeasance (and in
the event of any loss with respect to the funds deposited with the trustees,
or delay of the anticipated Closing, the Purchaser shall deposit additional
funds sufficient to satisfy such redemption, satisfaction, discharge and/or
defeasance, as applicable).

(c) The Purchaser shall prepare all necessary and appropriate documentation in
connection with the Notes Redemptions, including the Redemption Notices, as
applicable. Each of the Company and the Purchaser shall, and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its representatives to, provide
cooperation reasonably requested by the other in the preparation of any
Redemption Notices. All notices to the trustee and mailings to the holders of
the notes under the Existing Indentures in connection with the Notes

cause its counsel to, furnish legal opinions in customary form and scope
relating to the Company and required by the Existing Indentures in connection
with any Notes Redemptions.

(d) The Purchaser shall immediately, upon request by the Company, reimburse

respective Affiliates and representatives from and against any and all losses,
damages, costs and expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection
with the Notes Redemptions to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law;

or result from the fraud or intentional misrepresentation of the Company, its
Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates and representatives.

the earlier termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01, except as

Subsidiaries and representatives not to take, any action to encourage,
initiate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or provide any
information to, any Person (other than the Purchaser and the Purchaser's
Representatives) concerning any purchase of the Common Stock or any merger,
sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries or
similar

Stockholder Approval or the earlier termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 10.01, the Company or its board of directors, directly or indirectly
through its representatives, may (i) furnish nonpublic information to any
Third Party making a Competing Proposal (provided, however, that prior to so
furnishing such information, the Company has entered into a customary
confidentiality agreement with such Third Party), and (ii) engage in
discussions or negotiations with such Third Party with respect to the
Competing Proposal, in each case if: (x) such Third Party has submitted a bona
fide written Competing Proposal that did not result from a material breach of
this Section 7.07 and that the board of directors of the Company, or any duly
authorized committee thereof, determines in good faith, after consultation
with its financial and legal advisors, constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal, and (y) the board of directors of
the Company, or any duly authorized committee thereof, determines in good
faith, after consultation with legal counsel, that failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable
Law. Prior to taking any of the actions referred to in this Section 7.07(b),
the Company shall notify Purchaser that it proposes to furnish non‑public
information and/or enter into discussions or negotiations as provided in this
Section 7.07(b).

Recommendation; or (ii) approve, endorse or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve, endorse or recommend, any Competing Proposal (any of the actions
described in clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 7.07(c), an "Adverse
Recommendation Change"); or (iii) cause or permit the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar
definitive agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement) with respect to
any Competing Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, at any time prior to the Stockholder Approval, the board of
directors of the Company shall be permitted to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change, if the board of directors of the Company determines in
good faith, after consultation with its legal advisors, that failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

(d) The Company shall not be entitled to effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change as permitted under Section 7.07(c) with respect to a Superior Proposal
unless (i) the Company has provided a written notice (a "Notice of Superior
Proposal") to Purchaser and Merger Sub that the Company intends to take such
action and describing the material terms and conditions of the Superior
Proposal that is the basis of such action (including the identity of the Third
Party and providing copies of all proposed definitive documents), (ii) during
the three (3) Business Day period following Purchaser's and Merger Sub's
receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause
its representatives to, 

negotiate with Purchaser and Merger Sub in good faith (to the extent Purchaser
and Merger Sub desire to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that such Superior Proposal ceases to
constitute a Superior Proposal; and (iii) following the end of the three (3)
Business Day period, the board of directors of the Company shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with its legal and financial
advisors and taking into account any changes to this Agreement proposed in
writing by Purchaser and Merger Sub in response to the Notice of Superior
Proposal or otherwise, that the Superior Proposal giving rise to the Notice of
Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal. Any material
amendment to the financial terms or any other material amendment of such
Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and the
Company shall be required to comply again with the requirements of this
Section 7.07(d); provided, however, that references to the three (3) Business
Day period above shall be deemed to be references to a two (2) Business Day
period.

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, following the Stockholder Approval, (i) neither the
Company nor the board of directors of the Company, directly or through its
representatives, may provide any information to a Third Party as contemplated
under Section 7.07(b) and (ii) neither the board of directors of the Company
nor any committee thereof shall make an Adverse Recommendation Change.

7.08 Notification.

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, if the Company becomes aware
of (i) any variance from the representations and warranties contained in
Article IV that would cause the condition set forth in Section 3.01(a) not to
be satisfied, or (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of the Company
set forth in this Agreement that would cause the condition set forth in
Section 3.01(c) not to be satisfied or (iii) any change, effect, event,
occurrence, state of facts or development that would cause the condition set
forth in Section 3.01(d) not to be satisfied, the Company shall, as soon as
reasonably practicable, disclose to the Purchaser in writing such variance,
breach, change, effect, event, occurrence, state of facts or development.

(b) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, the Company shall, as soon as
reasonably practicable, make available to the Purchaser a copy of (i) any
written notice received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from any
Third Party alleging that the consent of such Third Party is or may be
required in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (ii) any written notice received by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries from any customer, supplier, vendor, licensor, licensee or
other business partner to the effect that such customer, supplier, vendor,
licensor, licensee or other business partner is terminating or otherwise
materially adversely modifying its relationship with Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as a result of any of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) any written notice between any
Governmental Entity and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(iv) any material suits, 

actions, proceedings or investigations commenced or, to the Company's
knowledge, threatened that relate to the consummation of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger.

(c) The delivery of any notice or the making of any disclosure pursuant to
this Section 7.08 shall not (i) limit or otherwise affect any rights or
remedies available to the Purchaser or (ii) be deemed to amend or supplement
the Disclosure Schedules or prevent or cure any misrepresentation, breach of
warranty or breach of covenant. The failure to deliver any notice or make any
disclosure pursuant to Section 7.08(a)(i) shall be deemed a breach of the
representation or warranty to which such notice or disclosure relates
hereunder and shall in no event be deemed a breach of a covenant or agreement.

7.09 Cooperation with Financing.

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to use their respective reasonable best efforts to provide to the
Purchaser, in each case at the Purchaser's sole cost and expense, cooperation

follows:

(i) promptly providing the Lenders and their respective agents with (A) all
financial statements, pro forma financial statements and other information

otherwise necessary to satisfy the conditions in connection with the Debt
Financing and (B) customary letters to the Lenders authorizing the
distribution of information to prospective lenders which may include customary
representations to the Lenders that such information does not contain a
material misstatement or omission and does not contain material non-public
information with respect to the Company, its Affiliates or any of its or their
respective securities for purposes of any applicable securities Laws (provided
that such letters shall exculpate the Company and its Subsidiaries from any
liability related to the use or misuse of such information by such prospective
lenders) (collectively, the "Required Information"),

(ii) causing the senior officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries to
participate in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, due diligence
sessions (or other sessions with prospective lenders, investors and rating

(iii) (A) reasonably assisting with the preparation of any pledge and security
documents, any loan agreement, currency or interest hedging agreement, legal
opinions, officers certificates and other definitive financing and closing
documents as may be necessary and customary in connection with a financing

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any such document or agreement
shall be effective until the Closing, and (B) to the extent reasonably
requested at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, providing
the documentation and other 

information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries required by bank

the Debt Commitment Letters),

(iv) reasonably cooperating with the Lenders and their respective agents' due
diligence, to the extent not unreasonably interfering with the business of the
Company,

provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates and
representatives shall not (v) be required to execute and deliver or enter into
any certificate, instrument, agreement or other document in connection with
the Debt Financing, including any solvency certificate, that would be
effective prior to the Closing Date, (w) be required to cooperate or assist to

cooperation or assistance, any personal financial liability that will not be
repaid or reimbursed in full by the Purchaser, (x) be required to pay any
commitment or other similar fee or incur any liability in connection with the
Debt Financing prior to the Closing, (y) have any liability (contingent or
otherwise) under any loan agreement or any related document or any other
agreement or document related to the Debt Financing which is not contingent on
the Closing (other than the authorization letters described above) or (z) be
required to waive or amend any terms of the Agreement.

(b) Purchaser shall immediately, upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by any
of the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Stockholders and their respective
Affiliates and representatives in connection with the cooperation of the
Company and its Subsidiaries contemplated by this Section 7.09 and shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Affiliates and representatives from and against any and all losses, damages,
costs and expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the
arrangement of the Debt Financing and any information used in connection
therewith to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, except in the
event any such losses, damages, costs or expenses arose out of or result from
the fraud or intentional misrepresentation of the Company, its Subsidiaries or
their respective Affiliates and representatives. The Company hereby consents
to the use of its and its Subsidiaries' logos in connection with the Debt
Financing; provided, however, that such logos are used solely in a manner
permitted by the Confidentiality Agreement and that is not intended to or
reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything herein to the contrary, the
obligations of the Company set forth in this Section 7.09 are the sole
obligations of the Stockholders, the Company and their Affiliates and
representatives with respect to the Debt Financing. Notwithstanding anything
in this Section 7.09 to the contrary, prior to the Closing, the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their 

Affiliates and representatives shall not be required to deliver or cause the
delivery of (A) any legal opinions, (B) any accountants' comfort letters or
reliance letters, (C) any solvency certificates or opinions (except as
expressly contemplated in clause (c) of Section 7.09(a)) or (D) any approvals
by the Company's or its Subsidiaries' board of directors, in each case in
connection with Purchaser's arrangement of any debt financing. All information
provided by the Company or any of its representatives pursuant to this Section
7.09 shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement, except that the Purchaser shall be permitted to disclose such
information to the Lenders, other potential lenders and rating agencies in
accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letters, subject to customary
confidentiality undertakings by the Lenders, other lenders and rating agencies
and potential lenders similar to those in the Confidentiality Agreement.

7.10 Stockholder Litigation. The Company shall promptly notify the Purchaser
of any claims or threatened claims of the type described in Section
9.02(a)(v)and shall keep the Purchaser reasonably informed regarding any such
claims or threatened claims. Without limiting Section 7.01(b)(xvi), the
Company (a) shall give the Purchaser the opportunity, at the Purchaser's sole
cost and expense, to participate in the defense or settlement of any such
stockholder litigation, (b) shall give due consideration to the Purchaser's
advice with respect to such stockholder litigation and (c) shall not, except
with the prior written consent of the Purchaser, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, make any payment with respect to such litigation or
settle or offer to settle any such litigation. For the avoidance of doubt, any
expenses incurred by the Purchaser pursuant to this Section 7.10 shall be the
sole responsibility of the Purchaser and shall not be considered a Loss for
purposes of indemnification.

7.11 Third Party Consents. The Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to promptly obtain such written consents, waivers, approvals and
authorizations of Third Parties, give notices to Third Parties and take such
other actions as may be necessary or appropriate in order to effect the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, in each case to the extent set forth on the Authorization Schedule
and marked with an "*" thereon or otherwise reasonably requested by the
Purchaser, to enable the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
continue to carry on the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries
immediately after the Effective Time and to keep in full force and effect,
preserve all rights and benefits under, and avoid the breach, violation of or
termination of any Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party; provided that the failure to obtain any such consent, waiver,
approval or authorization prior to the Closing Date shall not prevent the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company will (a)
consult with the Purchaser beforehand regarding the process for seeking such
consents, waivers, approvals and authorizations, giving such notices and
taking such other actions, (b) provide the Purchaser with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment in advance on the forms of all such consent
requests and notices and (c) give due consideration to all comments thereto
made by the Purchaser. Without limiting Section 7.01(b)(xv), the Company and
its Affiliates shall not be required or permitted to amend or modify any
material terms of any Contract in order to obtain any required consent,
waiver, approval or authorization. 

7.12 Termination of Affiliated Transactions. Unless notified otherwise by the
Purchaser prior to twenty (20) days before the anticipated Closing Date, the
Company shall terminate or cause to be terminated all Contracts marked with an
"*" set forth in the Affiliated Transactions Schedule and any other Contracts
set forth (or required to be set forth, or would have been required to be set
forth if such Contract were (i) material or (ii) entered into prior to the
date hereof) on the Affiliated Transaction Schedule reasonably requested by
the Purchaser prior to twenty (20) days before the anticipated Closing Date
(including any provisions of such Contracts that purport to survive any such
termination), including sending all required notices, such that each such
contract shall be of no further force or effect as of the Effective Time, in
each case without any remaining liability of any kind on the part of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the Purchaser as a result of or in
connection with such termination or such Contract (other than Transaction
Expenses); provided that with respect to the foregoing such Contracts (a) that
are reasonably requested by the Purchaser prior to twenty (20) days before the
anticipated Closing Date but are not marked with an "*" set forth in the
Affiliated Transactions Schedule and (b) the termination of which requires the
consent of Persons that are not controlled, directly or indirectly, by the
Company, Onex, Onex Corporation, or any of their respective directors,
officers or employees (other than individuals who are (x) not officers or
directors of the Company and (y) affiliated with Onex, Onex Corporation or the
Company solely as a result of their capacity as employees of the Company or
its Subsidiaries or other portfolio companies of Onex) or any Person that has
executed the Stockholder Consent or the Joinder and Waiver Agreement, the
Company shall be required to use only commercially reasonable efforts to
effect such termination). Any amounts paid or required to be paid by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or other liabilities of any kind on the
part of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that arise, in connection with
the termination of such contracts shall be deemed to be Transaction Expenses
for all purposes hereunder. The Purchaser shall not have any liability of any
kind to the Company, the Stockholder Representative, any Stockholder or any
other Person for any liabilities of any kind resulting from the Company
seeking the termination of such contracts.

7.13 Resignation and Release Letters. The Company shall (a) cause such
officers and directors of the Company and its U.S. Subsidiaries as the
Purchaser may designate in writing at least five (5) Business Days prior to
the Closing to and (b) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
officers and directors of the Company's non-U.S. Subsidiaries as the Purchaser
may designate in writing at least fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the
Closing, to, in each case, execute a resignation and release letter
substantially in the form of (x) with respect to directors of the Company,
Exhibit E attached hereto (the "SWW Director Resignation and Release Letter"),
or (y) with respect to all other directors and officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, Exhibit F attached hereto (the "Director and Officer Resignation
Letter") in each case, to be effective as of the Effective Time.

7.14 State Takeover Statutes. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall not take
any action that would cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to
be prohibited by requirements imposed by an anti‑takeover or similar Law. In
the event that any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition,"
"supermajority," "affiliate transactions" or "business combination statute or
regulation" or other anti‑takeover Law (including Section 203 of the DGCL) may
become, or may be proposed to be, applicable to the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that would prohibit the
transaction contemplated hereby, the Company, at the 

direction of its board of directors, shall use its reasonable best efforts to
ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

7.15 Treatment of Swaps.

(a) At or prior to the Closing, the Company shall terminate or cause to be
terminated that certain ISDA Master Agreement, dated September 24, 2007, by
and between J. Aron and Company and SITEL, LLC, as amended and supplemented (the
"J. Aron ISDA"), and all Transactions (as defined therein) thereunder and
Confirmations (as defined therein) thereto, in each case with no further
liabilities of any Person thereunder, and all amounts, if any, payable to the
applicable counterparty in connection therewith shall constitute Transaction
Expenses for all purposes hereunder.

(b) At the election of the Purchaser no later than twenty (20) days before the
anticipated Closing Date, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to, at
or prior to the Closing, either:

(i) terminate or cause to be terminated, effective as of the Closing, the ISDA
Master Agreements and Foreign Exchange Agreement set forth on Section (a)(vii)
of the Contracts Schedule (other than the J. Aron ISDA) and all similar
Contracts to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party (such
agreements, the "ISDA Agreements"), and all Transactions (as defined therein)
thereunder and Confirmations (as defined therein) thereto, and all amounts, if
any, payable to the applicable counterparty in connection therewith shall be
paid by the Company, with no further liabilities of any Person thereunder; or

(ii) obtain (effective as of the Closing) such written consents, waivers,
approvals and authorizations, give such notices and take such other actions as
may be necessary in order to keep in full force and effect, preserve all
rights and benefits under, and avoid the breach, violation or termination of,
and eliminate any termination right or event of default under, the ISDA
Agreements in connection with the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

provided, however, that in the case of either clause (i) or (ii), the
Stockholders shall have no liability in connection with or relating to any
such termination, consent, waiver or notice pursuant to this Section 7.15(b)
(and for the avoidance of doubt, no amounts relating to the ISDA Agreements or
the termination, waiver or approval of or under such agreements shall be
treated as Indebtedness or Transaction Expenses).

(c) In connection with actions taken pursuant to Section 7.15(b), the Company
will (i) consult with the Purchaser beforehand regarding the process for
terminating such Contracts or seeking such consents, waivers, approvals and
authorizations, giving such 

notices and taking such other actions, (ii) provide the Purchaser with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment in advance on the forms of all
such terminations and/or consent requests and notices, (iii) give due
consideration to all comments thereto made by the Purchaser and (iv) obtain
the Purchaser's prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld) to the
terms (including financial terms) of such terminations and/or consents.

7.16 FCA Approval.

(a) If the UK Financial Conduct Authority (the "FCA") shall not have given
notice under Part XII of the UK Financial Services and Markets Act 2000
("FSMA") that it unconditionally approves or has no objection to the Purchaser
(or its direct or indirect controlling stockholder) becoming a controller
(within the meaning of section 422 of FSMA) of SITEL UK Limited (such notice,
"FCA Approval"), the Purchaser may, at its sole election, request by written
notice to the Company no earlier than ten (10) Business Days and no later than
five (5) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, that the Company
and Onex cause (and the Company and Onex shall, to the extent legally
permissible, cause) SITEL Europe Limited (England and Wales) to transfer or
distribute, for no consideration, immediately prior to the Closing, 100% of
the equity interests of SITEL UK Limited to a Person reasonably designated by
Onex that is (x) controlled by Onex, Onex Corporation or any of their
respective Affiliates, (y) not the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and (z)
a controller (within the meaning of section 422 of FSMA) of SITEL UK Limited
(the entity to which the equity interests of SITEL UK Limited are transferred
or distributed, the "Interim Controller," and the transfer or distribution
contemplated by this Section 7.16(a), the "FCA Restructuring").

(b) If the FCA Restructuring shall have been effected:

(i) from and after the date of the FCA Restructuring, the Purchaser and the
Company shall continue to use, and Onex shall cause the Interim Controller and
SITEL UK Limited to use, reasonable best efforts to promptly obtain the FCA
Approval;

(ii) promptly upon the receipt of the FCA Approval, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, Onex shall cause the Interim Controller to transfer, for no
additional consideration, 100% of the equity interests of SITEL UK Limited to
the Purchaser or such other Person as the Purchaser may designate (the
transfer contemplated by this Section 7.16(b)(ii), whether before or after the
Closing Date, the "FCA Return"); and

(iii) from the time of the FCA Restructuring until the time of the FCA Return,
(A) the Purchaser, the Company and Onex shall, and Onex shall cause the
Interim Controller and SITEL UK Limited to, enter into such reasonable
arrangements, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, as are reasonably
necessary to provide to the Purchaser and the Interim Controller the economic
and operational equivalent with respect to SITEL UK Limited as if the FCA
Approval had been obtained prior to the Closing and the FCA Restructuring had
not been effected and 

(B) Onex shall cause SITEL UK Limited to operate in the Ordinary Course of
Business;

(c) If the Purchaser shall not have elected to effect the FCA Restructuring or
the FCA Restructuring shall not be permitted by applicable Law (as a result of
there being no controller (within the meaning of section 422 of FSMA) of SITEL
UK Limited that is controlled by Onex, Onex Corporation or any of their
respective Affiliates and is not the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
for any other reason), notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, including Section 2.01, the Purchaser may, at its sole election, by
written notice to the Company, postpone the Closing to the earlier of (A) a
date on which the direct or indirect transfer of SITEL UK Limited to the
Purchaser may be effected in accordance with applicable Law and the Closing
would otherwise be required to occur in accordance with Section 2.01 and (B)
the Outside Date.

(d) Each party shall bear its own expenses in connection with the obtaining of
the FCA Approval.

regulatory filing or resolving any disputes related to this Agreement or pre-
Closing operations of the Company, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable notice, at the Stockholder Representative's expense, to (a) the
books and records (for the purpose of examining and copying) of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries with respect to periods or occurrences prior
to or on the Closing Date and (b) employees of the Surviving Corporation and

Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) such access shall occur
in such a manner as the Purchaser reasonably determines to be appropriate to
protect the confidentiality of the information being accessed and (iii)
nothing herein shall require the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or any

any legal privilege or (C) be in violation of applicable Law or the provisions
of any agreement to which the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or any of

the fact that it is withholding any such access and thereafter shall cooperate
with the Stockholder Representative and use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause such access to be provided to the Stockholder Representative and its
authorized representatives in a manner that would not reasonably be expected
to cause any such competitive harm, result in any such waiver of legal
privilege (including by entering into a common interest or joint defense
agreement) or violate any such Law or the provisions of any such agreement.
Unless otherwise consented to in writing by the Stockholder Representative,
the Purchaser shall not, and 

shall not permit the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries to, for a

portion thereof which the Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation may intend to
destroy, alter or dispose of.

8.02 Notification.

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, if the Purchaser becomes
aware of (i) any variance from the representations and warranties contained in
Article VI that would cause the condition set forth in Section 3.02(a) not to
be satisfied or (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of the Purchaser
or the Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement that would cause the condition
set forth in Section 3.02(b) not to be satisfied, the Purchaser shall, as soon
as reasonably practicable, disclose to the Company and the Stockholder
Representative in writing such variance or breach.

(b) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall, as soon
as reasonably practicable, make available to the Company a copy of (i) any

this Section 8.02 shall not (i) limit or otherwise affect any rights or
remedies available to the Company or (ii) be deemed to prevent or cure any
misrepresentation, breach of warranty or breach of covenant. The failure to
deliver any notice or make any disclosure pursuant to Section 7.08(a)(i) shall
be deemed a breach of the representation or warranty to which such notice or
disclosure relates hereunder and shall in no event be deemed a breach of a
covenant or agreement.

8.03 Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification.

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall
not, and shall not permit the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries to

Subsidiaries' certificate of formation, certification of incorporation,
articles of incorporation, operating agreement, bylaws, or equivalent
governing documents in effect as of the date hereof relating to the
exculpation or indemnification (including fee advancement) of any officers
and/or directors (unless required by Law), it being the intent of the parties
that the officers and directors of 

the Company and its Subsidiaries shall continue to be entitled to such
exculpation and indemnification (including fee advancement) as is provided to
such Persons thereunder as of the date hereof to the full extent of the Law.
The Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
honor and perform under all indemnification obligations under such governing
documents in effect as of the date hereof owed to any of the individuals who
were officers and/or directors of the Company or its Subsidiaries at or prior
to the Closing Date.

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Purchaser shall purchase a prepaid insurance
policy (i.e., "tail coverage") which provides liability insurance coverage for
the individuals who were officers and directors of the Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing on no less favorable terms
(including in amount and scope for directors and officers, management
liability, employment practices, fiduciary, crime and employed lawyers
coverage) as the policy or policies maintained by the Company or its
Subsidiaries as of the date hereof for the benefit of such individuals for an
aggregate period of not less than six (6) years with respect to claims arising
from acts, events or omissions that occurred at or prior to the Closing,
including with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, however, that the Purchaser shall not be required to pay a premium
for such "tail coverage" insurance policy in excess of two hundred fifty
percent (250%) of the annual premium currently paid by the Company and its
Subsidiaries (the "Premium Cap") (it being understood and agreed that in the
event such insurance policy cannot be obtained for such amount or less, in the
aggregate, (i) the Company, in its sole discretion, may nevertheless elect for
Purchaser to purchase such policy, in which case the amount by which the
premium for such policy exceeds the Premium Cap shall be treated as a
Transaction Expense or (ii) if the Company does not so elect, the Purchaser
shall purchase the greatest insurance coverage as may be obtained without
requiring payments in excess of the Premium Cap). Such policy shall be from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's or
its Subsidiaries' current insurance carrier with respect to directors' and
officers' liability insurance. For all purposes hereunder, Transaction
Expenses shall be deemed to include (A) fifty percent (50%) of the lesser of
(1) the cost of such policy and (2) the Premium Cap plus (B) one hundred
percent (100%) of the amount by which the cost of such policy exceeds the
Premium Cap.

(c) If the Surviving Corporation, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) is to consolidate with or merges into any other
Person and will not be the continuing or the Surviving Corporation or entity
of such consolidation or merger or (ii) is to transfer all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
for at least six (6) years after the Closing, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section
8.03. The provisions of this Section 8.03 are intended for the benefit of, and
will be enforceable by, each current and former officer, director or similar
functionary of the Company or its Subsidiaries and his or her heirs and
representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have
had by contract or otherwise. 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the
Closing Date) is made against any individuals who were officers and directors
of the Company and its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Closing Date or any
other party covered by directors' and officers' liability insurance, on or
prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date, the provisions of
this Section 8.03 shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in the Company
Organizational Documents, any Subsidiary Organizational Documents or any
Contract, the obligations of the Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation or
its successor pursuant to this Section 8.03 (i) shall be subject to any
limitation imposed by applicable Law and (ii) shall not be deemed to release
any of the individuals who were officers or directors of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Closing Date from his or her obligations
pursuant to this Agreement or any Related Agreement, nor shall any of the
individuals who were officers or directors of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries have any right of contribution, indemnification, or advancement
or reimbursement of expenses from the Surviving Corporation or its successor
or the Purchaser or any of their respective Subsidiaries (whether under this
Agreement, the Company Organizational Documents, any Subsidiary Organizational
Documents, any other Contract or otherwise) with respect to any Loss incurred
or sustained by such Person or any other Person (including any Indemnified
Party (and including the Surviving Corporation)) in connection with or as a
result of any Indemnifiable Matter (except to the extent such contribution,
indemnification or advancement or reimbursement of expenses is actually
recovered from a Third Party by the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries
from insurance, but net of any expenses incurred in obtaining such recovery,
including collection costs and reserves, deductibles, premium adjustments and
retrospectively rated premiums). Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the Purchaser shall have no obligation to maintain the existence of
the Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time.

8.04 Employment and Benefit Arrangements. For at least twelve (12) months
following the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide Employees of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries with compensation (including base salary, base wage rate and
bonus opportunity, but excluding any equity‑based awards where allowed under
applicable Law) that is equivalent to the compensation provided to such
Employees prior to the Closing and to either (i) maintain in effect on behalf
of Employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries all Plans, Foreign Plans and
any other employment, severance, termination, consulting, retirement and other
compensation and benefit plans, programs, arrangements, agreements and
policies (other than any equity‑based plans) of the Company or its
Subsidiaries as in effect as of the date hereof (the "Company Plans") or (ii)
provide all Employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries with compensation
and benefit plans, programs, arrangements, agreements and policies (other than
equity-based plans) that are substantially no less favorable to the
compensation and benefit plans, programs, arrangements, agreements and
policies provided to similarly situated employees of the Purchaser; provided
that such benefit plans, programs, arrangements, agreements and policies
provide a level of benefits that in the aggregate is substantially equivalent
to the 

aggregate level of benefits provided under the Company Plans as of the
Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8.04, for
fiscal year 2015, the Purchaser shall pay or shall cause to be paid in
accordance with the terms of the Purchaser's cash bonus plans (but utilizing
the Company's targets in determining the amount of any bonus payment
thereunder) at such time as payment is made under the Purchaser's cash bonus
plan (but provided that such payment shall be made no later than March 15,
2016, to the extent required to avoid the imposition of a penalty under
Section 409A of the Code) cash bonuses in an amount that at a minimum equals
the amount of the bonus accrual reflected on the Latest Financial Statements,
provided that such accrual shall have been made consistent with past practices
of the Company and such accrual for a month shall not exceed one hundred
percent (100%) of the monthly bonus amount for such month. The Purchaser shall
take all actions reasonably necessary, to the extent permitted under
applicable Law, so that Employees shall receive service credit for all
purposes (other than for purposes of benefit accrual in any plans other than
severance, termination, vacation, or paid time off plans, policies or
arrangements) under any compensation or benefit plans, programs, arrangements,
agreements and policies sponsored by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates,
except to the extent duplication of benefits would result. To the extent that
the Purchaser modifies any welfare benefit coverage Plan under which the
Employees participate, the Purchaser shall waive any applicable waiting
periods, pre‑existing conditions or actively‑at‑work requirements to the same
extent such waiting periods, pre‑existing conditions or actively‑at‑work
requirements would have been waived prior to the Closing, and shall give such
Employees credit under the new coverages or benefit plans for deductibles,
co‑insurance and out‑of‑pocket payments that have been paid or satisfied
during the plan year in which such welfare benefit coverage or plan
modification occurs. The Purchaser shall be solely responsible for any
obligations arising under Section 4980B of the Code with respect to all "MandA
qualified beneficiaries" as defined in Treasury Regulation §54.4980B‑9\.
Nothing in this Section 8.04 shall give any Third Party other than the parties
to this Agreement, including any Employees, any right to enforce the
provisions of this Section 8.04 as a third‑party beneficiary. Nothing herein
shall interfere with or otherwise limit the Purchaser's or its Affiliates'
(including the Surviving Corporation's and its Subsidiaries') right to
terminate the employment of any Employee at any time.

8.05 Regulatory Filings. The Purchaser shall make or cause to be made as
promptly as reasonably practicable all filings and submissions, if any,
required of the Purchaser under any applicable antitrust or noncompetition
Laws or regulations ("Antitrust Laws") or other Laws applicable to the
Purchaser for the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein
(including the transactions contemplated by Section 7.16), including those set
forth on the Antitrust Conditions Schedule. Without limiting the foregoing,
the Purchaser shall make or cause to be made no later than fifteen (15)
Business Days following the date hereof a draft notification with the European
Commission under the EC Merger Regulation in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Purchaser shall promptly comply with any
additional requests for information, including requests for production of
documents and production of witnesses for interviews or depositions by any
Governmental Entities. The Purchaser shall exercise its reasonable best
efforts to (i) obtain prior to the Outside Date such actions, nonactions,
waivers, approvals, consents and clearances as may be necessary, proper or
advisable under any Antitrust Laws and any other Laws applicable to the
Purchaser for the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein, and
(ii) prevent the entry of any order or other Law in any suit, claim, action,
investigation or proceeding 

brought by any Governmental Entity that would prohibit, make unlawful or delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
addition, the Purchaser shall (1) give the Company prompt notice of the
commencement or written threat of commencement of any suit, claim, action,
investigation or proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity with respect
to the transactions contemplated herein, (2) keep the Company informed as to
the status of any such suit, claim, action, investigation, proceeding or
threat, and (3) promptly inform the Company of any material communication to
or from any Governmental Entity regarding the transactions contemplated
herein. Except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity, the Purchaser
will consult and cooperate with the Company, and will consider in good faith
the views of the Company, in connection with any analysis, appearance,
presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or
submitted to a Governmental Entity in connection with any suit, claim, action,
investigation or proceeding under or relating to any Antitrust Law or other
Law applicable to the Purchaser for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein. Except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity,
the Purchaser will permit authorized representatives of the Company to be
present at each meeting or conference relating to any such legal proceeding
and to have access to and be consulted in connection with any document,
opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection
with any such legal proceeding. The Purchaser shall assist and cooperate with
the Company at the Company's reasonable request in the Company's preparing and
filing of all documents required to be submitted by the Company or its
Affiliates to any Governmental Entities in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and in obtaining any Governmental Entity or Third Party
consents, waivers, authorizations or approvals which may be required to be
obtained by the Company or its Affiliates in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby (which assistance and cooperation shall include timely
furnishing to the Company all information concerning the Purchaser and/or its
Affiliates that counsel to the Company reasonably determines is required to be
included in such documents or would be helpful in obtaining such required
consent, waiver, authorization or approval), but subject to the exceptions set
forth in the proviso of Section 8.01. The Purchaser shall be responsible for
one hundred percent (100%) of all fees, expenses or other payments in order to
obtain any consents or approvals or to give notices in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, including any filing fees under Antitrust
Laws and all other Laws or regulations applicable to the Purchaser or the
Company for the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein, except
as otherwise provided in Section 7.16. The Purchaser shall not, without the
written consent of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably conditioned,
delayed or withheld, "pull‑and‑refile" pursuant to 16 C.F.R. 803.12 any filing
made under the HSR Act, or take any similar action with respect to any filing
made with any Governmental Entity under any Antitrust Law or other Law
applicable to the Purchaser for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein, without prior written approval from the Company, which
shall not be unreasonably conditioned, delayed or withheld.

8.06 Conditions. The Purchaser and the Merger Sub shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the conditions set forth in Section 3.02 to be
satisfied prior to the Outside Date; provided that (without limiting the
obligations in Section 8.05) neither the Purchaser nor the Merger Sub shall be
required (a) to expend any funds (other than normal filing fees and expenses)
to obtain any consent from any Governmental Entity required under Section 3.02
or any other Person or to remedy any breach of any representation or warranty
hereunder, (b) to commence any litigation or 

arbitration proceeding or (c) to offer or grant or otherwise provide any
accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any Person.

8.07 Contact with Employees, Customers and Suppliers. Prior to the Closing,
the Purchaser and the Purchaser Parties may only contact and communicate with
the Employees, Independent Contractors, customers, service providers,
regulators and suppliers of the Company and its Subsidiaries related to the
transactions contemplated hereby after prior consultation with and written
approval of the Company's chief executive officer or chief financial officer
(which written approval will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, it being understood and agreed that requiring participation or
presence (either in person or telephonically) of Company personnel as may be
determined by the Company's chief executive officer or chief financial officer
shall be deemed not to be an unreasonable condition).

8.08 Replacement Letters of Credit. The Purchaser covenants and agrees that it
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (a) obtain new letters of credit
to substitute for and replace the letters of credit set forth on the Letters
of Credit Schedule (the "Letters of Credit") effective as of the Closing Date,
(b) arrange for the Letters of Credit to be "grandfathered" as letters of
credit under a new credit facility so that the Letters of Credit remain
outstanding after the Closing or (c) collateralize or otherwise backstop the
Letters of Credit so that the Letters of Credit remain outstanding after the
Closing. The Company and its Subsidiaries may take any necessary steps to cash
collateralize any Letters of Credit that will not be replaced, grandfathered,
collateralized or otherwise backstopped by the Purchaser at the Closing.

8.09 Financing.

(a) The Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to obtain and consummate the Debt Financing on the terms
and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letters or Fee Letters
(including the flex provisions, if applicable), subject to any amendments or
modifications thereto permitted by Section 8.09(b), including using its
reasonable best efforts to:

(i) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letters and Fee Letters and the
financing commitments thereunder,

(ii) negotiate, execute and deliver definitive agreements with respect to the
Debt Financing on terms and conditions (including the flex provisions, if
applicable) contained therein or on other terms not materially less favorable
to the Purchaser and the Merger Sub, in the aggregate, than the terms and
conditions (including any "market flex" provisions applicable thereto)
contained in the Debt Commitment Letters or Fee Letters,

(iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions that are applicable to the
Purchaser contained in the Debt Commitment Letter or Fee Letters, including
the payment of any commitment, engagement or placement fees required as a
condition to the Debt Financing and due and payable by the Purchaser, 

(iv) enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment Letters and Fee Letter,

(v) consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing, including
drawing on any interim or bridge financing under the Debt Commitment Letters
or Fee Letters.

The Purchaser shall provide such information as shall be necessary to keep the
Company informed on a reasonable basis and in reasonable detail of the status
of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing. In the event Purchaser becomes
aware that all or any portion of the Debt Financing has become unavailable,
the Purchaser shall promptly notify the Company and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to arrange as promptly as practicable any such portion from
alternative sources on terms and conditions no less favorable to the Purchaser
and to the Company taken as a whole than the terms and conditions set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letters and that would not have any of the effects
specified in Section 8.09(b) (any such alternative financing, "Alternative
Financing"). If an Alternative Financing is required in accordance with this
Section 8.09(a), the Purchaser shall obtain, and when obtained, provide the
Company with a copy of, a new financing commitment that provides for such
Alternative Financing, and on such event, (1) the term "Debt Financing" as
used in this Agreement will be deemed to include any such Alternative
Financing and (2) the term "Debt Commitment Letters" will be deemed to include
any commitment letters with respect to any such Alternative Financing. The
Purchaser shall give the Company prompt notice of any material change (adverse
or otherwise) with respect to the Debt Financing, including (A) the expiration
or termination of all or any portion of the financing commitments under the
Debt Commitment Letters or any definitive documentation relating to the
foregoing; (B) all or any portion of the Debt Financing (including pursuant to
any Alternative Financing or definitive documents relating to any of the
foregoing) becoming unavailable for any reason; or (C) any breach or
repudiation by any party to the Debt Commitment Letters (including any
definitive documents relating to any of the foregoing) of which the Purchaser
becomes aware if such breach would reasonably be expected to result in a
material delay of the Closing Date.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Purchaser
shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, agree to or
permit any amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification of, or
waive any of its rights or remedies under, the Debt Commitment Letters or Fee
Letters; provided that Purchaser may (i) amend, replace, supplement, modify or
waive any provision of the Debt Commitment Letters or related Fee Letters if
such amendment, replacement, supplement, modification or waiver does not (w)
add any new (or adversely modify, expand or amend in any material respect any
existing) condition to the consummation of the Debt Financing as compared to
the conditions in the Debt Commitment Letters and Fee Letters as of the date
hereof, (x) make the funding of the Debt Financing or conditions therein
materially less likely to be satisfied or materially delay, materially impede
or prevent the Closing, (y) adversely affect in any material respect the
ability of the Purchaser to enforce its rights against the other parties to
the Debt Commitment Letters or in any definitive agreements executed in
connection herewith or (z) reduce (or would reasonably be expected to have the
effect of 

reducing) the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing contemplated thereunder
(unless after giving effect to such reduction, the representation and warranty
in Section 6.08(d) shall be true and correct) and (ii) amend the Debt
Commitment Letters to add lenders, lead arrangers, book runners, syndication
agents or similar entities who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letters as
of the date of this Agreement, so long as any such addition would not
reasonably be expected to prevent, materially hinder or materially delay the
consummation of the Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the availability of the Debt Financing under the Debt Commitment
Letters. The Purchaser shall promptly deliver to the Company copies (redacted
only as to fee amounts, dates and certain other economic terms, including in
respect of "market flex" and "securities demand" provisions, in the case of
the Fee Letters) of any such amendment, replacement, supplement or other
modification or waiver of the Debt Commitment Letters or Fee Letters. The
Purchaser and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of Debt
Financing is not a condition to Closing and reaffirm their obligation to
consummate the Merger irrespective and independently of the availability of
the Debt Financing, subject to fulfillment or waiver of the conditions set
forth in Section 3.01.

result of their capacity as directors, officers or employees of the Company or
its Subsidiaries), severally (based on such Stockholder's Indemnity Pro Rata
Share of each Loss covered by this Section 9.02(a)) and not jointly, to
indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation, their
respective Affiliates and the respective officers, directors, employees,

consultants' fees and expenses and including any such reasonable out‑of‑pocket
expenses incurred in connection with investigating, defending against or

collectively "Losses") incurred or sustained by any of the Indemnified Parties
(including the Surviving Corporation) in connection with or as a result of the
following (the "Indemnifiable Matters"):

(i) any breach or inaccuracy of a representation or warranty by or on behalf
of the Company contained in this Agreement, any Related Agreement or in any

(v) any claims or threatened claims by or purportedly on behalf of any holder
or former holder of any shares of Company Stock or rights to acquire Company

connection with this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby, including appraisal or dissenters' rights proceedings,
(B) in connection with the Stockholder Notices or the Dissenter's Right
Notice, (C) alleging or based upon violations of fiduciary duty in connection
with the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including those relating to the allocation of the Merger
Consideration among the Stockholders as contemplated by this Agreement), or
(D) relating to the treatment of unclaimed Merger Consideration contemplated
by Section 1.04(g) (but in each case, excluding (x) consideration expressly
required to be paid by the Purchaser, the Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation in respect of shares of Company Stock under this Agreement and (y)
cash payments to holders of Dissenting Shares not in excess of the
consideration to which they would have been entitled for their shares of
Company Stock had they received the consideration payable in respect thereof
pursuant to Section 1.02 rather than exercising dissenters' rights, but not
excluding the costs and expenses incurred in connection with the proceedings
relating to such exercise of dissenters' rights);

(vi) any claim or threatened claim by any actual or purported Stockholder
relating to any alleged action or failure to act on its behalf by the
Stockholder Representative;

the Indemnified Parties shall not have any right to indemnification against
Losses incurred after the five (5) year anniversary of the Closing Date in
connection with or as a result of the Indemnifiable Matter set forth in this
Section 9.02(a)(vii).

(b) For the purpose of this Article IX only, when determining the amount of
Losses suffered by an Indemnified Party as a result of any breach, inaccuracy
or failure to be true of any representation or warranty given or made by the
Company, the Purchaser or the Merger Sub that is qualified or limited in scope
as to materiality (other than the representations and warranties in Section
4.05(a) and the second sentence of Section 4.21), Material Adverse Effect
(other than the representations and warranties in Section 4.06(a)), dollar
amounts or knowledge, but not when determining whether any such breach,
inaccuracy 

or failure has occurred, such representation or warranty shall be deemed to be
made or given without such qualification or limitation.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in the Company
Organizational Documents, any Subsidiary Organizational Documents or any
Contract, neither Onex, Onex Corporation nor any Indemnifying Party shall have
any right of contribution, indemnification, advancement or reimbursement from
the Surviving Corporation or its successor or the Purchaser or any of their
respective Subsidiaries (whether under this Agreement, the Company
Organizational Documents, any Subsidiary Organizational Documents, any other
Contract or otherwise) with respect to any Loss incurred or sustained by such
Indemnifying Party or any other Person (including any Indemnified Party) in
connection with or as a result of any Indemnifiable Matter (except to the
extent such contribution, indemnification or advancement or reimbursement of
expenses is actually recovered from a Third Party by the Surviving Corporation
or its Subsidiaries from insurance, but net of any expenses incurred in
obtaining such recovery, including collection costs and reserves, deductibles,
premium adjustments and retrospectively rated premiums).

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, this Article IX provides for indemnification
against all Losses incurred or sustained by one or more of the Indemnified
Parties as a result of the Indemnifiable Matters, subject to the limitations
herein, whether such indemnification is (i) pursuant to a direct claim by any
Indemnified Party or (ii) against Losses incurred or sustained as a result of
a Third Party Claim.

(e) This Article IX shall constitute the exclusive remedy after the Closing
for recovery of Losses by the Indemnified Parties in connection with any
Indemnifiable Matter or the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby; provided that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall limit the rights or remedies of the
Company, the Purchaser or any other Indemnified Party (i) except as expressly
set forth in Section 13.20, with respect to specific performance, injunctive
and other equitable relief or, (ii) except as expressly set forth in Sections
9.03(c) and 9.03(d), with respect to actual fraud.

9.03 Maximum Payments; Remedy.

(a) There shall be no recovery for claims under Section 9.02(a)(i) unless and
until the aggregate amount of Losses of the Indemnified Parties that may be
claimed thereunder exceeds $350,000 (the "Threshold"), and once the Threshold
has been reached, the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover the
full amount of all Losses that would otherwise be limited by the Threshold but
subject to the other limitations herein, including those which comprised any
portion of the Threshold; provided, however, that the foregoing limitation on
recovery for claims under Section 9.02(a)(i) shall not apply with respect to
any Losses incurred or sustained in connection with or as a result of (i) a
breach of any Fundamental Representation, (ii) a breach of any representation
or warranty contained in Section 4.08 (Tax Matters) or (to the extent relating
to Taxes) Section 4.13 (Employee Benefit Plans) or (to the extent relating to
Taxes) Section 4.19 (Employees), or (iii) any claims 

involving actual fraud, and such Losses to which the Threshold does not apply
shall not count towards satisfaction of the Threshold.

(b) In addition, there shall be no recovery for claims under Section
9.02(a)(i) with respect to any individual item or matter, or items or matters
arising out of substantially similar facts and circumstances, unless and until
the aggregate amount of Losses of the Indemnified Parties that may be claimed
thereunder with respect to such item(s) or matter(s) exceeds $75,000 (the "De
Minimis Amount"), and once the De Minimis Amount has been reached for such
item(s) or matter(s), the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover the
full amount of all Losses with respect to such item(s) or matter(s) that would
otherwise be limited by the De Minimis Amount but subject to the other
limitations herein, including those which comprised any portion of the De
Minimis Amount; provided, however, that the foregoing limitation on recovery
for claims under Section 9.02(a)(i) shall not apply with respect to any Losses
incurred or sustained in connection with or as a result of (i) a breach of any
Fundamental Representation, (ii) a breach of any representation or warranty
contained in Section 4.08 (Tax Matters) or (to the extent relating to Taxes)
Section 4.13 (Employee Benefit Plans) or (to the extent relating to Taxes)
Section 4.19 (Employees) or (iii) any claims involving actual fraud, and such
Losses to which the De Minimis Amount does not apply shall not count towards
satisfaction of the De Minimis Amount for any other Losses to which the De
Minimis Amount does apply.

(c) Subject to Section 9.03(d), the maximum amount that the Indemnified
Parties may recover from each Stockholder under this Article IX (or, with
respect to actual fraud, whether or not under this Article IX) shall be
limited as follows:

(i) With respect to Indemnifiable Matters under Section 9.02(a)(i) (other than
with respect to Fundamental Representations or the representations and
warranties in Section 4.06(b) or to the extent they arise from actual fraud),
to an amount (when aggregated with recovery from all other Stockholders) equal
to the Cap Amount;

(ii) With respect to all Indemnifiable Matters under Section 9.02(a) or claims
for actual fraud (other than the Indemnifiable Matter under Section 9.02(a)(v)
and other than as set forth in Section 9.03(d)), the total proceeds, if any,
received by such Stockholder in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby;

(iii) With respect to Indemnifiable Matters under Section 9.02(a)(v), an
amount equal to the total proceeds, if any, received by such Stockholder in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

For the avoidance of doubt, (x) the maximum recovery imposed by the preceding
clauses (ii) and (iii) are independent from one another, (y) recoveries by the
Indemnified Parties with respect to Indemnifiable Matters under Section
9.02(a)(v) shall not reduce the amounts that may be recovered in respect of
Indemnifiable Matters addressed under, and shall be disregarded in determining
whether the maximum recovery imposed by, the preceding clause (ii) has been
exceeded, and (z) recoveries 

by the Indemnified Parties with respect to Indemnifiable Matters other than
under Section 9.02(a)(v) shall not reduce the amounts that may be recovered in
respect of Indemnifiable Matters addressed under, and shall be disregarded in
determining whether the maximum recovery imposed by the preceding clause (iii)
has been exceeded.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein (including Section
9.03(c)), with respect to Indemnifiable Matters involving (i) acts of actual
fraud on behalf of the Company by Onex, Onex Corporation, any of their
respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers,
directors or employees (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries and other
portfolio companies directly or indirectly owned by Onex and any individuals
who are affiliated with Onex or Onex Corporation solely as a result of their
capacity as directors, officers or employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or such portfolio companies), or (ii) actual knowledge by Onex,
Onex Corporation, any of their respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries or any of
their respective officers, directors or employees (other than the Company and
its Subsidiaries and other portfolio companies directly or indirectly owned by
Onex and any individuals who are affiliated with Onex or Onex Corporation
solely as a result of their capacity as directors, officers or employees of
the Company or its Subsidiaries or such portfolio companies) of acts of actual
fraud by or on behalf of the Company, then in each case, those Stockholders
that are Subsidiaries or Affiliates of Onex or Onex Corporation (other than
other portfolio companies directly or indirectly owned by Onex and other than
those individuals who are affiliated with Onex or Onex Corporation solely as a
result of their capacity as directors, officers or employees of the Company or
its Subsidiaries or such other portfolio companies), or are or are
beneficially owned by directors, officers or employees thereof, shall
severally and not jointly indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties
against all Losses incurred or sustained by any of the Indemnified Parties
(including the Surviving Corporation) in connection with or as a result of
such actual fraud, and there shall be no limitation on the maximum amount of
recovery from such Stockholders with respect to such Losses.

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Stockholders shall
not be liable for, and shall have no obligation to indemnify the Indemnified
Parties against, any Losses attributable to Taxes of the Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates with respect to any taxable period (or portion thereof,
determined in accordance with the principles set forth in the definition of
Pre-Cutoff Straddle Period Taxes) beginning after the Closing Date other than
in respect of any breach of the representations set forth in Section 4.08(c),
clause (i) of Section 4.08(e), and Section 4.08(f).

(f) Nothing in this Article IX shall limit the liability, if any, of any party
hereto for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement or any Related Agreement if the Merger does not
close.

(g) None of the Purchaser or the other Indemnified Parties may avoid the
limitations on liability set forth in this Article IX by seeking damages for
breach of contract, tort or pursuant to any other theory of liability, and the
Purchaser, for itself and the other Indemnified Parties, hereby waives, from
and after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted 

under applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action it may
have against the Stockholders and their Affiliates relating (directly or
indirectly) to the subject matter of this Agreement arising under or based
upon any Law or otherwise; provided that notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall limit the rights or
remedies of the Purchaser or any other Indemnified Party in the event of
actual fraud, except as expressly set forth in Sections 9.03(c) or 9.03(d).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Purchaser shall have no right to indemnification hereunder with respect to any
Loss to the extent such Loss is included in the Indebtedness Adjustment.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Person may bring a claim
for indemnification under this Article IX, other than the Purchaser, on behalf
of the Indemnified Parties.

(h) For the avoidance of doubt, if and solely to the extent the amount of a
Loss is recovered by an Indemnified Party through the actual payment of a
Payable Claim to such Indemnified Party, the same amount of such Loss may not
be recovered again by such Indemnified Party by reason of such Loss being
subject to indemnification under more than one provision of this Agreement,
but the amount, if any, of Loss that exceeds the amount already recovered
shall be recoverable on and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Article IX.

(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Article IX to the contrary, if an
Indemnified Party's claim under this Article IX may be properly characterized
in multiple ways in accordance with this Article IX such that such claim may
or may not be subject to different caps, time limitations, baskets, and other
limitations depending on such characterization, then such Indemnified Party
shall have the right to characterize such Indemnifiable Matter in a manner
that maximizes the recovery and time to assert claims permitted in accordance
with this Article IX.

9.04 Claims for Indemnification; Resolution of Conflicts.

(a) Making a Claim for Indemnification; Officer's Certificate. The Purchaser,
on behalf of an Indemnified Party, may seek recovery of Losses pursuant to
this Article IX by delivering to the Stockholder Representative an Officer's
Certificate in respect of such claim promptly, but in any event within sixty
(60) days following the date on which the Purchaser obtained knowledge of such
claim; provided that the failure to timely deliver an Officer's Certificate
shall not impair such claim or any rights or remedies available with respect
thereto except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced
thereby. The date of receipt by the Stockholder Representative of an Officer's
Certificate is referred to herein as the "Claim Date" of such Officer's
Certificate (and the claims for indemnification contained therein). For
purposes hereof, "Officer's Certificate" shall mean a certificate signed by
any officer of the Purchaser: (i) stating that an Indemnified Party has paid,
sustained, or incurred, or reasonably anticipates in good faith that it will
have to pay, sustain, or incur, Losses and including a reasonable estimate of
the amounts of such Losses, if known, (ii) specifying in reasonable detail the
individual items of Losses included in the amount so stated, the date each
such item was paid, sustained, or incurred, or the basis for such 

anticipated liability, and the nature of the Indemnifiable Matter to which
such item is related; provided that (i) the Officer's Certificate need only
specify such information to the knowledge of such officer or such Indemnified
Party as of the Claim Date, shall not limit any of the rights or remedies of
any Indemnified Party, and (ii) the Officer's Certificate may be updated and
amended from time to time prior to the applicable Survival Date by the
Purchaser by delivering an updated or amended Officer's Certificate to the
Stockholder Representative (it being understood that any such update or
amendment, if material, will extend the Objection Deadline by a new forty-five
(45) day period) and (iii) no Indemnified Party's rights and remedies shall be
prejudiced as a result of limitations on disclosure in any Officer's
Certificate (except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is actually
prejudiced thereby), including any updates or amendments thereto, where such
limitations are made in good faith to preserve the attorney client privilege,
the work product doctrine or any other privileges (provided, further, that the
Purchaser shall at the time of delivery of the Officer's Certificate notify
the Stockholder Representative that it has so limited its disclosure and
thereafter shall cooperate with the Stockholder Representative and use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such limitation to be removed and the
applicable information provided to the Stockholder Representative or its
representatives in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to result in
any waiver of any privilege (including by entering into a common interest or
joint defense agreement)).

(b) Objecting to a Claim for Indemnification.

(i) The Stockholder Representative may object to a claim for indemnification
set forth in an Officer's Certificate by delivering to the Purchaser a written
statement of objection to the claim made in the Officer's Certificate (an
"Objection Notice"); provided that, to be effective, such Objection Notice
must (A) be delivered to the Indemnified Party prior to 5:00 p.m. New York
City time on the forty-fifth (45th) day following the Claim Date of the
Officer's Certificate (such deadline, the "Objection Deadline" for such
Officer's Certificate and the claims for indemnification contained therein)
and (B) set forth in reasonable detail the nature of the objections to the
claims in respect of which the objection is made, if known; provided that an
Objection Notice may be made by the Stockholder Representative if it does not
have sufficient information to assess the claim in the Officer's Certificate.

(ii) To the extent the Stockholder Representative does not object in writing
(as provided in Section 9.04(b)(i)) to the claims contained in an Officer's
Certificate prior to the Objection Deadline for such Officer's Certificate,
such failure to so object shall be deemed an acceptance of such claim by the
Stockholder Representative and an irrevocable acknowledgment by the
Stockholder Representative that the Indemnified Party is entitled to the full
amount of the claims for Losses set forth in such Officer's Certificate
actually sustained or incurred, subject to any limitations herein (but not any
estimated or anticipated amounts, unless and until actually sustained or
incurred) (and such entitlement shall be conclusively and irrefutably
established) with respect to the applicable parties against whom 

indemnification has been sought (the "Indemnifying Parties") (any such claim,
an "Unobjected Claim"). Within thirty (30) days after a claim becoming an
Unobjected Claim, the Indemnifying Parties shall make the applicable payment
to such Indemnified Party.

(c) Resolution of Conflicts.

(i) In case the Stockholder Representative delivers an Objection Notice prior
to the Objection Deadline in accordance with Section 9.04(b)(i), the
Stockholder Representative and the Purchaser shall attempt in good faith to
agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such
claims, within forty-five (45) days following the Purchaser's receipt of the
Objection Notice; provided that the Purchaser may limit its disclosures to the
Stockholder Representative pursuant to good faith efforts to preserve the
attorney‑client privilege, the work product doctrine or any other privileges
(provided, further, that the Purchaser shall at the time of the delivery of
such disclosures notify the Stockholder Representative that it has so limited
its disclosure and thereafter shall cooperate with the Stockholder
Representative and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
limitation to be removed and the applicable information provided to the
Stockholder Representative or its representatives in a manner that would not
reasonably be expected to result in any waiver of any privilege (including by
entering into a common interest or joint defense agreement)). During or prior
to such forty-five (45) day period, the Stockholder Representative may make
such investigation of the claim as the Stockholder Representative deems
necessary or advisable. For purposes of such investigation, upon the
Stockholder Representative's written request, the Purchaser will make
available to the Stockholder Representative, during normal business hours and
upon reasonable notice, at the Stockholder Representative's expense, such
information reasonably related to such claim or claims in the control of the
Purchaser as may be reasonably requested by the Stockholder Representative
pursuant and subject to Section 8.01. If the Stockholder Representative and
the Purchaser reach an agreement, a memorandum setting forth such agreement
shall be prepared and signed by all applicable parties (any claims covered by
such an agreement, "Settled Claims"). Any amounts required to be paid as a
result of a Settled Claim shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party to the
Indemnified Parties pursuant to the Settled Claim within thirty (30) days of
the applicable claim becoming a Settled Claim.

(ii) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation prior to
forty-five (45) days after delivery of an Objection Notice, then upon the
expiration of such forty-five (45) day period either the Purchaser or the
Stockholder Representative may bring a suit, action, claim or proceeding with
respect to the applicable claims in accordance with Section 13.18. Claims
finally determined by non-appealable judgment pursuant to any such suit,
action, claim or proceeding are referred to as "Resolved Claims." Within
thirty (30) days of a decision requiring 

payment of a Resolved Claim by an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnified Party,
such Indemnifying Party shall make the payment to such Indemnified Party,.

(d) Payable and Unresolved Claims. A "Payable Claim" shall mean a claim for
indemnification of Losses under this Article IX, to the extent that such claim
has not yet been satisfied by cash payment, that is (i) a Resolved Claim, (ii)
a Settled Claim, or (iii) an Unobjected Claim. An "Unresolved Claim" shall
mean any claim for indemnification of Losses under this Article IX specified
in any Officer's Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 9.04(a) or Section
9.06, to the extent that such claim is not a Payable Claim.

9.05 Mitigation. Each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall take
commercially reasonable steps in accordance with applicable Laws to mitigate
all Losses after becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be
expected to give rise to any Losses that are indemnifiable or recoverable
hereunder or in connection herewith.

9.06 Defense of Third Party Claims. If the Purchaser becomes aware of a third
party claim (a "Third Party Claim") which the Purchaser reasonably believes in
good faith may result in a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Article
IX (excluding any Tax Contests, which are governed by Section 11.08), the
Purchaser shall promptly deliver an Officer's Certificate in which it notifies
the Stockholder Representative of such claim, but in any event within ten (10)
days of receiving any such Third Party Claim (it being understood that the
failure to promptly notify the Stockholder Representative shall not impair
such claim or any rights or remedies available with respect thereto except to
the extent the applicable Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby),
and the Stockholder Representative shall be entitled on behalf of the
Stockholders, at their expense, to participate in and to receive copies of all
pleadings, notices and communications with respect to, such Third Party Claim,
and at its option, the Stockholder Representative shall, by written notice to
the Purchaser, be entitled to assume and conduct the defense thereof;
provided, however, that the Stockholder Representative may not assume and
conduct the defense of such Third Party Claim if (i) the amount of the Third
Party Claim exceeds two (2) times (or, in the case of a Third Party Claim
relating to the Indemnifiable Matter under Section 9.02(a)(v), one (1) time)
the amount that the Indemnifying Parties would be responsible for hereunder
(at the time of such Third Party Claim after giving effect to all earlier
claims by the Indemnified Parties under this Article IX), (ii) the Third Party
Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal action, claim,
lawsuit or proceeding, (iii) such Third Party Claim seeks equitable relief,
unless such claim is incidental to a primary claim for monetary damages, or
(iv) such Third Party Claim is by a customer or supplier of the Company and
the loss of the commercial relationship with which would be materially adverse
to the Company. If not assumed by the Stockholder Representative, the
Purchaser shall have the right in its sole discretion to conduct the defense
of, and after consultation with the Stockholder Representative, to settle, any
such claim and the Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to participate
in any negotiation of settlement, adjustment or compromise with respect to any
such Third Party Claim; provided that except with the consent of the
Stockholder Representative (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), no settlement of any such Third Party Claim with
third party claimants shall be determinative of the amount of Losses relating
to such matter. If the Stockholder Representative shall control the defense of
any Third Party Claim, then the Stockholder Representative shall (A) keep the
Purchaser reasonably informed regarding 

such Third Party Claim, (B) give the Purchaser the opportunity to participate
in the defense or settlement thereof, (C) give due consideration to the
Purchaser's advice with respect thereto and (D) be entitled to settle such
claim; provided that the Stockholder Representative shall obtain the prior
written consent of the Purchaser (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) before entering into any settlement of a
Third Party Claim or ceasing to defend any such Third Party Claim; provided,
further, that the Stockholder Representative shall not enter into any
settlement of any Third Party Claim unless such settlement by its terms
obligates the Indemnifying Parties to pay the full amount of the Losses
subject to indemnification hereunder (and subject to any limitations
hereunder) in connection with such Third Party Claim. The Stockholder
Representative shall cease defending any Third Party Claim which the parties
agree no longer relates to an Indemnifiable Matter. The party controlling the
defense of any Third Party Claim shall diligently defend such Third Party
Claim.

9.07 Determination of Loss Amount. The amount of any Loss subject to
indemnification under Section 9.02 shall be calculated net of any insurance
proceeds or any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment actually
recovered by the Indemnified Party from any Third Party with respect thereto
(net of any expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in obtaining such
recovery, including collection costs and reserves, deductibles, premium
adjustments and retrospectively rated premiums), except to the extent any such
insurance proceeds are required to be paid pursuant to Sections 8.03(e) or
9.02(c). If the Indemnified Party actually realizes a Tax Benefit on account
of a Loss by reason of the deductibility of such Loss in the taxable year of
the Loss or in the subsequent taxable year, and the Indemnified Party (or the
Purchaser) is entitled to be, and is in fact, indemnified against such Loss
pursuant to this Article IX, the Indemnified Party shall promptly pay to the
Indemnifying Party the amount of such Tax Benefit to the extent of the portion
of such Loss for which the Indemnified Party received an indemnification
payment pursuant to this Article IX. For purposes of this Section 9.07, an
Indemnified Party shall be deemed to recognize a tax benefit (a "Tax Benefit")
with respect to a taxable period if, and to the extent that, the Indemnified
Party's cumulative liability for Taxes through the end of such taxable year,
calculated by excluding any Tax items attributable to the Loss, exceeds the
Indemnified Party's actual cumulative liability for Taxes through the end of
such taxable year, calculated by taking into account any Tax items
attributable to the Loss (to the extent permitted by applicable Law and
treating the Tax items attributable to the Loss as the last items claimed for
any taxable year). The Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to seek full recovery under all insurance policies covering any Loss
or right of a current or former director or officer to contribution,
indemnification, advancement or reimbursement to the same extent as it would
if such Loss were not subject to indemnification hereunder or the Indemnified
Party were responsible for such contribution, indemnification, advancement or
reimbursement. In the event that an insurance or other recovery is made by any
Indemnified Party with respect to any Loss for which any such Person has been
indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the lesser of (i) the amount of
the recovery (net of any expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in
obtaining such recovery, including collection costs and reserves, deductibles,
premium adjustments and retrospectively rated premiums) and (ii) the amount of
the Loss for which the Indemnified Party was indemnified shall be made
promptly to the Indemnifying Party. Each party hereby waives, to the extent
permitted under its applicable insurance policies, any subrogation rights that
its insurer may have with respect to any indemnifiable Losses. 

9.08 Acknowledgment of the Purchaser and the Merger Sub. Each of the Purchaser
and the Merger Sub acknowledges that it has conducted to its satisfaction an
independent investigation and verification of the financial condition, results
of operations, assets, liabilities, properties and projected operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and, in making its determination to proceed with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Purchaser and the
Merger Sub has relied on the results of its own independent investigation and
verification and the representations and warranties of the Company expressly
and specifically set forth in Article IV, as modified by the Disclosure
Schedules attached hereto. The representations and warranties of the Company
in Article IV, as modified by the Disclosure Schedules, constitute the sole
and exclusive representations and warranties of the Company and the
Non‑Recourse Parties to the Purchaser and the Merger Sub in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby, and each of the Purchaser and the Merger
Sub understands, acknowledges and agrees that all other representations and
warranties of any kind or nature expressed or implied (including any relating
to the future or historical financial condition, results of operations, assets
or liabilities of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or the quality, quantity or
condition of the Company's or its Subsidiaries' assets or relating to any
other information provided to Purchaser) are specifically disclaimed by the
Company and the Stockholders. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement,
none of the Stockholder Representative, the Stockholder Parties, the Company
or its Subsidiaries makes or provides, and each of the Purchaser and the
Merger Sub hereby waives, any warranty or representation, express or implied,
as to the quality, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
conformity to samples, or condition of the Company's and its Subsidiaries'
assets or any part thereof. In connection with the Purchaser's and the Merger
Sub's investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries, each of the Purchaser
and the Merger Sub has received certain projections, including projected
statements of operating revenues and income from operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and certain business plan information. Each of the Purchaser
and the Merger Sub acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in
attempting to make estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans, that
the Purchaser and the Merger Sub are familiar with such uncertainties and that
each of the Purchaser and the Merger Sub is taking full responsibility for
making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates,
projections and other forecasts and plans so furnished to it, including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections and
forecasts. Accordingly, each of the Purchaser and the Merger Sub hereby
acknowledges that none of the Stockholder Representative, the Stockholders or
any of their Affiliates, or their respective officers, directors, partners,
members, employees, agents, representatives, successors and permitted assigns
(collectively, the "Stockholder Parties") is making any representation or
warranty with respect to such estimates, projections and other forecasts and
plans, including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such
estimates, projections and forecasts, and that neither of the Purchaser or the
Merger Sub has relied on any such estimates, projections or other forecasts or
plans, in each case except to the extent of the representations and warranties
expressly and specifically set forth in Article IV, as modified by the
Disclosure Schedules attached hereto. The Purchaser further agrees, for itself
and its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, partners,
members, employees, agents, representatives, successors and permitted assigns
(collectively, the "Purchaser Parties"), that none of the Stockholder Parties
or any other Person will have or be subject to any liability to any Purchaser
Party or any other Person resulting from the distribution to the Purchaser or
any other Purchaser Party, or the Purchaser's use of, any information other
than that contained in the representations and warranties contained in this
Article IV (including the certificate of the Company delivered by the Company 

with respect to the representations and warranties set forth in this Article
IV), including any information, document or material made available to the
Purchaser or any other Purchaser Party in certain "data rooms," management
presentations or any other form in expectation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall limit the recovery of the
Purchaser or the liability of the Company or any of its Affiliates or any
Stockholder in the event of actual fraud, except as expressly set forth in
Sections 9.03(c) and 9.03(d).

9.09 Tax Treatment. Any payment under this Article IX shall be treated by the
parties for U.S. federal, state, local and non‑U.S. income Tax purposes as a
purchase price adjustment unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

Subsidiaries and Onex have retained KandE to act as its counsel in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby and that KandE has not acted as
counsel for any other party hereto in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and that none of the other parties hereto has the status
of a client of KandE for 

conflict of interest or any other purposes as a result thereof. The Purchaser,
the Merger Sub, the Stockholder Representative, the Company, and their
respective Subsidiaries hereby agree, on their own behalf and on behalf of
their respective directors, equityholders, members, partners, officers,
employees and affiliates, that, in the event that a dispute arises after the
Closing between the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation, and/or its
Subsidiaries on the one hand, and the Stockholder Representative, Onex or
their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, KandE may represent the
Stockholder Representative, Onex and/or such Affiliates in such dispute even
though the interests of the Stockholder Representative, Onex and/or such
Affiliates may be directly adverse to the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation
or its Subsidiaries, even though KandE may have represented the Company or its
Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related to such dispute, or may be
handling ongoing matters for the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their Subsidiaries. The Purchaser and the Merger Sub further agree that, as
to all communications among KandE, the Company, its Subsidiaries, the
Stockholder Representative, Onex and/or any of their respective Affiliates
with respect to the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the attorney-client privilege and
the expectation of client confidence belongs to the Stockholder Representative
and may be controlled by the Stockholder Representative and shall not pass to
or be claimed by the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute
arises between the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Subsidiaries and a Third Party after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent
disclosure of confidential communications by KandE to such Third Party;
provided, however, that neither the Surviving Corporation nor its Subsidiaries
may waive such privilege without the prior written consent of the Stockholder
Representative and Onex.

11.03 Tax Shelter. The Purchaser shall not take any action with respect to the
Company that would cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to
constitute part of a transaction that is the same as, or substantially similar
to, the "Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter" described in Internal Revenue
Service Notices 2001‑16 and 2008‑11.

11.04 Transfer Taxes. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
all transfer, documentary, sales, use, registration and real property transfer
or gains tax, stamp tax, excise tax, stock transfer tax, or other similar Tax
imposed on the Company or the Stockholders as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, "Transfer Taxes"), and any
penalties or interest with respect to the Transfer Taxes, shall be borne fifty
percent (50%) by the Purchaser and fifty percent (50%) by the Stockholders.

11.05 Tax Sharing Agreements. Any and all existing Tax sharing or similar
agreements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand,
and any Affiliate of the Company other than one of its Subsidiaries, on the
other hand, shall be terminated and all payables and receivables arising
thereunder shall be settled, in each case prior to the Closing Date. After the
Closing Date, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have any
further rights or liabilities thereunder or under any payables or receivables
arising thereunder.

11.06 Tax Returns. 

(a) The Purchaser shall prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and filed),
all Tax Returns with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect
to taxable periods that end before or include the Closing Date that are
required to be filed after the Closing Date. Each such Tax Return shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with the Company's past practice except as
otherwise required by applicable Law. The Purchaser shall permit the
Stockholder Representative to review and comment on each such Tax Return prior
to its filing and shall make any revisions to such Tax Returns that are
reasonably requested by the Stockholder Representative and are not
inconsistent with the standard set forth in the preceding sentence of this
Section 11.06(a).

(b) Without the prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, the Purchaser will not (i) file or
amend or permit any of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to file or amend
any Tax Return of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to a taxable
period that ends before or includes the Closing Date, (ii) extend or waive, or
cause to be extended or waived, or permit the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to extend or waive, any statute of limitations or other period
for the assessment of any Tax or deficiency related to a taxable period of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that ends before or includes the Closing
Date, or (iii) make or change or permit any of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to make or change any Tax election or accounting method with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that has retroactive effect
to any taxable period that ends before or includes the Closing Date.

11.07 Tax Cooperation. The Company agrees to furnish or cause to be furnished
to the Purchaser and its Affiliates at any time after the date hereof, upon
request, as promptly as practicable, such information (including access to
books and records) and assistance relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, as is reasonably requested for the filing of any Tax Returns,
for the evaluation of the Company and its Subsidiaries' Tax positions, for the
preparation of any audit and for the prosecution or defense of any pending or
threatened audit or assessment, suit, proposed adjustment, deficiency,
dispute, administrative or judicial proceeding or other similar claim.

11.08 Tax Contests. After the Closing, the Purchaser shall promptly notify the
Stockholder Representative in writing of the proposal or commencement of any
Tax Contest which, if determined adversely to the taxpayer or after the lapse
of time, could be grounds for indemnification under Section 9.02. Such notice
shall contain factual information (to the extent known to the Purchaser, the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries) describing the asserted Tax
liability in reasonable detail and shall include copies of any notice or other
document received from any Governmental Entity in respect of any such asserted
Tax liability. The failure to provide such notice shall not relieve the
Stockholders of any liability hereunder except to the extent that such failure
results in actual prejudice to the rights of the Stockholders with respect to
such asserted Tax liability. In the case of a Tax Contest that relates solely
to a Pre‑Cutoff Tax Period (other than a Straddle Period or portion thereof),
the Stockholder Representative may elect to direct and control, through
counsel of its own choosing, any Tax Contest involving any asserted Tax
liability with respect to which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section
9.02(a)(iv). If the Stockholder Representative elects to direct a Tax Contest,
the Stockholder Representative shall within sixty (60) days (but in all events
in a timely manner, and without any delay that would prejudice the Purchaser
or the 

Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of such Tax
Contest) of receipt of the notice of asserted Tax liability notify the
Purchaser of its intent to do so, and the Purchaser shall cooperate and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to fully cooperate, at
the Stockholders' expense, in each phase of such Tax Contest; provided,
however, that the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
shall have the right to participate, at such Person's expense, in each phase
of such Tax Contest. If the Stockholder Representative elects to direct the
Tax Contest, the Stockholder Representative may not settle or compromise any
asserted liability without prior written consent of the Purchaser (which shall
not be unreasonably conditioned, delayed, or withheld) to the extent such
settlement or compromise could have a material effect on any Tax liability of
the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries in a
taxable period beginning after the date of the Latest Balance Sheet or the
portion of a Straddle Period beginning after the date of the Latest Balance
Sheet. For the avoidance of doubt, an election by the Stockholder
Representative to direct a Tax Contest shall constitute an acknowledgement of
the Stockholders' liability to indemnify the Purchaser to the extent required
under Article IX with respect to the relevant Tax. If (a) the Stockholder
Representative elects not to direct a Tax Contest described in the first
sentence of this Section 11.08 or (b) a Tax Contest relates to a Straddle
Period, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
may assume control of such Tax Contest (at the Purchaser's expense). However,
in such case, none of the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries may settle or compromise any asserted liability in connection
with such Tax Contest without prior written consent of the Stockholder
Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed). In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this
Section 11.08 and any other section of the Agreement, this Section 11.08 shall
control.

11.09 Tax Refunds. Any refunds (or credits for overpayment) of Taxes incurred
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and attributable to any Pre-Cutoff
Tax Period (or portion thereof, determined in accordance with the principles
set forth in the definition of Pre-Cutoff Straddle Period Taxes), including
any interest received from a Governmental Entity thereon, that is actually
received in cash or by credit by the Company or its Subsidiaries, shall be for
the account of the Stockholders; provided, however, that the Purchaser shall
not be required to pay the Stockholders pursuant to this Section 11.09 to the
extent that (a) there are any Taxes that have been finally determined and are
required to be paid by the Stockholders pursuant to Section 9.02(a)(i) or
Section 9.02(a)(iv) and which the Stockholders have not yet paid as of the
date such refund or credit is received, (b) such refund or credit was accrued
as a current and normal asset in the Latest Financial Statements, or (c) such
refund or credit arose from the carryback of losses, credits or other Tax
attributes from a taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the date
of the Latest Balance Sheet. Upon the Purchaser's, the Company's, or any
Subsidiary's receipt of any such refund or claim of such credit, Purchaser and
the Company, jointly and severally, shall pay or cause to be paid to the
Stockholder Representative, for the benefit of the Stockholders, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, any such refund (or the amount of any
such credit), including any interest thereon, but net of any Taxes imposed
thereon and reasonable expenses incurred in connection therewith. If a refund
or credit that has been paid to the Stockholders is later denied or
disallowed, the Stockholders shall pay or cause to be paid to the Purchaser
(or, at the Purchaser's direction, to the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries) the amount of any such refund or credit plus any interest owed
to the relevant Governmental Entity in respect of such denial or disallowance. 

11.10 Pre-Cutoff NOL Benefits.

(a) If the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Company and each
of its Subsidiaries) realizes a Pre-Cutoff NOL Benefit that is attributable to
any taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning on or after the date
immediately following the date of the Latest Balance Sheet and ending on or
before the last day of the Company's tenth (10th) full tax year following the
date of the Latest Balance Sheet that is attributable to any net operating
loss that arose in any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or before
the date of the Latest Balance Sheet (each such attribute, a "Pre-Cutoff
NOL"), the Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid to the Stockholder
Representative, for the benefit of the Stockholders, an amount equal to fifty
percent (50%) of the amount of such Pre-Cutoff NOL Benefit; provided that for
purposes of this Section 11.10, Pre-Cutoff NOL Benefits shall not include any
refunds or credits governed by Section 11.09.

(b) For purposes of this Section 11.10, a "Pre-Cutoff NOL Benefit" shall be
deemed to be realized in a taxable period and attributable to a Pre-Cutoff NOL
if, and to the extent that, the Purchaser's or any of its Affiliates'
hypothetical cumulative liability for Taxes for such taxable period,
calculated by excluding the relevant Pre-Cutoff NOL, exceeds the Purchaser's
or any of its Affiliates' actual liability for Taxes for such taxable periods,
as shown on the Purchaser's or any of its Affiliates' annual tax returns filed
in respect of such taxable period, calculated by taking into account the
relevant Pre-Cutoff NOL. In the case of a Pre-Cutoff NOL Benefit attributable
to a Pre-Cutoff NOL that is used to reduce Taxes owed by a non-U.S. Subsidiary
of the Company, the aggregate amount of the Pre-Cutoff NOLs that are
attributes of the Company and its U.S. Subsidiaries (i) shall be deemed, for
purposes of this Section 11.10, to be reduced by the amount of the Pre-Cutoff
NOL that is used to reduce Taxes owed by such non-U.S. Subsidiary of the
Company and (ii) shall be deemed, for purposes of this Section 11.10, to be
increased by the amount distributed by such non-U.S. Subsidiary that is
treated as dividend income for U.S. income Tax purposes (but only to the
extent such dividend income is actually offset and reduced by Pre-Cutoff NOLs
of the Company and/or any of its U.S. Subsidiaries) after the date on which
such Pre-Cutoff NOL Benefit was realized and until such non-U.S. Subsidiary
has distributed to the Company (or any U.S. Subsidiary of the Company)
earnings equal to the full amount of such Pre-Cutoff NOL that is used to
reduce Taxes owed by such non-U.S. Subsidiary of the Company.

(c) Any payment due to the Stockholder Representative pursuant to this Section
11.10 with respect to such Pre-Cutoff NOL Benefit shall be made by wire
transfer or immediately available funds within ten (10) Business Days
following the date on which the Purchaser or its Affiliate (as applicable)
realizes such Pre-Cutoff NOL Benefit in the form of a reduction in the amount
of Tax that would otherwise have been payable if the amount of such Pre-Cutoff
NOL Benefit had been zero. Following the Closing, the Purchaser shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates (including the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries) to, make all elective Tax reporting determinations that could
reasonably be expected to affect the amount of any Pre-Cutoff NOL Benefits
that could be payable to the Stockholder Representative pursuant to this
Section 11.10 as though the Purchaser were the only party 

in interest with respect to such Pre-Cutoff NOL Benefits; provided that
nothing in this sentence shall require the Purchaser, the Company or any
Subsidiary to take any action (or to refrain from doing so), to to make (or
refrain from making) any Tax reporting determination that is not elective.
Each payment made to the Stockholder Representative shall be accompanied by a
reasonably detailed written description of the nature of the Pre-Cutoff NOL
Benefit with respect to which such payment is being made and the calculation
of the amount of such Pre-Cutoff NOL Benefit. At the Stockholder
Representative's written request, the Purchaser shall permit the Stockholder
Representative or its designee to review (but not retain any copy of) those
portions of any Tax Return that reflects, or that the Stockholder
Representative could reasonably expect to reflect, a Pre-Cutoff NOL Benefit
required to be shared by the Purchaser with the Stockholders pursuant to this
Section 11.10.

(d) If, after the payment of any amount due to the Stockholder Representative
pursuant to this Section 11.10 with respect to a Pre-Cutoff NOL Benefit, any
Tax Contest relating to the Pre-Cutoff NOL which gave rise to such Pre-Cutoff
NOL Benefit is proposed or commenced, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation
or any of its Subsidiaries shall control such Tax Contest (with expenses
relating to such Tax Contest borne fifty percent (50%) by Purchaser and fifty
percent (50%) by the Stockholders). However, in such case, none of the
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries may settle or
compromise any aspect of such Tax Contest that relates solely to such Pre-
Cutoff NOL without prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
If, after the payment of any amount due to the Stockholder Representative
pursuant to this Section 11.10 with respect to a Pre-Cutoff NOL Benefit, the
Pre-Cutoff NOL which gave rise to such Pre-Cutoff NOL Benefit is later denied
or disallowed, the Stockholders shall pay or cause to be paid to the Purchaser
(or, at the Purchaser's direction, to the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries) the amount previously paid to the Stockholder Representative
pursuant to this Section 11.10 with respect to such Pre-Cutoff NOL Benefit
plus any interest owed to the relevant Governmental Entity in respect of such
denial or disallowance.

ARTICLE XIII 

MISCELLANEOUS

13.01 Stockholder Representative.

(h) Designation. The Stockholder Representative is hereby designated by each
of the Stockholders to serve as the Stockholder Representative of the
Stockholders with respect to the matters expressly set forth in this Agreement
to be performed by the Stockholder Representative.

(i) Appointment. By the execution of the Stockholder Consent or the Joinder
and Waiver Agreement, the Stockholders hereby irrevocably constitute and
appoint the Stockholder Representative as the representative, agent, proxy,
and attorney‑in‑fact for each of the Stockholders for all purposes authorized
under this Agreement, including the full power and authority on the
Stockholders' behalf (i) to consummate the transactions contemplated herein;
(ii) to pay such Stockholder's expenses incurred in connection with the
negotiation and performance of this Agreement (whether incurred on or after
the date hereof); (iii) to disburse any funds received hereunder to such
Stockholder and each other Stockholder; (iv) to endorse and deliver any
certificates or instruments representing the Common Stock and execute such
further instruments of assignment as Purchaser and the Merger Sub shall
reasonably request; (v) to execute and deliver on behalf of such Stockholder
any amendment or waiver hereto; (vi) (A) to dispute or refrain from disputing,
on behalf of such Stockholder relative to any amounts to be received by such
Stockholder under this Agreement or any agreements contemplated hereby, any
claim made by the Purchaser under this Agreement or other agreements
contemplated hereby, (B) to negotiate and compromise, on behalf of such
Stockholder, any dispute that may arise under, and exercise or refrain from
exercising any remedies available under, this Agreement or any other agreement
contemplated hereby, and (C) to execute, on behalf of such Stockholder, any
settlement agreement, release or other document with respect to such dispute
or remedy; (vii) to engage attorneys, accountants, agents or consultants on
behalf of the Stockholders in connection with this Agreement or any other
agreement contemplated hereby and paying any fees related thereto (viii) to
take all other actions to be taken by or on behalf of such Stockholder in
connection herewith; and (ix) to do each and every act and exercise any and
all rights which such Stockholder or the Stockholders collectively are
permitted or required to do or exercise under this Agreement. Each of the
Stockholders agrees that such agency and proxy are coupled with an interest,
are therefore irrevocable without the consent of the Stockholder
Representative and shall survive the death, incapacity, bankruptcy,
dissolution or liquidation of any Stockholder. If any Stockholder dies or
becomes incapacitated, disabled or incompetent (such deceased, incapacitated,
disabled or incompetent Stockholder being a "Former Stockholder") and, as a
result, the agency and power of attorney conferred by this Section 13.01 is
revoked by operation of law, it shall not be a breach by such Former
Stockholder under this Agreement if the heirs, beneficiaries, estate,
administrator, executor, guardian, conservator or other legal representative
of such Former Stockholder (each a "Successor Stockholder") confirms the
appointment of the Stockholder Representative as 

agent and attorney-in-fact for such Successor Stockholder. In addition, if the
agency and power of attorney conferred by this Section 13.01 is revoked by
operation of law and thereafter not reconfirmed by the Successor Stockholder
prior to the Closing, such revocation shall not be deemed a breach by the
Successor Stockholder of any of the provisions of this Agreement provided that
the shares of Common Stock held by such Successor Stockholder are delivered
for transfer to the Purchaser at the Closing as contemplated by Section 1.04,
and further provided that such Successor Stockholder executes and delivers
such other certificates, documents or instruments that would have been
delivered on its behalf by the Stockholder Representative had such Successor
Stockholder reconfirmed the agency and power of attorney conferred by this
Section 13.01. All decisions and actions by the Stockholder Representative (to
the extent authorized by this Agreement) shall be binding upon all of the
Stockholders, and no Stockholder shall have the right to object, dissent,
protest or otherwise contest the same.

(j) Authority; Indemnification. Each Stockholder agrees that the Purchaser,
the Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to rely on any
action taken by the Stockholder Representative, on behalf of such Stockholder,
pursuant to Section 13.01(b) above (an "Authorized Action"), and that each
Authorized Action shall be binding on each Stockholder as fully as if such
Stockholder had taken such Authorized Action. The Purchaser and the Merger Sub
agree that the Stockholder Representative, as the Stockholder Representative,
shall have no liability to the Purchaser and the Merger Sub for any Authorized
Action, except that the Stockholder Representative shall not be relieved of
liability to the extent that such Authorized Action is found by a final order
of a court of competent jurisdiction to have constituted fraud or willful
misconduct by the Stockholder Representative. Each Stockholder hereby
severally (allocated according to the allocation of the Merger Consideration
among the Stockholders), for itself only and not jointly and severally, agrees
to indemnify and hold harmless the Stockholder Representative against all
fees, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines
and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the
Stockholder Representative (and not paid by the Purchaser) in connection with
any action, suit or proceeding to which the Stockholder Representative is made
a party by reason of the fact it is or was acting as the Stockholder
Representative of any Stockholder pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

(k) Exculpation. The Stockholder Representative shall not have by reason of
this Agreement a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Stockholder, except
in respect of amounts received on behalf of such Stockholder. The Stockholder
Representative shall not be liable to any Stockholder for any action taken or
omitted by it or any agent employed by it hereunder or under any other
document entered into in connection herewith, except that the Stockholder
Representative shall not be relieved of any liability imposed by law for
willful misconduct. The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable to the
Stockholders for any apportionment or distribution of payments made by the
Stockholder Representative in good faith, and if any such apportionment or
distribution is subsequently determined to have been made in error the sole
recourse of any Stockholder to whom payment was due, but not made, shall be to
recover from other Stockholders any payment in excess of the 

amount to which they are determined to have been entitled. The Stockholder
Representative shall not be required to make any inquiry concerning either the
performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of
this Agreement. Neither the Stockholder Representative nor any agent employed
by it shall incur any liability to any Stockholder by virtue of the failure or
refusal of the Stockholder Representative for any reason to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby or relating to the performance of its other
duties hereunder, except for actions or omissions constituting fraud or bad
faith.

13.02 Press Releases and Communications. No press release or public
announcement related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
herein, or prior to the Closing any other announcement or communication to the
employees, customers or suppliers of the Company, shall be issued or made by
any party hereto (or any Affiliate of any party hereto) without the prior
joint approval of the Purchaser and the Company (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless required by Law (in the
reasonable opinion of counsel) in which case the Purchaser and the Company
shall have the right to review and be consulted in good faith with respect to
such press release, announcement or communication prior to its issuance,
distribution or publication.

13.03 Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, each of the
Company, the Purchaser and the Merger Sub shall pay all of their own fees and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, any of the Related
Agreements and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of the
Related Agreements, including the fees and disbursements of counsel, financial
advisors and accountants; provided that (a) in the event that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, the Purchaser shall pay all
the Transaction Expenses as provided in Section 2.02(f), (b) the Purchaser
shall pay all fees under the HSR Act and under any such other applicable Laws
and other fees as provided in Section 8.05, except as otherwise provided in
Section 7.16, (c) the Purchaser shall pay all fees and expenses in connection
with the Purchaser's financing arrangements for the transactions contemplated
hereby, regardless of whether such financing fees and expenses were to be
incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and (d) each party shall
pay all fees and expenses that it has agreed to pay pursuant to this Agreement
or any Related Agreement.

13.04 Knowledge Defined. For purposes of this Agreement, (a) "the Company's
knowledge" and "knowledge of the Company" as used herein means the actual
knowledge of Bert Quintana, Patrick Tolbert or David Beckman as well as any
other knowledge which any such foregoing individual would have possessed with
respect to the matter in question had such individual made due inquiry of the
employees reporting directly to him in the ordinary course of performing such
individual's duties, and (b) "the Purchaser's knowledge" or "the Merger Sub's
knowledge" as used herein means the actual knowledge of Laurent Uberti or
Elisabeth Destailleur as well as any other knowledge which any such foregoing
individual would have possessed with respect to the matter in question had
such individual made due inquiry of the employees reporting directly to him or
her in the ordinary course of performing such individual's duties.

13.05 Notices. All notices, demands and other communications to be given or
delivered under or by reason of the provisions of this Agreement shall be in
writing and shall be deemed to 

have been given (a) when personally delivered, (b) when transmitted by

13.06 Assignment. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, except that neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be
assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise,

null and void; provided, that no assignment shall limit the assignor's
obligations hereunder. 

13.07 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any provision of this
Agreement is held to be prohibited by or invalid or unenforceable under
applicable Law, such provision or portion shall be ineffective only to the
extent of such prohibition, invalidity or unenforceability, without
invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of
this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced
as if such prohibited, invalid or unenforceable provision or portion had never
been contained herein; provided that the parties intend that the remedies and
limitations on remedies contained in this Agreement (including the provisions
providing that termination of this Agreement be the sole and exclusive remedy

integral provisions of this Agreement and that such remedies and limitations
shall not be severable in any manner that increases a party's or any of its
related party's (including any Non‑Recourse Party of the Purchaser) liability
or obligations hereunder.

13.08 References. The table of contents and the section and other headings and
subheadings contained in this Agreement and the Exhibits hereto are solely for
the purpose of reference, are not part of the agreement of the parties hereto,
and shall not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement or any Exhibit hereto. All references to days or months shall be
deemed references to calendar days or months. All references to "$" shall be
deemed references to United States dollars. Unless the context otherwise
requires, any reference to an "Article," "Section," "Exhibit," "Disclosure
Schedule" or "Schedule" shall be deemed to refer to an article of this
Agreement, section of this Agreement, exhibit to this Agreement or a schedule
to this Agreement, as applicable. Capitalized terms used in the Disclosure
Schedules and not otherwise defined therein have the meanings given to them in
this Agreement. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of
similar import referring to this Agreement refer to this Agreement as a whole
and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The word "including" or
any variation thereof means "including, without limitation" and shall not be
construed to limit any general statement that it follows to the specific or
similar items or matters immediately following it. Unless the context
otherwise clearly indicates, each defined term used in this Agreement shall
have a comparable meaning when used in its plural or singular form.

13.09 Construction. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and
no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any Person. The
specification of any dollar amount or the inclusion of any item in the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or the Disclosure
Schedules or Exhibits attached hereto is not intended to imply that the
amounts, or higher or lower amounts, or the items so included, or other items,
are or are not required to be disclosed (including whether such amounts or
items are required to be disclosed as material or threatened) or are within or
outside of the Ordinary Course of Business, and no party shall use the fact of
the setting of the amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any item in this
Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules or Exhibits in any dispute or
controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter
not described or included in this Agreement or in any Schedule or Exhibit is
or is not required to be disclosed (including whether the amount or items are
required to be disclosed as material or threatened) or is within or outside of
the Ordinary Course of Business. The information contained in this Agreement
and in the Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits hereto is disclosed solely for 

purposes of this Agreement, and no information contained herein or therein
shall be deemed to be an admission by any party hereto to any Third Party of
any matter whatsoever (including any violation of Law or breach of contract).
For purposes of this Agreement, if the Company or a Person acting on its
behalf posts a document to the online data room hosted on behalf of the
Company and located at https://datasite.merrillcorp.com or such document has
been filed with the SEC by the Company and is publicly available on EDGAR, in
each case, at least two (2) Business Days prior to the date hereof or such
document is set forth on the Delivered Documents Schedule, such document shall
be deemed to have been "delivered," "furnished" or "made available" (or any
phrase of similar import) to the Purchaser and the Merger Sub by the Company.
The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this
Agreement with the benefit of competent legal representation, and the language
used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the
parties to express their mutual intent. In the event that an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any provisions hereof. Neither the drafting history nor the negotiating
history of this Agreement will be used or referred to in connection with the
construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

13.10 Amendment and Waiver. Any provision of this Agreement or the Disclosure
Schedules or Exhibits hereto may be amended or waived only in a writing signed
by the Purchaser, the Merger Sub, the Company and the Stockholder
Representative. No failure or delay of any party in exercising any right or
remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof. No waiver of any provision
hereunder or any breach or default thereof shall extend to or affect in any
way any other provision or prior or subsequent breach or default.

13.11 Complete Agreement. This Agreement, the Related Agreements and the other
documents referred to herein (including the Confidentiality Agreement) contain
the complete agreement between the parties hereto and supersede any prior
understandings, agreements or representations by or between the parties,
written or oral, which may have related to the subject matter hereof in any
way.

13.12 Third‑Party Beneficiaries. (i) Section 8.03 shall be enforceable by the
current and former officers, directors and similar functionaries of the
Company and/or its Subsidiaries and his or her heirs and representatives, (ii)
Section 13.19 is intended for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each Non‑Recourse Party of a party to this Agreement and (iii) Section 10.02,
this Section 13.12, Section 13.13, Section 13.17 and Section 13.18(b) are
intended for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Investor and
each Lender. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, nothing expressed
or referred to in this Agreement will be construed to give any Person other
than the parties to this Agreement any legal or equitable right, remedy, or
claim under or with respect to this Agreement or any provision of this
Agreement. In addition, after the Closing, the Stockholder Representative
shall have the right, but not the obligation, to enforce any rights of any of
the Stockholders under this Agreement.

13.13 Waiver of Trial by Jury. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY WAIVES, TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM,
DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION (A) ARISING UNDER 

THIS AGREEMENT OR (B) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO
THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE
TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER
ARISING, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE. EACH PARTY TO
THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION,
OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY, AND THAT
THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT
AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF
THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

13.14 Purchaser and the Merger Sub Deliveries. Each of the Purchaser and the
Merger Sub agrees and acknowledges that all documents or other items delivered
or made available to the Purchaser Parties shall be deemed to be delivered or
made available, as the case may be, to the Purchaser and the Merger Sub for
all purposes hereunder.

13.15 Delivery by Electronic Transmission. This Agreement and any signed
agreement entered into in connection herewith or contemplated hereby, and any
amendments hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a
facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to
electronic mail, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original
contract and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effects as if
it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the
request of any party hereto or to any such contract, each other party hereto
or thereto shall re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to all
other parties. No party hereto or to any such contract shall raise the use of
a facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to
electronic mail to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or
contract was transmitted or communicated through the use of facsimile machine
or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to electronic mail as a
defense to the formation of a contract and each such party forever waives any
such defense.

13.16 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts,
any one of which need not contain the signature of more than one party, but
all such counterparts taken together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

13.17 Governing Law. All issues and questions concerning the construction,
validity, interpretation and enforceability of this Agreement and the Exhibits
and Schedules hereto shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of law
or conflict of law rules or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or
any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
any dispute, claim or controversy of any kind or description with respect to
the Debt Commitment Letters shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the internal law of the State of New York.

13.18 Jurisdiction.

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, any suit, action
or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter
arising out of or 

in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may
be brought in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware,
the Delaware Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or any other court of
the State of Delaware, and each of the parties hereto hereby consents to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding which
is brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party
anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such
court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of
process on such party as provided in Section 13.05 shall be deemed effective
service of process on such party.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of the
parties agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action,
claim, cross‑claim or third‑party claim of any kind or description, whether in
law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the
Lenders in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, including to any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letters or the
performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of
New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof). The
parties further agree that all of the provisions of Section 13.13 relating to
the waiver of jury trial shall apply to any action, cause of action, claim,
cross‑claim or third party‑claim referenced in this Section 13.18(b).

13.19 No Recourse. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or
otherwise, the parties to this Agreement agree on their own behalf and on
behalf of their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates that no Non‑Recourse
Party of a party to this Agreement shall have any liability relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated herein except to the extent
expressly agreed to in writing by such Non‑Recourse Party.

13.20 Specific Performance.

(a) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the rights of each party to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are unique and recognizes and
affirms that in the event of a breach of this Agreement by any party, money
damages may be inadequate and the other party may have no adequate remedy at
law. Accordingly, the parties agree that (i) such other party shall have the
right, in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in their favor at
law or in equity, to enforce their rights and the other party's obligations
hereunder not only by an action or actions for damages but also by an action
or actions for specific performance, injunctive and/or other equitable relief
(without posting of bond or other security) and (ii) the right of specific
enforcement is an integral part of the 

transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right such other
party would not have entered into this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including
Section 13.20(a)), it is explicitly agreed that the right of the Company to
specific performance or other equitable remedies to enforce the Purchaser's
obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and the Purchaser's
obligation to consummate the Closing shall be subject to the requirements that
(i) all of the conditions set forth in Section 3.01 (other than those to be
satisfied at the Closing itself) were satisfied at the time when the Closing
would have been required to occur pursuant to Section 2.01 and remain
satisfied, (ii) the Debt Financing has been funded in accordance with the
terms thereof or will be funded at the Closing, (iii) the Company has
irrevocably confirmed in writing to the Purchaser that if specific performance
is granted and the Debt Financing is funded then the Company would consummate
the Closing in accordance with the terms hereof (including by satisfying all
conditions set forth in Section 3.01 to be satisfied at the Closing itself),
(iv) the Purchaser failed to consummate the Closing within three (3) Business
Days following the later of (A) the delivery of the notice contemplated by the
foregoing clause (iii) and (B) the time when the Closing should have occurred
pursuant to Section 2.01 and (v) the Company was prepared and able to
consummate the Closing during such three (3) Business Day period. In no event
shall the Company or any other Person be entitled to seek the remedy of
specific performance with respect to the Purchaser's obligations to consummate
the Closing other than solely under the specific circumstance described in the
preceding sentence of this Section 13.20(b). In no event shall any Person
other than the Company be entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance
with respect to the Purchaser's obligations to consummate the Closing.

(c) For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, the Company may pursue both (A) the remedy of specific
performance with respect to the Purchaser's obligation to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded and the Purchaser's obligation to consummate the
Closing to the extent permitted by this Section 13.20 and (B) the payment of
damages for any breach hereof.

13.21 Guarantee.

(a) Onex, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, hereby irrevocably,
absolutely and unconditionally guarantees the due, punctual and complete
payment in full of all obligations of each Stockholder that is a Subsidiary or
Affiliate of Onex or Onex Corporation (or is or is beneficially owned by a
director, officer or employee thereof, but not those individuals who are
affiliated with Onex or Onex Corporation solely as a result of their capacity
as directors, officers or employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries or
other portfolio companies of Onex) incurred under Article IX of this
Agreement, as and when due and payable under this Agreement, as from time to
time amended, modified or supplemented in accordance with their terms (the
"Guaranteed Obligations"). Onex acknowledges and agrees that the Purchaser
shall be entitled to enforce directly against Onex any of the Guaranteed
Obligations. Onex shall have rights of subrogation against any 

Stockholder for which it satisfies any Guaranteed Obligations. To the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, Onex waives presentment to, demand of
payment from and protest to any other Person of any of the Guaranteed
Obligations, and also waives promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance of
this guarantee and of the Guaranteed Obligations and notice of protest for
nonpayment. The Guaranteed Obligations shall not be subject to any reduction,
limitation, impairment, waiver, release, surrender, compromise or termination
for any reason (unless the underlying obligations and liabilities of the
applicable Stockholder shall have been reduced, limited, impaired, waived,
released, surrendered, compromised or terminated in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement, in which case the Guaranteed Obligations shall be reduced,
limited, impaired, waived, released, surrendered, compromised or terminated
correspondingly), and shall not be subject to any defense or setoff,
counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations. The
Purchaser shall not be obligated to file any claim related to the Guaranteed
Obligations in the event any applicable Stockholder becomes subject to a
bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding and the failure of the
Purchaser to so file shall not affect Onex's obligations hereunder. In the
event that any payment to the Purchaser for a Guaranteed Obligation hereunder
is rescinded to the party that made the payment, Onex shall remain liable
hereunder as if such payment had not been made.

(b) Onex further agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations hereunder shall not be
discharged except by complete payment of the amounts payable by each
Stockholder that is a Subsidiary or Affiliate of Onex or Onex Corporation (or
is or is beneficially owned by a director, officer or employee thereof, but
not those individuals who are affiliated with Onex or Onex Corporation solely
as a result of their capacity as directors, officers or employees of the
Company or its Subsidiaries or other portfolio companies of Onex) pursuant to
Article IX or Sections 11.09 or 11.10 (or the discharge of the underlying
obligations and liabilities of the applicable Stockholder), and that the
obligations of Onex hereunder shall not be released or discharged, in whole or
in part, or otherwise affected by (i) the failure of the Purchaser to assert
any claim or demand or enforce any right or remedy against any applicable
Stockholder or any other Person; (ii) insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization
or similar proceeding affecting any applicable Stockholder or any related
party, or the dissolution, liquidation, merger, or winding up of any such
Person; (iii) waiver, compromise, consolidation or other amendment or
modification of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement made in
accordance with the terms hereof; (iv) any change in corporate existence,
structure or ownership of Onex, any Stockholder, or any other Person
interested in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of the
Related Agreements, as applicable; (v) the existence of any claim, setoff or
other right that Onex may have against the Purchaser or any other Person
(except to the extent such claim, setoff or other right is available to the
applicable Stockholder); or (vi) the adequacy of any other means the Purchaser
may have of obtaining payment related to the Guaranteed Obligations. Onex
acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct and indirect benefits
from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Related
Agreements. 

(c) This guarantee shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of Onex
and shall inure to the benefit of the Purchaser and its successors and
assigns.
