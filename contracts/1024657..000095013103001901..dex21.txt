Baseline Statement   - iv -      AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   THIS
AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is made and entered into as
of March 27, 2003, by and among West Corporation ("Parent"), a
Delaware corporation; Dialing Acquisition Corp. ("Sub"), a Delaware
corporation; ITC Holding Company, Inc. ("Company"), a Delaware corporation;
and, solely with respect to Sections 3.6, 4.1 and 8.13, Article 11 and
Article 12 as the stockholders\' representative, Campbell B. Lanier, III (the
"Stockholder Representative").   Preamble   The respective Boards of
Directors of Company, Sub and Parent are of the opinion that the transactions
described herein are in the best interests of the Parties to this Agreement
and their respective stockholders. This Agreement provides for the
acquisition of Company by Parent pursuant to the merger of Sub with and into
Company. At the effective time of such merger, the outstanding shares of the
capital stock of Company shall be converted into the right to receive the
Cash Merger Consideration (except as provided herein). As a result, Company
shall continue to conduct its business and operations as a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent. The transactions described in this Agreement,
including the Merger, are subject to the approvals of the stockholders of
Company, the consummation of the Stock Dispositions, termination or
expiration of the required waiting period under the HSR Act and the
satisfaction of certain other conditions described in this Agreement.  
Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as
a condition and inducement to Parent\'s willingness to enter into this
Agreement, certain of the holders of the outstanding shares of Company
Capital Stock have executed and delivered to Parent an agreement in
substantially the form of one of the agreements attached as Exhibit 1 (each a
"Voting Agreement"), pursuant to which they have agreed, among other things,
subject to the terms thereof, to vote the shares of Company Capital Stock
over which such Persons have voting power to adopt this Agreement and the
related transactions.   Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are
defined in Section 13.1.    NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above
and the mutual warranties, representations, covenants, and agreements set
forth herein, the Parties agree as follows:   ARTICLE 1  TRANSACTIONS AND
TERMS OF MERGER  1.1 Merger.   Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, Sub shall be merged with and into Company
in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 251 of the DGCL and
with the effects provided in Section 259 of the DGCL (the "Merger"). As a
result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Sub shall cease and
Company shall continue as the Surviving Corporation of the Merger and as a
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent and shall continue to be governed by the
Laws of the State of Delaware. The Merger shall be consummated pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement, which has been approved by the respective Boards
of Directors of Company, Sub and Parent.  1.2 Time and Place of
Closing.   The closing of the transactions contemplated hereby (the
"Closing") will take place at 9:00 A.M. on the date that the Effective Time
occurs, or at such other time as the Parties, acting through
their    authorized officers, may mutually agree. The Closing shall be
held at such location as may be mutually agreed upon by the Parties.  1.3
Effective Time.   The Merger shall become effective on the date and at the
time the Certificate of Merger reflecting the Merger shall be filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later date as the
Parties mutually agree (the "Effective Time"). Subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing by the
authorized officers of each Party, the Parties shall use their reasonable
efforts to cause the Effective Time to occur on the first Business Day
following the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in
Article 9, other than those conditions requiring performance at the
Closing.   ARTICLE 2  TERMS OF MERGER  2.1 Certificate of
Incorporation.   The Certificate of Incorporation of Company in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended to read in its
entirety as set forth in Exhibit 2 attached hereto and as so amended shall

immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until duly amended or repealed.  2.3 Directors and Officers.

provisions of this Article 3, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Company, Sub or the
stockholders of any of the foregoing, the shares of the
constituent corporations shall be converted as follows:   (i) Each share of
Sub Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately  prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to be outstanding and shall be  converted into one hundred
(100) shares of common stock, par value $0.01  per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.   (ii) Subject to Sections 3.5 and 3.6, each share of Company
Common  Stock held by an "accredited investor" (as defined in Rule 501 of
the  Securities Act) who makes certain investor representations to Company
(a  "Qualified Investor") in the Investor Letter (the "Investor Letter"), 
excluding shares held by any Company Entity or any Parent Entity and 
excluding shares held by stockholders who perfect their statutory appraisal 
rights, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (but 
after conversion of any Company Preferred Stock that is to be converted 
immediately prior to the Effective Time and after exercise of any Company 
Options that are to be exercised immediately prior to the Effective Time) 
shall cease to be outstanding and shall be converted into and exchanged for 
the right to receive an amount of cash equal to the sum of (1) the 
Accredited Per Share Amount, without interest thereon, plus (2) the Escrow 
Per Share Amount, with interest thereon as described in Section 4.3 minus 
(3) any required withholding of Taxes (the "Accredited Merger 
Consideration").   (iii) Subject to Sections 3.5 and 3.6, each share of
Company Common  Stock held by a stockholder that is not a Qualified Investor,
excluding  shares held by any Company Entity or any Parent Entity and
excluding shares  held by stockholders who perfect their statutory appraisal
rights, issued  and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (but
after  conversion of any Company Preferred Stock that is to be converted 
immediately prior to the Effective Time and after exercise of any Company 
Options that are to be exercised immediately prior to the Effective Time) 
shall cease to be outstanding and shall be converted into and exchanged for 
the right to receive an amount of cash equal to (1) the Other Per Share 
Amount, without interest thereon, minus (2) any required withholding of 
Taxes (the "Non-Accredited Merger Consideration" and together with the 
Accredited Merger Consideration, the "Cash Merger Consideration").   (b)
Certain Definitions.   (i) Accredited Per Share Amount. The "Accredited Per
Share Amount"  shall be equal to the quotient (rounded down to the fourth
decimal place)  of (A) the product of (1) the Aggregate Cash Consideration
plus the product  of the aggregate number of all In The Money Options
immediately prior to  the Effective Time (but after exercise of any Company
Options that are to  be exercised immediately prior to the Effective Time)
multiplied by the  weighted average exercise price of such In The Money
Options, multiplied by  (2) the quotient (rounded down to the fourth decimal
place) of the  Accredited Shares (as defined below) divided by the number of
shares of  Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time  (but after conversion of any Company Preferred Stock that is
to be  converted immediately prior to the Effective Time and after exercise
of any  Company Options that are to be exercised immediately prior to the
Effective  Time) plus all In The Money Options (the "Accredited Quotient"),
less the  aggregate amount of the Escrow Deposits divided by (B) the number
of  Accredited Shares.   - 3 -     (ii) Accredited Shares. The
"Accredited Shares" shall mean that number  of shares of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior  to the Effective Time (but after
conversion of any Company Preferred Stock  that is to be converted
immediately prior to the Effective Time and after  exercise of any Company
Options that are to be exercised immediately prior  to the Effective Time)
(regardless of whether such shares are unvested,  subject to right of
repurchase, risk of forfeiture or other condition in  favor of Company at
such time) held by Qualified Investors.   (iii) Other Per Share Amount. The
"Other Per Share Amount" shall be  equal to the quotient (rounded down to the
fourth decimal place) of (A) the  product of (1) the Aggregate Cash
Consideration plus the product of the  aggregate number of all In The Money
Options immediately prior to the  Effective Time (but after exercise of any
Company Options that are to be  exercised immediately prior to the Effective
Time) multiplied by the  weighted average exercise price of such In The Money
Options, multiplied by  (2) the quotient (rounded down to the fourth decimal
place) of the Other  Shares divided by the number of shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time (but after
conversion of any  Company Preferred Stock that is to be converted
immediately prior to the  Effective Time and after exercise of any Company
Options that are to be  exercised immediately prior to the Effective Time)
plus all In The Money  Options (the "Other Quotient") divided by (B) the
number of Other Shares.   (iv) Other Shares. The "Other Shares" shall mean
that number of shares  of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the  Effective Time (but after conversion of any Company
Preferred Stock that is  to be converted immediately prior to the Effective
Time and after exercise  of any Company Options that are to be exercised
immediately prior to the  Effective Time) (regardless of whether such shares
are unvested, subject to  right of repurchase, risk of forfeiture or other
condition in favor of  Company at such time) not held by a Qualified
Investor.   (v) Escrow Per Share Amount. The "Escrow Per Share Amount" shall
be  equal to the quotient (rounded down to the fourth decimal place) of (A)
the  aggregate amount of the Escrow Deposits divided by (B) the number of 
Accredited Shares. The amount of the Escrow Deposits may be reduced in 
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, including without limitation, 
pursuant to Article 11.   (c) The Investor Letter was mailed on February 25,
2003 (the "Mailing Date") to each holder of record of Company Capital Stock
as of February 25, 2003 (the "Investor Record Date").   (d) Any Company
Capital Stock with respect to which the holder (or the beneficial owner, as
the case may be) shall not have submitted to Company, an effective, properly
completed Investor Letter on or before the date which is three (3) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date (the "Investment Deadline") shall be exchanged
for the right to receive the Non-Accredited Merger Consideration in
accordance with Section 3.2(a).   - 4 -     (e) Company shall make
available such number of Investor Letters as may be reasonably requested by
all persons who become holders (or beneficial owners) of Company Capital
Stock between the Investor Record Date and close of business on the Business
Day prior to the Investment Deadline, and Company shall provide to the Paying
Agent all information reasonably necessary for it to perform as specified
herein.   (f) Any such Investor Letter shall have been properly tendered
only if Company shall have actually received a properly completed Investor
Letter by the Investment Deadline. An Investor Letter shall be deemed
properly completed only if the holder shall have properly executed the
Investor Letter attesting that such holder is or is not an "accredited
investor" and making those other representations contained in the Investor
Letter.   (g) For illustrative purposes only, an example of the calculations
of the Accredited Merger Consideration, the Non-Accredited Merger
Consideration and the consideration to be paid to the option holders pursuant
to Section 3.4 is set forth on Exhibit 4.   (h) The amount of Accredited
Merger Consideration payable to a Company stockholder that is a stockholder
of the corporation purchasing the Disposed Companies in the Stock
Dispositions or that is purchasing the Lear jet from Company in the Asset
Dispositions (a "Disposition Stockholder") shall be setoff against amounts
owed by such stockholder to Company or a Company Entity, directly or
indirectly, under the Promissory Notes. Company shall provide to Parent and
the Paying Agent not less than one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing Date
(i) a list of the stockholders of Company that are subject to setoff pursuant
to this Section 3.2(h), (ii) a calculation of the amounts to be setoff
against the Accredited Merger Consideration payable to each such stockholder
of Company, and (iii) evidence signed by each such stockholder of Company of
the right of Parent to setoff amounts payable under this Agreement to such
stockholder against the portion of the amounts of the Promissory
Notes guaranteed by such stockholder. The aggregate amount of the Accredited
Merger Consideration to be offset against amounts owed to Company or a
Company Entity by all of the Disposition Stockholders shall equal the
aggregate of the amounts payable under the Promissory Notes. In no event
shall the amount owed by any Disposition Stockholder under the Promissory
Notes exceed the amount of Accredited Merger Consideration payable to such
stockholder.   (i) Subject to the rights of reimbursement and other remedies
available under this Agreement, in no event shall the Cash Merger
Consideration payable by Parent hereunder for all, but not less than all, of
the issued and oustanding shares of Company Capital Stock, together with the
amount payable by Parent under Section 3.4 in respect of all Company Options,
exceed or be less than the Aggregate Cash Consideration.  3.3 Shares Held
by Company or Parent.   Each of the shares of Company Capital Stock held by
any Company Entity or by any Parent Entity shall be canceled and retired at
the Effective Time and no consideration shall be issued in exchange
therefor.  3.4 Treatment of Equity Rights.   (a) Company shall take all
actions necessary to provide that all outstanding options or other Equity
Rights to purchase shares of Company Common Stock ("Company Options") granted
under any stock option plan, program or similar arrangement of Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, each as amended (the "Company Option Plans") or
otherwise, shall become fully exercisable and vested immediately prior to the
Effective Time whether or not otherwise exercisable and vested. Company
shall   - 5 -    comply with the terms of the Company Option Plans, as
applicable, and, to the extent required thereunder, provide written notice to
the holders of Company Options that such Company Options shall be treated as
set forth herein. Holders of Company Options shall be given the opportunity
to exercise their Company Options, effective immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and thereby to become stockholders of Company, entitled to
receive the Cash Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock
at the same time and in the same manner as the other Company stockholders
pursuant to Article 3.   (b) All Company Options which are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, are held by persons who are not
Qualified Investors, and are not exercised in accordance with Section 3.4(a)
shall be canceled and shall become null and void, and the holders thereof
shall be entitled to receive, at the same time and in the same manner as the
Company stockholders pursuant to this Article 3, for each such Company Option
to acquire one share of Company Common Stock, an amount in cash equal to (x)
the Other Per Share Amount minus (y) the exercise price per share of such
Company Option (such difference being referred to as the "Exercise
Difference," and the aggregate amount of such Exercise Differences for all
Option holders who are not Qualified Investors, the "Aggregate
Exercise Differences"). All applicable withholding taxes attributable to the
payments made hereunder with respect to any Company Option (the "Required
Withholding Amount") shall be deducted from the amounts payable hereunder
with respect to such Company Option. Notwithstanding anything in this Section
3.4(c) to the contrary, in the event the Exercise Difference is zero or a
negative number with respect to any Company Option, the holder of such
Company Option shall receive no consideration in connection with the
cancellation of such Company Option pursuant to this Section 3.4(b).   (c)
All Company Options which are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, are held by Qualified Investors, and are not exercised in accordance
with Section 3.4(a) shall be canceled and shall become null and void, and the
holders thereof shall be entitled to receive from the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time, for each such Company Option to acquire one
share of Company Common Stock, that number of Shares of Company Common
Stock equal to the quotient of the Exercise Difference divided by the Other
Per Share Amount (the "Option Amount"). For Company Options to acquire more
than one share of Company Common Stock, the number of shares of Company
Common Stock to be received shall be equal to the product of the Option
Amount by the number of shares of Company Common Stock able to be acquired
under such Company Option. All applicable withholding taxes attributable to
the distributions contemplated hereby shall be deducted from the shares to be
distributed hereunder by withholding that number of shares having a value
equal to the Required Withholding Amount. Notwithstanding anything in this
Section 3.4(c) to the contrary, in the event the Exercise Difference is zero
or a negative number with respect to any Company Option, the holder of such
Company Option shall receive no consideration in connection with the
cancellation of such Company Option pursuant to this Section 3.4(c).
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 3.4(c) to the contrary, the Company
shall not be obligated to issue any fraction of a share of Company Stock
under this Section 3.4(c), and the Company will pay to any holder of a
fraction of a share of Company Common Stock that otherwise would be
distributed hereunder, a cash payment equal to the product of such
fraction and the Exercise Difference (the "Fractional Option Distribution").
Holders receiving a distribution of Company Common Stock pursuant to this
Section 3.4(c) shall become stockholders of the Company, entitled to receive
the Accredited Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock at
the same time and in the same manner as the other Qualified Investor
stockholders pursuant to Article 3.   (d) The Company Option Plans shall
terminate immediately prior to the Effective Time.  3.5 Estimated Balance
Sheet.   (a) Company will cause to be prepared and delivered to Parent
a consolidated balance sheet for Company and the Company Subsidiaries, pro
forma giving effect to the Stock Dispositions, as of the   - 6
-     Closing Date (the "Estimated Balance Sheet") and a certificate
based on such Estimated Balance Sheet setting forth in reasonable detail
Company\'s estimate of Working Capital (the "Estimated Working Capital") and
Net Cash on Hand (the "Estimated Net Cash On Hand"), as of such date (the
"Estimated Working Capital Certificate"). The Estimated Balance Sheet shall
(i) include the consolidated financial position of Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, and (ii) present the estimated financial position of Company
and the Company Subsidiaries as at the close of business on the Closing Date.
The Estimated Balance Sheet and the Estimated Working Capital Certificate
shall be prepared using the same accounting methods, policies, practices,
procedures and adjustments as were used in the preparation of the Baseline
Statement, which are attached as Exhibit 5 hereto (the "Agreed Accounting
Principles").   (b) Company shall deliver to Parent the Estimated Balance
Sheet and the Estimated Working Capital Certificate no less than five (5)
business days prior to the Closing Date. The Estimated Balance Sheet and the
Estimated Working Capital Certificate shall be deemed final upon the earliest
of (i) the date on which Parent and Company agree that such documents are
final, (ii) the third Business Day after receipt of such documents pursuant
to Section 3.5(b) if Parent has not delivered a written notice to Company
that expresses a disagreement in good faith of at least $5,000,000 with the
Estimated Working Capital or the Estimated Net Cash on Hand or the
calculations thereof and setting forth its calculations of such amounts, and
(iii) the date on which all disputes relating to such statements and
calculations between the Parties are resolved in accordance with Section
3.5(c). If Parent delivers a notice of disagreement pursuant to this Section
3.5(b), such notice shall specify in reasonable detail those items or amounts
as to which it disagrees.   (c) If Parent delivers a notice of disagreement
pursuant to Section 3.5(b), Company and Parent shall, during the two (2)
Business Days following such delivery, use their reasonable efforts to reach
agreement on the disputed items or amounts (the "Disputed Estimated
Amounts"). If, during such period, Company and Parent are unable to reach
such agreement, they shall promptly thereafter cause PriceWaterhouseCoopers
(or if said firm shall be unwilling to act thereunder, such other independent
public accountants of nationally recognized standing reasonably satisfactory
to Parent and Company), promptly to review and analyze the Estimated Balance
Sheet and the Estimated Working Capital Certificate for correctness and
compliance with the calculations described in Exhibits 3 and 5. The
independent accountants shall be entitled to review all work papers of the
Parties used in calculating the Disputed Estimated Amounts. In making such
calculations, such independent accountants shall act as arbitrators. Such
independent accountants shall deliver to Company and Parent, as promptly as
practicable and in any event no later than seven (7) days after the Estimated
Balance Sheet and Estimated Working Capital Certificate are provided to such
independent accountants, the independent accountants\' calculations of the
Estimated Working Capital and the Estimated Net Cash on Hand. Such
calculations shall be final and binding upon Company and Parent, absent
fraud, bad faith, willful misconduct or manifest error in the
preparation thereof. Both Company and Parent shall have the opportunity to
participate in such analysis and comment on the workpapers related thereto
prior to the delivery of the calculations of the Estimated Working Capital
and the Estimated Net Cash on Hand by the independent accountants. The cost
of such review and calculations shall be borne (i) by Company if the
difference between (A) the sum of the Estimated Working Capital and the
Estimated Net Cash on Hand shown in the independent accountants\' calculation
and (B) the sum of Company\'s calculation of the Estimated Working Capital
and Estimated Net Cash on Hand delivered pursuant to Section 3.5(a) is
greater than the difference between (C) the sum of the Estimated Working
Capital and Estimated Net Cash on Hand shown in the independent accountants\'
calculation and (D) the sum of Parent\'s calculation of the Estimated Working
Capital and Estimated Cash on Hand delivered pursuant to Section 3.5(b), (ii)
by Parent if the difference between (E) the sum of the Estimated Working
Capital and Estimated Net Cash on Hand shown in the independent accountants\'
calculation and (F) the sum of Parent\'s calculation of the Estimated Working
Capital and Estimated Cash on Hand delivered pursuant to Section 3.5(b) is
greater than the difference between (G) the sum of the Estimated Working
Capital and Estimate Cash on Hand   - 7 -     shown in the independent
accountants\' calculation and (H) the sum of Company\'s calculation of the
Estimated Working Capital and Estimated Cash on Hand delivered pursuant to
Section 3.5(a), and (iii) otherwise equally by Company and Parent. If for any
reason the independent accountants do not complete their procedures within
the seven (7) day review period, then Company and Parent shall jointly
determine the Estimated Working Capital and the Estimated Net Cash on Hand as
soon as reasonably practical following such review period. If Company and
Parent are unable to make a joint determination within two (2) Business
Days after such review period, then the final Estimated Working Capital and
the final Estimated Net Cash on Hand shall be equal to the average of
Company\'s and Parent\'s calculation of the Estimated Working Capital and the
average of Company\'s and Parent\'s calculation of the Estimated Net Cash on
Hand.   (d) If the Estimated Working Capital as determined in accordance
with this Section 3.5 is greater than the Baseline Working Capital Amount,
the Aggregate Cash Consideration payable by Parent at Closing shall be
increased by the amount of the excess; provided, however, the Estimated
Working Capital shall not exceed $13,000,000 for the purposes of this Section
3.5(d).   (e) If the Estimated Working Capital as determined in accordance
with this Section 3.5 is less than the Baseline Working Capital Amount, the
Aggregate Cash Consideration payable by Parent at Closing shall be reduced by
the amount of the deficiency.   (f) If the Estimated Net Cash on Hand as
determined in accordance with this Section 3.5 is greater than $0, the
Aggregate Cash Consideration payable by Parent at Closing shall be increased
by the amount of the excess; provided, however, the Estimated Net Cash on
Hand shall not exceed $25,000,000 for the purposes of this Section
3.5(f).   (g) If the Estimated Net Cash on Hand as determined in accordance
with this Section 3.5 is less than $0, the Aggregate Cash Consideration
payable by Parent at Closing shall be reduced by the amount of the
deficiency.  3.6 Closing Working Capital.   (a) As promptly as
practicable, but not later than thirty (30) days after the Closing Date,
Parent will cause to be prepared and delivered to the Stockholder
Representative a consolidated balance sheet, giving effect to the Stock
Dispositions, of Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date
(the "Closing Balance Sheet") and a certificate based on the Closing Balance
Sheet setting forth in reasonable detail Parent\'s calculation of the Closing
Working Capital and the Net Cash on Hand (the "Closing Net Cash On Hand") as
of the Closing Date (the "Closing Working Capital Certificate"). The Closing
Balance Sheet shall (i) include the consolidated financial position of
Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii) present the consolidated financial
position of Company and its Subsidiaries as at the close of business on the
Closing Date. The Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Working Capital
Certificate shall be prepared using the Agreed Accounting Principles.   (b)
The Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Working Capital
Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 3.6(a) shall be deemed final,
absent fraud, bad faith, willful misconduct or manifest error in the
preparation thereof, upon the earliest of (i) the date on which Parent and
the Stockholder Representative agree that such documents are final, (ii) the
30th day after receipt of such documents pursuant to Section 3.6(a), if the
Stockholder Representative has not delivered a notice that expresses a
disagreement with the Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Working Capital
Certificate or the Closing Working Capital or the calculations thereof and
setting forth their calculation of such amount(s), and (iii) the date on
which all disputes relating to such statements and calculations between the
Parties are resolved in accordance   - 8 -      with Section 3.6(c).
If the Stockholder Representative delivers a notice of disagreement pursuant
to this Section 3.6(b), such notice shall specify those items or amounts as
to which they disagree.   (c) If the Stockholder Representative delivers a
notice of disagreement pursuant to Section 3.6(b), the Stockholder
Representative and Parent shall, during the 30 days following such delivery,
use their reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or
amounts (the "Disputed Amounts"). If, during such period, the Stockholder
Representative and Parent are unable to reach such agreement, they shall
promptly thereafter cause PriceWaterhouseCoopers (or if said firm shall be
unwilling to act thereunder, such other independent public accountants of
nationally recognized standing reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the
Stockholder Representative), promptly to review this Agreement, the documents
delivered pursuant to Section 3.6(a) and any other documents necessary to
calculate the Disputed Amounts (including all work papers of the Parties used
in calculating the Disputed Amounts). In making such calculation, such
independent accountants shall act as arbitrators. Such independent
accountants shall deliver to the Stockholder Representative and Parent, as
promptly as practicable and in any event no later than 90 days after their
engagement, a report setting forth such calculation. Such report shall
be final and binding upon the stockholders of Company and Parent, absent
fraud, bad faith, willful misconduct or manifest error in the preparation
thereof. The cost of such review and report shall be (i) deducted from either
the InterCall Fund or the ITC Operations Fund, as Parent may determine in its
sole discretion, in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, if the
difference between the Closing Working Capital shown in the independent
accountants\' calculation and the Stockholder Representative\'s calculation
of the Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to Section 3.6(b) is
greater than the difference between the Closing Working Capital shown in the
independent accountants\' calculation and Parent\'s calculation of the
Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to Section 3.6(a), (ii) borne by
Parent if the difference between the Closing Working Capital shown in the
independent accountants\' calculation and Parent\'s calculation of the
Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to Section 3.6(a) is greater than
the difference between the Closing Working Capital shown in the independent
accountants\' calculation and the Stockholder Representative\'s calculation
of the Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to Section 3.6(b), and
(iii) otherwise borne equally by the stockholders of Company, through
a deduction from either the InterCall Fund or the ITC Operations Fund, as
Parent may determine in its sole discretion, in accordance with the terms of
the Escrow Agreement, and Parent.   (d) The independent accountants shall
have jurisdiction to decide any and all issues presented to it that arise out
of or relate to this Section 3.6 or the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the issue of whether or not the independent accountants have
jurisdiction to decide any particular dispute controversy or claim. The
arbitration shall be held in Cobb County, Georgia. The governing Law shall be
as set forth in Section 13.8 of this Agreement and the parties\' consent to
the jurisdiction of the courts identified in Section 13.8 of this Agreement
for all purposes in connection with the arbitration, including (i)
enforcement of the arbitration award and (ii) issuance of
provisional remedies to protect rights, interests, assets or property,
including but not limited to temporary or preliminary injunctive relief, to
ensure ultimate satisfaction of the arbitration award. The parties agree that
the award made by the independent accountants shall be final and binding on
the parties and that they waive any right to appeal the arbitral award, to
the extent an appeal may be lawfully waived.   (e) The Stockholder
Representative and Parent agree that they will, and will cause their
respective independent accountants and the Company Entities to, cooperate and
assist in the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Working Capital Certificate and in the conduct of the reviews referred to in
this Section 3.6, including, without limitation, making available, to
the extent necessary, relevant books, records, working papers, analyses
and schedules, and permitting representatives of the Parties to consult (in
the presence of a representative of the Company Entities) with the
respective employees, auditors, actuaries, attorneys and agents of the
Company Entities. The   - 9 -     Stockholder Representative and
Parent further agree that they will take reasonable efforts to ensure that a
representative of the Stockholder Representative and Parent are present and
permitted to participate in any and all discussions involving the independent
accountants relating to the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Working
Capital Certificates and a copy of all information provided to the
independent accountants by one Party is promptly delivered to the other
Party.   (f) Subject to Section 3.6(j), if the Closing Working Capital as
determined in accordance with this Section 3.6 is greater than the Estimated
Working Capital (as determined in accordance with Section 3.5 and as capped
by Section 3.5(d), if applicable), then the Aggregate Cash Consideration
payable by Parent shall be increased by the amount of the excess, and Parent
shall pay to the Paying Agent such excess to be promptly distributed to the
Company Stockholders and option holders in the same manner as the Cash Merger
Consideration and other consideration was distributed pursuant to Sections
3.2, 3.4 and 4.1.   (g) Subject to Section 3.6(j), if the Closing Working
Capital as determined in accordance with this Section 3.6 is less than the
Estimated Working Capital (as determined in accordance with Section 3.5 and
as capped by Section 3.5(d), if applicable), then the amount of such
deficiency shall be deducted from either the InterCall Fund or the ITC
Operations Fund, as Parent may determine in its sole discretion, in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.   (h) Subject to Section
3.6(j), if the Closing Net Cash on Hand as determined in accordance with this
Section 3.6 is greater than the Estimated Net Cash on Hand (as determined in
accordance with Section 3.5 and as capped by Section 3.5(f), if applicable),
then the Aggregate Cash Consideration payable by Parent shall be increased by
the amount of the excess, and Parent shall pay to the Paying Agent such
excess to be promptly distributed to the Company Stockholders and option
holders in the same manner as the Cash Merger Consideration and other
consideration was distributed pursuant to Sections 3.2, 3.4 and 4.1.   (i)
Subject to Section 3.6(j), if the Closing Net Cash on Hand as determined in
accordance with this Section 3.6 is less than the Estimated Net Cash on Hand
(as determined in accordance with Section 3.5 and as capped by Section
3.5(f), if applicable), then the amount of such deficiency shall be deducted
from either the InterCall Fund or the ITC Operations Fund, as Parent may
determine in its sole discretion, in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement.   (j) If pursuant to this Section 3.6 there is both an
increase to the Aggregate Cash Consideration and an entitlement to a
deduction from the InterCall Fund or the ITC Operations Fund, Parent shall be
entitled to offset the amount of such deduction against the additional amount
of Aggregate Cash Consideration prior to the payment of the remaining
portion, if any, of the additional Aggregate Cash Consideration or making any
deduction from the InterCall Fund or the ITC Operations Fund, as the case may
be, for the remaining portion, if any.  3.7 Dissenting Stockholders.  
(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, but only
in the circumstances and to the extent provided by the DGCL, shares of
Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and that are held by Company stockholders who did not vote such shares
in favor of the Merger and who shall have properly and timely delivered to
Company, as the case may be, a written demand for appraisal of their shares
of the Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive, or be
exchangeable for, the Cash Merger Consideration. Instead, the holders thereof
shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance
with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL;   - 10 -     provided,
however, that (i) if any holder of Dissenting Shares shall subsequently
withdraw its demand for payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares,
or (ii) if any holder fails to establish and perfect its entitlement to the
relief provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, the rights and obligations of
such holder to receive such fair value shall terminate, and such Dissenting
Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into the right to
receive, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the
Cash Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 3.2 hereof.   (b)
Within three (3) days prior to the Effective Time, Company shall give Parent
notice of any demands received by Company for appraisal of Dissenting Shares.
Prior to the Closing, Company shall control all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands and on and after the Closing, Parent shall
exercise such control. Parent shall promptly pay to any holder of Dissenting
Shares any and all amounts due and owing to such holder as a result of any
settlement or determination by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
with respect to such demands. If, as a result of any such settlement
or determination (i) any Company stockholder is entitled to receive as
payment for its Dissenting Shares an amount per share that exceeds the
Accredited Merger Consideration or the Non-Accredited Merger Consideration,
as the case may be (the aggregate amount of such excess for all Dissenting
Shares the "Appraisal Reduction Amount"), then the Appraisal Reduction Amount
shall be deducted from the ITC Operations Fund or the InterCall Fund, as
Parent may determine in its sole discretion, in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement, or (ii) any Company stockholder is entitled to receive an amount
per share that is less than the amount of the Accredited Merger Consideration
or the Non-Accredited Merger Consideration, as the case may be (the aggregate
amount of such deficiency for all Dissenting Shares, the "Appraisal Addition
Amount"), then Parent shall promptly deposit with the Escrow Agent the
Appraisal Addition Amount, with such amount to be treated as interest is
treated on the Escrow Deposits in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement. Company shall comply with the notice provisions of Section 262 of
the DGCL.   (c) All of the costs and expenses incurred by the Parties in
connection with this Section 3.7 (but excluding the amounts due and owing to
the holders of Dissenting Shares under Section 3.7(b)) shall be paid by
Company in cash prior to the Closing Date and thereafter shall be deducted
from the ITC Operations Fund or the InterCall Fund, as Parent may determine
in its sole discretion.   ARTICLE 4  PAYMENT OF MERGER CONSIDERATION  4.1
Payment Procedures.   (a) At the Effective Time, Parent shall wire in
immediately available funds to a paying agent selected by Company and
approved by Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld (the
"Paying Agent"), for exchange in accordance with this Section 4.1, the
Aggregate Cash Consideration less the sum of (A) the aggregate amount of the
Escrow Deposits, and (B) the aggregate amounts of the Promissory Notes.
Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent and the Stockholder Representative
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates which represented shares of Company Capital Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Certificates") appropriate
transmittal materials and instructions (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to such Certificates shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates, to the Paying Agent).
The Certificate or Certificates representing Company Capital Stock so
delivered shall be duly endorsed as the Paying Agent may require. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Capital
Stock represented by Certificates that are not registered in the transfer
records of Company, the Cash Merger Consideration provided in Section 3.2 may
be issued to a transferee if the Certificates representing such shares are
delivered to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to   -
11 -      evidence such transfer and by evidence satisfactory to the
Paying Agent that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. If any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, mislaid or destroyed, upon receipt
of (i) an affidavit of that fact from the holder claiming such Certificate to
be lost, mislaid, stolen or destroyed, (ii) such bond, security or indemnity
as Parent and the Paying Agent may reasonably require and (iii) any other
documents necessary to evidence and effect the bona fide exchange thereof,
the Paying Agent shall deliver to such holder the consideration into which
the shares represented by such lost, stolen, mislaid or destroyed Certificate
shall have been converted. The Paying Agent may establish such other
reasonable and customary rules and procedures in connection with its duties
as it may deem appropriate. Parent shall pay all charges and expenses,
including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the distribution of
the Cash Merger Consideration.   (b) After the Effective Time, each holder
of shares of Company Capital Stock (other than shares to be canceled pursuant
to Section 3.3, and excluding Dissenting Shares and excluding shares to be
issued upon the exercise of Company Options immediately prior to the
Effective Time) issued and outstanding at the Effective Time shall surrender
the Certificate or Certificates representing such shares to the Paying Agent
and shall promptly upon surrender thereof receive in exchange therefor the
consideration provided in Section 3.2. Parent shall not be obligated to
deliver the consideration to which any former holder of Company Capital Stock
is entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders such
holder\'s Certificate or Certificates for exchange as provided in
this Section 4.1. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall
deliver to the holders of Company Options the amounts due, if any, to such
holders of Company Options under Sections 3.4(b) and 3.4(c).   (c) Each of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Capital Stock such amounts, if
any, as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
Law. To the extent that any amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the holder of the shares of Company Capital Stock in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.   (d) Any other provision of this
Agreement notwithstanding, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent shall be liable to a holder of Company Capital Stock for any
amounts paid or property delivered in good faith to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.  4.2
Rights of Former Company Stockholders.   At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of Company shall be closed as to holders of Company Capital
Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time and no transfer of Company
Capital Stock by any such holder shall thereafter be made or recognized.
Until surrendered for exchange in accordance with the provisions of Section
4.1, each Certificate theretofore representing shares of Company Capital
Stock (other than shares to be canceled pursuant to Sections 3.3 and
excluding Dissenting Shares) shall from and after the Effective
Time represent for all purposes only the right to receive the consideration
provided in Sections 3.2 in exchange therefor.  4.3 Escrow Fund.   At the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with The Bank of New York, as escrow
agent under the Escrow Agreement, from the Aggregate Cash Consideration:   -
12 -      (a) an amount of cash equal to $10,000,000 (the "InterCall
Fund");   (b) an amount of cash equal to $4,500,000 (the "ITC Non-Operations
Fund"); and   (c) an amount of cash equal to $12,500,000 (the "ITC
Operations Fund" and, together with the InterCall Fund and the ITC Non-
Operations Fund, the "Escrow Deposits").   Each of the amounts set forth in
paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) above shall be held, invested and disbursed in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit 6 (the "Escrow
Agreement").   Article 5  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY

business as now conducted and to own, lease and operate its material Assets.
Company is duly qualified or licensed to transact business as a foreign
corporation in good standing in the States of the United States and foreign
jurisdictions where the character of its Assets or the nature or conduct of

jurisdictions in which the failure to be so qualified or licensed would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Section 5.1 of the Company Disclosure
Memorandum sets forth all jurisdictions in which Company is qualified to

Breach By Agreement.   (a) Company has the corporate power and authority

of Company, subject to the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and the holders of
two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Company Preferred Stock,
as contemplated by Section 8.1, which are the only stockholder votes required
for adoption of this Agreement and consummation of the Merger by Company.
Subject to such requisite stockholder approval, this Agreement represents a
legal, valid, and binding obligation of Company, enforceable against Company
in accordance with its terms (except in all cases as such enforceability may
be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
receivership, conservatorship, moratorium, or similar Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors\' rights generally and except that the availability
of the equitable remedy of specific performance or injunctive relief is
subject to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding may be
brought).   - 13 -      (b) Except as disclosed in Section 5.2(b) of
the Company Disclosure Memorandum, neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Company, nor the consummation by Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including, without limitation, the setting up, the
payment and the other operation of the Escrow Deposits), nor compliance by
Company with any of the provisions hereof, will (i) conflict with or result
in a breach of any provision of Company\'s Certificate of Incorporation or
Bylaws or the certificate or articles of incorporation or bylaws or similar
constitutive document of any Company Subsidiary or any resolution adopted by
the board of directors or the stockholders of any Company Entity, or (ii)
constitute or result in a Default under, or require any Consent pursuant to,
or result in the creation of any Lien on any material Asset of any Company
Entity under, any Company Contract or Permit of any Company Entity, where

likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect, or, (iii) subject to receipt of the requisite Consents referred to in
Section 5.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Memorandum, constitute or result in
a Default under, or require any Consent pursuant to, any Law or Order
applicable to any Company Entity or any of their respective material
Assets.   (c) Other than Consents required from Regulatory Authorities set
forth in Section 5.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Memorandum, and other than

not party to or bound by a Contract with Company or any Company Entity is
necessary for the consummation by Company of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated in this Agreement (including, without limitation,
the setting up, the payment and the other operation of the Escrow Deposits),
other than Consents, filings, or notifications which, if not obtained or
made, are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.  5.3 Capital Stock.   The authorized

and is in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction in which it is
incorporated or organized, and has the corporate power and authority
necessary for it to own, lease, and operate its material Assets and to carry
on its business as now conducted. Each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified
or licensed to transact business as a foreign entity in good standing in the
States of the United States and foreign jurisdictions where the character of
its Assets or the nature or conduct of its business requires it to be so
qualified or licensed, except for jurisdictions in which the failure to be so
qualified or licensed would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Section

such Subsidiary is incorporated or organized and are owned by the Company
Entity free and clear of any Lien.   (b) Legal Connect Limited, a Company
Subsidiary organized under the laws of the United Kingdom, has neither

advice of outside legal counsel, and (B) if Company and its officers and
directors have complied in all   - 36 -    respects with their
obligations set forth in Section 8.2 in connection with its receipt of all

Entity nor any of its Affiliates or Representatives shall, directly or
indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, encourage, induce or otherwise facilitate
any inquiry or the making, submission, offer or announcement of any

such Acquisition Proposal and of Company\'s intention to furnish nonpublic
information to, or enter into discussions or negotiations with, such Person
or Group, and (2) prior to providing any non-public information or data to

the extent such nonpublic information has not been previously made available
by Company to Parent). Company shall keep Parent informed, on a prompt basis,
of the status and material terms of any proposals or offers referred to in
this Section 8.2(a) and the status and material terms of any discussions or
negotiations referred to herein.   (b) Each of the Company Entities shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, immediately cease any and all existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore

Consents of Regulatory Authorities.   (a) Each of the Parties (i) will, as
promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, make an appropriate
filing of a Notification and Report Form with the United States antitrust
enforcement authorities, the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") and the United
States Department of Justice ("DOJ"), pursuant to the HSR Act (and make such
other filings and responses as may be required under state Laws or under Laws
in foreign jurisdictions governing antitrust or merger control matters) with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) will promptly file any
supplemental or additional information and documentary materials which may be
requested in connection therewith by Regulatory Authorities, (iii) will
comply in all material respects with all other requirements of the HSR Act,

or foreign Law or Order designed to protect competition (collectively,
"Antitrust Laws"), and (iv) will take all other actions necessary to cause
the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the
Antitrust Laws as soon as practicable. Each Party shall use its
reasonable efforts to resolve objections, if any, which may be asserted with
respect to the Merger under the Antitrust Laws. In the event any Litigation
is threatened or instituted challenging the Merger as violative of Antitrust
Laws, each Party shall use its reasonable efforts to avoid the filing of, or
resist or resolve such Litigation. Each Party shall use its reasonable
efforts to take such action as may be required by: (i) the DOJ and/or the FTC
in order to resolve such objections as either of them may have to the Merger
under the Antitrust Laws, or (ii) any federal or state court of the United
States, or similar court of competent jurisdiction in any foreign
jurisdiction, in any suit brought by any Regulatory Authority or any other
Person challenging the Merger as violative of the Antitrust Laws, in order to
avoid the entry of any Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent)
which has the effect of preventing the consummation of the Merger and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any such Order. Parent shall be
entitled to direct any proceedings or negotiations with any Regulatory
Authority relating to any of the foregoing, provided that it shall afford
Company a reasonable opportunity to participate therein.   (b) The Parties
hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their reasonable efforts to
promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all
applications, notices, petitions and filings (which shall include the filings
pursuant to subsection (a) above), and to obtain as promptly as practicable
all Consents of all Regulatory Authorities and other Persons which are
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including the Merger). The Parties agree that they will
consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all Consents of all
Regulatory Authorities and other Persons necessary or advisable to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each Party will keep the
other apprised of the status of matters relating to consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein. Each Party also shall promptly advise the
other upon receiving any communication from any Regulatory Authority whose
Consent is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement which causes such Party to believe that there is a reasonable
likelihood that any requisite Consent will not be obtained or that the
receipt of any such Consent will be materially delayed.  8.4 Filing with
State Office.   Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, Company shall execute and file the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in connection with the
Closing.  8.5 Agreement as to Efforts to Consummate.   (a) Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party agrees to use, and to
cause its Subsidiaries to use, its reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper, or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective,
as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using its reasonable
efforts to lift or rescind any Order adversely affecting its ability to
consummate the transactions contemplated herein and to cause to be
satisfied the conditions referred to in Article 9; provided, that nothing
herein shall preclude either Party from exercising its rights under this
Agreement.   (b) Neither Parent nor Sub shall, without the prior written
consent of the Company, take any action to amend, terminate or rescind the
Commitment Letter in any manner that would reasonably be expected to decrease
the likelihood that the Financing will be obtained at Closing and each shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy the terms and conditions
set forth in the Commitment Letter on   - 38 -      or before the
termination of this Agreement; provided, however, that this Section 8.5(b)
shall not restrict Parent\'s ability to reasonably withhold its consent under
the Commitment Letter in respect of pricing matters related to
the Financing.  8.6 Investigation and Confidentiality.   (a) Prior to the
Effective Time, each Party shall keep the other Party advised of all material
developments relevant to its business and to consummation of the Merger and
shall permit the other Party to make or cause to be made such investigation
of the business and properties of it and its Subsidiaries and of their
respective financial and legal conditions as the other Party reasonably
requests, provided that such investigation shall be reasonably related to the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not interfere unnecessarily with
normal operations. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, Parent shall not
be required to provide disclosure to Company if such disclosure violates, or
could reasonably be expected to violate, applicable securities laws. No
investigation by a Party shall affect the ability of such Party to rely on
the representations and warranties of the other Party.   (b) In addition to
the Parties\' respective obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement,
which is hereby reaffirmed and adopted, and incorporated by reference herein,
each Party shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, maintain the
confidentiality of all confidential information made available to it by the
other Party concerning its and its Subsidiaries\' businesses, operations, and
financial positions and shall not use such information for any purpose except
in furtherance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If this
Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time, each Party shall
promptly return or certify the destruction of all documents and copies
thereof, and all work papers containing confidential information received
from the other Party.   (c) Each Party agrees to give the other Party notice
as soon as practicable after any determination by it of any fact or
occurrence relating to the other Party which it has discovered through the
course of its investigation and which represents, or would represent, either
a material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of
the other Party or which has had or would have a Company Material Adverse
Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as applicable.  8.7 Press
Releases.   Prior to the Effective Time, Company and Parent shall consult
with each other as to the form and substance of any press release or other
public disclosure materially related to this Agreement or any other
transaction contemplated hereby; provided, that nothing in this Section 8.7
shall be deemed to prohibit any Party from making any disclosure which its
counsel deems necessary or advisable in order to satisfy such Party\'s
disclosure obligations imposed by Law.  8.8 Employee Benefits and
Contracts.   (a) Prior to or effective upon the Closing, Company shall adopt
a severance plan for employees of InterCall in substantially the form
attached to Section 8.8 of the Company Disclosure Memorandum (the "InterCall
Severance Plan"). Following the adoption of the InterCall Severance Plan,
Company and Parent shall cooperate in the "roll out" of the InterCall
Severance Plan, including the development and delivery of appropriate
employee communications associated with such plan. Prior to the Closing,
Company shall take all actions necessary and required to amend Company\'s
401(k) plan to provide one hundred percent (100%) vesting of all Company
contributions previously allocated to each active participant under such
plan. Following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide generally to
officers and employees of the Company Entities who are or become employed by
InterCall or any of their respective Subsidiaries on or following the Closing
(the "Transferred Employees") employee benefits under   - 39
-      employee benefit plans (other than stock option or other plans
involving the potential issuance of Parent Common Stock), on terms and
conditions which, when taken as a whole, are substantially similar to those
currently provided by the Parent Entities to their similarly-situated
officers and employees; provided, that, for a period of twelve (12) months
after the Effective Time, Parent shall provide to Transferred Employees
severance benefits in accordance with either (i) the InterCall Severance
Plan, or (ii) the policies of Parent, whichever of (i) or (ii) will provide
the greater benefit to the officer or employee; provided further, that Parent
shall be entitled to continue providing Transferred Employees employee
benefits on the terms and conditions that were provided by Company and any
Company Entity immediately prior to the Effective Time until such time as
Parent\'s first open enrollment under its benefit plans which shall be no
later than nine (9) months following the Effective Time.   (b) For purposes
of eligibility and vesting, but not benefit accruals, under any Parent
Employee Benefit Plan, the service of the Transferred Employees prior to the
Effective Time shall be treated as service with a Parent Entity for purposes
of such Parent Employee Benefit Plans. Parent also shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor in accordance with their terms all
employment, severance, consulting and other compensation Contracts disclosed
in Section 8.8 of the Company Disclosure Memorandum to Parent between any
Company Entity and any current or former director, officer, or
employee thereof, and all provisions for vested benefits or other vested
amounts earned or accrued through the Effective Time under the Company
Benefit Plans. The amount of monetary obligations owed to or with respect to
such current and former directors, officers and employees listed in Section
8.8 of the Company Disclosure Memorandum have been accrued in the Company\'s
Financial Statements. The Company and InterCall have financial obligations
for providing post-employment medical and dental benefits ("Continued Health
Benefits") to the officers listed on Section 5.7(b) of the Company Disclosure
Memorandum and their respective spouses (each a "Covered Individual"), in
accordance with the Severance Agreement and General Release executed between
each of such officers and the Company (a "Severance Agreement"). The Company
has provided to Parent a copy of each Severance Agreement reflecting the
maximum period during which Continued Health Benefits shall be provided (the
"Continuation Period"). As of the date of execution of this Agreement, the
Covered Individuals are provided medical and dental benefits through the
medical plan, dental plan and any related insurance policy or policies with
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Georgia (collectively, the "Current Plan"). In the
event the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, the Surviving Corporation or any
successor thereto, as applicable (the "Continuing Sponsor") fails to continue
in full force and effect during the Continuation Period the Current Plan, or
in the event coverage of the Covered Individuals under the Current Plan
(determined with regard to both benefits provided and the cost of such
benefits) is reduced during the Continuation Period, then (i) the Continuing
Sponsor, at its sole cost and expense, shall obtain Continued Health Benefits
for the Covered Individuals other than Campbell B. Lanier, III and his spouse
and William H. Scott, III and his spouse (the "Lanier and Smith Covered
Individuals") under a replacement plan that is comparable to the Current Plan
(determined with regard to both benefits provided and the cost of such
benefits), and (ii) the Continuing Sponsor shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain Continued Health Benefits for the Lanier and Smith Covered
Individuals under a replacement plan that is comparable to the Current Plan
(determined with regard to both benefits provided and the cost of such
benefits). If the Continuing Sponsor fails to obtain such coverage under a
replacement plan for the Lanier and Smith Covered Individuals, then each of
Campbell B. Lanier, III or William H. Scott, III can elect either (i) to
pay any additional premiums for the Continued Health Benefits over the costs
for such individual that was reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet that
is attributable to providing Continued Health Benefits or (ii) to require
the Continuing Sponsor to pay directly to such individual an amount equal to
the remaining pro rata share reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet that
is attributable to providing Continued Health Benefits for such individual
and his spouse. Any such payment shall be made within thirty (30) days of
the discontinuance of the Current Plan or the date that coverage of the
Covered Individual under the Current Plan is reduced. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, following the Closing, in no event
shall Parent, Surviving Corporation or any of their   - 40
-      respective Subsidiaries have any Liability with respect to any
employment, severance, consulting or other compensation Contract between any
Company Entity and any employee or former employee of any Disposed Company in
such Person\'s capacity as an employee or former employee of any Disposed
Company.   (c) Following the Effective Time, no employee of a Company Entity
who elects to be covered under any medical or disability insurance plan of a
Parent Entity shall be excluded from coverage under such plan on the basis of
a pre-existing condition that was not also excluded under the applicable
Company Benefit Plan. To the extent that an employee of a Company Entity has
satisfied in whole or in part any annual deductible or paid any out-of-pocket
or co-payment expenses (as evidenced by reasonable documentation to be
provided by Company) under a medical insurance plan of a Company Entity for a
plan year, such individual shall be credited therefor under the corresponding
provisions of the corresponding Parent Employee Benefit Plan in which such
individual participates after the Effective Time.  8.9 Indemnification of
Officers and Directors.   (a) From and after the Effective Time, in the
event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding, or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, or administrative (a "Claim"),
including a Claim in which any person who is now, or has been at any time
prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective
Time, a current or former director or officer of any Company Entity (each an
"Indemnified Party") is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole
or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i)
the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was acting in his or her capacity
as a director, officer, or employee of Company, any of the Company
Subsidiaries, or any of their respective predecessors (excluding any Claim
brought by an Indemnified Party against another Indemnified Party), or (ii)
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, whether in any
case asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, if
the Indemnified Party, in his or her capacity as a director, officer of
employee of any Company Entity, is or is threatened to be made a defendant in
such Claim each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and
hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by Law, each such
Indemnified Party against any Liability (including reasonable attorneys\'
fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit,
proceeding, or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent
permitted by Law upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable Law),
judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such
threatened or actual Claim and in the event of any such threatened or actual
Claim (whether asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time), the
Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to them;
provided, that (x) Parent shall have the right to assume the defense thereof
and upon such assumption Parent shall not be liable to any Indemnified Party
for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently
incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof,
except that if Parent elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the
Indemnified Parties reasonably advises the Indemnified Parties that there are
issues which raise conflicts of interest between Parent and the Indemnified
Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory
to them, and Parent shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel for the Indemnified Parties, (y) neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected without Parent\'s
prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), and (z) neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
shall have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a
court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and
such determination shall have become final and nonappealable, that
indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby
is prohibited by applicable Law. Parent\'s and the Surviving Corporation\'s
obligations under this Section 8.9(a) continue in full force and effect for a
period of six years after the Effective Time; provided, that all rights to
indemnification in   - 41 -      respect of any claim (an
"Indemnification Claim") asserted or made within such period shall continue
until the final disposition of such Indemnification Claim.   (b) Parent
agrees that all rights to indemnification and all limitations on Liability
existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers, and employees
of the Company Entities (the "Covered Parties") as provided in the Company
Entities\' respective Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, or
similar governing instruments or any indemnity agreement with a Covered Party
as in effect as of the date of this Agreement with respect to matters
occurring prior to the Effective Time shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect, and shall be honored by such entities or
their respective successors as if they were the indemnifying party
thereunder, without any amendment thereto, for a period of six years after
the Effective Time; provided, that all rights to indemnification in respect
of any Claim asserted or made within such period shall continue until the
final disposition of such Claim; provided, further, however, that nothing
contained in this Section 8.9(b) shall be deemed to preclude the liquidation,
consolidation, or merger of any Company Entity, in which case all of such
rights to indemnification and limitations on Liability shall be deemed to so
survive and continue notwithstanding any such liquidation, consolidation, or
merger. Without limiting the foregoing, in any case in which approval by
Parent is required to effectuate any indemnification, Parent shall direct, at
the election of the Indemnified Party, that the determination of any such
approval shall be made by independent counsel mutually agreed upon
between Parent and the Indemnified Party.   (c) Prior to or at the
Effective Time, Company shall, at its sole cost and expense, secure an
endorsement to the ForeFront Portfolio blended liability insurance policy,
Policy No. 8160-9827 issued to it by Federal Insurance Company for the period
August 16, 2002 to August 16, 2003 (the "Policy"). Such endorsement shall
provide the Indemnified Parties with coverage for acts committed or allegedly
committed prior to the Effective Time. Such coverage shall be for a period of
at least six years following the Effective Time and shall be at least as
broad in scope as the coverage currently provided under the Policy and have
other terms and conditions not materially less favorable to the coverage
presently provided under the Policy. The provisions of this Section 8.9(c)
shall be deemed to have been satisfied if an extended reporting period shall
have been obtained by Parent at Company\'s sole cost and expense prior to or
at the Effective Time, which provides coverage equivalent to that provided
under the Policy for an aggregate period of at least six years, with respect
to acts committed or allegedly committed prior to the Effective Time. Parent
shall maintain, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain, such
coverage in effect for the Indemnified Parties for not less than six
years after the Effective Time. Company shall fully pay the premiums of the
Policy on or before the Effective Time.   (d) If a Claim is based on,
arises out of or pertains to an Indemnified Party\'s actions or inactions in
his or her capacity as a current or former officer, director or employee of
any of the Disposed Companies, Parent shall be reimbursed, to the extent that
such Claim is not covered by the Policy, out of either the InterCall Fund or
the ITC Operations Fund (as Parent may, in its sole discretion, determine)
the amount, if any, for which Parent is required to indemnify such
Indemnified Party under this Section 8.9, any indemnity agreement entered
into by Company in favor of such Indemnified Party or otherwise in connection
with such Claim.   (e) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any
successors or assigns shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or
merger or shall transfer all or substantially all of its Assets to any
Person, then and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 8.9.   (f) The provisions of this
Section 8.9 are intended to be for the benefit of and shall be enforceable by
each Indemnified Party and their respective heirs and representatives.   -
42 -      8.10 Asset Dispositions.   The Asset Dispositions other than
the sale of Surebridge, Inc. shall be consummated on or prior to the
Effective Time and Company agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts
to consummate the sale of Surebridge, Inc. on or prior to the Effective Time.
Company has furnished to Parent a true, complete and correct copy of the
agreements and other documents set forth in Section 8.10 of the Company
Disclosure Memorandum pursuant to which the Asset Dispositions shall be
consummated. Company agrees not to amend the documents set forth in Section
8.10 without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Parties acknowledge that
the corporation purchasing the Disposed Companies ("Purchaser") will
issue additional securities of Purchaser to new investors that are
stockholders of the Company and that such new investors will enter into
agreements and related documents substantially similar to the copies provided
to Parent. Parent agrees that entering into such agreements and related
documents will not be a violation of this Section 8.10. The Parties further
acknowledge that Campbell B. Lanier, III ("Lanier"), as purchaser of the Lear
jet, may assign a portion of the obligation to purchase the Lear jet to third
parties; provided, however, that Lanier shall remain solely liable for all
obligations to ITC Services with respect to such purchase unless the assignee
enters into agreements and related documents substantially similar to the
copies provided to Parent (including, without limitation, a proceeds setoff
letter ("Proceeds Setoff Letter"), and Parent consents to decreasing the
obligations of Lanier with respect to such transaction, in which case the
obligations of Lanier shall be reduced only to the extent such obligations
are assigned to and assumed by the assignee (including, without limitation,
the setoff obligation in the Proceeds Setoff Letter). Section 8.10 of the
Company Disclosure Memorandum sets forth the obligations of any Company
Entity following the Effective Time to any of the Disposed Companies.  8.11
Financing.   Parent understands and agrees that any financing used to
provide Parent with the funds to perform its obligation under this Agreement
shall not contemplate or require the pledge or use of Assets of any Company
Entity prior to the Effective Time.  8.12 Restrictive Covenant
Agreement.   Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
the individuals listed on Section 8.12 of the Company Disclosure Memorandum
have executed and delivered to Parent an agreement in substantially the form
of Exhibit 7 (each a "Restrictive Covenant Agreement").  8.13 Certain Tax
Matters   (a) Preparation of Tax Returns.   (i) Stockholder
Representative\'s Responsibility. The Stockholder  Representative, on behalf
of Company, shall prepare and timely file  (or cause to be prepared and
timely filed) with the relevant taxing  authorities all Tax Returns of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for  the tax year ending December 31, 2002
("2002 Tax Returns"). In the  event that the 2002 Tax Returns are not
completed prior to the Closing  then such returns shall be subject to the
procedures outlined in  subsections (a)(ii)(A) through (C) below, revised to
reflect that the  Stockholder Representative is responsible in the first
instance for  the preparation of the 2002 Tax Returns and therefore placing
the  Stockholder Representative in the position of Parent and Parent in the 
position of the Stockholder Representative.   - 43 -       (ii)
Parent\'s Responsibility. Parent, on behalf of Company, shall  prepare and
timely file (or cause to be prepared and timely filed)  with the relevant
taxing authorities all Tax Returns with respect to  Company or its
Subsidiaries with respect to taxable periods ending  after 2002 and including
the Closing Date ("Final Tax Returns"),  subject to the provisions in
paragraphs (A) - (C) below.   (A) Any such Final Tax Returns shall, to the
extent permitted  by applicable Tax law, be prepared (i) on a basis
consistent with the  last previous Tax Returns filed in respect of Company or
its  Subsidiaries, as the case may be, and (ii) in the case of the Tax 
Returns of Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to the 2003  taxable year
and for which the Reimbursing Parties may have a  reimbursement obligation
under Section 11.1, on a basis consistent  with the underlying methodology
used in the calculation of (x) the  Projected Liabilities and (y) any
estimated tax payments made by  Company or its Subsidiaries, as the case may
be, with respect to the  2003 taxable year.   (B) Parent shall submit a
draft of the Final Tax Returns  (including the underlying work papers) to the
Stockholder  Representative at least ninety (90) days prior to their due date
for  their approval. The Stockholder Representative shall have the right to 
conduct a reasonable review of the Final Tax Returns prepared by  Parent, and
Parent shall not file (or cause to be filed) such Final  Tax Returns without
the prior written consent of the Stockholder  Representative, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or  delayed. The draft Final Tax Returns
shall be deemed final upon the  earliest of (i) the date on which Parent and
the Stockholder  Representative agree that such draft Final Tax Returns are
final, (ii)  the 30th day after receipt of the draft Final Tax Returns
pursuant to  this Section 8.13(a)(ii)(B), if the Stockholder Representative
has not  delivered a notice that expresses disagreement with the draft
Final  Tax Returns and setting forth the basic terms of their disagreement, 
or (iii) the date on which all disputes relating to such Final Tax  Returns
between Parent and the Stockholder Representative are resolved  in accordance
with Section 8.13(a)(ii)(C). If the Stockholder  Representative delivers a
notice of disagreement pursuant to this  Section 8.13(a)(ii)(B), such notice
shall specify those items or  amounts as to which they disagree with
specificity.   (C) If the Stockholder Representative delivers a notice of 
disagreement pursuant to Section 8.13(a)(ii)(B), the Stockholder 
Representative and Parent shall, during the 20 days following such  delivery,
use their commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement  on the disputed
tax items or amounts (the "Disputed Tax Items"). If,  during such period, the
Stockholder Representative and Parent are  unable to reach such agreement,
they shall promptly thereafter cause  accounting firm used in Section 3.6(c)
(or if said firm shall be  unwilling to act thereunder, such other
independent public accountants  of nationally recognized standing reasonably
satisfactory to Parent  and the Stockholder Representative) (the "Tax Dispute
Accountants"),  promptly to review the draft Final Tax Returns and any other
documents  necessary to render a determination on the Disputed Tax Items 
(including all necessary work papers of the parties). The parties will 
present their arguments to the Tax Dispute Accountants within 10 days  after
submission of the dispute to the Tax Dispute Accountants. The  Tax Dispute
Accountants will resolve the dispute, in a fair and  equitable manner and in
accordance with the applicable Tax law, within  20 days after the parties
have presented their arguments to the Tax  Dispute Accountants or earlier if
so required by law. The Tax Dispute  Accountants\' decision shall be final,
conclusive and binding on the  parties. Following the resolution of any such
dispute, Parent shall  prepare and timely file (or cause to be prepared and
timely filed) the  Final Tax Returns, as modified based on the resolution of
such  dispute. The fees and expenses of the Tax dispute Accountants in 
resolving a dispute shall be either borne by Parent or deducted from  the
Escrow Deposits in accordance with the terms of the Escrow  Agreement in
inverse proportion   - 44 -       as the parties may prevail on
matters resolved by the Tax Dispute  Accountants, which proportionate
allocations shall be determined by  the Tax Dispute Accountants at the time
the determination of the Tax  Dispute Accountants is rendered on the merits
of the matters  submitted.   (b) Audits and Other Proceedings.   (i)
Following the Closing Date, if an audit or other  administrative or judicial
proceeding is initiated by any Tax  authority with respect to Taxes of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries  for which the Reimbursing Parties may
have a reimbursement obligation  under Section 11.1, Parent or Company, as
the case may be, shall  promptly notify the Stockholder Representative of
such audit or  proceeding, stating the nature and basis of such claim and the
amount  thereof, to the extent known. Failure to give such notice shall not 
relieve the Reimbursing Parties from any reimbursement obligation  which they
may have with respect to Section 11.1, except to the extent  that the
Reimbursing Parties are prejudiced thereby. The Stockholder  Representative
will have the right, at its option, to control the  conduct of all stages of
such audit or other administrative or  judicial proceeding with
representatives of its own choosing  reasonably acceptable to the Reimbursed
Party (and Reimbursed Party  acknowledges that Alston and Bird LLP shall be
deemed reasonably  acceptable as legal representative to Reimbursing Parties)
with  respect to Taxes of Company or any of its Subsidiaries for which the 
Reimbursing Parties may have a reimbursement obligation under Section  11.1.
At such time as such request is received by Parent, Parent or  Company, as
the case may be, will furnish the Stockholder  Representative and/or its
representatives with powers of attorney or  any other documentation or
authorization necessary or appropriate to  enable the Stockholder
Representative and/or its representatives to  control the conduct of such
audit or other proceeding. Parent shall  control the conduct of all stages of
all other audits or other  administrative or judicial proceedings with
respect to Taxes of  Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Parent and Company
shall not, and  shall not permit any of their Affiliates to, accept any
proposed  adjustment or enter into any settlement or agreement in
compromise  regarding any Taxes of Company or any of its Subsidiaries for
which  the Reimbursing Parties have a reimbursement obligation under
Section  11.1 without the express written consent of the Stockholder 
Representative (on behalf of the Reimbursing Parties).   (ii) With respect
to any audit or other administrative or judicial  proceeding that it
controls, the Stockholder Representative (x) shall  give prompt notice to
Parent of any Tax adjustment proposed in writing  pursuant to any audit or
other administrative or judicial proceeding  controlled by the Stockholder
Representative (on behalf of the Company  Stockholders) with respect to the
assets or activities of Company or  any of its Subsidiaries, and (y) shall
not accept any proposed  adjustment or enter into any settlement or agreement
in compromise  which would bind Parent or Company or any of its Subsidiaries
with  respect to any Taxes of Company or its Subsidiaries (other than any 
such Taxes for which the Reimbursing Parties have a reimbursement  obligation
under Section 11.1) without the express written consent of  Parent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.   (c) Cooperation on
Tax Matters. Parent, the Stockholder Representative and Company stockholders
shall (and after the Closing, Parent shall cause Company to) cooperate fully,
to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the
filing of all Tax Returns and in the course of any audit or other
administrative or judicial proceeding with respect to Taxes. Parent
and Company stockholders agree, and following the Closing, Parent agrees to
cause Company, to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to Company relating to any Tax period beginning before the Closing
Date until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.   - 45
-       (d) Amended Tax Returns. Parent shall not amend, and shall not
permit any of its Affiliates to amend, any Tax Return pertaining to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period without the prior written consent of the Stockholder
Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
provided, however, Parent may amend, and may permit any of its Affiliates to
amend, such a Tax Return without such written consent and thereby forego any
right to reimbursement from the Reimbursing Party under Section 11.1 with
respect to any Tax Return pertaining to a Pre-Closing Tax Period.   (e)
Final Tax Payments. If the amount due and payable on the 2002 Tax Returns or
the Final Tax Returns is less than the amount included in
Projected Liabilities or Working Capital for such obligation, such difference
shall be promptly remitted to the Stockholder Representative (for
distribution to the stockholders of Company in the same manner as provided in
Article 3). If the amount due and payable on the 2002 Tax Returns or the
Final Tax Returns is more than the amount included in Projected Liabilities
or Working Capital for such obligation, such difference shall be considered
an amount subject to reimbursement pursuant to the provisions of Section
11.1. Any amounts subject to reimbursement under the provisions of Section
11.1 pursuant to this Section 8.13(e) shall be deducted from either the
InterCall Fund or the ITC Operations Fund as Parent may determine in its sole
discretion.   (f) Loss. For purposes of Section 11.1, no "Loss" shall have
occurred with respect to any Tax matter arising from a federal, state, local
or other income Tax return if and to the extent any increase in Tax in one
period is offset by a decrease in Tax in another period and such offset is
readily calculable. By way of illustration and not limitation, if an item of
income or deduction is included in one year and it is determined that it
should instead be included or allowed in another year, the reduction in Tax
by reflecting the item in the other year shall reduce the Loss arising from
the increase in Tax in the year adjusted. Similarly, if an item of deduction
is required to be capitalized and recovered over some other period of time
specified at the time of the disallowance of the item, the reduction in Tax
resulting from the later deductions shall offset the original increase in
Tax, but limiting such offset to the amount of Tax deductions actually
permitted to be taken on a Tax return filed by the time of the final
determination of the disallowed amount. No offset will be required to be
made, however, if the timing or amount of the future potentially offsetting
item is uncertain at the time of resolution of the matter resulting in the
Tax loss, such as an adjustment that may only be recovered through recovery
of the basis of an item in a future period that cannot be determined. In the
event of a dispute over the calculation of an offsetting amount, such item
shall be resolved in the manner specified in Section 8.13(a)(ii)(C).  8.14
Real Estate Matters   Company covenants to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain prior to the Closing Date an estoppel certificate (the
"Declarant Estoppel") from the Declarant under the Declaration of Covenants
dated November 2, 1989, recorded in Deed Book 544, Page 543, in the Office of
the Clerk of Superior Court of Troup County, Georgia (the "CCRs") which shall
provide that all of the Owned Real Properties subject to the CCRs are in
compliance with the terms of the CCRs. Further, to the extent the Owned
Property located at 1239 O.G. Skinner Drive, West Point, Georgia or the
1.6306 acre parcel which is contiguous to the property located at 1211 O.G.
Skinner Drive does not comply with the acreage requirement contained in
Section 3.12 of the CCRs, Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain a variance (as described in Section 4.02 of the CCRs) prior
to the Closing Date for such non-compliance. The costs of any such estoppel
certificates and variances under this Section 8.14 shall be borne solely by
Company.   - 46 -       Article 9  CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO

time prior to the Effective Time:   (a) By mutual written agreement of
Parent and Company; or   (b) By either Party (provided that the terminating
Party is not then in breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or
other agreement contained in this Agreement) in the event of a breach by the
other Party of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement
which facts giving rise to such breach cannot be or have not been cured
(provided that no cure period shall be required for a breach which by its
nature cannot be cured) within 30 days after the giving of written notice to

to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect
or a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as applicable, on the breaching Party;
or   (c) By either Party (provided that the terminating Party is not then
in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or other

result of Parent\'s failure to receive the Financing due to any
material adverse condition, material disruption or material adverse change in
the financial, banking or capital markets as set forth in the Commitment
Letter) if the failure to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on
or before such date is not caused by any breach of this Agreement by the
Party electing to terminate pursuant to this Section 10.1(e); provided,
however, that Parent shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 10.1(e) if the failure to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby on or before such date is caused by

the Conditions Precedent to Closing section of the Summary of Indicative

Statement its recommendation, without modification or qualification, that
Company stockholders give the Company Stockholder Approval or shall have
formally withdrawn, qualified or modified, in a manner adverse to Parent, the
recommendation of such Board of Directors to Company stockholders that they
give the Company Stockholder Approval, or (ii) the Board of Directors of
Company shall have affirmed, recommended or authorized entering into any
Acquisition Transaction other than the Merger; or   (g) By Company, if prior
to receipt of Company Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of Company

Superior Proposal, (B) the material terms of the Superior Proposal, and (C)
Company intends to effect a Company Subsequent Determination, an offer that
the Board of Directors of Company shall have concluded in its good faith
judgment is as favorable to the Company stockholders as such
Superior Proposal, and (ii) Company shall have tendered to Parent the Company
Termination Fee payable pursuant to Section 13.2(b); or   (h) By Company in
the event that the Financing has been terminated; or   (i) By Parent in the
event that the Financing has been terminated as a result of a material
adverse change set forth in clause (iii) of the last paragraph of the
Commitment Letter or in condition 2 or in the first part of Condition 3 of
the Conditions Precedent to Closing section of the Summary of Indicative
Terms and Conditions incorporated into the Commitment Letter and, if required
by Section 13.2(c), Parent has tendered to Company the Parent Termination Fee
as provided therein.  10.2 Effect of Termination.   In the event of the
termination and abandonment of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1, this
Agreement shall become void and have no effect, without any Liability on the
part of any Party or its Affiliates, Representatives or stockholders, except
that (i) the provisions of this Section 10.2, Section 8.6(b) and Article 13
shall survive any such termination and abandonment, and (ii) no such
termination shall relieve the breaching Party from Liability resulting from
any willful breach by that Party of this Agreement. No termination of this
Agreement shall affect the obligations of the parties contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, all of which obligations shall survive termination
of this Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof.    Article 11 
REIMBURSEMENT FOR LOSSES  11.1 Reimbursement for Losses.   (a)
Notwithstanding the Closing, the Escrow Deposits shall be reduced
in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and this Article 11 in an amount
sufficient to compensate Parent and any Affiliate of Parent and their
respective directors, officers, agents and employees (the "Reimbursed
Party"), for any damage (including, without limitation, punitive and
consequential damages), liability, loss, cost, expense (including all
reasonable attorneys\' fees), interest, penalty, assessments or fines
(collectively, "Losses")   - 51 -    suffered or incurred by any
Reimbursed Party at any time and from time to time, arising out of or
resulting from one or more of the following:   (i) the breach of any
representation or warranty of Company  contained in this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement or in any schedule  or certificate delivered herewith or
therewith to Parent in connection  with the Closing, which results in a Loss
after the Effective Time;   (ii) any failure of Company to duly perform or
observe prior to  the Effective Time any term, provision, covenant, agreement
or  condition contained in this Agreement on the part of Company to be 
performed or observed, which results in a Loss after the Effective  Time;
and   (iii) the matters set forth in Section 11.1 of the Company 
Disclosure Memorandum, which matters result in a Loss after the  Effective
Time.  For purposes of determining under this Section 11.1 if any
representation or warranty of Company other than Sections 5.10(c), 5.17,
5.18, and 5.27 has been breached, any qualification or limitation of such
representation or warranty by reference to the materiality of matters stated
therein or as to matters having or not having a "Material Adverse Effect,"
and any limitation of such representations and warranties as being "to the
Knowledge of," or "known to" or words of similar effect, shall be
disregarded, in determining any breach thereof.   (b) Any reduction in the
Escrow Deposits pursuant to Section 11.1(a) above shall be subject to the
limitations set forth in this Article 11 including the following
limitations:   (i) Any Reimbursement Claim for Losses resulting from, based
upon  or arising out of the InterCall Business shall be made only against 
the InterCall Fund. The InterCall Fund shall not be reduced under  Section
11.1(a) for Losses resulting from, based upon or arising out  of the
InterCall Business unless the aggregate of all Losses relating  thereto for
which a reduction would, but for this Section 11.1(b)(i),  be made exceeds on
a cumulative basis an amount equal to $1,000,000  (subject to Section
11.1(b)(iii)), and upon reaching such amount, the  InterCall Fund shall be
reduced only for any such Losses in excess of  such amount; provided,
however, that any claim for which it shall have  been fully and finally
adjudicated or determined that fraud is a  material element shall not be
subject to the limitation set forth in  this clause to the extent the Losses
are caused by or result from such  fraud; and provided, further, that any
Reimbursement Claim for Losses  resulting from, based upon or arising out of
the matters set forth in  Section 8.13(e) shall not be conditioned on, or
subject to, the  $1,000,000 limitation set forth in this clause.   (ii) Any
Reimbursement Claim for Losses resulting from, based  upon or arising out of
the Company Business unrelated to the Company  Disposition Matter or the
Hedges shall be made only against the ITC  Operations Fund. The ITC
Operations Fund shall not be reduced under  Section 11.1(a) for Losses
resulting from, based upon or arising out  of the Company Business unrelated
to the Company Disposition Matter or  the Hedges unless the aggregate of all
Losses relating thereto for  which a reduction would, but for this Section
11.1(b)(ii), be made  exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount equal to
$1,000,000 (subject  to Section 11.1(b)(iv)), but upon reaching such amount,
the ITC  Operations Fund shall be reduced for all such Losses; provided, 
however, that any claim for which it shall have been fully and finally 
adjudicated or determined that fraud is a material element shall not  be
subject to the limitation set forth in this clause to the extent  the Losses
are caused by or result from such fraud; and provided,  further, that any
Reimbursement Claim for Losses resulting from, based  upon or arising out of
the matters set forth   - 52 -     in Section 8.13(e) shall not be
conditioned on, or subject to, the  $1,000,000 limitation set forth in this
clause.   (iii) The maximum amount the Escrow Deposits may be reduced
under  Section 11.1(a) for Losses resulting from, based upon or arising out 
of the InterCall Business, whether individually or in the aggregate, 
(whether such liability would be pursuant to such sections or under  any
other theory of liability) shall not exceed the InterCall Fund.   (iv) The
maximum amount the Escrow Deposits may be reduced under  Section 11.1(a) for
Losses resulting from, based upon or arising out  of the Company Business
unrelated to the Company Disposition Matter or  the Hedges, whether
individually or in the aggregate, (whether such  liability would be pursuant
to such sections or under any other theory  of liability) shall not exceed
(A) the ITC Operations Fund, and (B) if  no funds remain in the ITC
Operations Fund and if there are funds  remaining in the InterCall Fund, the
remaining portion, if any, of the  InterCall Fund.   (v) Any Reimbursement
Claim for Losses resulting from, based upon  or arising out of the Company
Disposition Matter or the Hedges shall  be made only against the ITC Non-
Operations Fund. The maximum amount  the Escrow Deposits may be reduced under
Section 11.1(a) for Losses  resulting from, based upon or arising out of the
Company Disposition  Matter or the Hedges, whether individually or in the
aggregate,  (whether such liability would be pursuant to such sections, the
Escrow  Policy or under any other theory of liability) shall not exceed the 
ITC Non-Operations Fund.   (vi) A Reimbursed Party shall not be entitled
under this  Agreement to multiple recovery for the same Losses.   (vii)
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, to the  extent that the IRS
asserts a claim for an additional amount of Taxes  with respect to the Stock
Dispositions (except to the extent such  Taxes are attributable to a breach
of representation or warranty set  forth in Section 5.8(l)-(p)), there shall
be no right to seek  reimbursement from the Escrow Deposits for the amount of
such Taxes  under Section 11.1.  11.2 Procedures for Reimbursement.   (a)
A Reimbursement Claim shall be made by a Reimbursed Party by delivery of a
written notice to the Stockholder Representative requesting a reduction
in the Escrow Funds and specifying the basis on which such reduction is
sought and the amount of asserted Losses and, in the case of a Third Party
Claim, containing (by attachment or otherwise) such other information as
such Reimbursed Party shall have concerning such Third Party Claim.   (b)
If the Reimbursement Claim involves a Third Party Claim (excluding any claim
that relates to Tax matters), the procedures set forth in Section 11.3 shall
be observed by the Reimbursed Party and the Reimbursing Parties.   (c) If
the Reimbursement Claim involves a Third Party Claim that relates to Tax
matters, the procedures set forth in Section 8.13(b) - (c) (as opposed
to Section 11.3) shall be observed by the Reimbursed Party and the
Reimbursing Parties.   (d) If the Reimbursement Claim involves a matter
other than a Third Party Claim, the Reimbursing Parties shall have 30 days to
object to such Reimbursement Claim by delivery of a written   - 53
-      notice of such objection to such Reimbursed Party specifying in
reasonable detail the basis for such objection. Failure to timely so object
shall constitute a final and binding acceptance of the Reimbursement Claim by
the Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Reimbursing Parties and
the Reimbursement Claim shall be paid in accordance with Section 11.2(e)
hereof.   (e) Upon determination of the amount of a Reimbursement Claim,
whether by agreement between the Reimbursing Parties and the Reimbursed Party
or by any other final adjudication, the Escrow Deposits shall be reduced in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement by the amount of any such Reimbursement
Claim within ten days of the date such amount is determined.  11.3 Third
Party Claims.   The obligations and liabilities of the parties hereunder
with respect to a Third Party Claim (excluding any claim that relates to Tax
matters) shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:   (a) A
Reimbursed Party shall give the Stockholder Representative written notice of
a Third Party Claim promptly after receipt by the Reimbursed Party of notice
thereof, and the Reimbursing Parties may undertake the defense, compromise
and settlement thereof by representatives of its own choosing reasonably
acceptable to the Reimbursed Party (and Reimbursed Party acknowledges that
Alston and Bird LLP shall be deemed reasonably acceptable to act as
legal representatives to Reimbursing Parties). The failure of a Reimbursed
Party to notify the Stockholder Representative of such claim shall not limit
the possibility for the reduction of the Escrow Deposits with respect to such
claim except to the extent the Reimbursing Parties demonstrate that the
defense of such claim is materially prejudiced by such failure. If the
Reimbursed Party desires to participate in, but not control, any such
defense, compromise and settlement, it may do so at its sole cost and
expense. If, however, the Reimbursing Parties fail or refuse to undertake the
defense of such Third Party Claim within twenty (20) days after written
notice of such claim has been given to the Stockholder Representative by the
Reimbursed Party, the Reimbursed Party shall have the right to undertake the
defense, compromise and settlement of such claim with counsel of its own
choosing. In the circumstances described in the preceding sentence, the
Reimbursed Party shall, promptly upon its assumption of the defense of such
claim, make a Reimbursement Claim as specified in Section 11.3 which shall be
deemed a Reimbursement Claim that is not a Third Party Claim for the purposes
of the procedures set forth herein.   (b) No settlement of a Third Party
Claim which shall result in the reduction of the Escrow Deposits under this
Article 11 shall be made without the prior written consent by the Stockholder
Representative on behalf of the Reimbursing Parties, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Consent shall be presumed in the case of
settlements of $50,000 or less where the Reimbursing Parties have not
responded within five Business Days of notice of a proposed settlement. If
the Reimbursing Parties assume the defense of such a Third Party Claim, (i)
no compromise or settlement thereof may be effected by the Reimbursing
Parties without the Reimbursed Party\'s consent unless (a) there is no
finding or admission of any violation of law or any violation of the rights
of any person and no effect on any other claim that may be made against the
Reimbursed Party, and (b) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that
are paid in full by the Reimbursing Parties, and (ii) the Reimbursed Party
shall have no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement thereof
effected without its consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.   (c) In connection with the defense, compromise or
settlement of any Third Party Claim, the Parties to this Agreement shall
execute such powers of attorney as may reasonably be necessary or appropriate
to permit participation of counsel selected by any Party hereto and, as may
reasonably be related to any such claim or action, shall provide access to
the counsel, accountants and other representatives of each Party during
normal business hours to all properties, personnel, books, Tax   - 54
-      records, contracts, commitments and all other business records of
such other Party and will furnish to such other Party copies of all such
documents as may reasonably be requested (certified, if requested).   (d)
All expenses reasonably incurred by the Stockholder Representative
in connection with the defense, compromise and settlement of Reimbursement
Claims under this Section 11.3 shall first be paid out of the interest
accrued on the Escrow Deposits in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and,
to the extent that the amount of such expenses exceeds the amount of such
accrued interest, such excess shall be paid out of the ITC Operations Fund
and/or the InterCall Fund, as Parent may determine in its sole discretion
but, to the extent one fund is depleted, such expenses shall be deducted from
the other fund. Other than as may be deducted from the Escrow Deposits, in no
event shall Parent or any of its Affiliates be liable for expenses incurred
by the Stockholder Representative in connection with the defense, compromise
and settlement of Reimbursement Claims under this Section 11.3.  11.4
Exclusive Post-Closing Remedy.   Absent fraud, and except for seeking
equitable relief, from and after the Closing the sole remedy of a Reimbursed
Party in connection with the matters specified in Section 11.1, shall be the
appropriate Escrow Deposits as set forth in this Article 11. For greater
certainty, claims which are the subject matter of Section 11.1 and which
allege a claim of fraud and state the circumstances constituting fraud with
particularity on the part of any party shall not be subject to the
limitations set forth in this Section 11.4, including, without limitation,
reimbursement exclusively from the Escrow Deposits. For greater certainty, no
stockholder of Company shall have personal liability for any amounts by which
the Escrow Deposits may be reduced under this Agreement, and the sole source
of recovery for such amounts shall be the Escrow Deposits.  11.5 Time
Limitations.   (a) The InterCall Fund or the ITC Operations Fund, as the
case may be, shall not be reduced under Section 11.1(a) hereof for Losses
resulting from, based upon or arising out of the InterCall Business or the
Company Business unrelated to the Company Disposition Matter or the Hedges,
unless written notice asserting a Reimbursement Claim based thereon is given
to the Stockholder Representative in accordance with Section 11.3 prior to
the second anniversary of the Closing Date.   (b) The ITC Non-Operations
Fund shall not be reduced under Section 11.1(a) hereof for Losses resulting
from, based upon or arising out of the Company Disposition Matter or the
Hedges, unless written notice asserting a Reimbursement Claim based thereon
is given to the Stockholder Representative in accordance with Section 11.3
prior to the second anniversary of the Closing Date; provided, however, that
if Company has received written notice from the IRS that it intends to
examine, or that it is in fact examining, the federal income tax consequences
of the Company Disposition Matter, and such examination has not been
concluded on or prior to the second anniversary of the Closing Date, the time
by which notice asserting a Reimbursement Claim must be given to the
Stockholder Representative shall be extended until there has been a
Final Determination of the examination of the Company Disposition
Matter.  11.6 Tax Effect and Insurance.   Subject to the limitations set
forth in Section 11.1, the amount by which the Escrow Deposits shall be
reduced with respect to any Reimbursement Claim shall be reduced by the tax
benefit actually realized and any insurance proceeds received by the
Reimbursed Party as a result of any Losses upon which such Reimbursement
Claim is based, and shall include any tax detriment actually suffered by the
Reimbursed Party as a result of such Losses. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
any insurance proceeds   - 55 -      received by Parent and the
Surviving Corporation under the Escrow Policy (as defined in Section 11.8)
shall not reduce the amount by which the ITC Non-Operations Fund shall be
reduced with respect to any Reimbursement Claim pursuant to Section
11.1(b)(v), inasmuch as each of the Parties agrees that the ITC Non-
Operations Fund is, for all purposes, the Retention (as defined in the Escrow
Policy) with respect to any Loss resulting from, based upon or arising out of
the Company Disposition Matter or the Hedges, including, without limitation,
the reimbursement of Claim Expenses (as defined in the Primary Policy). With
respect to any Losses resulting from, based upon or arising out of the
Hedges, any Reimbursed Party may seek recovery for the amount of such
Losses in excess of the amount of the Retention solely under the Escrow
Policy. Any Losses resulting from, based upon or arising out of the Hedges
which do not exceed the amount of the Retention shall be deducted from the
ITC Non-Operations Fund in accordance with Section 11.1(b)(v). The amount of
any such tax benefit or detriment shall be determined by taking into account
the effect, if any and to the extent determinable, of timing differences
resulting from the acceleration or deferral of items of gain or loss
resulting from such Losses and shall otherwise be determined so that payment
by the Reimbursing Parties of the Reimbursement Claim, as adjusted to give
effect to any such tax benefit or detriment, will make the Reimbursed Party
as economically whole as is reasonably practical with respect to the Losses
upon which the Reimbursement Claim is based.  11.7 Subrogation.   Upon
payment in full of any Reimbursement Claim, whether such payment is effected
by set-off or otherwise, or the payment of any judgment or settlement with
respect to a Third Party Claim, the Reimbursing Parties shall be
subrogated to the extent of such payment to the rights of the Reimbursed
Party against any person or entity with respect to the subject matter of such
Reimbursement Claim or Third Party Claim.  11.8 Reimbursement Claims for
Losses, Resulting from, Based upon or Arising out  of the Company Disposition
Matter.   (a) The Parties acknowledge and agree that the ITC Non-Operations
Fund is, for all purposes, the Retention (as defined in the Escrow Policy)
with respect to any Loss resulting from, based upon or arising out of the
Company Disposition Matter or the Hedges, including, without limitation, the
reimbursement of Claim Expenses (as defined in the Primary Policy); provided,
however, that in no event shall this Section 11.8 or the Escrow Policy
prevent the ITC Non-Operations Fund from being otherwise distributed in
accordance with Section 11.5(b) and the Escrow Agreement (it being understood
that a Policy Claim shall be deemed to be a Reimbursement Claim for purposes
of Section 11.5(b)). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, including, without limitation, Sections 8.13(b), 11.2 and 11.3,
each of Parent, Company and the Stockholder Representative hereby agrees that
a Reimbursement Claim for Losses resulting from, based upon or arising out of
the Company Disposition Matter or the Hedges (to be made against the ITC Non-
Operations Fund pursuant to Section 11.1(b)(v)) shall be governed by the
terms and conditions set forth in the Escrow Policy and in this Section 11.8
and to the extent such losses exceed the ITC Non-Operations Fund,
reimbursement shall be available solely under the Escrow Policy. Each
of Parent, Company and the Stockholder Representative hereby agrees that
with respect to any claim for coverage under the Escrow Policy resulting
from, based upon or arising out of the Company Disposition Matter or the
Hedges (a "Policy Claim") and for so long as there is any amount remaining in
the ITC Non-Operations Fund:   (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall notify the Stockholder  Representative in writing in the event that
Parent or the Surviving  Corporation asserts a Policy Claim. The time limits
for reimbursement  against the ITC Non-Operations Fund shall be governed by
Section 11.5(b)  and the release of funds in the ITC Non-Operations Fund
shall be in  accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.   - 56
-       (ii) Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation shall keep the 
Stockholder Representative informed, on a prompt basis, of the status of  any
Policy Claim and in connection therewith, shall furnish the Stockholder 
Representative with a copy of all material documents relating to such  Policy
Claim. Subject to Section 11.8(a)(i), failure to comply with this  Section
11.8(ii) shall not relieve the Reimbursing Parties from any  reimbursement
obligation which they may have pursuant to Section 11.1,  except to the
extent that the Reimbursing Parties are prejudiced thereby.   (iii) The
Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to consult with  Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and the Insurer (as defined in the Escrow  Policy) on
an ongoing basis during the pendency of any Policy Claim.   (iv) Neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall approve the  settlement of any
Policy Claim with the Insurer or the reimbursement of  Claim Expenses (as
defined in the Primary Policy) which provides for the  reduction of the ITC
Non-Operations Fund without the express written  consent of the Stockholder
Representative, which consent shall not be  unreasonably withheld or
delayed.   (v) Subject to the provisions of this Section 11.8, any Final 
Adjudication (as defined in the Primary Policy) of a Policy Claim with 
respect to Loss covered under the Escrow Policy, including amounts 
attributable to the Retention, shall be final and binding upon Parent, the 
Surviving Corporation and the Stockholder Representative and each such  Party
shall comply in all respects therewith.   (vi) The Stockholder
Representative shall cooperate in good faith with  Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and the Insurer in all matters in  connection with any Policy
Claim.  Other than in the event of material non-compliance with any or all
of the foregoing items (i) through (vi) and subject to the provisions of this
Section 11.8, the Parties agree that any determination made under the Escrow
Policy shall be final and binding upon each of them, absent manifest
error.   (b) Upon exhaustion of the ITC Non-Operations Fund (whether as a
result of the Final Adjudication of a Policy Claim requiring disbursement of
the Retention, a Claim Expense or upon the release of the funds therein to
the Qualified Investors in accordance with the Escrow Agreement), this
Section 11.8 shall be void and of no further force and effect, which shall in
no way affect any other section of this Agreement.   ARTICLE 12 
STOCKHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE  12.1 Appointment; Acceptance.   Each Company
stockholder constitutes and appoints the Stockholder Representative as his or

dispute as herein provided, accepting the defense, compromise and settlement
of any Third Party Claim or refusing to accept the same, taking actions on
behalf of the Company Stockholders in accordance with Section 8.13 hereof,
instituting and prosecuting such actions (including arbitration proceedings)

any of the foregoing, retaining counsel, accountants, appraisers and other
advisers in connection with any of the foregoing, all for the account of the
stockholder, such stockholder   - 57 -      agreeing to be fully bound

agrees that (i) the Stockholder Representative is exclusively authorized to
act on its behalf, notwithstanding any dispute or disagreement among
stockholders, (ii) Parent and any other Person shall be entitled to rely on
any and all actions taken by the Stockholder Representative (regardless of
any disagreement or disparity between them) under this Agreement and any
related agreements without any liability to any of the stockholders of
Company and without any obligation to inquire of any of such stockholders or
the Stockholder Representative.  12.4 Effectiveness.   The authorization
of the Stockholder Representative shall be irrevocable and effective until

stockholders hereby jointly and severally agree (i) to indemnify and hold the
Stockholder Representative harmless from any and all liability, loss, cost,
damage or expense, including attorneys fees (reasonably incurred or suffered
as a result of the performance of their duties under this Agreement), and
(ii) that the Stockholder Representative shall not have any liability to
the stockholders for any act or omission hereunder, except for gross
negligence or willful misconduct. Prior to disbursement of the ITC Operations
Fund, the reasonable fees and expenses of the Stockholder Representative
(including those resulting from mere negligence on the part of the
Stockholder Representative) shall first be paid out of the interest accrued
on the Escrow Deposits in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and, to the
extent the amount of such fees and expenses exceeds the amount of such
accrued interest, such excess shall be deducted from the ITC Operations Fund
or the InterCall Fund, as Parent may determine in its sole discretion, but to
the extent one such fund is depleted, such expenses shall be deducted from
the other fund, in advance where reasonably requested by the Stockholder
Representative. Other than as may be deducted from the Escrow Deposits,
neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates (including, without limitation,
Company following the Effective Time) shall have any liability with respect
to such fees and expenses. The Stockholder Representative shall have no
personal liability to advance any of their moneys hereunder.   - 58
-      12.6 Successor.   Upon not less than 30 days prior written
notice to Parent, the Stockholder Representative shall have the right to
resign at his sole discretion for any reason at any time and in such event,
such Stockholder Representative shall continue to have all rights to
indemnification, fees and expenses as provided in Section 12.5 above. If the
Stockholder Representative resigns or ceases to function in his capacity as
such for any reason whatsoever, such Stockholder Representative shall
immediately give notice to the other parties to this Agreement. In such
event, the stockholders, may appoint a successor and give notice to the other
parties to this Agreement; provided, however, that if for any reason the
Stockholder Representative has resigned and the stockholders do not appoint
any successor within thirty (30) days after the Stockholder Representative
resigns or otherwise ceases to function, then Parent shall have the right,
upon notice to each stockholder, to petition a court of
competent jurisdiction for the appointment of one or more successors.  12.7

AGREEMENT   THIS ESCROW AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made and entered
into as of [__________________], 2003 (the "Effective Date") by and among
West Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), the Stockholder
Representative listed on the signature page hereto (the "Stockholder
Representative" and together with Parent, the "Interested Parties") on behalf
of certain former stockholders (the "Stockholders") of ITC Holding Company,
Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Company"), and The Bank of New York, a New
York banking institution, as escrow agent hereunder (the "Escrow Agent").  
Preamble  --------   Dialing Acquisition Corp. ("Sub"), a Delaware
corporation, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and each of Parent and
Sub is a party to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement")
with Company, dated as of March __, 2003, pursuant to which Sub has on this
date merged (the "Merger") with and into Company with Company surviving the
Merger and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent;   Pursuant to
Section 3.2 of the Merger Agreement, the Stockholders received, in exchange
for shares of capital stock of Company, the right to receive the Aggregate
Cash Consideration, including the right to receive the $27,000,000 in cash
deposited in escrow pursuant to Section 4.3 of the Merger Agreement
(the "Escrow Deposit");   Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement,
the Escrow Deposit has been delivered and will be held by the Escrow Agent
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement until termination of this Agreement
as provided herein; and   The Escrow Agent is willing to hold and administer
such funds and any income thereon and additions thereto, and to pay and
distribute the amounts held by it in accordance with the agreement of the
Interested Parties and/or arbitral or judicial orders and decrees as set
forth in this Agreement.   Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement
are defined in Section 5.1 of this Agreement.   NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which is hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:      ARTICLE
1 ESTABLISHMENT OF ESCROW  1.1 Escrow Deposit.   On the Effective Date,
Parent shall deliver the Escrow Deposit in immediately available funds to the
Escrow Agent. From and after receipt of the Escrow Deposit by the Escrow
Agent, the Escrow Agent will hold and disburse the Escrow Deposit (together
with any cash or other property received in respect thereof or earned
thereon, which shall become a part of the Escrow Deposit) for the benefit of
Parent and the Stockholders, as the case may be, in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement.  1.2 Stockholder Percentage Interests.  
Attached as Schedule I hereto is a schedule showing for each Stockholder (i)
the respective percentage interest (the "Percentage Interest") of each
such Stockholder in the Escrow Deposit, and (ii) the corresponding aggregate
maximum cash payment payable to each Stockholder, subject to the adjustments
provided herein.  1.3 Investments.   The Escrow Agent shall invest the
cash received by the Escrow Agent in Eligible Investments and shall not be
responsible or liable for any loss accruing from any investment made in
accordance herewith. "Eligible Investments" shall mean (i) obligations issued
or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or
instrumentality thereof (provided that the full faith and credit of the
United States is pledged in support thereof); and (ii) shares of money market
funds 100% of the assets of which constitute obligations of the type
described in clause (i) above. No investment shall have a term of more
than 90 days. If otherwise qualified, obligations of the Escrow Agent shall
qualify as Eligible Investments. Absent its timely receipt of such specific
written investment instruction from the Stockholder Representative, the
Escrow Agent shall invest the Escrow Deposit in the Fidelity U.S. Treasury
Fund III or such other comparable investment fund selected from time to time
by the Stockholder Representative and as agreed to by Parent. After first
deducting any fees of the Escrow Agent, all remaining earnings received from
the investment of the Escrow Deposit shall be credited to, and shall become a
part of, the Escrow Deposit (and any losses on such investments shall be
debited from the Escrow Deposit); provided; however, the earnings on the
investment of the Escrow Deposit will be the sole property of the
Stockholders and Parent will have no right to seek recovery of Escrow Claims
from such earnings. The Stockholders have no right to any guaranteed rate of
return on the investment of the Escrow Deposit.  1.4 Tax-Related Terms.  
(a) Tax Characterization. The Interested Parties agree to treat
the Stockholders (in proportion to their respective Percentage Interests) as
the owner of the Escrow Deposit for all federal, state and local income
tax purposes. Accordingly, all earnings   - 2 -    from the investment
of the Escrow Deposit shall be reported as allocated to the Stockholders in
proportion to their respective Percentage Interests.   (b) Certification of
Taxpayer Identification Number. The Stockholders hereto agree to provide the
Escrow Agent with a certified tax identification number for each Stockholder
by signing and returning a Form W-9 (or Form W-8, in case of non-U.S.
persons), or by providing copies of any substitute W-9 by submitting copies
of such Stockholder\'s transmittal materials, to the Escrow Agent prior to
the date on which any income earned on the investment of the Escrow Deposit
is credited to the Escrow Deposit. The Stockholders understand that, in the
event their tax identification numbers are not certified to the Escrow Agent,
the Internal Revenue Code, as amended from time to time, may require
withholding of a portion of any interest or other income earned on
the investment of the Escrow Deposit.   (c) Tax Distributions. The Escrow
Agent shall make a distribution ("Tax Distribution") to the Stockholders (in
proportion to their Percentage Interests) no later than March 15th of each
year during the term of this Agreement in an amount equal to the lesser of
(x) the amount of earnings earned on the investment of the Escrow Deposit in
the previous calendar year or (y) the product of 35% and the amount of
earnings earned on the investment of the Escrow Deposit in the previous
calendar year.  1.5 Separate Allocation of Escrow Deposit.   The Escrow
Deposit shall be maintained by the Escrow Agent as three separate and
distinct funds for the benefit of Parent and the Stockholders. The three
funds are referred to as the InterCall Fund, the ITC Non-Operations Fund and
the ITC Operations Fund. On the Effective Date, the InterCall Fund shall
be allocated $10,000,000 of the Escrow Deposit, the ITC Non-Operations Fund
shall be allocated $4,500,000 of the Escrow Deposit and the ITC Operations
Fund shall be allocated $12,500,000 of the Escrow Deposit. Following the
Effective Date, the Escrow Agent, pursuant to written instructions received
pursuant to Sections 2.2 and 2.3 hereof, or based on the terms of a final
arbitration award or other final adjudication, shall deduct the amount of
each distribution from the appropriate escrow fund. Parent and the
Stockholder Representative agree that the determination of which fund an
Escrow Claim should be deducted from and the limits on the amount of the
Escrow Claims that can be deducted against these funds, shall be governed by
the terms of the Merger Agreement. Further, the Escrow Agent shall allocate
earnings from the investment of the Escrow Deposit to each of these three
funds based on the percentage that each fund represents to the aggregate
amount of the Escrow Deposit at the time such allocation of earnings is
computed; provided; however, the earnings on the investment of the Escrow
Deposit will be the sole property of the Stockholders and Parent will have no
right to seek recovery of Escrow Claims from such earnings. Upon the written
request of Parent or the Stockholder Representative, and on each anniversary
of the Effective Date, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to Parent and the
Stockholder Representative, a report setting forth the amounts then allocated
to each of these funds and a summary of the aggregate earnings from the
investment of the Escrow Deposit since the date of the last report.   - 3
-     Article 2 TERM; DISTRIBUTION OF ESCROW DEPOSIT; LIMITS  2.1
Term.   The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and
shall terminate at such time as the entire Escrow Deposit shall have been
distributed pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.  2.2 Adjustment of
Escrow Deposit.   If, between the Effective Date and the Distribution Date,
Parent shall be entitled to be reimbursed pursuant to an Escrow Claim, then
Parent shall deliver to the Stockholder Representative (with a copy to the
Escrow Agent) a notice thereof (a "Notice of Reimbursement Obligation"),
which notice shall include a good faith estimate of the amount of the Escrow
Claim and shall also allocate in good faith, and in accordance with the terms
of the Merger Agreement, the amount of such Escrow Claim that should be
deducted from the InterCall Fund, the ITC Non-Operations Fund and/or the ITC
Operations Fund. Following the receipt of such Notice of Reimbursement
Obligation, the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall mutually agree on
the amount of the Escrow Claim to be subject to reimbursement hereunder (the
"Reimbursement Amount") and deliver written notice thereof to the Escrow
Agent, or if they cannot so agree, the Reimbursement Amount shall be
determined by arbitration or other final adjudication in accordance with the
terms of the Merger Agreement. Within 10 days following the final
determination of the Reimbursement Amount, the Escrow Agent shall distribute
to Parent an amount of the Escrow Deposit equal to the Reimbursement Amount
and shall hold any remaining Escrow Deposit pursuant to this
Agreement. Unless otherwise set forth in a ruling issued in connection with
arbitration or other final adjudication as provided herein, the Escrow Agent
shall have no right or obligation to distribute funds from the Escrow Deposit
under this Section 2.2 until such time as the Escrow Agent receives a joint
written notice from Parent and the Stockholder Representative setting forth
the amount to be distributed and the portion thereof to be deducted from the
InterCall Fund, the ITC Non-Operations Fund and/or the ITC Operations Fund
(which shall be determined in accordance with the Merger Agreement).  2.3
Distribution of Escrow Deposit.   (a) With respect to Escrow Claims pending
as of the Distribution Date, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall
use their reasonable efforts to agree in writing on the Reimbursement Amount
with respect to any such pending Escrow Claims; provided, that if Parent and
the Stockholder Representative are unable to agree on the Reimbursement
Amount with respect to such Escrow Claims by the Distribution Date, the
Reimbursement Amount for purposes of the calculations in the following
sentences of this Section shall be the amount claimed by Parent in good faith
in its Notice of Reimbursement Obligation, plus an estimate of the
Stockholder Representative\'s maximum legal and other expenses made by the
Stockholder Representative in good faith as communicated to the Escrow Agent
in writing. Upon determination of the Reimbursement Amounts related to
pending Escrow Claims in accordance with the    - 4 -     preceding
sentence (the "Pending Claim Amount"), the Escrow Agent shall (i) promptly
distribute to the Stockholders, in accordance with their
respective Percentage Interests, the Escrow Deposit, less the Pending Claim
Amount (the "Undisputed Escrow Deposit"), and (ii) retain in escrow the
Pending Claim Amount (the "Disputed Escrow Deposit"). For purposes of Section
1.5 hereof, the Disputed Escrow Deposit shall be allocated among the
InterCall Fund, the ITC Non-Operations Fund and the ITC Operations Fund in
accordance with the written agreement of Parent and the Stockholder
Representative in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement;
provided, that if Parent and the Stockholder Representative are unable to
agree on the allocation between these funds, the allocation shall be made in
accordance with the Notice of Reimbursement Obligation. Except for accrued
earnings that are being retained as part of the Disputed Escrow Deposit to
cover fees and expenses of the Stockholder Representative, all accrued
earnings from the investment of the Escrow Deposit less any amount previously
distributed as a Tax Distribution shall be distributed to the Stockholders on
the Distribution Date in accordance with their respective Percentage
Interests.   (b) Upon the final resolution as agreed by Parent and the
Stockholder Representative in writing of any Escrow Claim for which Disputed
Escrow Deposit amounts were retained in escrow after the Distribution Date,
or upon determination by an arbitration award or by any other final
adjudication, the Escrow Agent shall promptly (i) distribute to Parent an
amount of the Disputed Escrow Deposit equal to the Reimbursement Amount
corresponding to such Escrow Claim (if any); (ii) distribute to the
Stockholder Representative an amount equal to the actual fees and expenses
reasonably incurred by the Stockholder Representative in connection with such
Escrow Claim (if any); and (iii) deliver any remaining Disputed Escrow
Deposit to the Stockholders in accordance with their respective Percentage
Interests in such remaining Disputed Escrow Deposit.   (c) If there is a
Company Disposition Audit pending as of the Distribution Date, the Escrow
Agent shall retain in escrow the balance of the Escrow Deposit that is then
allocated to the ITC Non-Operations Fund, plus the estimated fees and
expenses of the Stockholder Representative to defend the Company
Disposition Audit, which amount shall be estimated by the Stockholder
Representative in good faith and shall be retained from the accrued earnings
on the investment of the Escrow Deposit and communicated to the Escrow Agent
in writing. Within 10 days following a Final Determination of the Company
Disposition Audit, the Escrow Agent shall promptly (i) distribute to Parent
the amount of the Escrow Deposit held pursuant to this Section 2.3(c) that is
owed to Parent, if any, in accordance with the terms of the Final
Determination; (ii) distribute to the Stockholder Representative an amount
equal to the actual fees and expenses reasonably incurred by the Stockholder
Representative in connection with the Company Disposition Audit; and (iii)
distribute to the Stockholders in accordance with their respective Percentage
Interests the remaining amount of the Escrow Deposit funds held pursuant to
this Section 2.3(c).   - 5 -     2.4 Effect of Final Delivery.   This
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until the Escrow Agent has
delivered all, but not less than all, of the Escrow Deposit pursuant to the
terms hereof. After all of such funds have been so delivered, all
rights, duties and obligations of the respective parties hereunder shall
terminate.   ARTICLE 3 THE ESCROW AGENT  3.1 Appointment.   Parent and
the Stockholder Representative hereby designate and appoint the Escrow Agent
as "Escrow Agent" under this Agreement and the Escrow Agent hereby accepts
such designation and appointment, subject to all of the provisions of this
Agreement.   (a) Each Interested Party acknowledges and agrees that the
Escrow Agent (i) shall not be responsible for any of the agreements referred
to or described herein (including the Merger Agreement), or for determining
or compelling compliance therewith, and shall not otherwise be bound thereby,
(ii) shall be obligated only for the performance of such duties as are
expressly and specifically set forth in this Escrow Agreement on its part to
be performed, each of which are ministerial (and shall not be construed to be
fiduciary) in nature, and no implied duties or obligations of any kind shall
be read into this Agreement against or on the part of the Escrow Agent, (iii)
shall not be obligated to take any legal or other action hereunder which
might in its judgment involve or cause it to incur any expense or liability
unless it shall have been furnished with acceptable indemnification, (iv) may
rely on and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any
written notice, instruction (including wire transfer instructions, whether
incorporated herein or provided in a separate written instruction),
instrument, statement, certificate, request or other document furnished to it
hereunder and believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or
presented by the proper person, and shall have no responsibility for
determining the accuracy thereof, and (v) may consult counsel satisfactory to
it, including in-house counsel, and the opinion or advice of such counsel in
any instance shall be full and complete authorization and protection in
respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good
faith and in accordance with the opinion or advice of such counsel. The
Escrow Agent may act in reliance upon any instructions signed on signature
believed by it to be genuine, and may assume that any person who gives any
written instructions, notice or receipt, or makes any statements
in connection with the provisions hereof, has been duly authorized to do so.
The Escrow Agent shall have no duty to make inquiry as to the genuineness,
accuracy or validity of any statements or instructions or any signatures on
statements or instructions.   (b) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable to
anyone for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it hereunder except in
the case of the Escrow Agent\'s gross negligence or willful misconduct. In no
event shall the Escrow Agent be liable for indirect, punitive, special or

-     lost profits) whatsoever, even if the Escrow Agent has been
informed of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form
of action.  3.2 Successor.   The Escrow Agent may at any time resign as
Escrow Agent hereunder by giving 30 days\' prior written notice of
resignation to Parent and the Stockholder Representative. Prior to the
effective date of the resignation as specified in such notice, the
Stockholder Representative will issue to the Escrow Agent a written
instruction authorizing redelivery of the Escrow Deposit to a bank or trust
company that it selects as successor to the Escrow Agent hereunder, subject
to the consent of the Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). If, however, the Stockholder
Representative shall fail to name such a successor escrow agent within 20
days after the notice of resignation from the Escrow Agent, Parent shall be
entitled to name such successor escrow agent. If no successor escrow agent is
named by Parent or the Stockholder Representative, the Escrow Agent may apply
to a court of competent jurisdiction for appointment of a successor escrow
agent.  3.3 Compensation, Expenses Reimbursement and Indemnification.  
(a) Each of the Interested Parties agrees (i) to reimburse the Escrow
Agent for 50% of its attorney\'s fees and expenses incurred in connection

fees and expenses incurred by the Escrow Agent in connection with the
resolution of any claim by any party hereunder.   (c) The Escrow Agent may
obtain reimbursement for its fees and expenses from the Escrow Deposit,
including, without limitation, reimbursement from any accrued earnings

such reimbursements.   (d) Any withdrawal made by the Escrow Agent from the
Escrow Deposit in accordance with this Section 3.3 and any subsequent
reimbursement thereof from Parent shall be allocated among the InterCall
Fund, the ITC Non-Operations Fund and the ITC Operations Fund based on the
percentage that each fund represents to the aggregate amount of the Escrow
Deposit at the time such withdrawal is made.   (e) Each of the Interested
Parties covenants and agrees to jointly and severally indemnify the Escrow
Agent (and its directors, officers and employees) and hold it (and such
directors, officers and employees) harmless from and against any loss,
liability, damage, cost and expense of any nature incurred by the Escrow
Agent arising out of or in   - 7 -     connection with this Agreement
or with the administration of its duties hereunder, including, but not
limited to, attorney\'s fees and other costs and expenses of defending or
preparing to defend against any claim of liability unless and except to the
extent such loss, liability, damage, cost and expense shall be caused by the
Escrow Agent\'s gross negligence, bad faith, or willful misconduct. The
foregoing indemnification and agreement to hold harmless shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and the resignation of the Escrow Agent.  3.4
Dispute Resolution.   It is understood and agreed that should any dispute
arise with respect to the delivery, ownership, right of possession, and/or
disposition of the Escrow Deposit, or should any claim be made upon the
Escrow Agent or the Escrow Deposit by a third party, the Escrow Agent upon
receipt of notice of such dispute or claim is authorized and shall be
entitled (at its sole option and election) to retain in its possession
without liability to anyone, all or any of said Escrow Deposit until such
dispute shall have been settled either by the mutual written agreement of the
parties involved or by a final order, decree or judgment of a court in the
United States of America, the time for perfection of an appeal of such order,
decree or judgment having expired. The Escrow Agent may, but shall be under
no duty whatsoever to, institute or defend any legal proceedings that relate
to the Escrow Deposit.   ARTICLE 4 STOCKHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE  4.1 Power
and Authority.   The Stockholder Representative represents and warrants to
Parent and the Escrow Agent that the Stockholder Representative has
irrevocable right, power and authority (i) to enter into and perform this
Agreement, (ii) to give and receive directions and notices hereunder; and
(iii) to make all determinations that may be required or that Stockholder
Representative deems appropriate under this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Stockholder Representative shall have full
power and authority, on behalf of all the Stockholders and their successors,
to interpret all the terms and provisions of this Agreement, to dispute or
fail to dispute any claim against the Escrow Deposit made by Parent, to

Fees and Expenses.   (a) In accordance with Sections 11.3(d) and 12.5 of the
Merger Agreement, the reasonable fees and expenses of the Stockholder
Representative shall first be paid from the interest earned on the Escrow
Deposit and to the extent that the amount of such fees and expenses exceeds
the amount of such accrued interest, such excess shall be deducted against
the balance of the ITC Operations Fund and/or the InterCall Fund, as Parent
may in its sole discretion determine and notify the Escrow Agent in writing,
but to the extent one such fund is depleted, such expenses shall be deducted
from the other fund.   (b) In order to obtain reimbursement for fees and
expenses from the Escrow Deposit, the Stockholder Representative shall submit
to Parent and Escrow Agent a written notice setting forth the amount of the
fees and expenses for which they are seeking reimbursement (the
"Reimbursement Request"). Any portion of a Reimbursement Request that does
not exceed the balance of the accrued earnings on the Escrow Deposit shall be
paid to the Stockholder Representative within five business days following
the receipt of the Reimbursement Request by the Escrow Agent. If any portion
of the Reimbursement Request exceeds the balance of the accrued earnings on
the Escrow Deposit (the "Deficiency Amount"), Escrow Agent shall notify
Parent and the Stockholder Representative of such deficiency as soon as
reasonably practicable following the receipt of such Reimbursement Request.
Within 10 days following the receipt of such notice, Parent shall provide to
the Stockholder Representative and the Escrow Agent its written agreement or
objection to the withdraw of the Deficiency Amount from the balance of the
Escrow Deposit. If Parent disagrees with the withdrawal of the
Deficiency Amount, the balance of the Deficiency Amount available for
distribution to the Stockholder Representative shall be determined by
arbitration or other final adjudication. If Parent agrees with the withdraw
of the Deficiency Amount from the Escrow Deposit, Parent shall deliver to the
Escrow Agent a written statement to such effect The Deficiency Amount to be
distributed to the Stockholder Representative, as determined by the mutual
agreement of Stockholder Representative and Parent or by arbitration or other
adjudication, shall be deducted from the ITC Operations Fund or the InterCall
Fund (or a combination thereof) in accordance with the written instructions
of Parent. If Parent does not provide such written instructions within ten
(10) business days following a request by Escrow Agent, the balance of the
Deficiency Amount shall be deducted from the ITC Operations Fund, but to the
extent the ITC Operations Fund is depleted, such expenses shall be deducted
from the InterCall Fund.   ARTICLE 5 MISCELLANEOUS  5.1 Definitions.

-      [Form of Restrictive Covenant Agreement]   Exhibit 7  
RESTRICTIVE COVENANT AGREEMENT   THIS RESTRICTIVE COVENANT AGREEMENT (this
"Covenant Agreement") is entered into on this ___ day of March, 2003, by and
among ______________________ ("Stockholder") and West Corporation ("Parent"),
a Delaware corporation.   WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and
delivery hereof, Parent, Dialing Acquisition Corp. ("Sub"), a Delaware
corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and ITC Holding
Company, Inc. ("Company"), a Delaware corporation, are entering into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger of even date herewith (the "Merger Agreement")
which provides for the merger (the "Merger") of Sub with and into Company in
accordance with its terms; and   WHEREAS, Stockholder is the beneficial
owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of shares of the
outstanding capital stock of Company; and   WHEREAS, in consideration of
the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement by Parent and Sub,
Stockholder agrees to, among other things, enter into this Covenant
Agreement.   NOW, THEREFORE, intending to be legally bound, the parties
hereto hereby agree as follows:   1. General. Stockholder acknowledges and
agrees that (1) the agreements and covenants contained in this Covenant
Agreement are reasonable and valid in geographical and temporal scope and in
all other respects, and essential to protect the value of Parent\'s business
and assets, and (2) Stockholder has obtained knowledge, contacts, know-how,
training and experience and there is a substantial probability that such
knowledge, know-how, contacts, training and experience could be used to the
substantial advantage of a competitor of Company or Parent and to Company\'s
or Parent\'s substantial detriment.   2. Covenant Not To Compete.   (a)
Stockholder covenants and agrees that, during the Restricted Period
(as defined below), Stockholder shall not, directly or indirectly,
individually or on behalf of or through any Person, or as a sole proprietor,
partner, stockholder, director, officer, principal, agent or executive of a
Person, or in any other capacity or relationship, engage in any business or
employment, anywhere within the United States of America, or any other
jurisdiction in which InterCall or any of the InterCall Operating
Subsidiaries conducts business or operations, that is materially competitive
with the audio, video and web conferencing business of InterCall and the
InterCall Operating Subsidiaries.    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
restrictions set forth in this Section 2(a) shall not apply to the Person set
forth on Schedule A hereto.   (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Covenant Agreement, Stockholder shall not be prohibited from
acquiring or holding: (i) less than five percent (5%) of the outstanding
securities of any entity that may compete directly or indirectly with the
audio, video and web conferencing business of InterCall or any of the
InterCall Operating Subsidiaries, or (ii) the outstanding securities of any
entity that may compete directly or indirectly with the audio, video and web
conferencing business of InterCall or any of the InterCall Operating
Subsidiaries provided that such entity does not generate more than 5% of its
gross revenue from its audio, video and web conferencing business. Those
entities whose securities are acquired or held by Stockholder pursuant to
clause (i) or (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence are referred to
herein as to the "Permitted Entities."   3. Non-Solicitation of Customers
and Suppliers. Stockholder covenants and agrees that, during the Restricted
Period, Stockholder shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent,
directly or indirectly, individually or on behalf of or through any Person
who is not a Permitted Entity, (i) solicit or divert or attempt to solicit or
divert, any Person, from doing business with InterCall or any of the
InterCall Operating Subsidiaries for purposes of providing audio, video and
web conferencing services to such Person or (ii) attempt to induce any such
Person to cease being a supplier of InterCall or any of the InterCall
Operating Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions set
forth in this Section 3 shall not apply to the Person set forth on Schedule A
hereto.   4. Non-Hire of Employees. Stockholder covenants and agrees that
during the Restricted Period, Stockholder shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent, directly or indirectly, either individually or on
behalf of or through any Person who is not a Permitted Entity, employ any of
the individuals set forth on Schedule B hereto.   5. Remedies for Breach.
Without intending to limit the remedies available to Parent, Stockholder
acknowledges that a breach of any of the covenants contained in this Covenant
Agreement may result in irreparable injury to Parent, or an Affiliate of
Parent, for which there is no adequate remedy at law, and that in such case
it will not be possible to measure damages for such injuries precisely and
that, in the event of such a breach or imminent threat thereof, Parent shall
be entitled to obtain a temporary restraining order and/or a preliminary or
permanent injunction, without the necessity of proving irreparable harm or
injury as a result of such breach or threatened breach, restraining
Stockholder from engaging in activities prohibited hereunder or such other
relief as may be required specifically to enforce such
covenants. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, the
Restricted Period with respect to Stockholder shall be tolled during any
period of violation, as determined by a court of law, of any of the covenants
set forth   - 2 -    herein; provided, however, that the Restricted
Period shall be tolled only as to the specific covenant so violated.   6.
Independence and Severability. Each of the rights enumerated in this Covenant
Agreement shall be independent of the others and shall be in addition to and
not in lieu of any other rights and remedies available to Parent at law or in
equity. If any of the covenants contained herein or any part of any of them
is hereafter construed or adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable,
the same shall not affect the remainder of the covenant or covenants or
rights or remedies, which shall be given full effect without regard to the
invalid portions. If any of the covenants contained herein are held to be
invalid or unenforceable because of the duration of such provisions or the
area or scope covered thereby, Stockholder agrees that the court making such
determination shall have the power to reduce the duration, scope and/or area
of such provision to a reasonable duration, scope and/or area and in its
reduced form said provision shall then be enforceable.   7. Restricted
Period. For purposes of this Covenant Agreement, the term "Restricted Period"
shall mean the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the thirty
(30) month anniversary of said Closing Date.   8. Binding Effect and
Assignment. This Covenant Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, provided that except as
otherwise specifically provided herein, neither this Covenant Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations of the parties hereto may be
assigned by any of the parties hereto without prior written consent of the
other parties hereto and except that Parent, without obtaining the consent of
any other party hereto, shall be entitled to assign this Covenant
Agreement or all or any of its rights or obligations hereunder to any one or
more Affiliates of Parent, but no assignment by Parent under this Section 87
shall relieve Parent of its obligations under this Covenant Agreement. Any
assignment in violation of the foregoing shall be void.   9. Amendments and
Modification. This Covenant Agreement may not be modified, amended, altered
or supplemented except upon the execution and delivery of a written agreement
executed by each of the parties hereto; provided that any provision of this
Covenant Agreement may be waived, or the time for its performance may be
extended, by the party or parties entitled to the benefit thereof by a
writing signed by each such party or an authorized
representative thereof.   10. Notices. All notices and other communications
pursuant to this Covenant Agreement shall be in writing and deemed to be
sufficient if contained in a written instrument and shall be deemed given if
delivered personally, telecopied, sent by nationally recognized overnight
courier or mailed by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested),
postage prepaid, to the parties at the following address (or at such other

its address provided in the Merger Agreement, with a copy to Parent\'s
counsel; and if to   - 3 -    Stockholder, to Stockholder\'s address
shown below Stockholder\'s signature on the signature page hereof.   11.
Choice of Law. The parties agree that this Covenant Agreement shall
be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of
Georgia, without giving effect to the choice of law provisions thereof.  
12. Effectiveness and Termination. This Covenant Agreement shall be effective
from and after the Effective Time. This Covenant Agreement shall terminate
automatically upon the termination of the Merger Agreement and, accordingly,
shall be rendered null and void.   13. Entire Agreement. This Covenant
Agreement, together with the documents expressly referred to herein, contain
the entire understanding of the parties in respect of the subject matter
hereof, and supersede all prior negotiations and understandings between the
parties with respect to such subject matter.   14. Effect of Headings. The
section headings are for convenience only and shall not affect the
construction or interpretation of this Covenant Agreement.   15. Defined
Terms. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Covenant Agreement
shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Merger Agreement.   16.
Counterparts. This Covenant Agreement may be executed in
several counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but which together
shall constitute one and the same agreement.   Agreed to on the date
indicated above.   WEST CORPORATION  -----------------------------
