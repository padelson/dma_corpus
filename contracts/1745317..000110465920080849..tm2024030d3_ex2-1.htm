Company Preferred Stock or shares of Acquiror Common Stock will be
appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock,
Company Preferred Stock and the holders of Acquiror Common Stock the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that

of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock, as applicable, shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, the Merger Consideration into which
such shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock, as

Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) the
number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock issuable as Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 3.01(a) in consideration for one share of
Company Common Stock, rounded to the nearest whole share of Acquiror Common
Stock (after such conversion, " _Rollover Restricted Stock_ ").

for all purposes. In the case of any such payment payable to employees of the
Company or its Affiliates in connection with the Merger treated as
compensation, the parties shall cooperate to pay such amounts through the
Company's or its Affiliate's payroll to facilitate applicable withholding.

  



  

Section 3.08 _Cash in Lieu of Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates or scrip
representing fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock shall be issued upon
the conversion of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.01(a), and such

holder of Company Common Stock who otherwise would be entitled to receive
such fractional share an amount in cash, without interest, rounded down to the

interest in a share of Acquiror Common Stock to which such holder otherwise
would have been entitled but for this Section 3.08) multiplied by (ii) an
amount equal to the VWAP of shares of Acquiror Common Stock for the 20
Trading Days prior to the date that is three Business Days prior to the

respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL or (b) dissenters' rights pursuant to
the provisions of Chapter 13 of the California General Corporate Law (the "
_CGCL_ ") by reason of Section 2115 of the CGCL (such shares, " _Dissenting

in a trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the " _Trust Account_ "),
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company, a New York
corporation, acting as trustee (the  " _Trustee_ "), pursuant to the
Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated October 15, 2018, by and between
Acquiror and the Trustee (the " _Trust Agreement_ "). The Trust Agreement is
in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Acquiror and, to the knowledge of Acquiror, the Trustee, enforceable in
accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws affecting
creditors' rights generally and subject, as to enforceability, to general
principles of equity. The Trust Agreement has not been
terminated, repudiated, rescinded, amended or supplemented or modified, in
any respect, and, to the knowledge of Acquiror, no such
termination, repudiation, rescission, amendment, supplement or modification
is contemplated. There are no side letters and there are no
agreements, Contracts, arrangements or understandings, whether written or
oral, with the Trustee or any other Person that would (i) cause
the description of the Trust Agreement in the Acquiror SEC Reports to be
inaccurate or (ii) entitle any Person (other than any Acquiror Stockholder
who is a Redeeming Stockholder) to any portion of the proceeds in the Trust
Account. Prior to the Closing, none of the funds held in the Trust Account
may be released except in accordance with the Trust Agreement, Acquiror
Organizational Documents and Acquiror's final prospectus dated October 16,
2018. Amounts in the Trust Account are invested in United States
Government securities or in money market funds meeting certain conditions
under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
Acquiror has performed all material obligations required to be performed by it
to date under, and is not in material default, breach or delinquent in
performance or any other respect (claimed or actual) in connection with, the
Trust Agreement, and no event has occurred which, with due notice or lapse of
time or both, would constitute such a default or breach thereunder. There are
no Actions pending or, to the knowledge of Acquiror, threatened with respect
to the Trust Account. Since October 18, 2018, Acquiror has not released any
money from the Trust Account (other than interest income earned on the
principal held in the Trust Account as permitted by the Trust Agreement). As
of the Effective Time, the obligations of Acquiror to dissolve or liquidate
pursuant to the Acquiror Organizational Documents shall terminate, and, as of
the Effective Time, Acquiror shall have no obligation whatsoever pursuant to
the Acquiror Organizational Documents to dissolve and liquidate the assets of
Acquiror by reason of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby. Following the Effective Time, no Acquiror Stockholder shall be
entitled to receive any amount from the Trust Account except to the extent
such Acquiror Stockholder is a Redeeming Stockholder.

(b)  As of the date hereof, assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company herein and the compliance by

Account will not be satisfied or funds available in the Trust Account will not
be available to Acquiror on the Closing Date.

administrative or judicial proceeding with a taxing authority with respect to

a proposed deficiency of a material amount of Taxes, other than any such

any Governmental Authority in a jurisdiction where Acquiror does not file a
Tax Return that such entity is or may be subject to Taxes by that
jurisdiction in respect of Taxes that would be the subject of such Tax
Return, which claim has not been resolved. There are no outstanding
agreements extending or waiving the statutory period of limitations

assessment or reassessment of, material Taxes of Acquiror, and no written
request for any such waiver or extension is currently pending.

corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a distribution of stock

result of any: (A) change in method of accounting for a taxable period (or
portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date and made prior to the
Closing; (B) ruling by, or written agreement with, a Governmental Authority
(including any closing agreement pursuant to Section 7121 of the Code or any

(D) prepaid amount received prior to the Closing; (E) intercompany transaction

or (F) Section 965 of the Code.

  



  

(h)  There are no Liens with respect to Taxes on any of the assets
of the Acquiror, other than Permitted Liens.

  



  

   

40

 



    



   



  

(i)  Acquiror does not have any liability for the Taxes of any
Person (other than the Company or its Subsidiaries) (i) under Treasury

(j)  Acquiror is not party to, or bound by, or have any

(l)  Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Acquiror nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (either alone or in combination with another event) will (i) entitle
any employee, director, officer or independent contractor of Acquiror or any
of its Subsidiaries to severance pay or any material increase in severance
pay, (ii) result in the payment of any amount to any employee, director,
officer or independent contractor of Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries
that could, individually or in combination with any other such payment,
constitute an "excess parachute payment" as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of
the Code, or (iii) require a "gross-up," indemnification for, or payment to
any employee, director, officer or independent contractor of Acquiror or any
of its Subsidiaries for any taxes imposed under Section 409A or Section 4999
of the Code or any other tax.

  



  

(m)  Other than the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 5.10, this Section 5.08 contains the exclusive representations and
warranties of Acquiror with respect to Tax matters. Nothing in this Section
5.08 shall be construed as providing a representation or warranty with

other documents required to be filed by it with the SEC since October 18,
2018 (collectively, as they have been amended since the time of their filing

the Acquiror SEC Reports, as of their respective dates (or if amended or
superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement or the Closing
Date, then on the date of such filing), contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The audited

each case, the notes and schedules thereto) included in the Acquiror SEC
Reports complied as to form in all material respects with the published rules
and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, were prepared in accordance
with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except

unaudited statements as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC), and fairly
present (subject, in the case of the unaudited interim financial statements

flows for the respective periods then ended.

disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material
information relating to Acquiror and other material information required to

Acquiror's principal executive officer and its principal financial officer as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in
timely alerting Acquiror's principal executive officer and principal
financial officer to material information required to be included
in Acquiror's periodic reports required under the Exchange Act.

  



  

(c)  Acquiror has established and maintained a system of
internal controls. Such internal controls are sufficient to

financial reporting and the preparation of Acquiror's financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.

  



  

(d)  There are no outstanding loans or other extensions of
credit made by Acquiror to any executive officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7

Acquiror's independent auditors has identified or been made aware of (i) any
significant deficiency or material weakness in the system of internal
accounting controls utilized by Acquiror, (ii) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves Acquiror's management or other employees who have a
role in the preparation of financial statements or the internal accounting
controls utilized by Acquiror or (iii) any claim or allegation regarding
any of the foregoing.

Section 5.20 _Subscription Agreements_. The Acquiror has

Subscription Agreement executed on or prior to the date hereof, pursuant to
which certain Investors have committed, subject to the terms and conditions
therein, to purchase 150,000,000 shares of Acquiror Common Stock. To the
knowledge of Acquiror, each Subscription Agreement is in full force and
effect and is legal, valid and binding upon the Acquiror and the applicable
Investor, enforceable in accordance with its terms. Each
Subscription Agreement has not been withdrawn, terminated, amended or
modified since the date of delivery hereunder and prior to the execution of
this Agreement, and, to the knowledge of Acquiror, as of the date of this
Agreement no such withdrawal, termination, amendment or modification is
contemplated, and as of the date of this Agreement the commitments contained
in each Subscription Agreement have not been withdrawn, terminated or
rescinded by the applicable Investor in any respect. As of the date hereof,
there are no side letters or Contracts to which Acquiror or Merger Sub is a
party related to the provision or funding, as applicable, of the purchases
contemplated by each Subscription Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby other than as expressly set forth in this Agreement, each Subscription
Agreement or any other agreement entered into (or to be entered into) in
connection with the Transactions delivered to the Company. Acquiror has fully
paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required in connection with
each Subscription Agreement that are payable on or prior to the date hereof
and will pay any and all such fees when and as the same become due and
payable after the date hereof pursuant to each Subscription Agreement.
Acquiror has, and to the knowledge of Acquiror, each Investor has, complied
with all of its obligations under each Subscription Agreement. There are no
conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the consummation of
the purchases set forth in each Subscription Agreement, other than as
expressly set forth in each Subscription Agreement. No event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would
reasonably be expected to (i) constitute a default or breach on the part of
Acquiror or, to the knowledge of Acquiror as of the date hereof, any
Investor, (ii) assuming the conditions set forth in Section 9.01 and Section
9.02 will be satisfied, constitute a failure to satisfy a condition on the
part of Acquiror or, to the knowledge of Acquiror as of the date hereof,
the applicable Investor or (iii) assuming the conditions set forth in Section
9.01 and Section 9.02 will be satisfied, to the knowledge of Acquiror as of
the date hereof, result in any portion of the amounts to be paid by each
Investor in accordance with each Subscription Agreement being unavailable on
the Closing Date. As of the date hereof, assuming the conditions set forth in
Section 9.01 and Section 9.02 will be satisfied, Acquiror has no reason to
believe that any of the conditions to the consummation of the purchases
under each Subscription Agreement will not be satisfied, and, as of the date
hereof, Acquiror is not aware of the existence of any fact or event that
would or would reasonably be expected to cause such conditions not to be
satisfied.

49

 



    



  

Section 6.03 _HSR Act and Regulatory Approvals_. 

  



  

(a)  In connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Company shall comply promptly but in no event later than
fifteen (15) Business Days after the date hereof with the notification and
reporting requirements of the HSR Act. The Company shall furnish to the
Acquiror as promptly as reasonably practicable all information required for
any application or other filing to be made by the Acquiror pursuant to any
Antitrust Law. The Company shall (i) substantially comply with any Information
or Document Requests and (ii) request early termination of any waiting period
under the HSR Act. The Company shall promptly notify the Acquiror of any
substantive communication with, and furnish to Acquiror copies of any notices
or written communications received by, the Company or any of its Affiliates
and any third party or any Governmental Authority with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the Company shall permit
counsel to Acquiror an opportunity to review in advance, and the Company
shall consider in good faith the views of such counsel in connection with,
any proposed written communications by the Company and/or its Affiliates to
any Governmental Authority concerning the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, that the Company shall not extend any waiting period or
comparable period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with any
Governmental Authority without the written consent of Acquiror. The Company
agrees to provide, to the extent permitted by the applicable
Governmental Authority, Acquiror and its counsel the opportunity, on
reasonable advance notice, to participate in any substantive meetings
or discussions, either in person or by telephone, between the Company and/or
any of its Affiliates, agents or advisors, on the one hand, and any
Governmental Authority, on the other hand, concerning or in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby. Any materials exchanged in connection
with this Section 6.03 may be redacted or withheld as necessary to address
reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns, and to remove references
concerning the valuation of the Company or other competitively
sensitive material; provided, that the Company may, as it deems advisable and
necessary, designate any materials provided to the Acquiror under this
Section 6.03 as "outside counsel only." Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Section 6.03 or any other
provision of this Agreement shall require or obligate the Company or any of
its Affiliates (including the Investors and any investment funds or
investment vehicles affiliated with, or managed or advised by, the Investors
or any portfolio company (as such term is commonly understood in the private
equity industry) or investment of the Investors or of any such
investment fund or investment vehicle) to, and the Acquiror shall not,
without the prior written consent of the Company, agree or otherwise be
required to, take any action with respect to the Company, or any of its
Subsidiaries or such Affiliates, including selling, divesting, or otherwise
disposing of, licensing, holding separate, or taking or committing to take any
action that limits in any respect its freedom of action with respect to, or
its ability to retain, any business, products, rights, services, licenses,
assets or properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or such
Affiliates, or any interest therein. The Company shall pay 50% of all filing
fees payable to the Regulatory Consent Authorities in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

   

50

 



    



  

(b) The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
not to, acquire or agree to acquire, by merging with or into or
consolidating with, or by purchasing a portion of the assets of or equity in,
or by any other manner, any business or any corporation,
partnership, association or other business organization or division thereof,
or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets, or take any other
action, if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to, or the
consummation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation, or the taking of
any other action, would reasonably be expected to (i) impose any delay in the
obtaining of, or increase the risk of not obtaining, any authorizations,
consents, orders or declarations of any Regulatory Consent Authorities or the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period; (ii) increase the
risk of any Governmental Authority entering an order prohibiting the
consummation of the transaction contemplated hereby; (iii) increase the risk
of not being able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise; or (iv)
delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

Section 6.04 _No Acquiror Common Stock Transactions_. From and
after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, except as otherwise
contemplated by this Agreement, none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or its stockholders shall engage in any transactions involving
the securities of Acquiror without the prior written consent of Acquiror. The
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to require each of its
Subsidiaries and stockholders to comply with the foregoing sentence.

  



  

Section 6.05 _No Claim Against the Trust Account_. The Company
acknowledges that the Acquiror is a blank check company with the power and
privileges to effect a merger, asset acquisition, reorganization or similar
business combination involving the Company and one or more businesses or
assets, and the Company has read Acquiror's final prospectus, dated October
16, 2018 and other Acquiror SEC Reports, the Acquiror Organizational
Documents, and the Trust Agreement and understands that Acquiror has
established the Trust Account described therein for the benefit of
Acquiror's public stockholders and that disbursements from the Trust Account
are available only in the limited circumstances set forth therein. The
Company further acknowledges and agrees that the Acquiror's sole assets
consist of the cash proceeds of the Acquiror's initial public offering and
private placements of its securities, and that substantially all of these
proceeds have been deposited in the Trust Account for the benefit of its
public shareholders. The Company further acknowledges that, if the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated by July 31,
2020 or such later date as approved by the shareholders of Acquiror to
complete a Business Combination, Acquiror will be obligated to return to its
stockholders the amounts being held in the Trust Account. Accordingly, the
Company (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) hereby waives any past,
present or future claim of any kind against, and any right to access, the
Trust Account, any trustee of the Trust Account and Acquiror to collect from
the Trust Account any monies that may be owed to them by Acquiror or any of
its Affiliates for any reason whatsoever, and will not seek recourse against
the Trust Account at any time for any reason whatsoever, including, without
limitation, for any Willful Breach of this Agreement. This Section 6.05 shall
survive the termination of this Agreement for any reason.

  



  

Section 6.06 _Proxy Solicitation; Other Actions_. 

  



  

(a)  The Company agrees to use reasonable best efforts to
provide Acquiror, no later than twenty (20) Business Days after the date of
this Agreement, financial statements, including unaudited quarterly financial
statements for the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2020, in each case, as
required and prepared in accordance with GAAP and Regulation S-X. The Company
shall be available to, and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall use
reasonable best efforts to make their officers and employees available to,
in each case, during normal business hours and upon reasonable advanced
notice, Acquiror and its counsel in connection with (i) the drafting of the
Proxy Statement and (ii) responding in a timely manner to comments on the
Proxy Statement from the SEC. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company shall reasonably cooperate with Acquiror in connection
with Acquiror's preparation for inclusion in the Proxy Statement of pro forma
and other financial statements, as required by Regulation S-X under the rules
and regulations of the SEC (as interpreted by the staff of the SEC).

  



  

   

51

 



    



  

(b)  The Company will give Acquiror prompt written notice of
any action taken or not taken by the Company or its Subsidiaries or of any
development regarding the Company or its Subsidiaries, in any such case which
is known by the Company, that would cause the Proxy Statement to contain an
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
in order to make the statements, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading; provided, that, if any such action shall be
taken or fail to be taken or such development shall otherwise occur, Acquiror
and the Company shall cooperate fully to cause an amendment or supplement to
be made promptly to the Proxy Statement, such that the Proxy Statement no
longer contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, further,
however, that no information received by Acquiror pursuant to this Section
6.06 shall operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any representation,
warranty or agreement given or made by the party who disclosed such
information, and no such information shall be deemed to change, supplement or
amend the Schedules.

  



  

Section 6.07 _Non-Solicitation; Acquisition Proposals_. 

  



  

(a)  Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.07, from
the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the valid
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 10.01, the Company
shall not, shall cause its Subsidiaries not to and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives not to,
directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or
knowingly facilitate any inquiries or requests for information with respect
to, or the making of, any inquiry regarding, or any proposal or offer that
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to result in or lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any
negotiations or discussions concerning, or provide access to its properties,
books and records or any confidential information or data to, any Person
relating to any proposal, offer, inquiry or request for information that
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to result in or lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve, endorse or recommend, or propose
publicly to approve, endorse or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, (iv)
execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, confidentiality agreement (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement executed in accordance with Section 6.07(b)(ii)),
merger agreement, acquisition agreement, exchange agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement
for or relating to any Acquisition Proposal or (v) resolve or agree to do any
of the foregoing; provided that it is understood and agreed that any
determination or action by the Company Board made in accordance with Section
6.07(b) or Section 6.07(c) shall not be deemed to be a breach or violation of
this Section 6.07(a). The Company also agrees that immediately following the
execution of this Agreement it shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their
Representatives to, cease any solicitations, discussions or negotiations with
any Person (other than the Parties and their respective Representatives)
conducted heretofore in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry
or request for information that could reasonably be expected to lead to, or
result in, an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly (and in any
event within one Business Day) notify, in writing, Acquiror of the receipt of
any inquiry, proposal, offer or request for information received after the
date hereof that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to result in or
lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall include a summary of
the material terms of, and the identity of the Person or group of Persons
making, such inquiry, proposal, offer or request for information (provided,
that, solely with respect to the identity of the Person or group of Persons
making, such inquiry, proposal, offer or request for information, such
disclosure is not restricted by confidentiality obligations in existence as
of the date of this Agreement) and an unredacted copy of any Acquisition
Proposal or inquiry, proposal or offer made in writing or, if not in writing,
a written description of the material terms and conditions of such inquiry,
proposal or offer (and shall include any other documents evidencing or
specifying the terms of such proposal, offer, inquiry or request). The
Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) keep
Acquiror reasonably informed of any material developments with respect to any
such inquiry, proposal, offer, request for information or Acquisition Proposal
(including any material changes thereto and copies of any additional written
materials received by the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
Company may grant a waiver, amendment or release under any confidentiality or
standstill agreement to the extent necessary to allow for a confidential bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal (which Acquisition Proposal was made after
the date of this Agreement and did not result from a breach of this Section
6.07) to be made to the Company or the Company Board so long as the Company
promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours thereafter) notifies
Acquiror thereof (including the identity of such counterparty) after granting
any such waiver, amendment or release and the Company Board determines prior
to the grant of such waiver, amendment or release in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel to the Company, that the failure of
the Company Board to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood
that any violation of the restrictions contained in this Section 6.07 by any
of the Company's Subsidiaries, or any of the Company's or its Subsidiaries'
respective Representatives acting on the Company's or one of its
Subsidiaries' behalf, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.07
by the Company.

(b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section

the Company Board from:

  



  

(i)  taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any
similar communication to stockholders required by applicable Law in connection
with the making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer) or from
making any legally required disclosure to stockholders with regard to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or an Acquisition Proposal;
provided that this clause (i) shall not be deemed to permit the Company or the
Company Board to effect a Company Change in Recommendation except in
accordance with Sections 6.07(c) and 6.07(d);

  



  

(ii)  prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Approval, (A)
contacting and engaging in any negotiations or discussions with any Person
and its Representatives who has made a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
after the date hereof that did not result from a breach of Section 6.07(a)
and (B) providing access to the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries'
properties, books and records and providing information or data in response
to a request therefor by a Person who has made a bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of Section
6.07(a), in each case of clause "(A)" or "(B)", if the Company Board (I)
shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisor(s), that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes
or would reasonably be expected to constitute, result in or lead to a Superior
Proposal, (II) shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (III) has received from
the Person so requesting such information an executed Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement; provided that the Company shall provide to Acquiror
and Merger Sub any information or data that is provided to any Person given
such access that was not previously made available to Acquiror or Merger Sub
prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such
Person (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours thereof);

  



  

(iii)  prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Approval, making
a Company Change in Recommendation (only to the extent permitted by Section
6.07(c) or Section 6.07(d)); or

  



  

(iv)  resolving, authorizing, committing or agreeing to take any
of the foregoing actions, only to the extent such actions would be permitted
by the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii).

  



  

   

53

 



    



  

(c)  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.07 to the
contrary, if, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Approval,
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisor(s) and outside legal counsel, in response to a bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section
6.07, that (i) such proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (ii) the
failure to take the actions specified in clause (A) or (B) of this Section
6.07(c) would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law,
the Company or the Company Board may, prior to obtaining the Company
Requisite Approval, (A) make a Company Change in Recommendation or (B)
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(e) to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; provided that the
Company pays to Acquiror the Company Termination Payment required to be paid
pursuant to Section 10.02(b) at or prior to the time of such termination
(it being agreed that such termination shall not be effective unless such fee
is so paid); provided further that the Company will not be entitled to make a
Company Change in Recommendation or terminate this Agreement in accordance
with Section 10.01(e) unless (x) the Company delivers to Acquiror a written
notice (a " _Company Notice_ ") advising Acquiror that the Company
Board proposes to take such action and containing the material terms and
conditions of the Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action
of the Company Board, and (y) at or after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on
the fifth (5th) Business Day immediately following the day on which the
Company delivered the Company Notice (such period from the time the Company
Notice is provided until 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the fifth (5th)
Business Day immediately following the day on which the Company delivered the
Company Notice (it being understood that any material revision, amendment,
update or supplement to the terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal
shall be deemed to constitute a new Superior Proposal and shall require a new
notice with an additional five (5) Business Day period from the date of such
notice), the " _Notice Period_ "), the Company Board reaffirms in good faith
(1) after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisor(s) that such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior
Proposal if the adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
proposed by Acquiror (if any) were to be given effect and (2) after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to make a
Company Change in Recommendation or so terminate would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. If requested by Acquiror, the
Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, and will use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its or their Representatives to, during the Notice
Period, engage in good faith negotiations with Acquiror and its
Representatives to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a
Superior Proposal.

  



  

(d)  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.07 or Section
8.02(e) to the contrary, if, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Requisite Approval, the Company Board determines in good faith, in response to
an Intervening Event, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that
the failure to make a Company Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company or the Company
Board may, prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Approval, make a
Company Change in Recommendation; provided that the Company will not be
entitled to make, or agree or resolve to make, a Company Change in
Recommendation unless (i) the Company delivers to Acquiror a written notice
(an " _Intervening Event Notice_ ") advising Acquiror that the Company Board
proposes to take such action and containing the material facts underlying the
Company Board's determination that an Intervening Event has occurred, and
(ii) at or after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the fifth (5th) Business
Day immediately following the day on which the Company delivered the
Intervening Event Notice (such period from the time the Intervening Event
Notice is provided until 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the fifth (5th)
Business Day immediately following the day on which the Company delivered the
Intervening Event Notice (it being understood that any material
development with respect to an Intervening Event shall require a new notice
with an additional five (5) Business Day period from the date of such
notice), the " _Intervening Event Notice Period_ "), the Company Board
reaffirms in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel)
that the failure to make a Company Change in Recommendation would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. If requested by
Acquiror, the Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, and will use
its reasonable best efforts to cause its or their Representatives to, during
the Intervening Event Notice Period, engage in good faith negotiations with
Acquiror and its Representatives to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so as to obviate the need for a Company Change
in Recommendation.

net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, (B) any direct or indirect acquisition of 20% or more of the

of the Company owning such assets, (C) acquisition of beneficial ownership,
or the right to acquire beneficial ownership, of 20% or more of the total
voting power of the equity securities of the Company, any tender offer or
exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person beneficially
owning 20% or more of the total voting power of the equity securities of the
Company, or any merger, reorganization, consolidation, share exchange,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving the Company (or any Subsidiary of the Company whose

sale or other disposition (including by way of merger, reorganization,
division, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization or other similar transaction) of 20% or more of the total
voting power of the equity securities of the Company.

  



  

(ii)  " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide and written
Acquisition Proposal made after the date hereof, that did not result from a
breach of this Section 6.07, that the Company Board in good faith determines
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor(s))
is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms and
would, if consummated, result in a transaction that is more favorable from a
financial point of view to the stockholders of the Company (solely in their
capacity as such) than the transactions contemplated hereby after taking into
account all such factors and matters deemed relevant in good faith by the
Company Board, including legal, financial (including the financing terms of
any such proposal), regulatory, timing or other aspects of such proposal and
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including any offer
by Acquiror to amend the terms of this Agreement, termination or break-up fee
and conditions to consummation); provided that for purposes of the definition
of "Superior Proposal," the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall have the
meaning assigned to such term herein, except that the references to "20%" in
such definition shall be deemed to be references to "80%".

circumstance or occurrence (but specifically excluding any Acquisition
Proposal or Superior Proposal) that materially affects the business, assets,
operations or prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, and that was not known and was not reasonably foreseeable to the
Company or the Company Board as of the date hereof, and that occurs after the
date of this Agreement; provided, that, the fact that the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries exceeds projections, forecasts or budgets, in and of itself,
including without limitation any payments or expected payments from
litigation or sale of real property, shall not be taken into account in
determining whether an "Intervening Event" has occurred.

Company shall, at least five (5) days prior to the Closing, take commercially
reasonable actions to (a) solicit waivers of any excess parachute payment (as

solicit the approval of the Company's shareholders in a manner intended to
comply with Sections 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) and 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code of all

parachute payments." To the extent required to comply with the provisions of
the preceding sentence, the Company shall deliver, among other items, to its
equity holders entitled to vote in the shareholder approval process under Code
Section 280G(b)(5)(B), a disclosure statement intended to satisfy the

Acquiror, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

(a)  The shares of Acquiror Common Stock to be issued pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement have not been registered under the Securities
Act, and have been acquired for investment and not with a view to, or in
connection with, the sale of distribution thereof. No transfer of such shares
may be effected without an effective registration statement related thereto or
an exemption from registration under the Securities Act. The Company shall

for a period of 6 months following the Closing, all in a form reasonably
acceptable to Acquiror.

56

 



    



  

(c) Acquiror shall cooperate in good faith with the Regulatory
Consent Authorities and exercise its reasonable best efforts to undertake
promptly any and all action required to complete lawfully the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable (but in any event prior
to the Termination Date) and any and all action necessary or advisable to
avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove any impediment under Antitrust Law or the
actual or threatened commencement of any proceeding in any forum by or on
behalf of any Regulatory Consent Authority or the issuance of any
Governmental Order that would delay, enjoin, prevent, restrain or
otherwise prohibit the consummation of the Merger. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Section 7.01 or any other
provision of this Agreement shall require or obligate Acquiror's Affiliates,
the Sponsors, the Investors, their respective Affiliates and any investment
funds or investment vehicles affiliated with, or managed or advised by,
Acquiror's Affiliates, the Sponsors, the Investors or any portfolio company

or (B) avoiding, preventing, eliminating or removing any impediment under
Antitrust Law with respect to the Transactions, including selling, divesting,
or otherwise disposing of, licensing, holding separate, or taking or

Affiliates and any third party or Governmental Authority with respect to the

advance notice, to participate in any substantive meetings or discussions,
either in person or by telephone, between Acquiror and/or any of its
Affiliates, agents or advisors, on the one hand, and any Governmental
Authority, on the other hand, concerning or in connection with the

consolidating with, or by purchasing a portion of the assets of or equity in,
or by any other manner, any business or any corporation,
partnership, association or other business organization or division thereof,
or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets, or take any other
action, if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to, or the
consummation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation, or the taking of
any other action, would reasonably be expected to (i) impose any delay in the
obtaining of, or increase the risk of not obtaining, any authorizations,
consents, orders or declarations of any Regulatory Consent Authorities or the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period; (ii) increase the
risk of any Governmental Authority entering an order prohibiting the
consummation of the transaction contemplated hereby; (iii) increase the risk

Section 7.02 _Indemnification and Insurance_. 

  



  

(a)  From and after the Effective Time, Acquiror agrees to
cause the Surviving Company to indemnify and hold harmless each present and
former director and officer of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at
or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company or its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, would have been permitted under applicable
Law and its certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational
documents in effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify such Person
(including the advancing of expenses as incurred to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law). Without limiting the foregoing, Acquiror
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to, (i)
maintain for a period of not less than six years from the Effective Time
provisions in its certificate of incorporation (if applicable), bylaws and
other organizational documents concerning the indemnification and exoneration
(including provisions relating to expense advancement) of officers and
directors that are no less favorable to those Persons than the provisions of
such certificates of incorporation (if applicable), bylaws and other
organizational documents as of the date of this Agreement and (ii) not amend,
repeal or otherwise modify such provisions in any respect that would
adversely affect the rights of those Persons thereunder, in each case, except
as required by Law. Acquiror shall assume, and be liable for, and shall cause
the Surviving Company and their respective Subsidiaries to honor, each of the
covenants in this Section 7.02.

  



  

(b)  For a period of six years from the Effective Time,
Acquiror shall, or shall cause one or more of its Subsidiaries to,
maintain in effect directors' and officers' liability insurance covering
those Persons who are currently covered by the Company's or its Subsidiaries'
directors' and officers' liability insurance policies (true, correct and
complete copies of which have been heretofore made available to Acquiror or
its agents or representatives) on terms not less favorable than the terms of
such current insurance coverage, except that in no event shall Acquiror or its
Subsidiaries be required to pay an annual premium for such insurance in
excess of 300% of the aggregate annual premium payable by the Company and its
Subsidiaries for such insurance policy for the year ended December 31, 2018;
provided, however, that (i) Acquiror may cause coverage to be extended
under the current directors' and officers' liability insurance by obtaining a
six-year "tail" policy containing terms not materially less favorable than
the terms of such current insurance coverage with respect to claims existing
or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and (ii) if any claim is
asserted or made within such six-year period, any insurance required to be
maintained under this Section 7.02 shall be continued in respect of such claim
until the final disposition thereof.

  



  

   

58

 



    



  

(c)  Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to
the contrary, this Section 7.02 shall survive the consummation of the Merger
indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on Acquiror and the
Surviving Company and all successors and assigns of Acquiror and the
Surviving Company. In the event that Acquiror, the Surviving Company or any of
their respective successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, Acquiror and the Surviving Company shall ensure that proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Acquiror or the
Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set
forth in this Section 7.02. The obligations of Acquiror and the Surviving
Company under this Section 7.02 shall not be terminated or modified in such a
manner as to materially and adversely affect any present and former director
and officer of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries to whom this Section
7.02 applies without the consent of the affected Person.

(a)  During the Interim Period, except as set forth on Schedule
7.03 or as expressly contemplated by this Agreement (including, for the
avoidance for doubt, the execution and delivery of the Subscription Agreements

to by the Company in writing (which consent shall not be unreasonably
conditioned, withheld or delayed), Acquiror shall not and each shall not

thereto. If Acquiror or the Company becomes aware that any information

material respect or that the Proxy Statement is required to be amended in
order to comply with applicable Law, then (i) such party shall promptly
inform the other parties and (ii) Acquiror, on the one hand, and the Company,
on the other hand, shall cooperate and mutually agree upon (such agreement not
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) an amendment or supplement to the

approval of the Acquiror AandR Charter (the " _Amendment Proposal_ "), (ii)
approval of the issuance of Acquiror Common Stock as contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Issuance Proposal_ "), (iii) approval of the issuance of

outstanding shares of Acquiror Common Stock as of Closing, and (y) the
aggregate number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock underlying the Specified

to, as promptly as practicable, (i) establish the record date for, duly call,

withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to change,
withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify, the Acquiror Board Recommendation (an
" _Acquiror Change in Recommendation_ "); provided, that the Acquiror Board
may make a Acquiror Change in Recommendation if it determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that a failure to make an
Acquiror Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Section 8.02(d), if on a date for which the Special Meeting is scheduled,
Acquiror has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares
of Acquiror Common Stock to obtain the Acquiror Stockholder Approval, whether
or not a quorum is present, Acquiror shall have the right to make one or more
successive postponements or adjournments of the Special Meeting.

withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify, the Company Board Recommendation or
(ii) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to approve,
recommend or declare advisable, any Acquisition Proposal (any action
described in clause (i) or (ii), a " _Company Change in Recommendation_ ")
except in accordance with Sections 6.07(c) and 6.07(d). The Company will
provide Acquiror with copies of all stockholder consents it receives within
one (1) Business Day of receipt. If the Company Requisite Approval is
obtained, then promptly following the receipt of the required written
consents, the Company will prepare and deliver to its stockholders who have
not consented the notice required by Section 228(e) of the DGCL. Unless
this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the
Company's obligation to solicit written consents from the Company
Shareholders to give the Company Requisite Approval in accordance with this
Section 8.02(e) shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the making,
commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission of any Acquisition
Proposal or Superior Proposal, or by any Company Change of Recommendation.
The Company shall use its best efforts to deliver the Company Requisite
Approval by July 23, 2020.

applicable Law, Acquiror will join in the execution of any such Tax Returns.

  



  

(b)  Tax Treatment. Acquiror, Merger Sub and the Company intend
that the Transactions shall qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment. None of

any action that would reasonably be expected to prevent qualification for such
Intended Tax Treatment. Each party shall, unless otherwise required by a
final determination within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or
any similar state, local or non-U.S. final determination) or a change in
applicable Law, or based on a change in the facts and
circumstances underlying the Transactions from the terms described in this
Agreement, cause all Tax Returns to be filed on a basis of treating the
Merger as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code
and the Transactions as a transaction that qualifies under Section 351 of the
Code. Each of the parties agrees to use reasonable best efforts to promptly
notify all other parties of any challenge to the Intended Tax Treatment by
any Governmental Authority. Acquiror and the Company shall execute and
deliver officer's certificates containing customary representations at such
time or times as may be reasonably requested by counsel to the Company in
connection with the delivery of any opinion by such counsel to the Company
with respect to the tax treatment of the Transactions.

(b)  Prior to the Effective Time, none of Acquiror, the Company
or any of their respective Affiliates shall make any public announcement or
issue any public communication regarding this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, or any matter related to the foregoing, without first

(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
except if such announcement or other communication is required by
applicable Law or legal process (including pursuant to the Securities Law or
the rules of any national securities exchange), in which case Acquiror or the
Company, as applicable, shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
coordinate such announcement or communication with the other party, prior to
announcement or issuance and allow the other party a reasonable opportunity to
comment thereon (which shall be considered by Acquiror or the Company, as
applicable, in good faith); provided, however, that, notwithstanding
anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, each party and its
Affiliates may make announcements and may provide information regarding this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to their respective owners,
their Affiliates, and its and their respective directors, officers,
employees, managers, advisors, direct and indirect investors and prospective
investors without the consent of any other party hereto; and provided,
further, that subject to Section 6.02 and this Section 8.04, the foregoing
shall not prohibit any party hereto from communicating with third parties to
the extent necessary for the purpose of seeking any third party consent.

  



  

Section 8.05 _Post-Closing Cooperation; Further Assurances_. 

  



  

(a)  Following the Closing, each party shall, on the request of
any other party, execute such further documents, and perform such further
acts, as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to give full effect to the
allocation of rights, benefits, obligations and liabilities contemplated by
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

(b)  Following the Closing, Acquiror and the Surviving Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the funds held by

Transactions) (including funds resulting from (i) the disbursements to

(a)  by written consent of the Company and Acquiror;

69

 



    



  

(c)  prior to the Closing, by written notice to Acquiror from
the Company if (i) there is any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Acquiror set forth in this
Agreement, such that the conditions specified in Section 9.03(a) or Section

the other if the Acquiror Stockholder Approval is not obtained at the Special
Meeting (subject to any adjournment or recess of the meeting);

or

  



  

(g)  by written notice from Acquiror if the Company shall have

Section 10.02 _Effect of Termination_. 

  



  

(a)  Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 10.02, in
the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01,
this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability on the part of any party hereto or its respective Affiliates,
officers, directors, employees or stockholders, other than liability of any
party hereto for any Willful Breach of this Agreement by such party occurring
prior to such termination subject to Section 6.05. The provisions of
Sections 6.05, 8.04, 10.02 and Article XI (collectively, the " _Surviving
Provisions_ ") and the Confidentiality Agreement, and any other Section or
Article of this Agreement referenced in the Surviving Provisions, which are
required to survive in order to give appropriate effect to the Surviving
Provisions, shall in each case survive any termination of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a failure by Acquiror and Merger Sub to close
in accordance with this Agreement when they are obligated to do so shall be
deemed to be a Willful Breach of this Agreement.

  



  

(b)  In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated by
(A) the Company pursuant to Section 10.01(e) or (B) by Acquiror pursuant to
Section 10.01(f)(A) or (B), then the Company shall pay the Company Termination
Payment to Acquiror (or one or more of its designees), at or prior to the
time of termination in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 10.01(e)
or as promptly as reasonably practicable in the case of a termination
pursuant to Section 10.01(f)(A) or (B) (and, in any event, within two
Business Days following such termination), payable by wire transfer of
immediately available funds.

  



  

   

70

 



    



  

(c)  (A) In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated
by Acquiror pursuant to Section 10.01(f)(C) and (B) within 12 months of such
termination the Company consummates, or enters into an agreement providing
for, a transaction contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal, then the Company
shall pay the Company Termination Payment to Acquiror (or one or more of its
designees) as promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within
two Business Days) after the date of the event giving rise to the obligation
to make such payment.

  



  

(d)  The Parties acknowledge and hereby agree that the Company
Termination Payment, if, as and when required pursuant to this Section 10.02,
shall not constitute a penalty but will be liquidated damages, in a reasonable
amount that will compensate Acquiror in the circumstances in which it is
payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Merger, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. The Parties acknowledge
and hereby agree that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the
Company Termination Payment on more than one occasion. Each of the Company,
Acquiror and Merger Sub acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 10.02 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter
into this Agreement.

  



  

(e)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, in any circumstance in which this Agreement is terminated
and Acquiror is paid the Company Termination Payment pursuant to this Section
10.02, the Company Termination Payment shall be the sole and exclusive
monetary remedy of Acquiror, Merger Sub or any of the Acquiror Related Parties
against the Company or any other Company Related Party for any loss or damage
suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a breach (including
any Willful Breach) of, or failure to perform under, this Agreement or any
certificate or other document delivered in connection herewith or otherwise or
in respect of any oral representation made or alleged to have been made in
connection herewith or therewith, and upon payment of such amounts, none of
the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or in respect of
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith, whether in
equity or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise.

in whole or in part, only by a duly authorized agreement in writing executed
in the same manner as this Agreement and which makes reference to this
Agreement. The approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of any of the

Section 11.12 _Jurisdiction; WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY_. Any Action based
upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement, or the transactions
contemplated hereby, shall be brought in the Court of Chancery of the State
of Delaware or, if such court declines to exercise jurisdiction, the U.S.

respect of the Action shall be heard and determined only in any such court,
and agrees not to bring any Action arising out of or relating to this

Section 11.12. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND
ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED

damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that the parties do not perform their
obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take
such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement)
in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions.
The parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, without proof of damages, prior to the valid termination
of this Agreement in accordance with Section 10.01, this being in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement, and (b) the
right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, none of the parties
would have entered into this Agreement. Each party agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of specific performance and other equitable relief on the
basis that the other parties have an adequate remedy at Law or that an award
of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or
equity. The parties acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section
11.13(a) shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in

respect to such party. Except to the extent named as a party to this
Agreement (and then only to the extent of the specific obligations undertaken

director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder,
Affiliate, agent, attorney, advisor or representative or Affiliate of any
named party to this Agreement and (b) no past, present or future director,
officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate,

otherwise) for any one or more of the representations, warranties, covenants,
agreements or other obligations or liabilities of any one or more of the
Company, Acquiror or Merger Sub under this Agreement of or for any claim
based on, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  



  

   

74

instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement, including any rights arising
out of any breach of such representations, warranties, covenants,
obligations, agreements and other provisions, shall survive the Closing and
shall terminate and expire upon the occurrence of the Effective Time (and
there shall be no liability after the Closing in respect thereof), except for
(a) those covenants and agreements contained herein that by their terms
expressly apply in whole or in part after the Closing and then only with
respect to any breaches occurring after the Closing and (b) this Section
11.15.

agrees (on its own behalf and on behalf of its respective Affiliates and its
and their respective Representatives) that: (i) it has conducted its own
independent investigation of the financial condition, results of

Representations by the Company, the Acquiror and Merger Sub Representations

makes, or has made, any other express or implied representation or warranty
with respect to any party hereto (or any party's Affiliates) or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and all other representations and
warranties of any kind or nature expressed or implied (including (x)
regarding the completeness or accuracy of, or any omission to state or to
disclose, any information, including in the estimates, projections or
forecasts or any other information, document or material provided to or made
available to any party hereto or their respective Affiliates or
Representatives in certain "data rooms," management presentations or in any
other form in expectation of the Transactions, including meetings, calls or
correspondence with management of any party hereto (or any party's
Subsidiaries), and (y) any relating to the future or historical business,
condition (financial or otherwise), results of operations, prospects, assets
or liabilities of any party hereto (or its Subsidiaries), or the
quality, quantity or condition of any party's or its Subsidiaries' assets)
are specifically disclaimed by all parties hereto and their respective
Subsidiaries and all other Persons (including the Representatives and
Affiliates of any party hereto or its Subsidiaries); and (v) each party
hereto and its respective Affiliates are not relying on any representations
and warranties in connection with the Transactions except the Company
