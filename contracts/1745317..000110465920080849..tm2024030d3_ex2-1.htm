</FONT>As of the date hereof, there is at least $117,000,000 invested in a trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the &ldquo;<U>Trust
Account</U>&rdquo;), maintained by Continental Stock Transfer &amp; Trust Company, a New York corporation, acting as trustee (the
 &ldquo;<U>Trustee</U>&rdquo;), pursuant to the Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated October 15, 2018, by and between Acquiror
and the Trustee (the &ldquo;<U>Trust Agreement</U>&rdquo;). The Trust Agreement is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid
and binding obligation of Acquiror and, to the knowledge of Acquiror, the Trustee, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject
to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws affecting creditors&rsquo;
rights generally and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity. The Trust Agreement has not been terminated,
repudiated, rescinded, amended or supplemented or modified, in any respect, and, to the knowledge of Acquiror, no such termination,
repudiation, rescission, amendment, supplement or modification is contemplated. There are no side letters and there are no agreements,
Contracts, arrangements or understandings, whether written or oral, with the Trustee or any other Person that would (i) cause the
description of the Trust Agreement in the Acquiror SEC Reports to be inaccurate or (ii) entitle any Person (other than any Acquiror
Stockholder who is a Redeeming Stockholder) to any portion of the proceeds in the Trust Account. Prior to the Closing, none of
the funds held in the Trust Account may be released except in accordance with the Trust Agreement, Acquiror Organizational Documents
and Acquiror&rsquo;s final prospectus dated October 16, 2018. Amounts in the Trust Account are invested in United States Government
securities or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of
1940. Acquiror has performed all material obligations required to be performed by it to date under, and is not in material default,
breach or delinquent in performance or any other respect (claimed or actual) in connection with, the Trust Agreement, and no event
has occurred which, with due notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute such a default or breach thereunder. There are no
Actions pending or, to the knowledge of Acquiror, threatened with respect to the Trust Account. Since October 18, 2018, Acquiror
has not released any money from the Trust Account (other than interest income earned on the principal held in the Trust Account
as permitted by the Trust Agreement). As of the Effective Time, the obligations of Acquiror to dissolve or liquidate pursuant to
the Acquiror Organizational Documents shall terminate, and, as of the Effective Time, Acquiror shall have no obligation whatsoever
pursuant to the Acquiror Organizational Documents to dissolve and liquidate the assets of Acquiror by reason of the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby. Following the Effective Time, no Acquiror Stockholder shall be entitled to receive any
amount from the Trust Account except to the extent such Acquiror Stockholder is a Redeeming Stockholder.</P>

The Acquiror has delivered to the Company a true, correct and complete copy of each Subscription Agreement executed on or prior
to the date hereof, pursuant to which certain Investors have committed, subject to the terms and conditions therein, to purchase
150,000,000 shares of Acquiror Common Stock. To the knowledge of Acquiror, each Subscription Agreement is in full force and effect
and is legal, valid and binding upon the Acquiror and the applicable Investor, enforceable in accordance with its terms. Each Subscription
Agreement has not been withdrawn, terminated, amended or modified since the date of delivery hereunder and prior to the execution
of this Agreement, and, to the knowledge of Acquiror, as of the date of this Agreement no such withdrawal, termination, amendment
or modification is contemplated, and as of the date of this Agreement the commitments contained in each Subscription Agreement
have not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded by the applicable Investor in any respect. As of the date hereof, there are no
side letters or Contracts to which Acquiror or Merger Sub is a party related to the provision or funding, as applicable, of the
purchases contemplated by each Subscription Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby other than as expressly set forth
in this Agreement, each Subscription Agreement or any other agreement entered into (or to be entered into) in connection with the
Transactions delivered to the Company. Acquiror has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required in connection
with each Subscription Agreement that are payable on or prior to the date hereof and will pay any and all such fees when and as
the same become due and payable after the date hereof pursuant to each Subscription Agreement. Acquiror has, and to the knowledge
of Acquiror, each Investor has, complied with all of its obligations under each Subscription Agreement. There are no conditions
precedent or other contingencies related to the consummation of the purchases set forth in each Subscription Agreement, other than
as expressly set forth in each Subscription Agreement. No event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would or would reasonably be expected to (i) constitute a default or breach on the part of Acquiror or, to the knowledge of Acquiror
as of the date hereof, any Investor, (ii) assuming the conditions set forth in Section 9.01 and Section 9.02 will be satisfied,
constitute a failure to satisfy a condition on the part of Acquiror or, to the knowledge of Acquiror as of the date hereof, the
applicable Investor or (iii) assuming the conditions set forth in Section 9.01 and Section 9.02 will be satisfied, to the knowledge
of Acquiror as of the date hereof, result in any portion of the amounts to be paid by each Investor in accordance with each Subscription
Agreement being unavailable on the Closing Date. As of the date hereof, assuming the conditions set forth in Section 9.01 and Section
9.02 will be satisfied, Acquiror has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the consummation of the purchases under
each Subscription Agreement will not be satisfied, and, as of the date hereof, Acquiror is not aware of the existence of any fact
or event that would or would reasonably be expected to cause such conditions not to be satisfied. </FONT></P>

The Company acknowledges that the Acquiror is a blank check company with the power and privileges to effect a merger, asset acquisition,
reorganization or similar business combination involving the Company and one or more businesses or assets, and the Company has
read Acquiror&rsquo;s final prospectus, dated October 16, 2018 and other Acquiror SEC Reports, the Acquiror Organizational Documents,
and the Trust Agreement and understands that Acquiror has established the Trust Account described therein for the benefit of Acquiror&rsquo;s
public stockholders and that disbursements from the Trust Account are available only in the limited circumstances set forth therein.
The Company further acknowledges and agrees that the Acquiror&rsquo;s sole assets consist of the cash proceeds of the Acquiror&rsquo;s
initial public offering and private placements of its securities, and that substantially all of these proceeds have been deposited
in the Trust Account for the benefit of its public shareholders. The Company further acknowledges that, if the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement are not consummated by July 31, 2020 or such later date as approved by the shareholders of Acquiror to complete
a Business Combination, Acquiror will be obligated to return to its stockholders the amounts being held in the Trust Account. Accordingly,
the Company (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) hereby waives any past, present or future claim of any kind against, and any
right to access, the Trust Account, any trustee of the Trust Account and Acquiror to collect from the Trust Account any monies
that may be owed to them by Acquiror or any of its Affiliates for any reason whatsoever, and will not seek recourse against the
Trust Account at any time for any reason whatsoever, including, without limitation, for any Willful Breach of this Agreement. This
Section 6.05 shall survive the termination of this Agreement for any reason.</FONT></P>

received after the date hereof that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to result in or lead to, any Acquisition Proposal,

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company may grant a waiver, amendment or release under any confidentiality
or standstill agreement to the extent necessary to allow for a confidential bona fide written Acquisition Proposal (which Acquisition
Proposal was made after the date of this Agreement and did not result from a breach of this Section 6.07) to be made to the Company
or the Company Board so long as the Company promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours thereafter) notifies Acquiror
thereof (including the identity of such counterparty) after granting any such waiver, amendment or release and the Company Board

to the Company, that the failure of the Company Board to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions contained in this Section
6.07 by any of the Company&rsquo;s Subsidiaries, or any of the Company&rsquo;s or its Subsidiaries&rsquo; respective Representatives

Time provisions in its certificate of incorporation (if applicable), bylaws and other organizational documents concerning the indemnification

affect the rights of those Persons thereunder, in each case, except as required by Law. Acquiror shall assume, and be liable for,

premium for such insurance in excess of 300% of the aggregate annual premium payable by the Company and its Subsidiaries for such
insurance policy for the year ended December 31, 2018; provided, however, that (i) Acquiror may cause coverage to be extended under

Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, subject to the provisions of this Section 8.02(d). The Acquiror Board shall not (and
no committee or subgroup thereof shall) change, withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to change, withdraw,
withhold, qualify or modify, the Acquiror Board Recommendation (an &ldquo;<U>Acquiror Change in Recommendation</U>&rdquo;); provided,
that the Acquiror Board may make a Acquiror Change in Recommendation if it determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that a failure to make an Acquiror Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.02(d), if on a date for which the Special Meeting
is scheduled, Acquiror has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock to obtain the
Acquiror Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, Acquiror shall have the right to make one or more successive

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would
occur in the event that the parties do not perform their obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing
to take such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. The parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
hereof, without proof of damages, prior to the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 10.01, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement, and (b) the right of specific enforcement is an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, none of the parties would have entered
into this Agreement. Each party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of specific performance and other equitable relief
on the basis that the other parties have an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at Law or equity. The parties acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section 11.13(a)
shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such injunction.</FONT></P>
