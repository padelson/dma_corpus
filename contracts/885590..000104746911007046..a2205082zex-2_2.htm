(x)&nbsp;Inventories as agreed to in writing by Seller and Inventory Purchaser or (y)&nbsp;Inventories as shown in the Independent Accountant's and/or the Arbitrator's calculation delivered

the Independent Accountant or Arbitrator, as the case may be, shall not make any other determination. Any determinations by either of the Independent Accountant or Arbitrator, respectively, and any
work or analyses performed by either of the Independent Accountant or Arbitrator, respectively, in connection with its resolution of any Dispute under this Section&nbsp;2.7, shall not be admissible
in evidence in any suit, action or proceeding between the Parties, other than to the extent necessary to enforce payment obligations under this Section&nbsp;2.7(c). </FONT></P>
