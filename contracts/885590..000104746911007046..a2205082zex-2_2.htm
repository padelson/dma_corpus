 (c) If a notice of Disputed Items shall be timely delivered pursuant to Section 2.7(a) or (b), Seller and Inventory Purchaser shall, during the twenty (20) Business Day period immediately following the date of such delivery (the " _Resolution Period_ "), negotiate to resolve the Disputed Items. If, during the Resolution Period, the Parties are unable to reach agreement, Seller and Inventory Purchaser shall refer all unresolved Disputed Items to an independent, nationally-recognized accounting firm as Seller and Inventory Purchaser shall mutually agree upon in writing (the " _Independent Accountant_ "), or, in the case of a Disputed Item under Section 2.7(a), to the Arbitrator pursuant to Section 10.11. If the parties fail to agree on an Independent Accountant (if applicable) within twenty (20) days after the expiration of the Resolution Period, on the request of any party the American Arbitration Association shall nominate a senior partner in an independent nationally recognized accounting firm to serve as the Independent Accountant. Such referral shall be made within ten (10) Business Days of termination of the Resolution Period, whereupon the Independent Accountant or Arbitrator, as the case may be, shall make a determination with respect to each unresolved Disputed Item within thirty (30) days after such referral, or as soon thereafter as practicable, which determination shall be made in accordance with this Section 2.7; _provided_ , that in making such determination, the Independent Accountant or Arbitrator, as the case may be, shall be limited to choosing between the calculation of Inventories last proposed in writing by Seller during the Resolution Period (or, in the absence of any such proposal, the calculation of Inventories set forth on the Inventories Statement initially delivered by Seller pursuant to this Section 2.7), on the one hand, and the calculation of Inventories last proposed in writing by Purchasers during the Resolution Period (or, in the absence of any such proposal, the calculation of Inventories set forth in Purchasers\' dispute notice) on the other hand. The Independent Accountant or Arbitrator, as the case may be, shall deliver to Seller and Inventory Purchaser, within such thirty (30) day period, or as soon thereafter as practicable, a report setting forth its adjustments, if any, to the Inventories Statement and the calculations supporting such adjustments. Such report shall be final and binding on the Parties and non-appealable and conclusive in all respects and may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant and/or Arbitrator shall be borne by the Party whose calculation of Inventories is not accepted by the Independent Accountant or Arbitrator, as the case may be, which fees and expenses shall be paid (taking into account any prior payments) at the time the payment contemplated by Section 2.7(d) is made. For purposes of clarity, such costs do not include any adjustments determined by the Independent Accountant or Arbitrator hereunder. As used herein, " _Final Inventories_ " shall mean (i) if no notice of Disputed Items is delivered by Inventory Purchaser within the periods provided in Sections 2.7(a) or (b), Inventories as shown on the Inventories Statement as prepared by Seller or (ii) if such a notice of Disputed Items is delivered by Inventory Purchaser, either (x) Inventories as agreed to in writing by Seller and Inventory Purchaser or (y) Inventories as shown in the Independent Accountant\'s and/or the Arbitrator\'s calculation delivered pursuant to this Section 2.7(c). The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Independent Accountant or Arbitrator, as the case may be, shall be limited to the unresolved Disputed Items, and the Independent Accountant or Arbitrator, as the case may be, shall not make any other determination. Any determinations by either of the Independent Accountant or Arbitrator, respectively, and any work or analyses performed by either of the Independent Accountant or Arbitrator, respectively, in connection with its resolution of any Dispute under this Section 2.7, shall not be admissible in evidence in any suit, action or proceeding between the Parties, other than to the extent necessary to enforce payment obligations under this Section 2.7(c). 

        

 (d) If the Final Inventories are less than ***, then Seller shall, within ten (10) days after the determination of the Final Inventories, pay to Inventory Purchaser, by wire transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with written instructions given to Seller by Inventory Purchaser, the amount of such shortfall. If the Final Inventories are greater than ***, then Purchasers shall, within ten (10) days after the determination of the Final Inventories, pay to Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with written instructions given by Seller to Inventory Purchaser, the amount of such excess. 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that, during the sixty (60) day period following Inventory Purchaser\'s receipt of the Inventories Statement, Inventory Purchaser discovers any latent defect in respect of any Inventories, Inventory Purchaser may submit a Disputed Item in respect of such latent defect to Seller subject to the process set forth in Section 2.7(b) and Section 2.7(c), and be entitled to an adjustment to amounts previously paid consistent with the provisions set forth in Section 2.7(d), in each case _mutatis mutandis_. 

  

 (f) All payments made pursuant to this Section 2.7 shall be treated for Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, unless otherwise required by applicable Law. 

  

 Section 2.8 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. (a) The Parties agree that the Purchase Price and Assumed Liabilities shall be allocated among the Purchased Assets on or after the Closing Date in the manner specified in _Schedule 2.8(a)_, as mutually agreed to by the Parties (the " _Allocation_ "). Such Allocation shall be made in accordance with the principles of section 1060 of the Code. In the event of any adjustment in the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.7, such adjustment shall be allocated by the Parties among the Purchased Assets in accordance with the principles of section 1060 of the Code, _Schedule 2.8(a)_ and as mutually agreed to by the Parties, and such revised allocation shall be the Allocation. The Parties each agree to (i) be bound by the Allocation, (ii) act in accordance with the Allocation in the preparation of financial statements and filing of all Tax Returns (including filing Form 8594 with its federal income Tax Return for the taxable year that includes the Closing Date) and (iii) take no position inconsistent with the Allocation for all Tax purposes. 

  

 (b) In the event that any Taxing Authority disputes the Allocation, Seller, Inventory Purchaser or Products Purchaser, as the case may be, shall promptly notify the other Party in writing of the nature of such dispute. 

  

 Section 2.9 _Taxes_. (a) All Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by Purchasers. Purchasers and Seller shall cooperate in timely making all Tax Returns as may be required to comply with the provisions of such Transfer Tax laws. 

  

 (b) All personal property Taxes and assessments on the Purchased Assets for any taxable period commencing prior to the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date shall be prorated on a per diem basis between Purchasers and Seller as of the Closing Date. The amount of all such prorations payable by the Party that is not required to pay such Tax under applicable Law shall be paid to the Party required to pay such Tax under applicable Law on the Closing Date and such amount shall be remitted to the applicable Taxing Authority as soon as practicable thereafter;  _provided_ , _however_ , that final payments with respect to prorations that are not able to be calculated as of the Closing Date shall be calculated and paid as soon as practicable after the Closing Date. 

  

 (c) Each Party shall cooperate and otherwise take commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any exemptions for or refunds of such Transfer Taxes or property Taxes and to minimize any such Transfer Taxes or property Taxes. 

  

 Section 2.10 _***_. During the period from the date hereof through the date that is *** after the Closing Date, Purchasers shall enter into negotiations with the Seller for a transaction or transactions involving the acquisition by the Purchasers of assets substantially similar to the Purchased Assets relating to the business of developing, commercializing, manufacturing, packaging, marketing, distributing and selling the Products in *** and/or ***. Seller shall provide such diligence information as is reasonably requested by Purchaser and the Parties shall negotiate in good faith with each other with a goal, but without any obligation, of entering into a definitive agreement prior to the end of such period. During the period from the date hereof through the date that is *** after the Closing Date, Seller shall not negotiate with or otherwise discuss with another Person any acquisition, exclusive license or other similar arrangement for the Products in ***or ***. Such exclusivity period may be extended on mutual agreement of the Parties. 

        

 Section 2.11 _Risk of Loss_. Prior to the Closing, any loss or damage to the Purchased Assets from fire, casualty or otherwise shall be the sole responsibility of Seller. Thereafter, any such loss or damage shall be the sole responsibility of Purchasers. 

   

 Section 2.12 _Transferred Domain Names_. Notwithstanding any other term or condition set forth in this Agreement to the contrary, at the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause the Divesting Entities to, sell, convey, assign and transfer to Purchaser "as is" and "where is", and Purchaser shall purchase, acquire and accept from Seller and such Divesting Entities any right, title and interest that Seller and such Divesting Entities have in, to and under the Transferred Domain Names set forth on  _Schedule 1.1(e)_ in the Territory as of the Closing. Seller and the Divesting Entities shall maintain the Transferred Domain Names after the Closing until the transfer of the Transferred Domain Names is effective, provided that such period shall not exceed ***. Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, or cause the Divesting Entities to obtain, the consent of any other Person to the extent necessary to allow Purchaser to sell and transfer any of the Transferred Domain Names. Purchaser agrees that no representation, warranty or covenant of Seller contained herein shall be breached or deemed breached, and no condition to Purchaser\'s obligations to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be deemed not satisfied, solely as a result of (i) the failure to obtain any such consent or (ii) any lawsuit, action, claim, proceeding or investigation commenced or threatened by or on behalf of any Person to the extent arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any such consent. Notwithstanding the above, Seller shall, and shall cause the Divesting Entities to, provide reasonable assistance to the Purchasers, on request, to effect the assignment or transfer of such Transferred Domain Names, including by making any necessary filings with the applicable Governmental Authorities.

misappropriated or otherwise violated or conflicted with, the intellectual
property of any Person. To the Knowledge of Seller, no Person is infringing,

or Licensed Know-How. Each Transferred Intellectual Property License is valid
and binding on Seller or the Divesting Entity that is a party thereto and, to
the Knowledge of Seller, the other party thereto, and is in full force and
effect, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent
conveyance, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors\' rights generally

thereunder. The Seller, and each Divesting Entity, takes commercially

used or held for use in the conduct of the Business by the Seller or any
Divesting Entity, and to the actual Knowledge of Seller (without any
inquiry), there has not been any disclosure of any material trade secret or
confidential information owned, used or held for use in the conduct of the

secret or other rights in and to such information. To the Knowledge of Seller,
no funding, facilities or personnel of any Governmental Authority were used
to develop or create, in whole or in part, any Transferred Intellectual
Property. To the Knowledge of Seller, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not result in the loss or
impairment of the Seller\'s, or any Divesting Entity\'s, right to own, use or
hold for use any of the Licensed Know-How with respect to its use in the
conduct of the Business.

Each of Seller and the Divesting Entities are not aware of any facts which are reasonably likely to cause (i) the recall, market withdrawal or replacement of any Product sold or intended to be sold by Seller or the Divesting Entities, (ii) a change in the marketing classification or a material change in the labeling of any such Products, or (iii) a termination or suspension of the marketing of such Products.

_INDEMNIFICATION_

  

 Section 8.1 _Indemnification by Seller_. Subject to the provisions of this Article VIII, Seller agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Purchasers and its Affiliates and, if applicable, their respective directors, officers, agents, employees, successors and assigns, from and against any and all penalties, assessments, fines, fees, suits, actions, causes of action, judgments, Taxes, awards and Liabilities, including reasonable attorneys\' fees (collectively, the " _Losses_ ") to the extent arising from or relating to (i) any Retained Liability, (ii) any breach by Seller or any Divesting Entity of any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, (iii) any breach of any warranty or representation of Seller or any Divesting Entity contained in this Agreement; or (iv) any event occurring after the Closing, to the extent relating to the period prior to the Closing, in connection 

        
  

with the Products, the Business and the Purchased Assets, including the use,
ownership, possession, operation, occupancy, sale or lease of any Purchased
Assets prior to the Closing (other than Assumed Liabilities).

  

 Section 8.2 _Indemnification by Purchasers_. Subject to the provisions of this Article VIII, Purchasers agree, severally but not jointly, to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates and, if applicable, their respective directors, officers, agents, employees, successors and assigns, from and against any and all Losses to the extent arising from or relating to (i) any Assumed Liability, (ii) any breach by Purchasers of any of their covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, (iii) any breach of any warranty or representation of Purchasers contained in this Agreement and (iv) any event occurring after the Closing, to the extent relating to the period after to the Closing, in connection with the Products, the Business and the Purchased Assets, including the use, ownership, possession, operation, occupancy, sale or lease of any Purchased Assets after the Closing (other than Retained Liabilities). 

  

 Section 8.3 _Notice of Claims_. If any of the Persons to be indemnified under this Article VIII (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") has suffered or incurred any Loss, the Indemnified Party shall so notify the Party from whom indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") promptly in writing, describing such Loss, the amount or estimated amount thereof, if known or reasonably capable of estimation, and the method of computation of such Loss, all with reasonable particularity and containing a reference to the provisions of this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or certificate delivered pursuant hereto in respect of which such Loss shall have occurred. If any claim, action, suit or proceeding (in equity or at law) is instituted by a third party with respect to which the Indemnified Party intends to claim any Loss under this Article VIII, the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify (the " _Third Party Claim Notice_ ") the Indemnifying Party of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and offer to tender to the Indemnifying Party the defense of such claim, action, suit or proceeding. A failure by the Indemnified Party to give notice and to offer to tender the defense of any claim, action, suit or proceeding in a timely manner pursuant to this Section 8.3 shall not limit the obligation of the Indemnifying Party under this Article VIII, except (i) to the extent such Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby or (ii) as provided in Section 8.5. 

  

 Section 8.4 _Third Party Claims_. (a) The Indemnifying Party under this Article VIII shall have the right, but not the obligation, exercisable by written notice to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days of receipt of a Third Party Claim Notice from the Indemnified Party with respect thereto, to assume the conduct and control, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party and through counsel of its choosing that is reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party, any third party claim, action, suit or proceeding (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), and the Indemnifying Party may compromise or settle the same; _provided_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall give the Indemnified Party advance written notice of any proposed compromise or settlement and shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), consent to or enter into any compromise or settlement that commits the Indemnified Party, to take, or to forbear to take, any action or does not provide for a full and complete written release by the applicable third party of the Indemnified Party. No Indemnified Party may compromise or settle any Third Party Claim for which it is seeking indemnification hereunder without the consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). No Indemnifying Party may consent to the entry of any judgment that does not relate solely to monetary damages arising from any such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). The Indemnifying Party shall permit the Indemnified Party to participate in, but not control, the defense of any such Third Party Claim through counsel chosen by the Indemnified Party; _provided_ , that the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to control or conduct the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party nevertheless shall have the right to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim and, at its own expense, to employ counsel of its own choosing for such purpose. 

  

 (b) The Parties shall cooperate in the defense of any Third Party Claim, with such cooperation to include (i) the retention and the provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim and (ii) reasonable access to employees on a mutually convenient basis for providing additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. 

   

 Section 8.5 _Expiration_. If the Closing shall have occurred, all covenants, agreements, warranties and representations made herein or in any certificate or other document delivered pursuant hereto shall survive the 

        
  

Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements made herein or in any certificate or other document
delivered pursuant hereto, and all indemnification obligations under Section
8.1(ii), Section 8.1(iii), Section 8.2(ii) and Section 8.2(iii) with respect
to any such representations or warranties (other than the Fundamental Reps,
the indemnification rights with respect to which shall not be subject to the
limitations set forth in this sentence, and the representations and warranties
in Section 5.17 (Tax Matters) which shall survive until *** following the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations) or any such covenants or
agreements, shall (i) in the case of any such representations or warranties,
or any covenants and agreements as to which the last date on which such
covenant or agreement is to be performed is on or prior to the Closing Date,
terminate and expire on, and no action or proceeding seeking damages or other
relief for breach of any thereof or for any misrepresentation or inaccuracy
with respect thereto, shall be commenced after the date that is *** after the
Closing Date ( _provided_ , that to the extent that any such claims of
breaches relate to Purchased Assets that were not transferred to the
Purchasers as of the Closing Date, the date of such termination and
expiration shall be *** after the date on which the applicable Purchased
Assets were transferred to Purchasers), unless prior to such date a claim
for indemnification with respect thereto shall have been made, with
reasonable specificity, by written notice given in accordance with Section 8.3
and (ii) in the case of any such covenants or agreements as to which the last
date on which such covenant or agreement is to be performed after the Closing
Date, terminate and expire on, and no action or proceeding seeking damages or
other relief for breach of any thereof shall be commenced after, the date
occurring *** following the last date on which such covenant or agreement is
to be performed, unless prior to such date a claim for indemnification with
respect thereto shall have been made, with reasonable specificity, by written
notice given in accordance with Section 8.3.

   

 Section 8.6 _Certain Limitations_. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article VIII, Seller shall not have any indemnification obligations for Losses under Section 8.1(iii), (i) for any individual item or series of related items where the Loss relating thereto is less than *** and (ii) in respect of each individual item or series of related items where the Loss relating thereto is equal to or greater than ***, unless the aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeds an amount equal to *** of the Purchase Price (the " _Deductible_ "), in which event Seller shall be required to pay only the amount of such Losses that exceed the Deductible, but only up to a maximum amount equal to *** of the Purchase Price. For purposes of determining the amount of any such Loss (but not for determining the existence of any breach, misrepresentation or inaccuracy with respect to any representation or warranty of Seller or any Divesting Entity), any qualification as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect set forth in any such representation or warranty shall be disregarded. 

  

 Section 8.7 _Losses Net of Insurance, Etc._ The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under Section 8.1 or Section 8.2 shall be net of (i) any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party pursuant to any indemnification by or indemnification agreement with any third party and (ii) any insurance proceeds actually received as an offset against such Loss. If the amount to be netted hereunder from any payment required under Section 8.1 or Section 8.2 is determined after payment by the Indemnifying Party of any amount otherwise required to be paid to an Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article VIII, the Indemnified Party shall repay to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after such determination, any amount that the Indemnifying Party would not have had to pay pursuant to this Article VIII had such determination been made at the time of such payment. The Indemnifying Party may require, as a condition to the provision of indemnification hereunder, that the Indemnified Party execute an undertaking consistent with its obligations set forth in this Section 8.7. All payments made pursuant to this Article VIII shall be treated for Tax purposes as an adjustment to the purchase price, unless otherwise required by applicable Law. 

  

 Section 8.8 _Sole Remedy/Waiver_. Subject to Section 10.12, each Party acknowledges and agrees that the remedies provided for in this Agreement shall be its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. In furtherance of the foregoing, each of the Parties hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any and all other rights, claims and causes of action (including rights of contributions, if any) known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future, that it may have against Seller or any of its Affiliates, or Purchasers or any of their Affiliates, as the case may be, arising under or based upon any applicable Law, except that nothing herein shall limit the liability of either Party for fraud or willful breach. 

        

 Section 8.9 _Indemnity Payments_. In the event that either Party agrees to or is determined to have an obligation to reimburse the other Party for Losses as provided in this Article VIII, the Indemnifying Party shall promptly pay such amount to the Indemnified Party in U.S. dollars via wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified in writing by the Indemnified Party. 

  

 Section 8.10 _No Consequential Damages_. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, NO PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ANCILLARY AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIABLE TO OR OTHERWISE RESPONSIBLE TO THE OTHER PARTY OR ANY AFFILIATE OF THE OTHER PARTY FOR LOST REVENUES OR PROFITS OR INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR MULTIPLIED DAMAGES THAT ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ANCILLARY AGREEMENT OR THE PERFORMANCE OR BREACH HEREOF OR THEREOF OR ANY LIABILITY RETAINED OR ASSUMED HEREUNDER OR THEREUNDER, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH DAMAGES WERE ACTUALLY PAID TO A THIRD PARTY PURSUANT TO A THIRD PARTY CLAIM.
