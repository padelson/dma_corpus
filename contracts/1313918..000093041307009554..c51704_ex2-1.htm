 21

 

 principal amount of any Notes excluded from clause (ii) above), as adjusted,
plus the amount of any liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries for Tax
purposes as of the Effective Time shall be allocated consistent with
past practice among the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including
the Management Agreement) as reasonably proposed by the Sellers
Representative in good faith and shall be set forth in a schedule produced by
the Sellers Representative and delivered to the Buyer within seventy-five
(75) days following the Closing Date (the " _Allocation Schedule_ "). The
Buyer shall have an opportunity to review the proposed Allocation Schedule
for a period of 20 days after receipt of the proposed Allocation Schedule. If
the Buyer disagrees with any aspect of the proposed Allocation Schedule, the
Buyer shall notify the Sellers Representative, in writing, prior to the end
of such 20-day period (an " _Allocation Objection Notice_ "), setting forth
the Buyers proposed Allocation Schedule and specifying, in
reasonable detail, any good faith dispute as to the Sellers Representatives
Allocation Schedule. If prior to the conclusion of such 20-day period, the
Buyer notifies the Sellers Representative in writing that it will not provide
any Allocation Objection Notice or if the Buyer does not deliver an
Allocation Objection Notice within such 20-day period, then the proposed
Allocation Schedule shall be deemed final and conclusive and binding upon each
of the parties hereto (a " _Final Allocation Schedule_ "). The Sellers
Representative and the Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
resolve any objection by the Buyer to the proposed Allocation Schedule and to
agree upon a Final Allocation Schedule. If within 10 days after the Sellers
Representative receives an Allocation Objection Notice the Buyer and the
Sellers Representative have not resolved all objections and agreed upon a
Final Allocation Schedule, the Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall
engage a mutually acceptable independent accounting firm of national
recognition (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ ") to determine whether the
Sellers Representatives position with respect to any remaining disputed
items, as set forth in the proposed Allocation Schedule, are reasonable. Any
disputed items that are so determined by the Independent Accounting Firm to
be reasonable shall be included in the Final Allocation Schedule as proposed
by the Sellers Representative. Any disputed items that are so determined by
the Independent Accounting Firm not to be reasonable shall be adjusted by the
Independent Accounting Firm to be reasonable, and such adjusted amounts shall
be included in the Final Allocation Schedule. The Buyer and the Sellers
Representative shall have the opportunity to present their position with
respect to any disputed items to the Independent Accounting Firm and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Accounting Firm,
within 20 days after its selection, to make the above-
described determinations and to prepare a Final Allocation Schedule in
accordance therewith. Unless the Buyer and the Sellers Representative
otherwise agree, such Final Allocation Schedule shall not modify items
previously agreed. The fees and disbursements of the Independent Accounting
Firm shall be shared equally by the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Members
that held issued and outstanding Membership Interests as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time ( _pro rata_ in proportion to the respective amounts
paid to such Members pursuant to Section 3.2(a)), on the other hand, which
amounts payable by the Members shall be paid solely from the
Sellers Representative Expense Fund. The parties shall, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to, use the allocations set forth in the Final
Allocation Schedule for all Tax purposes, file all Tax Returns in a manner
consistent with such Final Allocation Schedule  

 22

 

 and take no position contrary thereto, in each case, unless required to do
so by a change in applicable Tax Laws or a good faith resolution of a Tax
contest.

general partner or managing member, that are not intended to constitute "plan
assets" under 29 C.F.R. 2510.3 -101 (the " _Plan Asset Regulation_ ") are, to

requests pending therefor, by or with respect to either of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, any holder of Membership Interests or any employee of any such
Person in connection with the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
or to the Knowledge of the Company, by any Client of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in connection with the provision of Investment Management
Services to such Client by the Company and its Subsidiaries.

true, correct and complete list of (i) the Hedge Fund Documents (it

reflect the entering into, or amendment, supplement or other modification of,
any Hedge Fund Document after the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date
in compliance with this Agreement) and (ii) the CDO  

 30

 

 Documents (it being understood that the Company shall be permitted to
provide the Buyer with a supplement to Section 4.12(f) of the Company
Disclosure Letter to reflect the entering into, or amendment, supplement or
other modification of, any CDO Document after the date hereof and prior to
the Closing Date in compliance with this Agreement). The Company provided the
Buyer with true and correct copies of all CDO Documents and Hedge Fund
Documents as of the date hereof (and as of the Closing will have provided
true and correct copies of any CDO Documents and/or Hedge Fund Documents
entered into after the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date in compliance
with this Agreement), and the offering circulars or memoranda included in
such CDO Documents and Hedge Fund Documents did not at the time such CDO or
Hedge Fund issued any securities related to such CDO Documents and Hedge Fund
Documents contain any untrue statement of a material fact concerning
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or omit to state a material fact
concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries necessary in order to make
the statements contained therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. Each of the CDO Documents and the Hedge
Fund Documents to which the Company or its Subsidiaries is a party, to the
extent applicable, is in full force and effect and binding upon the Company or
its Subsidiary party thereto and, to the Knowledge of the Company, the other
parties thereto, except as (i) limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance and other similar laws of
general application affecting enforcement of creditors rights generally and
(ii) the availability of the remedy of specific performance or injunctive or
other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and would
be subject to the discretion of the court before which any
proceeding therefor may be brought. None of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is in material default under any CDO Document or Hedge Fund
Document to which it is a party, nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, has any
event occurred which, with the giving of notice or the passage of time, or
both, would give rise to such a material default. Except as set forth in
Section 4.12(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter, to the Knowledge of the
Company, each of the CDOs was in compliance as of the Base Date with each of
its overcollateralization tests and interest coverage tests.

 

  (g) Upon delivery by the Company to the Clients who have provided
Client Consents of notification letters informing them of the
transaction contemplated hereby (the "Client Consent Confirmation Letter"),
each of the Client Consents (including each of the Consents included in the
determination of whether the condition contained in Section 7.8 has been
satisfied) will, as of the Closing Date, have been duly obtained under all
applicable Law and the requirements of the applicable Advisory Contract with
regard to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than any such
Client Consents that may have been revoked by the Client from and after the
date hereof and prior to the Closing. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall have notified the Buyer of any Client to whom a Client Consent
Confirmation Letter was delivered that, to the Companys Knowledge, has
revoked or has advised the Company that it intends to revoke its Client
Consent.

 

  (h) Nothing in this Section 4.12 (other than the calculation of
the Base Date AUM) is intended to address any matters with respect to the
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries.  

 31

 

 4.13 _Non-Contravention; Consents and Approvals_.

of the material terms and conditions of, cause the termination of or give any
other contracting party the right to terminate, or constitute (or with notice

not have a Company Material Adverse Effect; or

or in breach or violation of any Orders, except for any Orders set forth in
Section 4.17 of the Company Disclosure Letter or that could not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Nothing in this Section 4.17 is intended to address any Legal
Proceedings or Orders that are the subject of any other representation or
warranty contained in this Article IV and are disclosed pursuant to such other
representation or warranty or are not required to be disclosed because such
other representation or warranty is limited or qualified with respect to time,

of its Subsidiaries have not filed Tax Returns that it is or may be subject to
taxation by that jurisdiction. There are no Liens for material Taxes on any of
the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than Permitted
Liens. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability for
the Taxes of any Person (other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries)

obligation (other than agreements among the Company and its Subsidiaries and
other than customary Tax indemnifications contained in credit or
other commercial agreements the primary purpose of which does not relate to
Taxes). Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in any  

 36

 

 "listed transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section

the Membership Interests to be acquired by it pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement involves substantial risk. The Buyer and its directors and officers

such as the ones being transferred pursuant to this Agreement, and the Buyer
can bear the economic risk of its investment (which may be for an indefinite
period) and has such knowledge and experience in financial or business matters

investment in the Membership Interests to be acquired by it pursuant to the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Buyer understands that the Membership
Interests to be acquired by it pursuant to this Agreement have not been
registered under the Securities Act. The Buyer acknowledges that such

applicable exemption therefrom.

business, results of operations, properties, assets and prospects of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as it has deemed necessary or appropriate, that
it has had the opportunity to request all information it has deemed relevant
to the foregoing from the Company and has received responses it deems
adequate and sufficient to all such requests for information, and that in
making its decision to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby it has relied solely on its own
investigation, analysis and evaluation of the Company and its Subsidiaries
and is not relying in any way on any representations and warranties, including
any implied warranties, made by the Company or on behalf of the Company by any
other Person other than the representations and warranties made expressly by
the Company in this Agreement and each applicable Ancillary Document.

 

  5.13 _Exclusivity of Representations_. The representations and
warranties made by the Buyer and Buyer Sub in this Agreement are in lieu of
and are exclusive of all other representations and warranties, including any
implied warranties.

necessary or advisable to secure the Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i) the Buyer may

provided to the Buyers stockholders or, if as of the time for which the
Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy
Statement) there are insufficient shares of Buyer Common Stock represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct
the business of the Stockholders Meeting and (ii) if the Stockholder Approval
is not obtained at the initial Stockholder Meeting to be held following the
Closing Date, then automatic conversion of the Buyer Preferred Stock shall
thereafter occur only if the holders of 20% or more of the Buyer Preferred
Stock shall have requested that the Company seek Stockholder Approval and such
approval is obtained at the first regularly scheduled annual meeting of the
stockholders occurring after such request is made and, if such request is
made, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain Stockholder
Approval at its next regularly scheduled annual meeting of the stockholders;

least forty-five (45) days prior to the regularly scheduled annual meeting

neither the Board of Directors of the Buyer nor the Special Committee
shall withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a
manner adverse to the Company, the Board Recommendation or the approval.

 

  (e) The written information to be supplied by or on behalf of the
Buyer (including with respect to the Company) for inclusion in the
Proxy Statement to be sent to the stockholders of the Buyer in connection
with the Stockholders Meeting shall not, on the date the Proxy Statement is
first mailed to stockholders of the Buyer, at  

 55

 

 the time of the Stockholders Meeting or at the Effective Time, contain any
statement that, at such time and in light of the circumstances under which it
shall be made, is false or misleading with respect to any material fact,
or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements
made in the Proxy Statement not false or misleading; or omit to state any
material fact necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication
with respect to the solicitation of proxies for the Stockholders Meeting that
has become false or misleading. If at any time prior to the Stockholders
Meeting any fact or event relating to the Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including the Company) that should be set forth in a supplement to the Proxy
Statement should be discovered by the Buyer or should occur, the Buyer shall,
promptly after becoming aware thereof, inform the Sellers Representative of
such fact or event.

shall make such records available to the Sellers Representative as the
Sellers Representative requires. The Buyer may destroy such records after
that time, but only after the Buyer gives ninety (90) days prior written
notice to the Sellers Representative and details the contents of the records
to be destroyed; the Sellers Representative shall have the option to take
possession of the records at its own expense within ninety (90) days of the
date of such notice by the Buyer in accordance with Section 6.10(b).

 

  (b) The Buyer (including, for the purpose of this Section 6.10(b),

litigation, investigation, Tax audit, discovery or similar proceeding, or in
the preparation of Tax Returns, and shall prepare, at the expense of the
Members, which shall be paid solely from the Sellers Representative Expense

audit, discovery, similar proceeding or claim, the Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to make such employees available for a
reasonable period of time.

 

  (c) The Sellers Representative shall exercise its rights under

covered employees (and their qualified beneficiaries) who terminate their
employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date.

 

  (e) From and after the Closing Date, and to the extent not
otherwise addressed in the foregoing Section 6.12(d), the Buyer shall be
responsible with respect to current and former employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and their beneficiaries (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, those former employees (and their beneficiaries) who terminate their
employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date)
for compliance with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of

that might be imposed as a result of the consummation of the transactions

  (a) The Company shall use its reasonable efforts to deliver to the
Buyer the resignations of all members of the Board of Directors of
the Company requested by the Buyer at least three Business Days prior to the
Closing from their positions as directors of the Company immediately prior to
the Closing.

 

  (b) The Buyer agrees that, for a period of six (6) years from the
Closing Date, neither the Existing Operating Agreement nor any
other comparable organizational instruments of the Companys Subsidiaries
shall be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who on the date
immediately prior to the Closing Date are or were directors, officers, agents
or employees of the Company, any of their respective Subsidiaries or otherwise
entitled to indemnification, advancement of expenses or exculpation pursuant
to the Existing Operating Agreement or any other comparable organizational
instrument of the Companys Subsidiaries (each a " _Director and/or Officer
Indemnified Party_ ").

 

  (c) Without limiting any additional rights that any Person may
have under the Existing Operating Agreement or any other
comparable organizational instrument of the Companys Subsidiaries or any
other Contract, but without duplication thereof, from the Effective Time
through the sixth anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs,
the Buyer shall, or shall cause the Surviving LLC to, indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Director and/or Officer Indemnified Parties from and against
any and all losses, liabilities or damages and reasonable attorneys fees,
court costs and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to (i) the fact
that the Director and/or Officer Indemnified Party is or was an officer,
director, employee, fiduciary or agent, at or prior to the Effective Time, of
the Company, or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) the Director and/or  

 58

 

 Officer Indemnified Partys service, at or prior to the Effective Time, at
the request of, or to represent the interests of, the Company as a director,
officer, partner, member, trustee, fiduciary, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, trust,
employee benefit plan or other enterprise including any charitable or not-for-
profit public service organization or trade association or (iii) matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including this
Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated hereby), whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law. In the event of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, in addition to any rights provided
in the Surviving LLCs organizational instruments, (x) subject to applicable
Law, each Director and/or Officer Indemnified Party will be entitled to
advancement of reasonable expenses (including attorneys fees and
disbursements) incurred in the defense of any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation from the Buyer or the Surviving LLC within 10 Business Days
of receipt by the Buyer or the Surviving LLC from the Director and/or Officer
Indemnified Party of a request therefor; provided that any Person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent
required by applicable Law, to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification and (y) neither
the Buyer nor the Surviving LLC shall settle, compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment in any proceeding or threatened action, suit,
proceeding, investigation or claim (and in which indemnification could be
sought by such Director and/or Officer Indemnified Party hereunder) unless
such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release
of such Director and/or Officer Indemnified Party from all liability arising
out of such action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim or such Director
and/or Officer Indemnified Party otherwise consents.

 

  (d) The Buyer agrees that, for a period of six (6) years from the
Closing Date, (i) the Buyer shall, or shall cause the Surviving LLC
to, obtain extended reporting or tail coverage on, obtain a substitute
directors and officers liability insurance policy for, or continue to
maintain, the directors and officers liability insurance policy maintained
by the Company as of the date hereof for the benefit of those persons who are
covered by such policy immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) the Buyer
shall continue to maintain the directors and officers liability insurance
policy maintained by the Buyer as of the date hereof for the benefit of those
persons who are covered by such policy immediately prior to the Closing, in
each case, on terms and conditions that are, in the aggregate, no less
favorable to the insured with respect to claims arising from acts or
omissions arising prior to and including the Closing than are currently in
effect; _provided_ , that such extended reporting or tail coverage or
substitute or existing policy can be obtained and maintained on commercially
reasonable terms and at a cost to the Company or the Buyer, as applicable, not
greater than 200 percent of the aggregate annual premium for the directors
and officers liability insurance policy maintained by the Company or the
Buyer, as applicable, on the date hereof; _provided_ , _further_ , that
if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the
Buyer shall be obligated to obtain policies with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount.  

 59

 

  (e) The Buyer agrees that, if the Surviving LLC merges into,
consolidates with, is converted into or transfers all or substantially all of
its assets to another Person, then and in each such case, the Buyer shall
make proper provision so that the surviving or resulting Person or the
transferee in such transaction (i) provides rights to indemnification and
advancement of expenses to the Director and/or Officer Indemnified Parties on
terms not materially less favorable to the Director and/or Officer Indemnified
Parties than those contained in the Existing Operating Agreement and (ii)
assumes the obligations of the Buyer and the Surviving LLC under this Section
6.13.

 

  (f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at
or after the Effective Time) is made against any Director and/or Officer
Indemnified Party on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
the provisions of this Section 6.13 shall continue in effect until the final
disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

 

  6.14 _Release_. Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer and the
Surviving LLC, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates and
each of their respective successors and assigns (each, a " _Releasor_ "),
hereby releases, acquits and forever discharges, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, each of the Members, managers and each of their
respective past or present officers, directors, employees, stockholders,
partners, members, managers and each of their successors and assigns (each, a
" _Releasee_ ") of, from and against any and all actions, causes of action,
claims, demands, damages, judgments, debts, dues and suits of every kind,

assigns ever had, now has or may have with respect to any acts or omissions
prior to the Closing Date of any such Releasee with respect to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, other than for fraud, bad faith or willful
misconduct which shall not be released pursuant to this Section 6.14. Each
Releasor agrees not to assert any claim covered by this Section 6.14 against
any Releasee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Releasor retains, and does
not release, its rights and interests under the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

  6.15 _Tax Matters_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, the parties hereto agree and acknowledge that (a) Triarc Companies,

taxable years of the Company that end on or before the Closing Date, the Tax
Matters Partner (as such term is defined in the Existing Operating Agreement)
of the Company and shall continue to have, with respect to such periods, all
the rights, obligations and authority granted to it or him, as applicable, as
Tax Matters Partner pursuant to Section 5.5 of the Existing
Operating Agreement, (b) the Sellers Representative shall prepare and file
or cause to be prepared and filed all Tax Returns (including IRS Form 1065 and

(taking into account any applicable extensions), and no such Tax Return or
amended Tax Return shall be filed without the prior written consent of
the Sellers Representative (which shall not be unreasonably withheld), (d)
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the parties shall treat the Merger as a
fully taxable sale of Membership Interests by the holders thereof and a
purchase of Membership Interests by the owners of Buyer Sub, file all Tax
Returns in a manner consistent with such treatment and take no position
contrary thereto unless required to do so by a change in applicable Tax Laws
or a good faith resolution of a Tax contest, and (e) any and all Tax
allocation or Tax sharing agreements between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any other Person, on the other hand, shall
be terminated as of the Closing Date and, from and after the Closing
Date, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be obligated to
make any payment pursuant to any such agreement for any past or future period.

 

  6.16 _Intentionally Omitted_.

 

  6.17 _REIT Qualification Opinion_. The Buyer shall cause an officer of
the Buyer (on behalf of the Buyer) to make such representations and
warranties as may be reasonably requested by Hunton and Williams LLP as a
condition to the issuance of the opinion referred to in Section 8.9.

 

  6.18 _Modification of Existing Restrictions on Transfer and Ownership
of Shares_. The Buyer, acting through its Board of Directors, shall take all
actions necessary or desirable to exempt, pursuant to the Buyers Charter, the
Members that held issued and outstanding Membership Interests as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, their respective Affiliates and the
successive transferees of any of the foregoing from the "Stock Ownership
Limit" contained in the Buyers Charter to the extent necessary to allow such
Members, their respective Affiliates and the successive transferees of any of
the foregoing to own the Buyer Preferred Stock and the Buyer Common Stock
issued upon the Conversion and/or options with respect thereto (i) issued to
such Members pursuant to the Merger or the Conversion, (ii) distributed
to such Members pursuant to Section 6.21, (iii) owned (or deemed owned
pursuant to the Buyers Charter) by such Members immediately prior to the
Effective Time, (iv) issued by the Buyer to any of such Members, their
respective Affiliates and the successive transferees of any of the foregoing
pursuant to options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time or (v)
otherwise issued by the Buyer or any of its Affiliates to any director,
officer or employee of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Board of Directors of the Buyer (x) shall grant such
waivers only to the extent it receives such representations, covenants, and
undertakings from such Members and their respective Affiliates and the
permitted successive transferees of any of the foregoing as the Board of
Directors of the Buyer reasonably deems appropriate and the Board
of Directors of the Buyer is advised by Hunton and Williams LLP or other
nationally recognized REIT tax counsel that granting such waivers will not
jeopardize the Buyers qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes
and (y) shall not be required to reduce the percentage ownership limit
applicable under the "Stock Ownership Limit" in the Buyers Charter in
connection with granting the waivers contemplated by this Section 6.18.  

 61

 

  6.19 _No Shop_. The Company and the Sellers Representative shall not,
and shall not permit any of the Affiliates, directors, officers, employees,
representatives or agents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Representatives_ ") to, directly or indirectly, (i)
discuss, negotiate, undertake, initiate, authorize, recommend, propose or
enter into, either as the proposed surviving, merged or acquired corporation,
any transaction involving a merger, consolidation, business combination
or disposition of any material amount of assets or any capital stock or other
equity interests of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (an " _Acquisition Transaction_
"), (ii) solicit or initiate discussions, negotiations or submissions of
proposals or offers in respect of an Acquisition Transaction, (iii) furnish or
cause to be furnished, to any Person, any information concerning the
business, operations, properties or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with an Acquisition Transaction or (iv) discuss,
negotiate, undertake, initiate, authorize, recommend, propose or enter into
any other transaction that could reasonably interfere with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company shall (and shall cause its
Representatives to) immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other than Buyer)
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Transaction. The Company
agrees not to release any third party from the confidentiality and standstill
provisions of any agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party.

 

  6.20 _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation_.

 

  (a) For a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on, (x)
in the case of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) below, the second anniversary
of the Closing Date and (y) in the case of clause (iv) below, the third
anniversary of the Closing Date, (the " _Restricted Period_ "), the Sellers
Representative shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (collectively, "
_Restricted Persons_ ") not to, directly or indirectly:

 

  (i) own, manage, operate, control or participate in the ownership,
management, operation or control of, or render services to, any
business, whether in corporate, proprietorship or partnership form or
otherwise, that competes with the business of, or provides services similar to
the services provided by, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (a "
_Restricted Business_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the restrictions
contained in this Section 6.20(a)(i) shall not restrict the acquisition by
the Sellers Representative or any of its Subsidiaries, directly or
indirectly, of less than 5% of the outstanding capital stock of any publicly
traded company engaged in a Restricted Business;

 

  (ii) take any action with the intention of diverting from the
Company or any controlled Affiliate of the Company any funds or
investment accounts with respect to which the Company or any controlled
Affiliate of the Company is providing Investment Management Services;

 

  (iii) solicit or attempt to solicit any Person to cease doing
business with the Company who, to the knowledge (whether actual knowledge
or knowledge that such Restricted Person should have possessed under  

 62

 

 the circumstances) of such Restricted Person, is or has been a customer,
supplier, licensor, licensee or other business relation of the Company at any
time (A) up to the date hereof or (B) during the applicable Restricted
Period; or

 

  (iv) induce, hire, employ, attempt to hire or employ or solicit any

employment (excluding for all purposes of this Section 6.20(a)(iv),
secretaries, drivers and persons holding similar positions).

 

  (b) The covenants and undertakings contained in this Section 6.20
relate to matters which are of a special, unique and extraordinary
character and a violation of any of the terms of this Section 6.20 will cause
irreparable injury to the Buyer, the amount of which will be impossible to
estimate or determine and which cannot be adequately compensated. Accordingly,
the remedy at law for any breach of this Section 6.20 will be inadequate.
Therefore, the Buyer will be entitled to an injunction, restraining order or
other equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction in the event
of any breach of this Section 6.20 without the necessity of proving actual
damages or posting any bond whatsoever. The rights and remedies provided by
this Section 6.20 are cumulative and in addition to any other rights and
remedies which the Buyer may have hereunder or at law or in equity. 

 

  (c) The parties hereto agree that, if any court of competent
jurisdiction in a final nonappealable judgment determines that a specified
time period, a specified geographical area, a specified business limitation
or any other relevant feature of this Section 6.20 is unreasonable, arbitrary
or against public policy, then a lesser time period, geographical area,
business limitation or other relevant feature which is determined by such
court to be reasonable, not arbitrary and not against public policy may be
enforced against the applicable party.

 

  (d) For the avoidance of doubt, "Restricted Persons" shall not be
deemed to include any Person other than the Sellers Representative and its
Subsidiaries and shall not be deemed to include (by way of illustration and
not limitation) Trian Fund Management, L.P. or any funds and accounts managed
by it, or any other Affiliate of the Sellers Representative that is not a
Subsidiary of the Sellers Representative.

 

  6.21 _Distribution and Vesting of Buyer Common Stock_. The Company
shall distribute, immediately prior to the Effective Time, to each Member
that holds issued and outstanding Membership Interests at such time, in
accordance with such Members Fully Diluted Percentage Interests, all of the
shares of Buyer Common Stock that are held by the Company and its
Subsidiaries at such time (other than any such shares that have been granted
as restricted stock awards to employees of DCM); _provided_ , that no
fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock shall be distributed to any such
Member and each such Members allocable portion of such distribution shall be  

 63

 

 rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Buyer Common Stock.
The Company and the Buyer shall take such actions as are necessary to
accelerate the vesting and transferability of such shares of Buyer Common
Stock so that such shares shall be fully vested and transferable under the
Deerfield Triarc Capital Corp. Stock Incentive Plan and related stock award
agreements as of the time immediately prior to their distribution as provided
in the preceding sentence. 

 

  6.22 _Permissible Activities_. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
Article VI, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed or interpreted to
prevent the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, at any time prior to the close
of business on the date immediately prior to the Closing Date, from (a) paying
or making distributions of cash, subject to the limitation set forth in
Section 6.1(b)(xvi); (b) making, accepting or settling intercompany loans or
advances or prepaying any amounts owing under the Revolving Note, dated
February 2, 2006, by and between DCM and Fifth Third Bank (as
amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time); or (c)
engaging in any other transaction incident to the normal cash management
procedures of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including short-term
investments in time-deposits, certificates of deposit and bankers
acceptances made in the ordinary course of business.

 

  6.23 _Section 16 Matters_. The Board of Directors of the Buyer shall,
prior to the Effective Time, take all such actions as may be necessary or
appropriate pursuant to Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act to exempt under
rule 16b-3 under the 1934 Act the direct or indirect acquisition of shares of
Buyer Preferred Stock and Buyer Common Stock pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement and the terms of the Buyer Preferred Stock by the Persons set forth
on Section 6.23 of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 

  6.24 _SEC Reporting Obligations_.

 

  (a) The Buyer shall prepare and deliver all financial and other
information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries, in such form
and manner and at such times as the Sellers Representative may reasonably
request to enable the Sellers Representative to satisfy its reporting and
other obligations under applicable laws, rules and regulations of the SEC and
the NYSE, including in respect of Triarcs Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ending December 30, 2007 (the " _Triarc 2007 10-K_ ") and Triarcs
Current Report on Form 8-K related to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and any amendments to any of the
foregoing; and, in connection therewith, the Buyer shall, after receiving
reasonable advance notice, provide the Sellers Representatives officers and
employees and its independent auditors with reasonable access to the books and
records of the Company (to the extent that they relate to the period ending on
the Closing Date).

 

  (b) The Buyer shall provide such cooperation as the Sellers
Representative may reasonably request to permit the Sellers Representatives
independent auditors to complete their review of the financial statements
required to be included in their audit of the financial statements required to
be included in the Triarc 2007 10-K.  

 64

 

  (c) The Buyer shall cause such of its employees as the Sellers
Representative shall reasonably request to deliver to the
Sellers Representative certifications, consistent in form and substance with
past practice, and to participate in a pre-filing "certification" meeting with
the officers and employees of Triarc, in connection with the filing of the
Triarc 2007 10-K.

 

  (d) As long as the Sellers Representative is required to report
its investment in the Buyer under the equity method of accounting
in accordance with GAAP, the Buyer shall prepare and deliver all financial
and other information relating to the Buyer and its Subsidiaries, in such form
and manner and at such times as the Sellers Representative may reasonably
request to enable the Sellers Representative to satisfy its reporting and
other obligations under applicable laws, rules and regulations of the SEC and
the New York Stock Exchange. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
upon the reasonable request of the Sellers Representative, the Buyer shall
(i) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its independent auditors
to deliver to the SEC any auditors consent that is required to be included in
any filing with the SEC that includes or incorporates by reference the
financial statements of the Buyer or the Company and (ii) to the extent the
Sellers Representative or any of its Subsidiaries conducts or intends to
conduct an offering of securities (and if the registration statement,
prospectus or offering memorandum for such offering includes or incorporates
by reference the financial statements of the Buyer), use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its independent auditors to deliver a letter
containing statements and information of the type ordinarily included in
accountants "comfort letters" with respect to the financial statements and
financial information relating to the Buyer contained or incorporated by
reference in any such document relating to any such offering, in the case of
each of (i) and (ii) above, within the time period reasonably requested by the
Sellers Representative. In addition, in connection with any SEC filing
required to be made by the Sellers Representative or any of its Subsidiaries
(or any SEC review of such filing), the Buyer shall permit the Sellers
Representative, its officers and employees and its independent auditors to
have reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable
advance notice, to the properties, books and records of the Buyer and its
Subsidiaries solely for the purpose of preparing any such SEC filing or
responding to SEC questions, comments or requests on such SEC filing, and to
cause the Buyer and its representatives to cooperate fully in such preparation
or response.

 

  (e) The Sellers Representative shall reimburse the Buyer for the
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses payable to a third party that the Buyer
incurs in connection with this Section 6.24; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Sellers Representative shall not be obligated to reimburse the Buyer for any
such expenses to the extent that the Buyer would have otherwise incurred such
expenses in connection with satisfying its reporting and other obligations
under applicable laws, rules and regulations of the SEC and the NYSE or
having its independent auditors complete their review or audit of any
financial statements of the Company. The Sellers Representative shall and
shall cause its representatives, to keep confidential all information received
by it under this Section 6.24 until such time as such information is included
in filings made by the Sellers Representative to satisfy its filing and
reporting obligations under applicable law, including the rules and
regulations of the SEC and NYSE.

 SELLERS REPRESENTATIVE

 

  9.1 _Appointment of Sellers  Representative_. Pursuant to the Member
Written Consent, the Sellers Representative (including its successors and
assigns) is appointed, authorized and empowered to be the exclusive proxy,
representative, agent and attorney-in-fact of each of the Members, with full
power of substitution, to give and receive notices and communications, to
take any and all action on behalf of the Members pursuant to this Agreement,
including but not limited to asserting, prosecuting or settling any claim
against the Buyer or Buyer Sub, defending or settling any claim
validly asserted by the Buyer or Buyer Sub, and otherwise to act and execute,
deliver and receive all documents, instruments and consents on behalf of such
Members at any time after the date hereof, in connection with, and that may be
necessary or appropriate to accomplish the intent and implement the
provisions of, this Agreement, and in connection with the activities to be
performed by or on behalf of such Members under this Agreement. By executing
this Agreement, the Sellers Representative accepts such appointment,
authority and power. Notwithstanding anything in this Article IX to the
contrary, the Sellers Representative shall not be authorized in its capacity
as the Sellers  

 70

 

 Representative to take any action that treats a Member in its capacity as
such different from other Members or increases the liability of any Member
without the consent of such Member. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Sellers Representative shall have no authority to act on behalf of the
Members under any agreement or document other than pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement.

 

  9.2 _Authority_. The appointment of the Sellers Representative by each
such Member is coupled with an interest and may not be revoked in whole or in
part (including, upon the death or incapacity of any such Member). Such
appointment shall be binding upon the heirs, executors, administrators,
estates, personal representatives, officers, directors, securityholders,
successors and assigns of each of the Members. With respect to any matter
contemplated by this Article IX, the Members shall be bound by any and all
determinations by or against the Sellers Representative consistent with
the rights and powers granted to the Sellers Representative pursuant to this
Agreement or the terms of any settlement or release to which the Sellers
Representative shall become a party.

 

  9.3 _Limitation of Liability_. The parties hereto understand and agree
that the Sellers Representative is acting solely on behalf of and as agent
for the Members and not in its personal capacity, and in no event shall the
Sellers Representative be personally liable to the Members hereunder except
in the case of bad faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence. The
Sellers Representative shall not be liable for any act done or omitted
hereunder as Sellers Representative unless the Sellers Representative
engaged in bad faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence. Except with
respect to the indemnification obligations of the Sellers Representative in
Article XI which shall solely be the obligation of the Sellers Representative
and not the Members, the Members severally and not jointly agree to
indemnify the Sellers Representative, on a _pro rata_ basis based on the
respective amounts paid to the Members pursuant to Section 3.2(a), for any and
all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever
(including the fees and expenses of counsel to the Sellers Representative),
which may at any time be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the
Sellers Representative in any way relating to or arising out of serving as
Sellers Representative under this Agreement or any documents contemplated by
or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or the enforcement of any of the terms hereof or thereof; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no Member shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the
extent they arise from the Sellers Representatives bad faith, gross
negligence or willful misconduct; _provided_ , _further_ , that Sellers
Representatives sole recourse against the Members under this Agreement shall
be limited to the Sellers Representative Expense Fund. The Sellers
Representative shall be fully justified in refusing to take or to continue to
take any action hereunder unless it shall first be fully indemnified to its
reasonable satisfaction by the Members against any and all liability and
expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take
any such action. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained
elsewhere herein, the Sellers Representative shall not have any duties or
responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, nor shall the
Sellers Representative have or be deemed to have any trustee or fiduciary
relationship with any Member, and no implied covenants, functions,  

 71

 

 responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this
Agreement or otherwise exist against the Sellers Representative.

 

  9.4 _Reliance_. From and after the Effective Time, each of the Buyer
and the Surviving LLC is entitled to deal exclusively with the Sellers
Representative on all matters relating to this Agreement, and agrees to deal
with the Sellers Representative on an exclusive basis. A decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Sellers Representative shall constitute a
decision of all the Members and none of the Company, the Surviving LLC or the
Buyer shall have any liability for any action of, or omission by, the Sellers
Representative in its capacity as such. Such decision, act, consent or
instruction is final, binding and conclusive upon each Member, and no such
Member shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest
the same; provided that such decision, act, consent or instruction was made in
accordance with the terms of this Article IX and otherwise was not the result
of the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Sellers
Representative. The Buyer and the Surviving LLC may rely upon any decision,
act, consent or instruction of the Sellers Representative.

 

  9.5 _Successor to Sellers  Representative_. In the event of the
failure, inability or refusal of Triarc Companies, Inc. (or any successor) to
act as Sellers Representative hereunder, the Members shall promptly fill such
a vacancy by approval of the majority of the Members (assuming the voting
rights of the Members in effect immediately prior to the Merger).

 

  9.6 _Expenses_. The Sellers Representative is authorized by the
Members to incur expenses on behalf of the Members in acting hereunder
(including the reasonable expenses of counsel to the Sellers Representative).
The Members severally and not jointly agree to reimburse the Sellers
Representative on demand for their _pro rata_ share (based on the respective
amounts paid to the Members pursuant to Section 3.2(a)) of all fees, costs and
expenses incurred by or at the direction of the Sellers Representative for
the benefit of the Members hereunder including, for all fees, costs and
expenses incurred by the Sellers Representative pursuant to this Agreement,
the Note and the Registration Rights Agreement. The Sellers Representatives
sole recourse against the Members under this Agreement shall be limited to
the Sellers Representative Expense Fund.

  (i) any and all Losses based upon, attributable to or resulting
from the failure of any representation or warranty of Buyer set forth in

the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance
with, any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. The waiver of
any condition based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on
the performance of or compliance with any such covenant or agreements, will
not affect the right to indemnification or any other remedy based on such
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements.

 

  11.3 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

  (a) In the event that any Legal Proceedings shall be instituted or
that any claim or demand shall be asserted by any Person in respect of
which payment may be sought under Section 11.2 hereof (regardless of the
limitations set forth in Section 11.4) (an " _Indemnification Claim_ "), the
indemnified party shall reasonably and promptly (and in any event within
twenty (20) Business Days or sooner, if the nature of the Indemnification
Claim so requires) cause written notice of the assertion of any
Indemnification Claim of which it has knowledge which is covered by this
indemnity to be forwarded to the indemnifying party. The indemnifying party
shall have the right, at its sole expense, to be represented by counsel of its
choice, and to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with
any Indemnification Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against
hereunder; _provided_ that the indemnifying party shall have acknowledged in
writing to the indemnified party its obligation to assume the defense of any
Indemnification Claim as provided hereunder. If the indemnifying party elects
to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any
Indemnification Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against
hereunder, it shall within twenty (20) Business Days (or sooner, if the nature
of the Indemnification Claim so requires) notify the indemnified party of its
intent to do so. If the indemnifying party elects not to defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Indemnification Claim which
relates to any Losses indemnified against hereunder, fails to notify the
indemnified party of its election as herein provided or fails to acknowledge
in writing its obligation to assume the defense of any Indemnification Claim
as herein provided, the indemnified party may defend against, negotiate,
settle or otherwise deal with such Indemnification Claim. If the indemnified
party defends any Indemnification Claim as provided in this Section 11.3(a),
then the indemnifying party shall reimburse the indemnified party for the
Indemnifiable Expenses of defending such Indemnification Claim upon submission
of periodic bills. If the indemnifying party shall assume the defense of any
Indemnification Claim, the indemnified party may participate, at his or its
own expense, in the defense of such Indemnification Claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such indemnified party shall be  

 76

 

 entitled to participate in any such defense with separate counsel at the
expense of the indemnifying party if (i) so requested by the indemnifying
party to participate or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of counsel to
the indemnified party a conflict or potential conflict exists between the
indemnified party and the indemnifying party that would make such separate
representation advisable; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the indemnifying
party shall not be required to pay for more than one such counsel for all
indemnified parties in connection with any Indemnification Claim. The parties
hereto agree to cooperate fully with each other in connection with the
defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Indemnification Claim.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 11.3 to the contrary, neither the
indemnifying party nor the indemnified party shall, without the written
consent of the other party, settle or compromise any Indemnification Claim or
permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment unless the claimant and
such party provide to such other party an unqualified release from all
liability in respect of the Indemnification Claim. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if a settlement offer solely for money damages is made by the
applicable third party claimant, and the indemnifying party notifies the
indemnified party in writing of the indemnifying partys willingness to
accept the settlement offer and, subject to the applicable limitations of
Section 11.4, pay the amount called for by such offer, and the indemnified
party declines to accept such offer, the indemnified party may continue to
contest such Indemnification Claim, free of any participation by the
indemnifying party, and the amount of any ultimate liability with respect to
such Indemnification Claim that the indemnifying party has an obligation to
pay hereunder shall be limited to the lesser of (A) the amount of the
settlement offer that the indemnified party declined to accept plus the Losses
of the indemnified party relating to such Indemnification Claim through the
date of its rejection of the settlement offer or (B) the aggregate Losses of
the indemnified party with respect to such Indemnification Claim. If the
indemnifying party makes any payment on any Indemnification Claim, the
indemnifying party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all
rights and remedies of the indemnified party to any insurance benefits or
other claims of the indemnified party with respect to such Indemnification
Claim.

 

  (b) After any final judgment or award shall have been rendered by
a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of
the time in which to appeal therefrom, or a settlement shall have been
consummated, or the indemnified party and the indemnifying party shall have
arrived at a mutually binding agreement with respect to an Indemnification
Claim hereunder, the indemnified party shall forward to the indemnifying
party notice of any sums due and owing by the indemnifying party pursuant to
this Agreement with respect to such matter and the indemnifying party shall be
required to pay all of the sums so due and owing to the indemnified party by
wire transfer of immediately available funds within ten (10) Business Days
after the date of such notice.

 

  (c) The failure of the indemnified party to give reasonably prompt
notice of any Indemnification Claim shall not release, waive or
otherwise affect the indemnifying partys obligations with respect thereto
except to the extent that the indemnifying party can demonstrate actual loss
and prejudice as a result of such failure.  

 77

Losses and Indemnifiable Expenses in excess of such amount of Tax, Loss and
Indemnifiable Expenses shall be covered; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Seller Basket shall not apply to Taxes, Losses or Indemnifiable Expenses (I)
resulting from the failure of any representation to be true or correct where
such failure is the result of the Companys fraud or willful misconduct, (II)
resulting from the failure of any representations and warranties set forth in
Sections 4.1, 4.2(a), 4.3, 4.4, 4.5(b), 4.18 (to the extent related to income

  (b) Buyer shall not have any liability under Section 11.2(b)(i)
hereof unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses and
Indemnifiable Expenses to the Company Indemnified Parties determined to arise
thereunder in the aggregate exceeds $1,950,000 (the " _Buyer Basket_ "), in
which case, only the Losses and Indemnifiable Expenses in excess of such
amount of Tax, Loss and Indemnifiable Expenses shall be covered; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Buyer Basket shall not apply to Losses or Indemnifiable
Expenses (I) resulting from the failure of any representation to be true or
correct where such failure is the result of the Buyers fraud or willful
misconduct or (II) resulting from the failure of any representations and
warranties set forth in Sections 5.1, 5.2(a), 5.3, 5.4 and 5.11 hereof to be
true and correct.

 

  (c) The Sellers Representative shall not be required to indemnify

Indemnifiable Expenses above the Sellers Representative Cap. The Buyer shall
not be required to indemnify any Person for an aggregate amount of

  (d) For purposes of calculating Losses hereunder (but not for
purposes of determining whether a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement has occurred), any materiality or material
adverse effect qualifications in the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements shall be ignored.

 

  (e) To the extent that an indemnified party has recovered all or
any portion of its Losses with respect to any matter arising under
one provision of this Agreement, such indemnified party shall not be entitled
to recover such portion of such Losses pursuant to other provisions of this
Agreement.

 

  (f) The Sellers Representative shall not be required to indemnify
any Person for any Taxes or any Losses or Indemnifiable Expenses related to
Taxes in each case to the extent such Taxes are Company Expenses or are
provided for on the unaudited consolidated balance sheets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of  

 78

 

 September 30, 2007 or were incurred in the ordinary course of business since
the Most Recent Balance Sheet Date.

 

  (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, the Buyer shall not have any liability under Section
11.2(b)(i) hereof for any Losses and Indemnifiable Losses determined to arise
thereunder based upon, attributable to or resulting from the failure of any
representation or warranty of the Buyer contained in Article V to be true and
correct to the extent that the failure of any such representation or warranty
to be true and correct arose from DCMs bad faith, willful misconduct, gross
negligence or reckless disregard of its duties under the Management Agreement
prior to the Closing Date.

 

  (h) The Sellers Representative, at its election, shall be
entitled to satisfy its indemnity obligations hereunder by one or more of
the following :(a) delivering one or more Notes owned by it (or portion(s)
thereof) having an outstanding principal amount equal to the amount of the
indemnification payment required to be made by the Sellers Representative
hereunder (the " _Sellers  Representative Indemnification Amount_"),
_provided_ , however that after delivering such Notes, the Sellers
Representative continues to own at least a majority of the Notes that are then
outstanding, (b) delivering shares of Buyer Common Stock owned by it having a
Current Market Price (determined as of the date one day immediately prior
to the date such payment is due) equal to the Sellers Representative
Indemnification Amount, (c) delivering shares of Buyer Preferred Stock owned
by it equal to the Sellers Representative Indemnification Amount, which
shares of Preferred Stock shall be valued at the Current Market Price
(determined as of the date one day immediately prior to the date such payment
is due) of the Common Stock that holders of Buyer Preferred Stock would
receive if the Buyer Preferred Stock was converted into Buyer Common Shares
immediately prior to the relevant determination date, plus accrued and unpaid
dividends thereon and (d) making a cash payment equal to the Sellers
Representative Indemnification Amount. For purposes of this clause (g), "
_Current Market Price_ " means, with respect to a share of Buyer Common Stock
or Buyer Preferred Stock, as applicable, on any date of determination, the
average of the daily Closing Prices of shares of the Buyer Common Stock or
Buyer Preferred Stock, as applicable, for the immediately preceding twenty
(20) days on which the principal securities exchange on which the shares of
Buyer Common Stock or Buyer Preferred Stock are then listed or admitted for
trading, and " _Closing Price_ " means, with respect to any shares of Buyer
Common Stock or Buyer Preferred Stock, as applicable, as of the date of
determination, the closing price per share of a share of Buyer Common Stock or
Buyer Preferred Stock, as applicable, on such date published in The Wall
Street Journal (National Edition) or, if no such closing price on such date
is published in The Wall Street Journal (National Edition), the average of
the closing bid and asked prices on such date, as officially reported on the
principal national securities exchange on which shares of Buyer Common Stock
or Buyer Preferred Stock, as applicable, are then listed or admitted to
trading.

 

  11.5 _Intentionally Omitted_.  

 79

 

  11.6 _Tax Matters_. The parties agree to treat any indemnity payment
made pursuant to this Article XI as an adjustment to the Aggregate Merger
Consideration for all income Tax purposes unless otherwise required by a
change in applicable Tax Laws or a good faith resolution of a Tax contest.

 

  11.7 _Non-Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, no Representative or Affiliate of either party shall have any
personal liability to the other party or any other Person as a result of the
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation of
such first party in this Agreement.

 

  11.8 _Exclusivity of Indemnity_. The indemnification provided in
Section 11.2 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy after the Closing Date
for damages available to the parties to this Agreement for breach of any of
the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement or any
right, claim or action arising from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, other than for fraud and other than for breaches of the
representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Ancillary
Documents. For the avoidance of doubt, the limitations on indemnification and
recovery in this Agreement shall not be applicable to the Ancillary Documents.
The Buyer Indemnified Parties expressly waive, release and agree not to make
any claim against the Sellers Representative or any Member, except for
indemnification claims made against the Sellers Representative pursuant to
Section 11.2, for the recovery of any costs or damages, whether directly or by
way of contribution, or for any other relief whatsoever, under any applicable
Laws, whether now existing or applicable or hereinafter enacted or applicable
(including claims for breach of contract, failure of disclosure, tortious
wrongdoing or violation of environmental or other securities Laws).

Trial_.

 

  (a) Any claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby may be instituted in any Federal court
in the State of New York, and each party agrees not to assert, by way of
motion, as a defense or otherwise, in any such claim, that it is not subject
personally to the jurisdiction of such court, that the claim is brought in an
inconvenient forum, that the venue of the claim is improper or that this
Agreement or the subject matter hereof may not be enforced in or by such
court. Each party further irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of such
court in any such claim.

 

  (b) Any and all service of process and any other notice in any
such claim shall be effective against any party if given personally or
by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or by any other

ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY.

 

  (d) EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO

of any party of any such right, power or privilege, nor any single or partial
exercise of any such right, power or privilege, preclude any further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other such right, power or privilege.

 

  11.13 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and

ANNEX A

 

 DEERFIELD TRIARC CAPITAL CORP.

 

 ARTICLES SUPPLEMENTARY ESTABLISHING AND FIXING THE RIGHTS AND 
 PREFERENCES OF A SERIES OF PREFERRED STOCK

 

  Deerfield Triarc Capital Corp., a Maryland corporation (the "
_Corporation_ "), having its principal office in the State of Maryland
in Baltimore City, Maryland and its principal business office in Rosemont,
Illinois certifies to the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of
Maryland that:

 

  _FIRST_ : Under a power contained in Section 2-208 of the Maryland
General Corporation Law and Article V of the Corporations Charter, the Board
of Directors (the " _Board_ "), by resolutions duly adopted on December 17,
2007, classified 15,000,000 shares of the unclassified preferred stock, par
value $0.001 per share, of the Corporation (" _Preferred Stock_ ") as Series
A Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, with the following preferences,
conversion or rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as
to dividends and other distributions, qualifications and terms and conditions
of redemption. Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein have
the meanings set forth in the Charter.

 

  (1) _Designation and Number_. A series of Preferred Stock of the
Corporation, designated the "Series A Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock"
(the " _Series A Preferred Stock_ "), is hereby established. The par value of
the Series A Preferred Stock is $0.001 per share. The number of shares of
Series A Preferred Stock shall be 15,000,000.

 

  (2) _Rank_. The Series A Preferred Stock will, with respect to dividend
and distribution rights, redemption rights and rights upon liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, rank prior or senior to all
classes or series of common stock of the Corporation and any other class or
series of capital stock of the Corporation.

 

  (3) _Dividends_.

 

  (a) Subject to the provisions of subsection 8(a), Holders of Series A
Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive, when and as authorized by the
Board and declared by the Corporation, out of funds legally available for
payment, cumulative cash dividends as follows:

 

  _(i)_ for the Dividend Period from the original issuance date of the
Series A Preferred Stock through the Dividend Record Date next following the
original issuance date (the " _First Dividend Record Date_ "), an amount
equal to 5% per annum of the Liquidation Preference;

 

  ( _ii)_ for the Dividend Period commencing on the day after the First
Dividend Record Date through the next succeeding Dividend Record Date,
an amount equal to the greater of (A) 5% per annum of the Liquidation
Preference or (B) the Common Stock dividend declared for such Dividend Period;

     

  ( _iii)_ for each succeeding Dividend Period after the Dividend Period
referred to in clause _(ii)_ , an amount equal to the greater of (A) 5% per
annum of the Liquidation Preference, or (B) the Common Stock dividend declared
for such Dividend Period.

 

  (b) Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock, as provided for in
subsection 3(a) shall be cumulative from the original issuance date, whether
or not the Corporation has earnings, whether or not the Corporation has
legally available funds, or whether or not declared by the Board or authorized
or paid by the Corporation. However, no cash dividend shall be payable (but
nevertheless shall continue to accrue) before the earlier to occur of
a Conversion Vote or March 31, 2008. Any dividend payable on the Series A
Preferred Stock for any partial Dividend Period will be computed on the basis
of twelve 30-day months and a 360-day year. Dividends will be payable in
arrears to holders of record as they appear on the records of the Corporation
at the close of business on the applicable Dividend Record Date. No interest
will be paid in respect of any dividend payment or payments on the Series A
Preferred Stock that may be in arrears, nor shall additional dividends be
declared or paid in respect of unpaid dividends.

 

  (c) Except for the payment of the First Dividend which in no event
shall exceed $ 0.50 per share of Common Stock (as adjusted for any stock
splits, stock combinations or similar transaction), unless full cumulative
dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock have been paid or declared and set
apart for payment for all past Dividend Periods, no dividends shall be
declared or paid or set apart for payment with respect to any Junior
Stock, nor shall any Junior Stock be redeemed, purchased or otherwise
acquired (except for purposes of an employee benefit plan) for any
consideration, or any monies be paid to or made available for a sinking fund
for the redemption of any Junior Stock, nor shall any other cash or property
be paid or distributed to or for the benefit of holders of Junior Stock.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation shall not be prohibited from
redeeming, purchasing or otherwise acquiring an amount of Junior Stock or
Series A Preferred Stock if such redemption, purchase or other acquisition is
in the opinion of outside counsel to the Corporation necessary to maintain the
Corporations qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal
income tax purposes (" _REIT_ "); _provided_ that prior to such redemption,
purchase or acquisition of any Junior Stock, the Corporation shall first
offer to each holder of Series A Preferred Stock (on a pro rata basis based on
the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock owned by such holder relative
to all of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock) the opportunity to elect
to have its, his or her Series A Preferred Stock redeemed at an amount equal
to the Redemption Price (as defined in subsection 6(a)) computed as of the
date the Redemption Price is paid.

 

  (d) If, for any taxable year, the Corporation elects to designate as "
_capital gain dividends_ " (as defined in Section 857 of the Internal Revenue
Code) any portion of the dividends (as determined for federal income tax
purposes) paid or made available for the year to holders of all classes of
capital stock, then the portion of the capital gains amount that shall be
allocable to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be the amount that
the total dividends (as determined for federal income tax purposes) paid or
made available to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock for the year
bears to the total

     

 dividends (as determined for federal income tax purposes) paid or made
available for the year to holders of all classes of capital stock. __

 

  (f) The liquidation preference of the outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock will not be added to the liabilities of the Corporation for
the purpose of determining whether under the Maryland General Corporation Law
a dividend or distribution may be made to stockholders of the Corporation
whose preferential rights upon dissolution of the Corporation are junior to
those of holders of Series A Preferred Stock.

 

  (4) _Liquidation Preference_.

 

  (a) Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation, before any payment or distribution shall
be made to or set apart for the holders of any Junior Stock, the holders of
Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive a liquidation preference
payable in cash equal to the greater of (i) $10.00 per share (the "
_Liquidation Preference_ ") or (ii) the per share amount that a holder of one
share of Series A Preferred Stock would have received had the share been
converted into Common Stock immediately prior to the Liquidation Date, plus
in each case an amount equal to all accumulated, accrued and unpaid dividends
(whether or not the Corporation has earnings and whether or not authorized by
the Board or declared by the Corporation) to the Liquidation Date, and such
holders shall not be entitled to any further payment. If upon any liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, cash distributable among the
holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to pay in full the
above described liquidation preference, then the Corporation remaining
assets, or the proceeds thereof, shall be distributed among the holders of
Series A Preferred Stock ratably in the same proportion as the respective
amounts that would be payable on such Series A Preferred Stock if all amounts
payable thereon were paid in full.

 

  (b) Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation,
after (and only after) payment shall have been made in full to the holders of
Series A Preferred Stock of the amount described in subsection 4(a), any other
series or class or classes of Junior Stock shall be entitled to receive any
and all assets remaining to be paid or distributed, and the holders of the
Series A Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to share therein.

 

  (c) Written notice of any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up
of the Corporation, stating the payment date or dates when, and the place or
places where, the amounts distributable in such circumstances shall be
payable, shall be given by first class mail, postage pre-paid, not less than
30 or more than 60 days prior to the payment date stated therein, to each
record holder of Series A Preferred Stock at the respective addresses of such
holders as the same shall appear on the stock transfer records of the
Corporation.

 

  (d) None of a Change of Control, consolidation or merger of the
Corporation with or into another entity, a merger of another entity with
or into the Corporation, a statutory

     

 stock exchange by the Corporation or a sale, lease or conveyance of all or
substantially all of the Corporations property or business shall be
considered a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation.

 

  (e) The liquidation preference of the outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock will not be added to the liabilities of the Corporation for
the purpose of determining whether under the Maryland General Corporation Law
a distribution may be made to stockholders of the Corporation whose
preferential rights upon dissolution of the Corporation are junior to those of
holders of Series A Preferred Stock.

 

  (5) _No Optional Redemption_. Except as provided in subsection 3(c),
shares of Series A Preferred Stock are not redeemable at the option of the
Corporation or the holders thereof.

 

  (6) _Mandatory Redemption by the Corporation_.

 

  (a) _Redempt_ i _on._

 

  (i) The Series A Preferred Stock shall be redeemed in whole and
not part by the Corporation on the earlier to occur of (x) a Change in
Control or (y) December __, 2014 (such date, the " _Redemption Date_ ") at a
cash redemption price per share (the _"Redemption Price")_ equal to the
greater of (A) the Liquidation Preference or (B) the Current Market Price on
the Redemption Date of the Common Stock that the holders of the Series A
Preferred Stock would have received if all shares of Preferred Stock were
converted into Common Stock immediately prior to the Redemption Date, plus in
each case, an amount equal to all accumulated, accrued and unpaid dividends
(whether or not the Corporation has earnings, and whether or not authorized
by the Board or declared by the Corporation) to the Redemption Date.

 

  (ii) The Series A Preferred Stock shall not be subject to any
sinking fund.

 

  (iii) In addition, the Series A Preferred Stock shall be subject to
the provisions of Article VI of the Charter pursuant to which Series
A Preferred Stock owned by a stockholder in excess of the applicable Stock
Ownership Limit, as established and modified by the Board of Directors in
accordance with Section 6.2.8 of the Charter or any successor provision, shall
automatically be transferred to a Trust for the exclusive benefit of a
Charitable Beneficiary, as provided in Article VI of the Charter.

 

  ( _b_ ) _Procedures for Redemption_.

 

  (i) Notice of redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be
mailed to each holder of record of the shares to be redeemed by first
class mail, postage prepaid at such holders address as the same appears on
the stock records of the Corporation. Any notice which was mailed as described
above shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given on the date
mailed whether or not 

     

 the holder receives the notice. In addition to any information required by
law or by the applicable rules of the exchange upon which the Series A
Preferred Stock may be listed or admitted to trading, each notice shall
state: (i) the Redemption Date; (ii) the Redemption Price; and (iii) the
place or places where certificates for such shares of Series A Preferred
Stock are to be surrendered for cash.

 

  (ii) On or after the Redemption Date, each holder of shares of
Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall present and surrender
the certificates representing his shares of Series A Preferred Stock to the
Corporation at the place designated in the notice of redemption and thereupon
the Redemption Price of such shares shall be paid to or on the order of the
person whose name appears on such certificate representing shares of Series A
Preferred Stock as the owner thereof and each surrendered certificate shall be
canceled.

 

  (iii) If notice of redemption has been mailed in accordance with
subsection 6(b)(i) above and if the funds necessary for such redemption
have been set aside by the Corporation in trust for the benefit of the
holders of the Series A Preferred Stock so called for redemption, then from
and after the Redemption Date (unless the Corporation defaults in the payment
of the redemption price, all dividends on the shares of Series A Preferred
Stock called for redemption in such notice shall cease to accumulate and all
rights of the holders thereof, except the right to receive the redemption
price thereof (including all accumulated and unpaid dividends up to the
Redemption Date, whether or not the Corporation has earnings and whether or
not authorized by the Board or declared by the Corporation), shall cease and
terminate and such shares shall not thereafter be transferred (except
with the consent of the Corporation) on the Corporations books, and such
shares shall not be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose whatsoever. At
its election, the Corporation, prior to a Redemption Date, may irrevocably
deposit the Redemption Price (including accumulated and unpaid dividends to
the Dividend Date) of the Series A Preferred Stock so called for redemption in
trust for the holders thereof with a bank or trust company, in which case the
Redemption Notice to holders of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be
redeemed shall (i) state the date of such deposit, (ii) specify the office of
such bank or trust company as the place of payment of the redemption price and
(iii) require such holders to surrender the certificates representing such
shares at such place on or about the date fixed in such redemption notice
(which may not be later than the Redemption Date) against payment of the
Redemption Price (including all accumulated and unpaid dividends to
the Redemption Date). Any interest or other earnings earned on the Redemption
Price (including accumulated and unpaid dividends) deposited with a bank or
trust company shall be paid to the Corporation. Any monies so deposited which
remain unclaimed by the holders of Series A Preferred Stock at the end of two
years after the Redemption Date shall be returned by such bank or trust
company to the Corporation and the holders thereof shall thereafter be
entitled to look to the Corporation for payment of the Redemption Price.

     

  (c) _ Status of Redeemed Shares_. Any shares of Series A
Preferred Stock that shall at any time have been redeemed shall, after such
redemption, have the status of authorized but unclassified and unissued
Preferred Stock, until such shares are once more classified or reclassified as
part of a particular class or series by the Board.

 

  (7) _Voting Rights_.

 

  (a) Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall not have any
voting rights, except as provided by Maryland law and as described below.

 

  (b) If and whenever dividends on any shares of Series A Preferred
Stock shall not have been authorized by the Board and declared and paid in
cash by the Corporation on four or more Dividend Dates, whether or not
consecutive (a " _Preferred Dividend Default_ "), the holders of such
shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to vote as a single
class for the election of a total of two additional directors of the
Corporation (the " _Preferred Stock Directors_ ") who shall each be
elected for one-year terms, subject to subsection 7(c). Such election shall
be held at a special meeting called by an officer of the Corporation within
15 days following the occurrence of the Preferred Dividend Default, unless
such Preferred Dividend Default occurs less than 60 days before the date
fixed for the next annual or special meeting of stockholders, in which case
the vote for such two directors will be held at the earlier of the next
annual or special meeting of the stockholders, and at each subsequent annual
meeting until all dividends accumulated on such shares of Series A Preferred
Stock for the past Dividend Periods and the dividend for the then current
Dividend Period shall have been fully paid or declared or authorized and a
sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside for payment in full. In such
cases, the size of entire Board automatically shall be increased by two
directors. Each Preferred Stock Director shall be elected by a plurality of
the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock. On any matter on
which the holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote (as
expressly provided herein or as may be required by law), including any action
by written consent, each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall have one
vote per share.

 

  The procedures in this subsection 7(b) for the calling of meetings and
the election of directors will, to the extent permitted by law, supersede
anything inconsistent contained in the Charter or Bylaws of the Corporation
and, without limitation to the foregoing, the Bylaws of the Corporation will
not be applicable to the election of directors by holders of Series A
Preferred Stock pursuant to this subsection 7(b). Notwithstanding the
Bylaws of the Corporation, the number of directors constituting the entire
Board will be automatically increased to include the directors to be elected
pursuant to this subsection 7(b).

 

  (c) If and when all accumulated unpaid dividends and the dividend
for the current Dividend Period on the Series A Preferred Stock shall
have been paid in full, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock
shall be divested of the voting rights set forth in Section 7(b) herein
(subject to revesting in the event of each and every Preferred Dividend
Default) and the term of office of each Preferred Stock Director so elected
shall

     

 terminate and the number of directors constituting the Board shall be
reduced accordingly. So long as a Preferred Dividend Default shall continue,
any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director may be filled by the
vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred
Stock. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time with or without
cause by the vote of, and shall not be removed otherwise than by the vote of,
the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock.

 

  (d) The affirmative vote or consent of at least 80% of the votes
entitled to be cast by the holders of the outstanding shares of Series
A Preferred Stock, voting as a single class, in addition to any other vote
required by the Charter or Maryland law, will be required to: (i) authorize
the creation of, or the issuance of any shares of any class of capital stock
that is senior to the Series A Preferred Stock as to dividends, redemption or
upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, (ii)
authorize the creation of, or the issuance of any shares of any class of
capital stock that is on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock as to
dividends, redemption or upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
the Corporation, or (iii) amend, alter or repeal any provision of, or add any
provision to, the Charter, including the articles supplementary establishing
the Series A Preferred Stock, whether by merger, consolidation or other
business combination or otherwise if such other action would materially
adversely affect the powers, rights or preferences of the holders of the
Series A Preferred Stock.

 

  (e) The foregoing voting provisions shall not apply if, at or
prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would
otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed or called for redemption in
accordance of paragraph 6 upon proper notice and sufficient funds shall have
been deposited in trust to effect such redemption.

 

  (8) _Mandatory Conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock_.

 

  (a) On the Conversion Date, each share of Series A Preferred Stock
shall be automatically converted, without any action by the holders
thereof or the Corporation, into that number of whole shares of Common Stock
determined by dividing the Liquidation Preference by the then effective
Conversion Price. In addition, in connection with the conversion of the Series
A Preferred Stock, upon a Conversion Vote the holders of Series A Preferred
Stock will also receive, on the next Dividend Payment Date occurring
immediately after the Conversion Date, (x) all accrued and unpaid dividends,
whether or not authorized by the Board or declared by the Corporation, plus,
(y) with respect to the Dividend Period in which the Conversion Date occurs,
the amount if any by which (i) 5% per annum of the Liquidation Preference
accrued from the start of the Dividend Period through the Conversion
Date, determined on a daily basis, exceeds (ii) the Common Stock dividend
declared for such Dividend Period; provided, however, that if the Conversion
Date occurs after the Dividend Record Date for the Dividend Period in which
the Conversion Date occurs and prior to the Dividend Payment Date for such
dividend, then in addition to the dividend in clause (y) above and
notwithstanding that the holders of Series A Preferred Stock were not holders
of record on the Dividend Payment

     

 Date, each holder of each share of Preferred Stock being converted shall
also be entitled to a cash payment equal to the dividend on the Common Stock
that such holder would have received had the Conversion Date
occurred immediately prior to such Dividend Record Date.

 

  (b) Upon the receipt of a Conversion Vote, the Corporation shall
give notice by mail to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock
promptly after the Conversion Vote advising holders of the Series A Preferred
Stock that the conversion has automatically occurred as the result of the
Conversion Vote and that they may surrender their certificates representing
the Series A Preferred Stock for certificates representing the Common Stock.
The notice to holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall state, as appropriate
that: (i) the Corporation obtained the Conversion Vote; (ii) accordingly, the
Series A Preferred Stock has automatically converted into Common Stock on the
date of the Conversion Vote; (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock to be
issued for each share of Series A Preferred Stock; and (iv) that dividends on
the Series A Preferred Stock ceased to accrue on the immediately preceding
Dividend Date.

 

  (c) Upon receipt of the Conversion Vote, all rights of holders of
the Series A Preferred Stock will terminate except the right to receive
the whole number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof
and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Series A Preferred Stock and the
dividends described in subsection (a).

 

  (d) If the Conversion Vote is not obtained at the first special
meeting of stockholders held for the purposes of obtaining the
Conversion Vote, then the holders of at least 20% of the outstanding Series A
Preferred Stock shall have the right, exercisable once only and then only in
conjunction with the annual meeting of stockholders, to require the
Corporation to include on the agenda for any subsequent annual meeting of
stockholders, that the holders of the Corporations outstanding voting
securities approve the conversion at a subsequent annual meeting by the
Conversion Vote. The request by the holders of such Series A Preferred Stock
shall be furnished in writing to the Corporation, attention Corporate
Secretary, at least 45 days before the anniversary of the prior years annual
meeting of stockholders. __ If the Conversion Vote is not obtained at the
meetings described in this paragraph, then the Series A Preferred Stock shall
thereafter not be convertible under any circumstances.

 

  (e) The Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be
adjusted from time to time as follows:

 

  (i) If the Corporation shall at any time or from time to time (A)
make a payment of dividends or distributions to holders of any class
of Common Stock of the Corporation in Common Stock, (B) subdivide its
outstanding Common Stock into a greater number of shares, (C) combine its
outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares or (D) issue any
shares of Common Stock by reclassification of its Common Stock, the
Conversion Price shall be adjusted so that the holder of any shares of Series
A Preferred Stock thereafter surrendered for conversion shall be entitled to
receive the number of shares of Common Stock

     

 that such holder would have owned or have been entitled to receive after the
happening of any of the events described above had such shares been converted
immediately prior to the record date in the case of a dividend
or distribution or the effective date in the case of a subdivision,
combination or reclassification. An adjustment made pursuant to this
subsection (e)(i) shall become effective immediately after the opening of
business on the business day next following the record date in the case of a
distribution and shall become effective immediately after the opening of
business on the business day next following the effective date in the case of
a subdivision, combination or reclassification. Such adjustment(s) shall be
made successively whenever any of the events listed above shall occur.

 

  (ii) If the Corporation shall at any time or from time to time
issue rights, options or warrants to all holders of Common Stock entitling
them to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock (or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock) at a price per share less
than the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on the record date for
the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights, options or
warrants, the then existing Conversion Price shall be adjusted to equal the
price determined by multiplying (A) the Conversion Price in effect immediately
prior to the opening of business on the business day next following the date
fixed for such determination by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which shall
be the sum of (I) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the
close of business on the date fixed for such determination and (II) the
number of shares of Common Stock that could be purchased at the Current Market
Price on the date fixed for such determination with the aggregate proceeds to
the Corporation from the exercise of such rights, options or warrants, and
the denominator of which shall be the sum of (x) the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding on the close of business on the date fixed for such
determination and (y) the number of additional shares of Common Stock offered,
for subscription or purchase pursuant to such rights, options or warrants.
Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such rights, options
or warrants are issued, and shall become effective immediately after the
opening of business on the business day next following the record date for
any such rights, options, or warrants issued. In determining whether any
rights, options or warrants entitle the holders of shares of Common Stock to
subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at less than the Current
Market Price, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by
the Corporation upon issuance and upon exercise of such rights, options or
warrants, the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to
be determined by the Board of Directors in good faith. Any adjustment(s) made
pursuant to this subsection (ii) shall become effective immediately after the
opening of business on the business day next following such record date. Such
adjustment(s) shall be made successively whenever any of the events listed
above shall occur.

 

  (iii) If the Corporation shall distribute to all holders of its
Common Stock any shares of capital stock of the Corporation (other than
Common Stock)

     

 or evidence of its indebtedness or assets or other property (but excluding
cash dividends or rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any of its
securities) (any of the foregoing being hereinafter in this subsection
(iv) called the "Securities"), therein each case the then existing Conversion
Price shall be adjusted so that it shall equal the price determined by
multiplying (A) the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the close
of business on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled
to receive such distribution by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which shall
be the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on the record date
described in the immediately following paragraph less the then Fair Market
Value of the Securities so distributed applicable to one share of Common
Stock, and the denominator of which shall be the Current Market Price per
share of Common Stock on the record date described in the immediately
following paragraph.

 

  Such adjustment shall become effective immediately at the opening of
business on the business day next following the record date for the
determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution. For the
purposes of this subsection (iii), the distribution of Securities which are
distributed not only to the holders of the Common Stock on the date fixed for
the determination of stockholders entitled to such distribution of
such Securities, but also are distributed with each share of Common Stock
delivered to a person converting a share of Series A Preferred Stock after
such determination date, shall not require an adjustment of the Conversion
Price pursuant to this subsection (iii); provided that on the date, if any,
on which a person converting a share of Series A Preferred Stock would no
longer be entitled to receive such Securities with a share of Common Stock
(other than as a result of the termination of all such Securities), a
distribution of such Securities shall be deemed to have occurred, and the
Conversion Price shall be adjusted as provided in this subsection (iii) (and
such date shall be deemed to be "the date fixed for the determination of the
stockholders entitled to receive such distribution" and "the record date"
within the meaning of the two preceding sentences). Such adjustment(s) shall
be made successively whenever any of the events listed above shall occur. 

 

  (iv) No adjustment in the Conversion Price shall be required unless
such adjustment would require a cumulative increase or decrease of at
least 1% in such price; provided, however, that any adjustments that by
reason of this subsection (iv) are not required to be made shall be carried
forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment until made; and
provided, further, that any adjustment shall be required and made in
accordance with the provisions of this subparagraph (8) (other than this
subsection (iv)) not later than such time as may be required in order to
preserve the tax-free nature of a distribution to the holders of shares of
Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subparagraph (8),
the Corporation shall not be required to make any adjustment to the Conversion
Price (A) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or
rights to purchase shares of Common Stock at the Current Market Price

     

 pursuant to any present or future employee, director or employee benefit
plan or employee program of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries that
has been approved by the Board; (B) upon a change in the par value of the
shares of Common Stock of the Corporation; or (C) for accumulated, declared
and unpaid dividends on shares of Common Stock of the Corporation prior to the
original date of issuance. All calculations under this subparagraph (8) shall
be made to the nearest cent (with $.005 being rounded upward) or to the
nearest one-tenth of a share (with .05 of a share being rounded upward), as
the case may be.

 

  (f) If the Corporation shall be a party to any transaction
(including without limitation a merger, consolidation, statutory share
exchange, tender offer for all or substantially all of the shares of Common
Stock, sale of all or substantially all of the Corporations assets or
recapitalization of the Common Stock and excluding any transaction as to which
subsection (e)(i) applies (each of the foregoing being referred to herein as
a " _Transaction_ "), in each case as a result of which shares of Common Stock
shall be converted into the right to receive shares, stock, securities or
other property (including cash or any combination thereof), each share of
Series A Preferred Stock which is not converted into the right to receive
shares, stock, securities or other property in connection with such
Transaction shall thereafter be convertible into the kind and amount of
shares, stock, securities and other property receivable (including cash or any
combination thereof) upon the consummation of such Transaction by a holder of
that number of shares of Common Stock or fraction thereof into which one
share of Series A Preferred Stock was convertible immediately prior to such
Transaction, assuming such holder of Common Stock (i) is not a person with
which the Corporation consolidated or into which the Corporation merged or
which merged into the Corporation or to which such sale or transfer was made,
as the case may be (a " _Constituent Person_ "), or an affiliate of a
Constituent Person and (ii) failed to exercise his or her rights of election,
if any, as to the kind or amount of such, stock, securities and other property
(including cash) receivable upon consummation of such Transaction (each a "
_Non-Electing Share_ ") (provided that if the kind or amount of shares, stock,
securities and other property (including cash) receivable upon consummation of
such Transaction by each Non-Electing Share is not the same for each Non-
Electing Share, then the kind and amount of shares, stock, securities and
other property (including cash) receivable upon consummation of such
Transaction for each Non-Electing Share shall be deemed to be the kind
and highest amount so receivable per share by any Non-Electing Shares). The
Corporation shall not be a party to any Transaction unless the terms of such
Transaction are consistent with the provisions of this subsection (f), and it
shall not consent or agree to the occurrence of any Transaction until the
Corporation has entered into an agreement with the successor or purchasing
entity, as the case may be, for the benefit of the holders of the Series A
Preferred Stock, that will require such successor or purchasing entity, as
the case may be, to make provision in its certificate or articles of
incorporation or other constituent documents to the end that the provisions of
this subsection (f) shall thereafter correspondingly be made applicable as
nearly as may reasonably be, in relation to any shares of stock or other
securities or property thereafter deliverable upon conversion of

     

 the Series A Preferred Stock. The provisions of this subsection (f) shall
similarly apply to successive Transactions.

 

  (g) If:

 

  (i) the Corporation shall declare a distribution on the shares of
Common Stock other than in cash out of the total equity applicable to shares
of Common Stock, less the amount of stated capital attributable to the Common
Stock, determined on the basis of the most recent annual or quarterly
consolidated balance sheets of the Corporation and its consolidated
subsidiaries available at the time of the declaration of the distribution; or

 

  (ii) the Corporation shall authorize the granting to the holders of the
Common Stock of rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any shares of
any class or any other rights or warrants; or

 

  (iii) there shall be any reclassifications of the Common Stock (other
than an event to which subsection (e)(i) of this subparagraph (8) applied) or
any consolidation or merger to which the Corporation is a party and for
which approval of any stockholders of the Corporation is required, or a
statutory share exchange involving the conversion or exchange of Common Stock
into securities or other property, or a self tender offer by the Corporation
for all or substantially all of its outstanding Common Stock, or the sale or
transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation as an
entity and for which approval of any stockholder of the Corporation is
required; or

 

  (iv) there shall occur the voluntary or involuntary liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation;

 

 then the Corporation shall cause to be filed with the transfer agent for the
Series A Preferred Stock and shall cause to be mailed to the holders of the
Series A Preferred Stock at their addresses as shown on the share records
of the Corporation, as promptly as possible, but at least 15 days prior to
the applicable date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (A) the record
date as of which the holders of Common Stock of record to be entitled to such
distribution or grant of rights or warrants are to be determined, provided,
however, that no such notification need be made in respect of a record date
for a distribution or grant of rights unless the corresponding adjustment in
the Conversion Price would be an increase or decrease of at least 1%, or (B)
the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, statutory
share exchange, sale, transfer, liquidation, dissolution or winding up is
expected to become effective, and the date as of which it is expected that
holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their Common
Stock for securities or other property, if any, deliverable upon such
reclassification, consolidation, merger, statutory share exchange, sale,
transfer, liquidation, dissolution or winding up. Failure to give or receive
such notice or any defect therein shall not affect the legality or validity of
the proceedings described in this subparagraph (8).

     

  (h) Whenever the Conversion Price is adjusted as herein provided,
the Corporation shall promptly file with the transfer agent for the Series
A Preferred Stock an officers certificate setting forth the Conversion Price
after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts
requiring such adjustment. Promptly after delivery of such certificate, the
Corporation shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of the Conversion
Price, setting forth the adjusted Conversion Price and the effective date on
which such adjustment becomes effective and shall mail such notice of such
adjustment of the Conversion Price to the holder of each share of Series A
Preferred Stock at such holders last address as shown on the share records of
the Corporation.

 

  (i) In any case in which subsection (e) of this subparagraph (8)
provides that an adjustment shall become effective on the date next
following the record date for an event, the Corporation may defer until the
occurrence of such event (I) issuing to the holder of any shares of Series A
Preferred Stock converted after such record date and before the occurrence of
such event the additional Common Shares issuable upon such conversion by
reason of the adjustment required by such event over and above the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion before giving effect to such
adjustment and (II) fractionalizing any shares of Series A Preferred Stock
and/or paying to such holder any amount of cash in lieu of any fraction.

 

  (j) There shall be no adjustment of the Conversion Price in case
of the issuance of any shares of Common Stock of the Corporation in
a reorganization, acquisition or other similar transaction except as
specifically set forth in this subparagraph (8). If any action or transaction
would require adjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to more than one
subsection of this subparagraph (8), only one adjustment shall be made, and
such adjustment shall be the amount of adjustment that has the highest
absolute value.

 

  (k) If the Corporation shall take any action affecting the Common
Stock, other than an action described in this subparagraph (8), that in
the opinion of the Board would materially and adversely affect the rights of
the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Conversion Price for the
Series A Preferred Stock may be adjusted, to the extent permitted by law, in
such manner, if any, and at such time, as the Board, in its sole discretion,
may determine to be equitable in the circumstances.

 

  (l) The Corporation covenants that it will at all times reserve
and keep available, free from preemptive rights, out of the aggregate of
its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock, for the purpose of
effecting conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, the full number of
shares of Common Stock deliverable upon the conversion of all outstanding
Series A Preferred Stock not theretofore converted in accordance with the
terms set forth herein. For purposes of this subsection (l), the number of
shares of Common Stock that shall be deliverable upon the conversion of all
outstanding Series A Preferred Stock shall be computed as if at the time of
computation all such outstanding shares were held by a single holder.

     

  The Corporation covenants that any shares of Common Stock issued upon
conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable. Before taking any action that would cause an
adjustment reducing the Conversion Price below the then par value of the
Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, the
Corporation will take any action that, in the opinion of its counsel, may be
necessary in order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue fully
paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion
Price.

 

  (m) The Corporation will pay any and all documentary stamp or similar
issue or transfer taxes payable in respect of the issue or delivery of shares
of Common Stock or other securities or property on conversion of the Series A
Preferred Stock pursuant hereto; provided, however, that the Corporation shall
not be required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any
transfer involved in the issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock or other
securities or property in a name other than that of the holder of the Series A
Preferred Stock to be converted, and no such issue or delivery shall be made
unless and until the person requesting such issue or delivery has paid to the
Corporation the amount of any such tax or has established, to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax has been paid.

 

  In addition to the foregoing adjustments, the Corporation shall be
entitled to make such reductions in the Conversion Price, in addition to
those required herein, as it in its discretion considers to be advisable in
order that any share distributions, subdivisions of shares, reclassification
or combination of shares, distribution of rights, options, warrants to
purchase shares or securities, or a distribution of other assets (other than
cash distributions) will not be taxable or, if that is not possible, to
diminish any income taxes that are otherwise payable because of such event.

 

  (9) _Restrictions on Transfer, Acquisition and Redemption of Shares_.
The Series A Preferred Stock is governed by and issued subject to all of the
limitations, terms and conditions of the Corporations Charter, including but
not limited to the terms and conditions (including exceptions and exemptions)
of Article VI of the Charter. The foregoing sentence shall not be construed to
limit the applicability of any other term or provision of the Charter to the
Series A Preferred Stock. Except as provided by applicable law and the
Charter, there shall be no restriction on the ability of a holder of Series A
Preferred Stock to transfer such shares. In addition to the legend
contemplated by Article VI, Section 2.9 of the Charter, each certificate for
Series A Preferred Stock shall bear substantially the following legend:

 

  "The Corporation will furnish to any stockholder on request and without
charge a full statement of the designations and any preferences, conversion
and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends,
qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption of the stock of each
class which the Corporation is authorized to issue, to the extent they have
been set, and of the authority of the Board of Directors to set the relative
rights and preferences of a subsequent series of a preferred or special class

the conditions and in reliance upon the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth herein, each Purchaser agrees to receive,
as full and complete payment and satisfaction of the Aggregate Note
Consideration to which such Purchaser is entitled pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, one or more Notes from the Issuer in an aggregate principal amount
set forth opposite the name of such Purchaser on _Schedule A_. 

 

  2.02. Redemptions and Repurchase of Notes.

 

  (a) _Optional Redemptions of Notes_.

 

 

 (i) The  Issuer may, from time to time on any Business Day, voluntarily redeem the  Notes at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount  of such Notes _plus_ accrued  and unpaid interest thereon, in whole or in part without premium or penalty.  Any such voluntary redemption shall be effected in accordance with _Section  2.02(a)(ii)_. 

 

 (ii) The  Issuer shall give irrevocable notice of any optional redemption of the  Notes pursuant to _Section 2.02(a)(i)_ to  each Holder not later than 1:00 P.M. two (2) Business Days prior to the  date on which such redemption is to take place. Each such notice shall  specify (A) the applicable redemption date (which shall be a Business Day),  (B) the amount of such redemption, which shall be in an aggregate principal  amount of $250,000 or a whole multiple of $50,000 in excess thereof  and shall be made on a pro rata basis, based on the Total Outstandings  at such time. If such notice is given by the Issuer, the Issuer shall make  such redemption and the aggregate principal amount specified in such notice  shall be due and payable on the date specified therein. Each such redemption  shall be applied to the Notes of the Holders in accordance with their Pro  Rata Share. Upon receipt by any Holder of its Pro Rata Share of the amount  of any such redemption, such Holder shall deliver to the Issuer for cancellation  an aggregate principal amount of Notes equal to not less than the amount  of Notes of such Holder so redeemed. In the event the aggregate principal  amount of such Notes delivered to the Issuer exceeds the aggregate principal  amount of the Notes so redeemed, the Issuer shall deliver to the applicable  Holder a new Note or Notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to the  amount of such excess.

 (ii) _Mandatory  Offer to Repurchase Notes Upon Debt Issuance_.

 (iii) _Mandatory  Offer to Repurchase Notes Upon Equity Issuance_.  In the event that the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries shall have received  Net Cash Proceeds from any Equity Issuance, the Issuer shall, in each  case subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, not later than  ten (10) Business Days after receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds, make  a Mandatory Redemption Offer, on a pro rata basis based on the Total  Outstandings at such time, to repurchase each Holders Notes using  twenty-five percent (25%) of the Net Cash Proceeds of such Equity Issuance  at an offer price equal to 100% of the aggregate outstanding principal  amount thereof _plus_ accrued  and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the date of such repurchase. 

 

 (iv) _Mandatory  Offer to Repurchase Notes Upon Exercise of Warrants, Rights or Options  to Acquire Capital Stock_.

repurchase of Notes pursuant to this  clause (iv) do not exceed $100,000 per
Exercise Event (or a related  series of Exercise Events).

 

 (v) _Offer  and Repurchase Mechanics_. Subject  to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, within ten (10) Business  Days following the occurrence of an Asset Sale, Event of Loss, Debt Issuance,  Equity Issuance or Exercise Event referred to in clauses (i), (ii), (iii)  or (iv) above requiring a Mandatory Redemption Offer, the Issuer shall  deliver to each Holder a written notice stating (1) that a Mandatory  Redemption Notice is being made pursuant to this _Section  2.02(b)_ and that Notes tendered  will be accepted for payment up to an aggregate amount equal to, (x)  in the case of clause (i) above, one-hundred percent (100%) of the Net  Cash Proceeds of the applicable Asset Sale or Event of Loss, as applicable,  less the applicable Reinvestment Deferred Amount, if any, (y) in the  case of clause (ii) above, fifty percent (50%) of the Net Cash Proceeds  of the applicable Debt Issuance, and (z) in the case of clause (iii)  or (iv) above, twenty-five (25%) of the Net Cash Proceeds of the relevant  Equity Issuance or Exercise Event, as applicable, (2) the purchase price  (which shall be as specified in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above) and  the purchase date (which shall be ten (10) Business Days after the date  such notice is sent) with respect to such event (the " _Mandatory  Payment Date_ "), and (3) that  any Notes not tendered or not repurchased will continue to remain outstanding.  On or before the second Business Day prior to the applicable Mandatory  Payment Date, each Holder shall notify the Issuer in writing of the amount  of such Holders Notes eligible for redemption that such Holder  wishes to tender for purchase pursuant to such Mandatory Redemption Offer; _provided_ that,  in the event any Holder does not so notify the Issuer on or before such  second Business Day, such Holder shall be deemed to have elected not  to tender any of such Holders Notes for purchase. On the Mandatory  Payment Date, the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries shall deliver to  any Holders that have elected to tender all or any portion of their respective  Notes for purchase pursuant to such Mandatory Redemption Offer, an amount  equal to the aggregate purchase price for such Notes. Upon receipt by  any Holder of the purchase price for the Notes which such Holder has  elected to tender for purchase, such Holder shall deliver to the Issuer  an aggregate principal amount of Notes equal to not less than the amount  of Notes of such Holder so tendered, which Notes shall be cancelled by  the Issuer. In the event such aggregate principal amount of the Notes  of such Holder delivered to the Issuer exceeds the aggregate principal  amount of the Notes of such Holder so tendered, the Issuer shall deliver  to such Holder a new Note or Notes in an aggregate principal amount equal  to the amount of such excess.  

 

 

 2.03. Repayment on Maturity Date. Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the entire aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding on the Maturity Date shall be repaid on such date, unless such date is not a Business Day, in which case such payment will be made on the Business day immediately preceding the Maturity Date. 

 

  2.04. Interest.

 

  (a) Subject to the provisions of _Section
2.06(b)_ ,  interest on the Notes will accrue and be charged on the principal
amount thereof for each day at the Interest Rate. All calculations of
interest shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days
elapsed.

 

  (b) Anything contained herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any Event
of Default, (i) interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding
under any Debtor Relief Law) on each outstanding Note will accrue and be
charged on the principal amount thereof for each day at the Default Rate and
(ii) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws, interest (including
post-petition interest in any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law) will
accrue and be charged for each day at the Default Rate on any payments
of interest that are not paid 

     

 when due and other amounts that are then due and payable hereunder. Accrued
and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due
interest) shall be due and payable upon demand. The Issuer acknowledges
and agrees that payment or acceptance of interest at the Default Rate is not
a permitted alternative to timely payment and shall not constitute a waiver of
any Event of Default or otherwise prejudice or limit any rights or remedies of
the Administrative Holder or any Holder.

 

  (c) Except as otherwise provided in _Section
2.06(b)_ , interest on each Note shall be due and payable in arrears on the
last day of each Interest Accrual Period applicable to such Note, on the date
of any redemption of all or any portion of the principal amount of such Note
(on the principal amount so redeemed) and on the Maturity Date. Interest
hereunder and under the Notes shall be due and payable in accordance with the
terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the commencement
of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law.

 

  (d) Interest shall accrue on each Note for the
day on which such Note is purchased, and shall not accrue on such Note, or
any portion thereof, for the day on which such Note or such portion is
redeemed, _provided_ that any Note that is redeemed on the same day on which
it is purchased shall, subject  to _Section 2.06(b)_ ,  bear interest for
one day.

 

  2.05. Payment Records. All payments of principal and interest
made by the Issuer under this Agreement and the Notes shall be evidenced by
one or more accounts or records maintained by the Issuer and each applicable
Holder in the ordinary course of business. Such accounts or records shall be
conclusive, absent manifest error, of the amount of such payments paid by the
Issuer. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however,
limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Issuer hereunder to pay any
amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict
between the accounts and records maintained by any Holder and the accounts and
records of the Issuer in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of
the Issuer shall be conclusive evidence of the matters contained therein in
the absence of demonstrable error. Each Holder may attach schedules to any of
its Notes and endorse thereon the date and amount of any payments with respect
thereto.

 

  2.06. Payments Generally.

 

  (a) All payments to be made by the Issuer in respect of the
Obligations shall be made without condition or deduction for any
counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, all payments by the Issuer in respect of the Obligations
shall be made to the Holders to which such payment is owed via wire transfer
of Dollars in immediately available funds on the date such payment is due and
payable by 2:00 P.M. All payments received by any Holder after 2:00 P.M. on
the date such payments are due and payable shall be deemed to have been
received on the next succeeding Business Day, and any applicable interest
shall continue to accrue thereon until such Business Day.

 

  (b) If any payment to be made by the Issuer in respect of
the Obligations shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, such
payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension
of time shall be reflected in computing any applicable interest.

 

  2.07. Sharing of Payments. If, other than as expressly
provided elsewhere herein, any Holder shall obtain, on account of any Note
held by it, any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise
of any right of set-off, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share (or
other share contemplated hereunder) thereof, such Holder shall immediately
(a) notify the Administrative Holder of such fact, and (b) purchase from the
other Holders such participations in the Notes held by them as shall be
necessary to cause such purchasing Holder to share the excess payment in
respect of such Note pro rata with each of them; _provided_ that if all or any
portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the

     

 purchasing Holder under any of the circumstances described in _Section 9.05_
(including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the purchasing
Holder in its discretion), such purchase shall to that extent be rescinded
and each other Holder shall repay to the purchasing Holder the purchase price
paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such paying Holders ratable
share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such paying Holders
required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing
Holder) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing
Holder in respect of the total amount so recovered, without further interest
thereon. The Administrative Holder will keep records (which shall be
conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations
purchased under this _Section 2.07_ and will in each case notify the Holders
following any such purchases or repayments. Each Holder that purchases a
participation pursuant to this _Section 2.07_ shall from and after such
purchase have the right to give all notices, requests, demands, directions and
other communications under this Agreement with respect to the portion of
the Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing Holder
were the original owner of the Obligations purchased.

 

  2.08. Representations and Warranties of the Purchasers.
Each Purchaser hereby represents and warrants, severally and not jointly, as
follows:

 

  (a) such Purchaser (A) understands that the Notes have not
been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and the Notes are
being issued by the Issuer in a transaction exempt from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and (B) agrees that it will not sell all or
any part of the Notes and the Notes may not be offered or sold, except
pursuant to  _Section 2.07(b)_ or pursuant to effective registration
statements under the Securities Act or pursuant to applicable exemptions from
registration under the Securities Act and in compliance with applicable State
laws;

 

  (b) such Purchaser further understands that the exemption
from registration afforded by Rule 144 (the provisions of which are known to
such Purchaser) promulgated under the Securities Act depends on the
satisfaction of various conditions, and that, if applicable, Rule 144 may
afford the basis for sales only in limited amounts;

 

  (c) such Purchaser did not employ any broker or finder in
connection with the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and no fees
or commissions are payable to or by such Purchaser except as otherwise
provided for in this Agreement; and

 

  (d) such Purchaser is an " _Accredited Investor_ " (as
defined in Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act). The financial position of
such Purchaser is such that it can afford to bear the economic risk of holding
the Notes. Such Purchaser can afford to suffer the complete loss of its
investment in the Notes. The knowledge and experience of such Purchaser in
financial and business matters is such that it is capable of evaluating the
risks of the investment in the Notes. Such Purchaser acknowledges that no
representations, express or implied, are being made with respect to the
Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries, the Notes or otherwise, other than those
expressly set forth herein.

 

 ARTICLE III. 
  _TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY_

 

  3.01. Taxes.

 

  (a) Any and all payments by the Issuer to or for the account
of the Administrative Holder or any Holder under any Note Document shall be
made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future
taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or
similar charges, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding (i) in
the case of the Administrative Holder and each Holder, taxes imposed on or
measured by its net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it (in lieu

     

 of income taxes), by the jurisdiction (or any political subdivision thereof)
under the Laws of which the Administrative Holder or such Holder, as the case
may be, is organized or, in the case of each Holder, maintains its principal
office or a lending office, (ii) any branch profits taxes imposed by the U.S.
or any similar tax imposed by any other jurisdiction described in clause (i)
above, (iii) any taxes that are attributable to such Holders failure to
comply with the requirements of _Section 9.11(a)_ (other than by reason of a
change in law) or (iv) any withholding taxes imposed on amounts payable to a
Holder at the time such Holder becomes a party to this Agreement, except to
the extent that such Holders assignor (if any) was entitled, at the time of
assignment, to receive additional amounts from the Issuer with respect to such
withholding taxes pursuant to this  _Section 3.01(a)_ (all such non-excluded
taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or
similar charges, and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as " _Taxes_ "
and those excluded, as " _Excluded Taxes_ "). If any Note Party shall be
required by any Laws to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable
under any Note Document to any the Administrative Holder or Holder, (i) the
sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all
required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums
payable under this Section), each of the Administrative Holder and such Holder
receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
deductions been made, (ii) the Issuer shall make such deductions, (iii) the
Issuer shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority
or other authority in accordance with applicable Laws, and (iv) within thirty
(30) days after the date of such payment, the Issuer shall furnish to the
Administrative Holder and such Holder the original or a copy of a receipt, or
other documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Holder and
such Holder, evidencing payment thereof.

 

  (b) In addition, the Issuer agrees to pay, or cause to be
paid, any and all present or future stamp, court or documentary taxes and any
other excise or property taxes or charges or similar levies which arise from
any payment made under any Note Document or from the execution, delivery,
performance, enforcement or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, any
Note Document (hereinafter referred to as " _Other Taxes_ ") and within
thirty (30) days after the date of such payment, the Issuer shall furnish to
the Administrative Holder and such Holder the original or a copy of a
receipt, or other documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative
Holder and such Holder, evidencing payment thereof.

 

  (c) Parent, together with the Issuer, (jointly and
severally) agree to indemnify the Administrative Holder and each Holder for
(i) the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including any Taxes or Other
Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this
Section) paid by the Administrative Holder and such Holder and (ii) any
liability (including additions to tax, penalties, interest and expenses)
arising therefrom or with respect thereto whether or not such Taxes or Other
Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant
governmental authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or
liability delivered to Parent or the Issuer by a Holder or the Administrative
Holder on its own behalf shall be conclusive absent a manifest error. Payment
under this subsection (c) shall be made as promptly as practicable, but in
any event within thirty (30) days, after the date the Holder or the
Administrative Holder makes a demand therefor.

 

  (d) If the Administrative Holder or any Holder receives a
refund (including pursuant to a claim for refund made pursuant to the
preceding sentence) in respect of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has
been indemnified by the Issuer, or with respect to which the Issuer has paid
additional amounts pursuant to _Section 3.01(a)_ , it shall within 30 days
from the date of such receipt pay over the amount of such refund to the
Issuer, net of all reasonable expenses of the Administrative Holder or such
Holder and without interest (other than interest paid by the relevant
taxation authority with respect to such refund); _provided_ that the Issuer,
upon the request of the Administrative Holder or such Holder, agrees to repay
the amount paid over to the Issuer (plus penalties, interest or other
reasonable charges) to the

     

 Administrative Holder or such Holder in the event the Administrative Holder
or such Holder is required or requested to repay such refund to such taxing
authority.

 

  3.02. Illegality.

 

  (a) If any Holder determines that any Law has made it
unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it
is unlawful, for such Holder to continue to hold its Notes or to determine or
charge interest rates based upon the LIBO Rate, such Holder shall give notice
thereof to the Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Holder). Upon receipt
of such notice, the Issuer shall, upon demand from such Holder (with a copy
to the Administrative Holder), either (i) redeem all Notes, at a price equal
to 100% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Notes, of such
Holder, either on the last day of the current Interest Accrual Period in
respect of such Notes, if such Holder may lawfully continue to hold such notes
until such date, or immediately, if such Holder may not lawfully continue to
hold such Notes, or (ii) at the option of the Issuer, pay interest on such
Holders Notes at a rate per annum, as determined by such Holder, that will
provide a corresponding yield to such Holder compared to the yield that such
Holder would have realized if its Notes had continued to accrue interest at a
rate based upon the LIBO Rate (taking into account any increased cost to such
Holder of continuing to hold its Notes). Upon any such prepayment, the Issuer
shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid. Each Holder agrees
to hold its Notes through a different office of such Holder if such
designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the good
faith judgment of such Holder, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such
Holder.

 

  (b) Failure or delay on the part of any Holder to provide
notice as per _Section 3.02(a)_ shall not constitute a waiver of such
Holders rights set forth therein; _provided_ that the Issuer shall not be
required to comply with the requirements set forth in _Section 3.02(a)(i) or
(ii)_ if such Holder provides notice of the relevant change in Law or
assertion of a Governmental Authority more than one year after the occurrence
of such change in Law or assertion of a Governmental Authority; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that, if such change in Law is retroactive, then the one year
period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of
retroactive effect thereof.

 

  3.03. Matters Applicable to all Requests for Compensation.

 

  (a) The Administrative Holder or any Purchaser or any Holder
claiming compensation under this _Article III_ shall deliver to the Issuer a
certificate setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it
hereunder and accompanied by a reasonably detailed invoice therefor
and supporting calculations, which certificate shall be conclusive in the
absence of manifest error. In determining such amount the Administrative
Holder or such Purchaser or Holder may use any reasonable averaging and
attribution methods.

 

  3.04. Survival. All of the Parents and the
Issuers obligations under this _Article III_ shall survive the repayment of
all Obligations hereunder.

 

  (a) In the event that (i)(A) it becomes illegal for any
Holder to continue to hold its Notes or to determine or charge interest rates
based upon the LIBO Rate and such Holder so notifies the Issuer pursuant to
_Section 3.02_ , or (B) any Holder is required to make any payment pursuant
to  _Section 3.01_ that is attributable to a particular Holder, and (ii) in
the case of clause (i)(B) above, Holders holding at least 50% of the aggregate
principal amount outstanding of the Notes are not subject to such illegality,
payment or proceedings (any such Holder, an " _Affected Holder_ "), the Issuer
may substitute any Holder and, if reasonably acceptable to the Administrative
Holder, any other Eligible Holder (a " _Substitute Institution_ ") for such
Affected Holder hereunder, after delivery of a written notice (a "
_Substitution Notice_ ") by the Issuer to the Administrative Holder and the
Affected Holder within a reasonable time (in

     

 any case not to exceed ninety (90) days) following the occurrence of any of
the events described in clause (i) above that the Issuer intend to make such
substitution; _provided_ that, if more than one Holder claims increased costs,
illegality or right to payment arising from the same act or condition and such
claims are received by the Issuer within thirty (30) days of each other, then
the Issuer may substitute all, but not (except to the extent the Issuer have
already substituted one of such Affected Holders before the Issuers receipt
of the other Affected Holders claim) less than all, Holders making such
claims.

 

  (b) If the Substitution Notice was properly issued under
this _Section 3.04_ , the Affected Holder shall sell, and the Substitute
Institution shall purchase, all rights and claims of such Affected Holder
under the Note Documents, and the Substitute Institution shall assume, and
the Affected Holder shall be relieved of all prior unperformed obligations of
the Affected Holder under the Note Documents (other than in respect of any
damages (other than exemplary or punitive damages, to the extent permitted by
applicable law) in respect of any such unperformed obligations). Such
purchase and sale (and the corresponding assignment of all rights and claims
hereunder) shall be effective on (and not earlier than) the later of (i) the
receipt by the Affected Holder of the principal amount of its Notes, together
with any other Obligations owing to it and (ii) the payment in full to the
Affected Holder in Cash of all fees, unreimbursed costs and expenses and
indemnities accrued and unpaid through such effective date. Upon the
effectiveness of such sale, purchase and assumption, the Substitute
Institution shall become a " _Holder_ " hereunder for all purposes of this
Agreement. 

 

  (c) Each Holder agrees that, if it becomes an Affected
Holder and its rights and claims are assigned hereunder to a Substitute
Institution pursuant to this _Section 3.04_ , it shall execute and deliver to
the Issuer an Assignment and Assumption to evidence such assignment, together
with any Note held by it; _provided_ that the failure of any Affected Holder
to execute an Assignment and Assumption or deliver such Notes shall not render
such assignment invalid.

cause such new Guarantor (A) to become a party to the Guaranty and Pledge
Agreement and (B) to take such actions reasonably necessary or advisable to
grant to the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Holders, a perfected

provisions of this Agreement and the other Note Documents, or of more fully
perfecting or renewing the rights of the Administrative Holder or the Holders
with respect to the Collateral (or with respect to any additions thereto or
replacements or proceeds thereof or with respect to any Capital Stock
hereafter acquired by any Note Party that may be deemed to be part of the

and use commercially  reasonable efforts to obtain, such Replacement
Financing. The Issuer and the Parent agree that in their determination as to
whether a Replacement Financing is available on commercially reasonable
terms, the Issuer and the Parent will consider the terms of such Replacement
Financing taken as a whole, and will not reject a Replacement Financing
solely because (i) the interest rate thereunder is greater than the Interest
Rate then in effect, (ii) the Issuer will be required to make amortization
payments with respect thereto, or (iii) such Replacement Financing includes
one or more financial incurrence or maintenance covenants. Upon request, the
Issuer and the Parent will discuss with the Administrative Holder and the
Qualifying Purchasers the information provided to them with respect to the
terms on which a Replacement Financing may at such time be available.

create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent
contracting parties. The provisions of this Article VIII are solely for the
benefit of the Administrative Holder and the Holders and no Note Party shall
have any rights as a third party

     

 beneficiary of any of the provisions thereof. In performing its functions
and duties hereunder, the Administrative Holder shall act solely as an agent
of the Holders and does not assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed
any obligation towards or relationship of agency or trust with or for any Note
Party.

 

  8.02. Collateral Matters. The Holders irrevocably authorize
the Collateral Agent, at its option and in its discretion:

 

  (a) to take any action with respect to the Collateral which
may be necessary to perfect and maintain perfected the Liens upon the
Collateral granted pursuant to any of the Note Documents;

 

  (b) to release any Lien on any property granted to or held
by the Collateral Agent under any Note Document (i) upon termination of the
payment in full of all Obligations, (ii) that is sold or to be sold as part of
or in connection with any Disposition permitted hereunder or under any other
Note Document, (iii) in accordance with any provision for the release thereof
provided for in this Agreement or the other Note Documents, or (iv) subject to
_Section 9.01_ , if approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the
Required Holders;

 

  (c) to subordinate any Lien on any property granted to or
held by the Collateral Agent under any Note Document to the holder of any
Lien on such property that is permitted by _Section 6.02_ ; and

 

  (d) following any such release or subordination described in
the preceding clauses (b) and (c), to deliver to the Issuer or any other
Person, at its expense, any Collateral so released that is then held by the
Collateral Agent hereunder and to execute and deliver to the Issuer or any
other Person such releases or other documents as the Issuer or such Person
shall request to evidence or effectuate such release or subordination of
Liens (including UCC termination statements, intercreditor agreements and
collateral agency agreements).

 

  (e) Upon request by the Collateral Agent at any time, the
Required Holders will confirm in writing the Collateral Agents authority to
release or subordinate its interest in particular types or items of property
pursuant to this _Section 8.02_.

 

  8.03. Duties in the Case of Enforcement. In case one of more
Events of Default have occurred and shall be continuing, the Collateral Agent
shall, if (a) so requested (or consented to) by the Administrative Holder or
the Required Holders and (b) the Holders have severally provided to the
Collateral Agent such additional indemnities and assurances against expenses
and liabilities as the Collateral Agent may reasonably request, proceed to
enforce the provisions of any Note Documents authorizing the sale or other
disposition of all or any part of the Collateral (or any other property which
is security for the Obligations) and exercise all or any such other legal and
equitable and other rights or remedies as it may have in respect of such
Collateral (or such other property); _provided_ , in no event shall this
sentence require any Holder to provide indemnities or assurances against
expenses and liabilities in excess of such Holders Overall Pro Rata Share.
The Required Holders may direct the Collateral Agent in writing as to the
method and the extent of any such sale or other disposition to the extent
permitted under the terms hereof, the Holders hereby agreeing to indemnify and
hold the Collateral Agent harmless from all liabilities incurred in respect
of all actions taken or omitted in accordance with such directions, _provided_
that the Collateral Agent need not comply with any such direction to the
extent that the Collateral Agent reasonably believes the Collateral Agents
compliance with such direction to be unlawful or commercially unreasonable in
any applicable jurisdiction.

 

  8.04. Right to Indemnity. Each Holder, in proportion to its Pro
Rata Share or its Overall Pro Rata Share (with respect to claims related to
the Administrative Holder and the Collateral Agent,

     

 respectively), at the time any claim therefor is made, severally agrees to
indemnify the Agents, to the extent that the Agents shall not have been
reimbursed by any Note Party (but without limiting any Note
Partys reimbursement obligations), for and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses (including counsel fees and disbursements) or disbursements of any
kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against the Agents in exercising its powers, rights and remedies or performing
its duties hereunder or under the other Note Documents or otherwise in its
capacity as Agents in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or
the other Note Documents; _provided_ , no Holder shall be liable for any
portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
resulting solely from the Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct. If
any indemnity furnished to the Agents for any purpose shall, in the opinion of
the Agents, be insufficient or become impaired, the Agents may call for
additional indemnity and cease, or not commence, to do the acts indemnified
against until such additional indemnity is furnished; _provided_ , in no event
shall this sentence require any Holder to indemnify the Agents against any
liability, obligation, loss, damage, penalty, action, judgment, suit, cost,
expense or disbursement in excess of such Holders Pro Rata Share or Overall
Pro Rata Share (with respect to the Administrative Holder and the Collateral
Agent, respectively) thereof; and _provided_ , _further_ , this sentence shall
not be deemed to require any Holder to indemnify the Agents against any
liability, obligation, loss, damage, penalty, action, judgment, suit, cost,
expense or disbursement described in the proviso in the immediately preceding
sentence.

 

  8.05. General Immunity.

 

  (a) _No Responsibility for Certain Matters_. The
Administrative Holder shall not be responsible to any Holder for
the execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability,
collectibility or sufficiency hereof or any other Note Document or for any
representations, warranties, recitals or statements made herein or therein or
made in any written or oral statements or in any financial or other
statements, instruments, reports or certificates or any other documents
furnished or made by any Holders or by or on behalf of any Note Party in
connection with the Note Documents and the transactions contemplated thereby
or for the financial condition or business affairs of any Note Party or any
other Person liable for the payment of any Obligations, nor shall the
Administrative Holder be required to ascertain or inquire as to the
performance or observance of any of the terms, conditions, provisions,
covenants or agreements contained in any of the Note Documents or as to the
use of the proceeds of the Notes or as to the existence or possible existence
of any Event of Default or Default or to make any disclosures with respect to
the foregoing. Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding,
Administrative Holder shall not have any liability arising from confirmations
of the outstanding amount of the Notes.

 

  (b) _Exculpatory Provisions_. Neither the Administrative
Holder, the Collateral Agent, nor any of their respective officers, partners,
directors, employees or agents shall be liable to Holders for any action taken
or omitted by the Administrative Holder or the Collateral Agent under or in
connection with any of the Note Documents except to the extent caused by the
Administrative Holders or Collateral Agents gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Agents shall be entitled to refrain from any act or the taking
of any action (including the failure to take an action) in connection herewith
or any of the other Note Documents or from the exercise of any power,
discretion or authority vested in it hereunder or thereunder unless and until
the Administrative Holder shall have received instructions in respect thereof
from the Required Holders (or such other Holders as may be required to give
such instructions under Section 9.01) and, upon receipt of such instructions
from the Required Holders (or such other Holders, as the case may be), the
Agents shall be entitled to act or (where so instructed) refrain from acting,
or to exercise such power, discretion or authority, in accordance with such
instructions. Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, (i) each
Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying,
upon any communication, instrument or document believed by it to be genuine
and correct and to

     

 have been signed or sent by the proper Person or Persons, and shall be
entitled to rely and shall be protected in relying on opinions and judgments
of attorneys (who may be attorneys for Issuer and/or other Note
Parties), accountants, experts and other professional advisors selected by
it; and (ii) no Holder shall have any right of action whatsoever against the
Admin Holder as a result of its acting or (where so instructed) refraining
from acting hereunder or any of the other Note Documents in accordance with
the instructions of the Required Holders (or such other Holders as may be
required to give such instructions under Section 9.01).

 

  (c) _Delegation of Duties_. The Administrative Holder may
perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers under
this Agreement or under any other Note Document by or through any one or more
sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Holder. The Administrative Holder
and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise
its rights and powers by or through their respective Affiliates. The
exculpatory, indemnification and other provisions of this Agreement (including
Section 8.02) shall apply to the Affiliates of the Administrative Holder. All
of the rights, benefits, and privileges (including the exculpatory and
indemnification provisions) of this Section 8.02 shall apply to any such
subagent and to the Affiliates of any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their
respective activities as sub-agent as if such sub-agent and Affiliates were
named herein. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to
each sub-agent appointed by Administrative Holder, (i) such sub-agent shall be
a third party beneficiary under this Agreement with respect to all such
rights, benefits and privileges (including exculpatory rights and rights to
indemnification) and shall have all of the rights and benefits of a third
party beneficiary, including an independent right of action to enforce such
rights, benefits and privileges (including exculpatory rights and rights to
indemnification) directly, without the consent or joinder of any other Person,
against any or all of the Note Parties and the Holders, (ii) such rights,
benefits and privileges (including exculpatory rights and rights to
indemnification) shall not be modified or amended without the consent of such
sub-agent, and (iii) such sub-agent shall only have obligations to
Administrative Holder and not to any Note Party, Holder or any other Person
and no Note Party, Holder or any other Person shall have any rights, directly
or indirectly, as a third party beneficiary or otherwise, against such sub-
agent.

 

  8.06. Successor Administrative Holder. The Administrative
Holder may resign at any time by giving twenty days prior written notice
thereof to the Holders and the Issuer. Upon any such notice of resignation,
the Required Holders shall have the right to appoint a successor
Administrative Holder. The Administrative Holders resignation shall become
effective on the earlier of (a) twenty days after delivery by the
Administrative Holder of the notice referred to in the first sentence of this
_Section 8.06_ and (b) the date on which a successor Administrative Holder
shall have been appointed (the " _Resignation Date_ "). On the Resignation
Date, such retiring Administrative Holder shall be discharged from its duties
and obligations hereunder. After any retiring Administrative Holders
resignation hereunder as Administrative Holder, the provisions of this Article
VIII shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be
taken by it while it was Administrative Holder hereunder.

Holder in addition to the Holders required above and the Issuer, affect the

respectively under this Agreement or any other Note Document.

 

  9.02. Notices and Other Communications; Facsimile Copies.

 

  (a) _General_. Unless otherwise expressly provided herein,
all notices and other communications provided for hereunder shall be in
writing or by any telecommunication device capable of creating a written
record (including electronic mail and facsimile transmission). All such
written notices shall be mailed, e-mailed, faxed or delivered to the
applicable address or facsimile number, and all notices and other
communications expressly permitted hereunder to be given by telephone shall be
made to the applicable telephone number, as follows:

 

 

 (i) if  to the Issuer, the Administrative Holder or the Collateral Agent, to the  address, the e-mail address, facsimile number or telephone number specified  for such Person on _Schedule 9.02_ or  to such other address, the e-mail address, facsimile number or telephone  number as shall be designated by such party in a notice to the other parties;  and

In no event shall a voicemail message be effective as a notice, communication or confirmation hereunder. 

 

  (b) _Effectiveness of Facsimile Documents and Signatures_.
Note Documents may be transmitted and/or signed by facsimile. The
effectiveness of any such documents and signatures shall, subject to
applicable Law, have the same force and effect as manually-signed originals
and shall be binding on each applicable Note Party, the Collateral Agent, the
Administrative Holder and the Holders. The Administrative Holder may also
require that any such documents and signatures be confirmed by a manually-
signed original thereof; _provided_ that the failure to request or deliver the
same shall not limit the effectiveness of any facsimile document or signature.

 

  (c) _Reliance by the Administrative Holder and the
Holders_. The Administrative Holder and the Holders shall be entitled to rely
and act upon any notices given by or on behalf of the Issuer even if (i) such
notices were not made in a manner specified herein, were incomplete or were
not preceded or followed by any other form of notice specified herein, or
(ii) the terms thereof, as understood by the recipient, varied from any
confirmation thereof, so long as, in each case, such notice is issued by a
Responsible Officer of the Issuer or by a Person or Persons
reasonably believed in good faith by the Holders to be Responsible Officers
of the Issuer. The Issuer shall indemnify each Indemnitee from all losses,
costs, expenses and liabilities resulting from the reliance by such Person on
each notice purportedly given by or on behalf of the Issuer. All telephonic
notices to and other communications with the Administrative Holder may be
recorded by the Administrative Holder, and each of the parties hereto hereby
consents to such recording.

 

  9.03. No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure by any Holder,
the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Holder to exercise, and no delay
by any such Person in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy,
power or privilege, subject to the terms of applicable Law. The rights,
remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.

 

  9.04. Payment of Expenses. The Parent and the Issuer jointly
and severally agree (a) to pay or reimburse the Agents and any Holder for all
its reasonable and documented out of pocket costs and expenses incurred in
connection with any amendment, supplement or modification to this Agreement
and the other Note Documents, entered into at the request of any Note Party
(in each case, whether or not the transactions contemplated thereby shall be
consummated), including the Attorney Costs of one principal counsel for the
Required Holders and the Agents, (b) to pay or reimburse each Holder and the
Agents for all their costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
enforcement or preservation of any rights under this Agreement, the other Note
Documents and any other documents prepared in connection herewith or
therewith, including without limitation, Attorney Costs of one principal
counsel (unless such

     

 principal counsel may not represent all Holders as a result of a conflict of
interest of such Holders with respect to the Obligations) for all Holders, and
Attorney Costs for counsel to the Agents, (c) to pay, indemnify, or reimburse
each Holder and the Agents for, and hold each Holder and the Agents harmless
from, any and all costs and reasonable expenses of perfecting and recording
the Liens granted with respect to the Collateral, including all recording and
filing fees, and any and all liabilities with respect to, or resulting from
any delay in paying delinquent or non-payment of any stamp, excise and similar
taxes, if any, which may be payable or determined to be payable in connection
with the execution and delivery of, or consummation or administration of any
of the transactions contemplated by, or any amendment, supplement or
modification of, or any waiver or consent under or in respect of, this
Agreement, the other Note Documents and any such other documents, and (d) to
pay, indemnify or reimburse each Holder, the Agents, their respective
Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, trustees, employees,
advisors, agents and controlling Persons (each, an " _Indemnitee_ ") for, and
hold each Indemnitee harmless from and against, any and all other liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to
the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance and administration of this
Agreement, the other Note Documents and any such other documents, whether
direct, indirect or consequential and whether based on any Laws (including
securities and environmental Laws), that may be imposed on, incurred by, or
asserted against any such Indemnitee, in any manner relating to or arising out
of any Note Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
(including the Holders agreement to receive the Notes hereunder), including,
without limitation, the fees and disbursements and other charges of legal
counsel in connection with claims, actions or proceedings by any Indemnitee
against the Issuer hereunder (all the foregoing in this clause (d),
collectively, the " _Indemnified Liabilities_ "), _provided_ that the Parent
and the Issuer shall have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnitee with
respect to Indemnified Liabilities to the extent such Indemnified Liabilities
are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent
jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct
of such Indemnitee. All amounts due under this Section shall be payable
promptly after written demand therefor. Statements payable by the Issuer
pursuant to this Section shall be submitted to the Issuer at the address of
the Issuer set forth in _Schedule 9.02_ , or to such other Person or address
as may be hereafter designated by the Issuer in a notice to the Holders and
the Administrative Holder. To the extent that the undertakings to defend,
indemnify, pay and hold harmless set forth in this _Section 9.04_ may be
unenforceable in whole or in part because they are violative of any law or
public policy, the applicable Note Party shall contribute the maximum portion
that it is permitted to pay and satisfy under applicable law to the payment
and satisfaction of all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by Indemnitees or any
of them. The agreements in this Section shall survive repayment of the Notes
and all other amounts payable hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
Section (other than clause (c) above) shall not apply to any tax-related
matter.

 

  9.05. Payments Set Aside. To the extent that any payment by or
on behalf of the Issuer is made to the Administrative Holder or any Holder,
or the Administrative Holder, or any Holder exercises its right of set-off,
and such payment or the proceeds of such set-off or any part thereof is
subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set
aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the
Administrative Holder or such Holder in its discretion) to be repaid to a
trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under
any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery,
the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be
revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not
been made or such set-off had not occurred, and (b) each Holder severally
agrees to pay to the Administrative Holder upon demand its applicable share of
any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative Holder, plus
interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such payment is
made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in
effect.

_provided_ ,  in each case of any assignment, sale or other transfer pursuant
to clauses  (i) or (ii) above that (A) each of the Issuer and the
Administrative Holder  shall have been given prior written notice of such
transfer, sale or assignment,(B)  each such transfer, sale or assignment
shall be in a minimum principal  amount of $500,000 or such lesser amount
consented to by the Issuer  and the Administrative Holder, and (C) the
parties to such transfer, sale  or assignment shall execute and deliver to
the Issuer (with a copy to the  Administrative Agent), for recording in the
Register (as hereinafter defined)  an Assignment and Assumption, together
with any Notes subject to such assignment.  Upon such execution, delivery,
acceptance and recording, from and after  the effective date specified in
each Assignment and Assumption, which effective  date shall be at least five
(5) Business Days after the execution thereof,  (1) the assignee thereunder
shall be a party hereto and, to the extent  provided in such Assignment and
Assumption, have the rights and obligations  of a Holder hereunder, and (2)
the assigning Holder thereunder shall, to  the extent provided in such
Assignment and Assumption, be released from  its obligations under this
Agreement.

 

 

 (b) _Certain Representations and Warranties; Limitations; Covenants_. By executing and delivering an Assignment and Assumption, the parties to the assignment thereunder confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows:

 

 

 (i) the  assignee under such Assignment and Assumption is acquiring Notes for its  own account, for investment and not with a view to any distribution thereof  within the meaning of the Securities Act;

 (iii) such  assignee further understands that the exemption from registration afforded  by Rule 144 (the provisions of which are known to the assignee) promulgated  under the Securities Act depends on the satisfaction of various conditions,  and that, if applicable, Rule 144 may afford the basis for sales only in  limited amounts; 

 

 (iv) such  assignee is an " _Accredited Investor_ " (as  defined in Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act). The financial position  of such assignee is such that it can afford to bear the economic risk of  holding the Notes. Such assignee can afford to suffer the complete loss  of its investment in the Notes. The knowledge and experience of such assignee  in financial and business matters is such that it is capable of evaluating  the risks of the investment in the Notes. Such assignee acknowledges that  no representations, express or implied, are being made with respect to  the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries, the Notes or otherwise, other than  those expressly set forth herein. 

 

 (v) Except  as disclosed in writing by each assignee, the source of funds to be used  by such assignee to pay the purchase price of the Notes purchased by such  assignee hereunder does not include assets of any employee benefit plan  (other than a plan exempt from the coverage of ERISA) or plan or any other  entity the assets of which consist of " _plan  assets_ " as defined in Department  of Labor regulation Section 2510.3 -101. As used herein, the term " _employee  benefit plan_ " shall have the  meaning assigned to such term in Section 3 of ERISA, and the term " _plan_ " shall  have the meaning assigned thereto in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code. 

 

 (vi) other  than the representation and warranty that it is the legal and beneficial  owner of the interest being assigned thereby free and clear of any adverse  claim, the assigning Holder makes no representation or warranty, express  or implied, and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements,  warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement  or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency  or value of this Agreement, the other Note Documents or any other instrument  or document furnished pursuant hereto or the attachment, perfection or  priority of any security interest or mortgage, 

 

 (vii) the  assigning Holder makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility  with respect to the financial condition of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries  or any other Person primarily or secondarily liable in respect of any of  the Obligations, or the performance or observance by the Note Parties or  any other Person primarily or secondarily liable in respect of any of the  Obligations of any of its obligations under this Agreement or any of the  other Note Documents or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant  hereto or thereto; 

 

 (viii) such  assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together  with copies of the most recent financial statements referred to in _Section  5.01_ and such other documents and  information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis  and decision to enter into such Assignment and Assumption; 

 

 (ix) such  assignee will, independently and without reliance upon the assigning Holder,  the Administrative Holder or any other Holder and based on such documents  and 

 

     

 

information as it shall deem appropriate  at the time, continue to make its
own credit decisions in taking or not  taking action under this Agreement;

 

 (x) such  assignee appoints and authorizes the Agents to take such action as agent  on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement and the  other Note Documents as are delegated to the Agents by the terms hereof  or thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; 

 

 (xi) such  assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with this Agreement  and the other Note Documents all of the obligations that by the terms thereof  are required to be performed by it as a Holder; 

 

 (xii) such  assignee represents and warrants that it is legally authorized to enter  into such Assignment and Assumption; and 

 

 (xiii) such  assignee acknowledges that it has complied with the provisions of _Section  9.11_ to the extent applicable. 

 

 

 (c) _Register_. The Issuer shall maintain a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Holders, and of the principal amounts of the Notes (and any interest thereon) owing to, each Holder pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the " _Register_ "). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent demonstrable error, and the Issuer, the Administrative Holder and the Holders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Holder hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Issuer, the Administrative Holder and any Holder, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. 

 

  (d) _New Notes_. Upon its receipt of an Assignment and
Assumption executed by the parties to such assignment, the Issuer shall (i)
record the information contained therein in the Register and (ii) give prompt
notice thereof to the Issuer and the Holders (other than the assigning
Holder). Promptly after the effectiveness of any assignment by any Holder of
all or any portion of such Holders Notes, the Issuer (at its expense) shall
execute and deliver (x) to the assignee Holder, one or more Notes in an
aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of Notes
assigned to such assignee Holder and (y) to the assignor Holder, one or more
Notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal
amount, if any, of the Notes delivered by such Assignor Holder to the Issuer
that were not assigned to such assignee Holder.

 

  (e) _Participations_. Any Holder may from time to time and
at any time, without the consent of any Note Party, sell participations in
all or any portion of such Holders Notes to any other Person (other than a
Restricted Entity) that invests in notes, loans, or similar securities;
_provided_ that the terms of any such participation shall not entitle the
participant to direct such Holder as to the manner in which it votes in
connection with any amendment, supplement or other modification of this
Agreement or any waiver or consent with respect to any departure from the
terms hereof, in each case unless and to the extent that the subject matter
thereof is one as to which the consent of all Holders is required in order
to approve the same.

 

  (f) _Pledges_. Any Holder may from time to time and at any
time after the Assignment Trigger Date, without the consent of any Note
Party, pledge, collaterally assign or grant a security interest in all or any
portion of such Holders Notes to any other Person (other than a Restricted
Entity); _provided_ that no such pledge, collateral assignment or grant of
security interest shall act as a substitution of the

     

 applicable pledgee or assignee for such Holder as a party to this Agreement
or any other Note Document except, in the case of a subsequent foreclosure, if
such foreclosure is made in compliance with the other provisions of this
_Section 9.06_.

 

  (g) _Assignment by the Issuer_. Neither the Parent nor the
Issuer shall assign or transfer any of their respective rights or obligations
under this Agreement or any of the other Note Documents without the prior
written consent of the Administrative Holder and each of the Holders.

 

  (h) _Satisfaction of Indemnification Obligations_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any
Holder may from time to time, without the consent of any Note Party, assign,
transfer or deliver all or any portion of such Holders Notes to the Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries in satisfaction, in whole or in part, of such
Holders indemnification obligations under the Merger Agreement in accordance
with the terms thereof.

 

  9.07. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

 

  9.08. Integration. This Agreement, together with the other
Note Documents, comprises the complete and integrated agreement of the
parties on the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior
agreements, written or oral, on such subject matter. In the event of any
conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and those of any other Note
Document, the provisions of this Agreement shall control; _provided_ that the
inclusion of supplemental rights or remedies in favor of the Agents or
Holders in any other Note Document shall not be deemed a conflict with this
Agreement. Each Note Document was drafted with the joint participation of the
respective parties thereto and shall be construed neither against nor in favor
of any party, but rather in accordance with the fair meaning thereof.

 

  9.09. Survival of Representations and Warranties.
All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Note
Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in
connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery
hereof and thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or will be
relied upon by the Administrative Holder and each Holder, regardless of any
investigation made by the Administrative Holder or any Holder or on their
behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Holder or any Holder may
have had notice or knowledge of any Default or Event of Default at the time
any Note is purchased hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect
as long as any Note or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or
unsatisfied.

 

  9.10. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the
other Note Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the
legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this
Agreement and the other Note Documents shall not be affected or impaired
thereby and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to
replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid
provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of
the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a
provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

 

  9.11. Tax Forms.

 

  (a) Each Holder that is not a " _United States person_ "
within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a " _Foreign Holder_ ")
shall deliver to the Issuer and the Administrative Holder, prior to receipt
of any payment subject to withholding under the Code (or upon accepting an
assignment of an interest herein) or upon the reasonable request of the Issuer
or the Administrative Holder, two duly signed completed copies of either IRS
Form W-8BEN or any successor thereto (relating to such Foreign

     

 Holder and entitling it to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax
on all payments to be made to such Foreign Holder by the Issuer pursuant to
this Agreement) or IRS Form W-8ECI or any successor thereto (relating to all
payments to be made to such Foreign Holder by the Issuer pursuant to this
Agreement) or, in the case of a Foreign Holder claiming exemption from U.S.
withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to
payments of " _portfolio interest_ ," a Form W-8BEN or any successor thereto
(and, if such Foreign Holder delivers a Form W-8, a certificate representing
that such Foreign Holder is not a bank for purposes of Section 881(c) of the
Code, is not a 10-percent shareholder (within the meaning of Section
871(h)(3)(B) of the Code) of the Issuer and is not a controlled foreign
corporation related to the Issuer (within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of
the Code)) claiming complete exemption from U.S. withholding tax. Thereafter
and from time to time, each such Foreign Holder shall (A) promptly submit to
the Issuer and the Administrative Holder such additional duly completed and
signed copies of one of such forms (or such successor forms as shall be
adopted from time to time by the relevant United States taxing authorities) as
may then be required under then current United States laws and regulations to
avoid or reduce, or such evidence as is satisfactory to the Issuer and the
Administrative Holder of any available exemption from or reduction of, United
States withholding taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such Foreign
Holder by the Issuer pursuant to this Agreement, (B) promptly notify the
Issuer and the Administrative Holder of any change in circumstances which
would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption and (C) upon the Issuers
request, take such steps as shall not be disadvantageous to it, in the
reasonable judgment of such Holder, and as may be reasonably necessary to
avoid any requirement of applicable Laws that the Issuer make any deduction or
withholding for taxes from amounts payable to such Foreign
Holder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Foreign Holder
shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this _Section 9.11(a)_
that it is not entitled or otherwise legally able to deliver.

 

  (b) Each Holder that is a " _United States person_ " within
the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall deliver to the Issuer and
the Administrative Holder, prior to receipt of any payment subject to
withholding under the Code (or upon accepting an assignment of an interest
herein) or upon request of the Issuer or the Administrative Holder two duly
signed completed copies of IRS Form W-9. Thereafter and from time to time,
each such Holder shall (i) promptly submit to the Issuer and the
Administrative Holder such additional duly completed and signed copies of
such form (or such successor form as shall be adopted from time to time by the
relevant United States taxing authorities) as may then be required under then
current United States laws and regulations to avoid, or such evidence as is
satisfactory to the Issuer and the Administrative Holder of any available
exemption from, United States backup withholding taxes in respect of all
payments to be made to such Holder by the Issuer pursuant to this Agreement,
(ii) promptly notify the Issuer and the Administrative Holder of any change in
circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption, and
(iii) upon the Issuers request, take such steps as shall not
be disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Holder, and as
may be reasonably necessary to avoid any requirement of applicable Laws that
the Issuer make any deduction or withholding for taxes from amounts payable to
such Holder. If such Holder fails to deliver such forms, then the Issuer may
withhold from any payment to such Holder an amount equivalent to the
applicable back-up withholding tax imposed by the Code.

 

  (c) If any Governmental Authority asserts that the
Administrative Holder did not properly withhold or backup withhold, as the
case may be, any tax or other amount from payments made to or for the account
of any Holder, such Holder shall indemnify the Administrative Holder therefor,
including all penalties and interest, any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on
the amounts payable to the Administrative Holder under this Section, and
costs and expenses (including Attorney Costs) of the Administrative Holder.
The obligation of the Holders under this Section shall survive the repayment
of all other Obligations hereunder and the resignation of the Administrative
Holder. Nothing contained in this _Section 9.11(c)_ shall alter or otherwise
affect the indemnification obligations set forth in _Section 3.01_.

     

  9.12. Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction.

 

  (a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK APPLICABLE TO AGREEMENTS
MADE AND TO BE PERFORMED ENTIRELY WITHIN SUCH STATE; PROVIDED THAT THE
COLLATERAL AGENT AND EACH HOLDER SHALL RETAIN ALL RIGHTS ARISING UNDER FEDERAL
LAW.

 

  (b) THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY CONSENT, UNCONDITIONALLY AND
IRREVOCABLY, TO THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE FEDERAL AND STATE COURTS
OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND WAIVE ANY OBJECTION BASED ON VENUE OR FORUM NON
CONVENIENS WITH RESPECT TO ANY PROCEEDING RELATING TO ANY MATTER, CLAIM OR
DISPUTE ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER NOTE DOCUMENTS OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW
EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY OR
OTHERWISE OTHER THAN PURSUIT OF A JUDGMENT ON A NOTE WHERE SUIT IS ALSO
BROUGHT IN THE STATE WHERE ANY COLLATERAL IS LOCATED TO TAKE JURISDICTION OF
SUCH COLLATERAL. THE PARENT AND THE ISSUER FURTHER CONSENT, GENERALLY,
UNCONDITIONALLY AND IRREVOCABLY, TO THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE STATE
AND FEDERAL COURTS OF EACH STATE WHERE ANY COLLATERAL IS LOCATED IN RESPECT
OF ANY PROCEEDING RELATING TO ANY MATTER, CLAIM OR DISPUTE ARISING WITH
RESPECT TO SUCH COLLATERAL INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO FORECLOSURES, AND THE
PARENT AND THE ISSUER AGREE THAT COLLATERAL AGENT AND HOLDERS SHALL HAVE
THE RIGHT TO BRING ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING AGAINST THE PARENT AND THE ISSUER
OR THEIR PROPERTY IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION WHICH THE COLLATERAL
AGENT OR HOLDERS DEEM NECESSARY OR APPROPRIATE IN ORDER TO REALIZE ON THE
COLLATERAL OR OTHER SECURITY FOR THE OBLIGATIONS OR TO OTHERWISE ENFORCE ITS
RIGHTS AGAINST THE PARENT OR THE ISSUERS PROPERTY. THE PARENT AND THE ISSUER
FURTHER IRREVOCABLY WAIVE PERSONAL SERVICE OF ANY AND ALL PROCESS UPON THEM
AND CONSENT TO THE SERVICE OF PROCESS, GENERALLY, UNCONDITIONALLY AND
IRREVOCABLY, AT THE ADDRESSES SET FORTH HEREIN IN CONNECTION WITH ANY OF THE
AFORESAID PROCEEDINGS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULES APPLICABLE TO SUCH
PROCEEDINGS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PARENT AND THE
ISSUER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION WHICH THEY MAY NOW HAVE OR HAVE
IN THE FUTURE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE IN RESPECT OF ANY OF THE AFORESAID
PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT IN THE COURTS REFERRED TO ABOVE AND AGREE NOT TO PLEAD OR
CLAIM IN ANY SUCH COURT THAT ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY
SUCH COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL
AFFECT THE RIGHT OF THE COLLATERAL AGENT AND THE HOLDERS TO SERVE PROCESS IN
ANY MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW OR TO COMMENCE PROCEEDINGS OR OTHERWISE PROCEED
AGAINST ANY BORROWER IN ANY JURISDICTION. To the extent that the Parent or the
Issuer has or may hereafter acquire any immunity from the jurisdiction of any
court or from any legal process (whether through service or notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution, execution or
otherwise) with respect to the Parent or the Issuer or their respective
property, the Parent and the Issuer hereby irrevocably waive such immunity in
respect of their respective obligations under this Agreement.

 

  9.13. Waiver of Right to Trial by Jury and Other Rights. TO
THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY
KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND

     

 INTENTIONALLY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND ANY RIGHT OR CLAIM TO
ANY CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, EXPECTANCY DAMAGES, SPECIAL
DAMAGES AND GENERAL DAMAGES IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION BASED
HEREON, ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, OR ANY
COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING, STATEMENT (WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN) OR
ACTION OF ANY PARTY OR ANY EXERCISE BY ANY PARTY OF ITS RESPECTIVE RIGHTS
HEREUNDER OR IN ANY WAY RELATING TO ANY NOTE OR ANY PROPERTY (INCLUDING ANY
ACTION TO RESCIND OR CANCEL THIS AGREEMENT, AND ANY CLAIM OR DEFENSE ASSERTING
THAT THIS AGREEMENT WAS FRAUDULENTLY INDUCED OR IS OTHERWISE VOID OR
VOIDABLE). THIS WAIVER IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR THE PARTIES HERETO TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND TO CONSUMMATE THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREUNDER.

 

  9.14. Time of the Essence. For all payments to be made and all
obligations to be performed under the Note Documents, time is of the essence.

Holder delivered to the Issuer exceeds the aggregate principal amount of the
Notes of such Holder so tendered, the Issuer shall deliver to such Holder a
new Note or Notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to the amount of
such excess.

thereof for each day at the Interest Rate. All calculations of interest shall
be computed on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed.

notwithstanding, upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any Event
of Default, (i) interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding
under any Debtor Relief Law) on each outstanding Note will accrue and be
charged on the principal amount thereof for each day at the Default Rate and
(ii) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws, interest (including
post-petition interest in any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law) will
accrue and be charged for each day at the Default Rate on any payments of
interest that are not paid when due and other amounts that are then due and
payable hereunder. Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including
interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon demand. The
Issuer acknowledges and agrees that payment or acceptance of interest at the
Default Rate is not a permitted alternative to timely payment and shall not
constitute a waiver of any Event of Default or otherwise prejudice or limit
any rights or remedies of the Administrative Holder or any Holder.

 

  (c) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 2.06(b)_ ,
interest on each Note shall be due and payable in arrears on the last day of
each Interest Accrual Period applicable to such Note, on the date of any

hereunder and under the Notes shall be due and payable in accordance with the
terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the commencement
of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law.

 

  (d) Interest shall accrue on each Note for the day on which
such Note is purchased, and shall not accrue on such Note, or any portion
thereof, for the day on which such Note or such portion is redeemed,
_provided_ that any Note that is redeemed on the same day on which it is
purchased shall, subject to _Section 2.06(b)_ , bear interest for one day.

 

  2.05. Payment Records. All payments of principal and
interest made by the Issuer under this Agreement and the Notes shall be
evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by the Issuer and
each applicable Holder in the ordinary course of business. Such accounts or
records shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, of the amount of such
payments paid by the Issuer. Any failure to so

     

 record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise
affect the obligation of the Issuer hereunder to pay any amount owing with
respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the
accounts and records maintained by any Holder and the accounts and records of
the Issuer in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Issuer
shall be conclusive evidence of the matters contained therein in the absence
of demonstrable error. Each Holder may attach schedules to any of its Notes
and endorse thereon the date and amount of any payments with respect thereto.

 

  2.06. Payments Generally.

 

  (a) All payments to be made by the Issuer in respect of the
Obligations shall be made without condition or deduction for any
counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, all payments by the Issuer in respect of the Obligations
shall be made to the Holders to which such payment is owed via wire transfer
of Dollars in immediately available funds on the date such payment is due and
payable by 2:00 P.M. All payments received by any Holder after 2:00 P.M. on
the date such payments are due and payable shall be deemed to have been
received on the next succeeding Business Day, and any applicable interest
shall continue to accrue thereon until such Business Day.

 

  (b) If any payment to be made by the Issuer in respect of the
Obligations shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment
shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time
shall be reflected in computing any applicable interest.

 

  2.07. Sharing of Payments. If, other than as
expressly provided elsewhere herein, any Holder shall obtain, on account of
any Note held by it, any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the
exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable
share (or other share contemplated hereunder) thereof, such Holder shall
immediately (a) notify the Administrative Holder of such fact, and (b)
purchase from the other Holders such participations in the Notes held by them
as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Holder to share the excess
payment in respect of such Note pro rata with each of them; _provided_
that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered
from the purchasing Holder under any of the circumstances described in
_Section 9.05_ (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the
purchasing Holder in its discretion), such purchase shall to that extent be
rescinded and each other Holder shall repay to the purchasing Holder the
purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such paying
Holders ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such
paying Holders required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from
the purchasing Holder) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the
purchasing Holder in respect of the total amount so recovered, without
further interest thereon. The Administrative Holder will keep records (which
shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error) of
participations purchased under this _Section 2.07_ and will in each case
notify the Holders following any such purchases or repayments. Each Holder
that purchases a participation pursuant to this _Section 2.07_  shall from
and after such purchase have the right to give all notices,
requests, demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement
with respect to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent
as though the purchasing Holder were the original owner of the Obligations
purchased.

 

  2.08. Representations and Warranties of the Purchasers.
Each Purchaser hereby represents and warrants as follows:

 

  (a) such Purchaser (A) understands that the Notes have not
been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and the Notes are
being issued by the Issuer in a transaction exempt from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and (B) agrees that it will not sell all or
any part of the Notes and the Notes may not be offered or sold, except
pursuant to effective registration statements under

     

 the Securities Act or pursuant to applicable exemptions from registration
under the Securities Act and in compliance with applicable State laws;

 

  (b) such Purchaser further understands that the exemption
from registration afforded by Rule 144 (the provisions of which are known to
such Purchaser) promulgated under the Securities Act depends on the
satisfaction of various conditions, and that, if applicable, Rule 144 may
afford the basis for sales only in limited amounts;

 

  (c) such Purchaser did not employ any broker or finder in
connection with the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and no fees
or commissions are payable to or by such Purchaser except as otherwise
provided for in this Agreement; and

 

  (d) such Purchaser is an " _Accredited Investor_ " (as
defined in Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act). The financial position of
such Purchaser is such that it can afford to bear the economic risk of holding
the Notes. Such Purchaser can afford to suffer the complete loss of its
investment in the Notes. The knowledge and experience of such Purchaser in
financial and business matters is such that it is capable of evaluating the
risks of the investment in the Notes. Such Purchaser acknowledges that no
representations, express or implied, are being made with respect to the
Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries, the Notes or otherwise, other than those
expressly set forth herein.

 

 ARTICLE III. 
  _TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY_

 

  3.01. Taxes.

 

  (a) Any and all payments by the Issuer to or for the account
of the Administrative Holder or any Holder under any Note Document shall be
made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future
taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or
similar charges, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding (i) in
the case of the Administrative Holder and each Holder, taxes imposed on or
measured by its net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it (in lieu of
income taxes), by the jurisdiction (or any political subdivision thereof)
under the Laws of which the Administrative Holder or such Holder, as the case
may be, is organized or, in the case of each Holder, maintains its principal
office or a lending office, (ii) any branch profits taxes imposed by the U.S.
or any similar tax imposed by any other jurisdiction described in clause (i)
above, (iii) any taxes that are attributable to such Holders failure to
comply with the requirements of _Section 9.11(a)_ (other than by reason of a
change in law) or (iv) any withholding taxes imposed on amounts payable to a
Holder at the time such Holder becomes a party to this Agreement, except to
the extent that such Holders assignor (if any) was entitled, at the time
of assignment, to receive additional amounts from the Issuer with respect to
such withholding taxes pursuant to this _Section 3.01(a)_ (all such non-
excluded taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees,
withholdings or similar charges, and liabilities being hereinafter referred to
as " _Taxes_ " and those excluded, as " _Excluded Taxes_ "). If any Note
Party shall be required by any Laws to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of
any sum payable under any Note Document to any the Administrative Holder or
Holder, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after
making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional
sums payable under this Section), each of the Administrative Holder and such
Holder receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
deductions been made, (ii) the Issuer shall make such deductions, (iii) the
Issuer shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority
or other authority in accordance with applicable Laws, and (iv) within thirty
(30) days after the date of such payment, the Issuer shall furnish to the
Administrative Holder and such Holder the original or a copy of a receipt, or
other documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Holder and
such Holder, evidencing payment thereof.

     

  (b) In addition, the Issuer agrees to pay, or cause to be
paid, any and all present or future stamp, court or documentary taxes and any
other excise or property taxes or charges or similar levies which arise from
any payment made under any Note Document or from the execution, delivery,
performance, enforcement or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, any
Note Document (hereinafter referred to as " _Other Taxes_ ") and within
thirty (30) days after the date of such payment, the Issuer shall furnish to
the Administrative Holder and such Holder the original or a copy of a
receipt, or other documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative
Holder and such Holder, evidencing payment thereof.

 

  (c) Parent, together with the Issuer, (jointly and severally)
agree to indemnify the Administrative Holder and each Holder for (i) the full
amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or
asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section) paid by
the Administrative Holder and such Holder and (ii) any liability
(including additions to tax, penalties, interest and expenses) arising
therefrom or with respect thereto whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes
were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant governmental
authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability
delivered to Parent or the Issuer by a Holder or the Administrative Holder on
its own behalf shall be conclusive absent a manifest error. Payment under this
subsection (c) shall be made as promptly as practicable, but in any event
within thirty (30) days, after the date the Holder or the Administrative
Holder makes a demand therefor.

 

  (d) If the Administrative Holder or any Holder receives a
refund (including pursuant to a claim for refund made pursuant to the
preceding sentence) in respect of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has
been indemnified by the Issuer, or with respect to which the Issuer has paid
additional amounts pursuant to _Section 3.01(a)_ , it shall within 30 days
from the date of such receipt pay over the amount of such refund to the
Issuer, net of all reasonable expenses of the Administrative Holder or such
Holder and without interest (other than interest paid by the relevant
taxation authority with respect to such refund); _provided_ that the Issuer,
upon the request of the Administrative Holder or such Holder, agrees to repay
the amount paid over to the Issuer (plus penalties, interest or other
reasonable charges) to the Administrative Holder or such Holder in the event
the Administrative Holder or such Holder is required or requested to
repay such refund to such taxing authority.

 

  3.02. Illegality.

 

  (a) If any Holder determines that any Law has made it
unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it
is unlawful, for such Holder to continue to hold its Notes or to determine or
charge interest rates based upon the LIBO Rate, such Holder shall give notice
thereof to the Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Holder). Upon receipt
of such notice, the Issuer shall, upon demand from such Holder (with a copy
to the Administrative Holder), either (i) redeem all Notes, at a price equal
to 100% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Notes, of such
Holder, either on the last day of the current Interest Accrual Period in
respect of such Notes, if such Holder may lawfully continue to hold such notes
until such date, or immediately, if such Holder may not lawfully continue to
hold such Notes, or (ii) at the option of the Issuer, pay interest on such
Holders Notes at a rate per annum, as determined by such Holder, that will
provide a corresponding yield to such Holder compared to the yield that such
Holder would have realized if its Notes had continued to accrue interest at a
rate based upon the LIBO Rate (taking into account any increased cost to such
Holder of continuing to hold its Notes). Upon any such prepayment, the Issuer
shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid. Each Holder agrees
to hold its Notes through a different office of such Holder if such
designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the good
faith judgment of such Holder, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such
Holder.

     

  (b) Failure or delay on the part of any Holder to provide
notice as per _Section 3.02(a)_ shall not constitute a waiver of such
Holders rights set forth therein; _provided_ that the Issuer shall not be
required to comply with the requirements set forth in _Section 3.02(a)(i) or
(ii)_ if such Holder provides notice of the relevant change in Law or
assertion of a Governmental Authority more than one year after the occurrence
of such change in Law or assertion of a Governmental Authority; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that, if such change in Law is retroactive, then the one year
period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of
retroactive effect thereof.

 

  3.03. Matters Applicable to all Requests for Compensation.

 

  (a) The Administrative Holder or any Purchaser or any Holder
claiming compensation under this _Article III_ shall deliver to the Issuer a
certificate setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it
hereunder and accompanied by a reasonably detailed invoice therefor
and supporting calculations, which certificate shall be conclusive in the
absence of manifest error. In determining such amount the Administrative
Holder or such Purchaser or Holder may use any reasonable averaging and
attribution methods.

 

  3.04. Survival. All of the Parents and the
Issuers obligations under this _Article III_ shall survive the repayment of
all Obligations hereunder.

 

  (a) In the event that (i)(A) it becomes illegal for any
Holder to continue to hold its Notes or to determine or charge interest rates
based upon the LIBO Rate and such Holder so notifies the Issuer pursuant to
_Section 3.02_ , or (B) any Holder is required to make any payment pursuant
to  _Section 3.01_ that is attributable to a particular Holder, and (ii) in
the case of clause (i)(B) above, Holders holding at least 50% of the aggregate
principal amount outstanding of the Notes are not subject to such illegality,
payment or proceedings (any such Holder, an " _Affected Holder_ "), the Issuer
may substitute any Holder and, if reasonably acceptable to the Administrative
Holder, any other Eligible Holder (a " _Substitute Institution_ ") for such
Affected Holder hereunder, after delivery of a written notice (a "
_Substitution Notice_ ") by the Issuer to the Administrative Holder and the
Affected Holder within a reasonable time (in any case not to exceed
ninety (90) days) following the occurrence of any of the events described in
clause (i) above that the Issuer intend to make such substitution; _provided_
that, if more than one Holder claims increased costs, illegality or right to
payment arising from the same act or condition and such claims are received by
the Issuer within thirty (30) days of each other, then the Issuer may
substitute all, but not (except to the extent the Issuer have already
substituted one of such Affected Holders before the Issuers receipt of the
other Affected Holders claim) less than all, Holders making such claims.

 

  (b) If the Substitution Notice was properly issued under this
_Section 3.04_ , the Affected Holder shall sell, and the Substitute
Institution shall purchase, all rights and claims of such Affected Holder
under the Note Documents, and the Substitute Institution shall assume, and
the Affected Holder shall be relieved of all prior unperformed obligations of
the Affected Holder under the Note Documents (other than in respect of any
damages (other than exemplary or punitive damages, to the extent permitted by
applicable law) in respect of any such unperformed obligations). Such
purchase and sale (and the corresponding assignment of all rights and claims
hereunder) shall be effective on (and not earlier than) the later of (i) the
receipt by the Affected Holder of the principal amount of its Notes, together
with any other Obligations owing to it and (ii) the payment in full to the
Affected Holder in Cash of all fees, unreimbursed costs and expenses and
indemnities accrued and unpaid through such effective date. Upon the
effectiveness of such sale, purchase and assumption, the Substitute
Institution shall become a " _Holder_ " hereunder for all purposes of this
Agreement. 

 

  (c) Each Holder agrees that, if it becomes an Affected Holder
and its rights and claims are assigned hereunder to a Substitute Institution
pursuant to this _Section 3.04_ , it shall execute and deliver to

     

 the Issuer an Assignment and Assumption to evidence such assignment,
together with any Note held by it; _provided_ that the failure of any
Affected Holder to execute an Assignment and Assumption or deliver such Notes
shall not render such assignment invalid.

Administrative Holder and the Holders that:

 

  4.01. Existence, Qualification and Power; Compliance with

buy any security of a type or in a 

     

 manner which would be integrated with the sale of the Notes and require the
Notes to be registered under the Securities Act. None of the Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, any of their respective Affiliates or any person acting on
its or their behalf (other than the Holders, as to whom the Parent and its
Subsidiaries make no representation or warranty) has engaged or will engage in

executed and delivered, such additional instruments, certificates or
documents, and take such actions, as the Administrative Holder or the Holders
may reasonably request for the purposes of implementing or effectuating the
provisions of this Agreement and the other Note Documents, or of more fully
perfecting or renewing the rights of the Administrative Holder or the Holders
with respect to the Collateral (or with respect to any additions thereto or
replacements or proceeds thereof or with respect to any Capital Stock
hereafter acquired by any Note Party that may be deemed to be part of the
Collateral) pursuant hereto or thereto. Upon the exercise by the
Administrative Holder or any Holder of any power, right, privilege or remedy

  5.14. Note Refinancing. The Issuer and the Parent
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain or issue, as
promptly as possible after the date hereof, a debt facility or debt security
for the Issuer, which may be required to be guaranteed by the Parent (a "
_Replacement Financing_ "), the proceeds of which will be used to repay in
full all outstanding principal and interest on the Notes and all other
Obligations. In connection therewith, during each consecutive three-month
period following the date hereof, the Issuer and the Parent shall have
discussions with potential sources of funds for a Replacement Financing with
respect to the then current market terms on which a Replacement Financing may
be available and, to the extent that it is determined by the board of
directors of the Parent that a Replacement Financing is then available on
commercially reasonable terms, shall solicit proposals and commitments for,
and use commercially  reasonable efforts to obtain, such Replacement
Financing. The Issuer and the Parent agree that in their determination as to
whether a Replacement Financing is available on commercially reasonable
terms, the Issuer and the Parent will consider the terms of such Replacement
Financing taken as a whole, and will not reject a Replacement Financing
solely because (i) the interest rate thereunder is greater than the Interest
Rate then in effect, (ii) the Issuer will be required to make amortization
payments with respect thereto, or (iii) such Replacement Financing includes
one or more financial incurrence or maintenance covenants. Upon request, the
Issuer and the Parent will discuss with the Administrative Holder and the
Qualifying Purchasers the information provided to them with respect to the
terms on which a Replacement Financing may at such time be available.

Required Holders discretion, alternatively, successively, or concurrently on
any one or more occasions, and shall include the right to apply to a court of

 ARTICLE VIII. 
  _COLLATERAL AGENT AND ADMINISTRATIVE HOLDER_

 

  8.01. (a) Appointment and Authorization of
Collateral Agent. Each Holder hereby irrevocably appoints, designates and
authorizes the Collateral Agent to take such action as contractual
representative on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement or under
the Guaranty and Pledge Agreement and each other Note Document and to
exercise such powers and perform such duties as are

     

 expressly delegated to it by the terms of this Agreement or any other Note
Document, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere herein or
in any other Note Document, the Collateral Agent shall not have any duties or
responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, nor shall the
Collateral Agent have or be deemed to have any trustee or fiduciary
relationship with any Holder or participant, and no implied covenants,
functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read
into this Agreement or any other Note Document or otherwise exist against the
Collateral Agent.

 

  (b) Appointment and Authorization of Administrative Holder.
Each Holder hereby irrevocably appoints, designates and authorizes the
Administrative Holder to take such action as contractual representative on its
behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and each other Note Document and
to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to
it by the terms of this Agreement or any other Note Document, together with
such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary contained elsewhere herein or in any other Note
Document, the Administrative Holder shall not have any duties or
responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, nor shall the
Administrative Holder have or be deemed to have any trustee or fiduciary
relationship with any Holder or participant, and no implied covenants,
functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read
into this Agreement or any other Note Document or otherwise exist against the
Administrative Holder. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing
sentence, the use of the term " _agent_ " herein and in the other Note
Documents with reference to the Administrative Holder is not intended to
connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under
agency doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead, such term is used merely as a
matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an
administrative relationship between independent contracting parties. The
provisions of this Article VIII are solely for the benefit of the
Administrative Holder and the Holders and no Note Party shall have any rights
as a third party beneficiary of any of the provisions thereof. In performing
its functions and duties hereunder, the Administrative Holder shall act solely
as an agent of the Holders and does not assume and shall not be deemed to have
assumed any obligation towards or relationship of agency or trust with or for
any Note Party.

 

  8.02. Collateral Matters. The Holders irrevocably authorize
the Collateral Agent, at its option and in its discretion:

 

  (a) to take any action with respect to the Collateral which
may be necessary to perfect and maintain perfected the Liens upon the
Collateral granted pursuant to any of the Note Documents;

 

  (b) to release any Lien on any property granted to or held by
the Collateral Agent under any Note Document (i) upon termination of the
payment in full of all Obligations, (ii) that is sold or to be sold as part of
or in connection with any Disposition permitted hereunder or under any other
Note Document, (iii) in accordance with any provision for the release thereof
provided for in this Agreement or the other Note Documents, or (iv) subject to
_Section 9.01_ , if approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the
Required Holders;

 

  (c) to subordinate any Lien on any property granted to or
held by the Collateral Agent under any Note Document to the holder of any
Lien on such property that is permitted by _Section 6.02_ ; and

 

  (d) following any such release or subordination described in
the preceding clauses (b) and (c), to deliver to the Issuer or any other
Person, at its expense, any Collateral so released that is then held by the
Collateral Agent hereunder and to execute and deliver to the Issuer or any
other Person such releases or other documents as the Issuer or such Person
shall request to evidence or effectuate such

     

 release or subordination of Liens (including UCC termination statements,
intercreditor agreements and collateral agency agreements).

 

  (e) Upon request by the Collateral Agent at any time, the
Required Holders will confirm in writing the Collateral Agents authority to
release or subordinate its interest in particular types or items of property
pursuant to this _Section 8.02_.

 

  8.03. Duties in the Case of Enforcement. In case one of
more Events of Default have occurred and shall be continuing, the Collateral
Agent shall, if (a) so requested (or consented to) by the Administrative
Holder or the Required Holders and (b) the Holders have provided to the
Collateral Agent such additional indemnities and assurances against expenses
and liabilities as the Collateral Agent may reasonably request, proceed to
enforce the provisions of any Note Documents authorizing the sale or other
disposition of all or any part of the Collateral (or any other property which
is security for the Obligations) and exercise all or any such other legal and
equitable and other rights or remedies as it may have in respect of such
Collateral (or such other property). The Required Holders may direct
the Collateral Agent in writing as to the method and the extent of any such
sale or other disposition to the extent permitted under the terms hereof, the
Holders hereby agreeing to indemnify and hold the Collateral Agent harmless
from all liabilities incurred in respect of all actions taken or omitted in
accordance with such directions, _provided_ that the Collateral Agent need not
comply with any such direction to the extent that the Collateral Agent
reasonably believes the Collateral Agents compliance with such direction to
be unlawful or commercially unreasonable in any applicable jurisdiction.

 

  8.04. Right to Indemnity. Each Holder, in proportion to its
Pro Rata Share at the time any claim therefor is made, severally agrees to
indemnify the Agents, to the extent that the Agents shall not have been
reimbursed by any Note Party (but without limiting any Note Partys
reimbursement obligations), for and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses (including counsel fees and disbursements) or disbursements of any
kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against the Agents in exercising its powers, rights and remedies or performing
its duties hereunder or under the other Note Documents or otherwise in its
capacity as Agents in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or
the other Note Documents; _provided_ , no Holder shall be liable for any
portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting solely from the
Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct. If any indemnity furnished to
the Agents for any purpose shall, in the opinion of the Agents, be
insufficient or become impaired, the Agents may call for additional indemnity
and cease, or not commence, to do the acts indemnified against until such
additional indemnity is furnished; provided, in no event shall this sentence
require any Holder to indemnify the Agents against any liability, obligation,
loss, damage, penalty, action, judgment, suit, cost, expense or disbursement
in excess of such Holders Pro Rata Share thereof; and _provided_ , _further_
, this sentence shall not be deemed to require any Holder to indemnify the
Agents against any liability, obligation, loss, damage, penalty, action,
judgment, suit, cost, expense or disbursement described in the proviso in the
immediately preceding sentence.

 

  8.05. General Immunity.

 

  (a) _No Responsibility for Certain Matters_. The
Administrative Holder shall not be responsible to any Holder for
the execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability,
collectibility or sufficiency hereof or any other Note Document or for any
representations, warranties, recitals or statements made herein or therein or
made in any written or oral statements or in any financial or other
statements, instruments, reports or certificates or any other documents
furnished or made by any Holders or by or on behalf of any Note Party in
connection with the Note Documents and the transactions contemplated thereby
or for the financial condition or business affairs of any Note Party or any
other

     

 Person liable for the payment of any Obligations, nor shall the
Administrative Holder be required to ascertain or inquire as to the
performance or observance of any of the terms, conditions, provisions,
covenants or agreements contained in any of the Note Documents or as to the
use of the proceeds of the Notes or as to the existence or possible existence
of any Event of Default or Default or to make any disclosures with respect to
the foregoing. Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding,
Administrative Holder shall not have any liability arising from confirmations
of the outstanding amount of the Notes.

 

  (b) _Exculpatory Provisions_. Neither the Administrative
Holder, the Collateral Agent, nor any of their respective officers, partners,
directors, employees or agents shall be liable to Holders for any action taken
or omitted by the Administrative Holder or the Collateral Agent under or in
connection with any of the Note Documents except to the extent caused by the
Administrative Holders or Collateral Agents gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Agents shall be entitled to refrain from any act or the taking
of any action (including the failure to take an action) in connection herewith
or any of the other Note Documents or from the exercise of any power,
discretion or authority vested in it hereunder or thereunder unless and until
the Administrative Holder shall have received instructions in respect thereof
from the Required Holders (or such other Holders as may be required to give
such instructions under Section 9.01) and, upon receipt of such instructions
from the Required Holders (or such other Holders, as the case may be), the
Agents shall be entitled to act or (where so instructed) refrain from acting,
or to exercise such power, discretion or authority, in accordance with such
instructions. Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, (i) each
Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying,
upon any communication, instrument or document believed by it to be genuine
and correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person or Persons,
and shall be entitled to rely and shall be protected in relying on opinions
and judgments of attorneys (who may be attorneys for Issuer and/or other Note
Parties), accountants, experts and other professional advisors selected by it;
and (ii) no Holder shall have any right of action whatsoever against the Admin
Holder as a result of its acting or (where so instructed) refraining from
acting hereunder or any of the other Note Documents in accordance with the
instructions of the Required Holders (or such other Holders as may be required
to give such instructions under Section 9.01).

 

  (c) _Delegation of Duties_. The Administrative Holder may
perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers under
this Agreement or under any other Note Document by or through any one or more
sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Holder. The Administrative Holder
and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise
its rights and powers by or through their respective Affiliates. The
exculpatory, indemnification and other provisions of this Agreement (including
Section 8.02) shall apply to the Affiliates of the Administrative Holder. All
of the rights, benefits, and privileges (including the exculpatory and
indemnification provisions) of this Section 8.02 shall apply to any such
subagent and to the Affiliates of any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their
respective activities as sub-agent as if such sub-agent and Affiliates were
named herein. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to
each sub-agent appointed by Administrative Holder, (i) such sub-agent shall be
a third party beneficiary under this Agreement with respect to all such
rights, benefits and privileges (including exculpatory rights and rights to
indemnification) and shall have all of the rights and benefits of a third
party beneficiary, including an independent right of action to enforce such
rights, benefits and privileges (including exculpatory rights and rights to
indemnification) directly, without the consent or joinder of any other Person,
against any or all of the Note Parties and the Holders, (ii) such rights,
benefits and privileges (including exculpatory rights and rights to
indemnification) shall not be modified or amended without the consent of such
sub-agent, and (iii) such sub-agent shall only have obligations to
Administrative Holder and not to any Note Party, Holder or any other Person
and no Note Party, Holder or any other Person shall have any rights, directly
or indirectly, as a third party beneficiary or otherwise, against such sub-
agent.

     

  8.06. Successor Administrative Holder. The Administrative
Holder may resign at any time by giving twenty days prior written notice
thereof to the Holders and the Issuer. Upon any such notice of resignation,
the Required Holders shall have the right to appoint a successor
Administrative Holder. The Administrative Holders resignation shall become
effective on the earlier of (a) twenty days after delivery by the
Administrative Holder of the notice referred to in the first sentence of this
_Section 8.06_ and (b) the date on which a successor Administrative Holder
shall have been appointed (the " _Resignation Date_ "). On the Resignation
Date, such retiring Administrative Holder shall be discharged from its duties
and obligations hereunder. After any retiring Administrative Holders
resignation hereunder as Administrative Holder, the provisions of this Article
VIII shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be
taken by it while it was Administrative Holder hereunder.

connection with any amendment, supplement or modification to this Agreement
and the other Note Documents, entered into at the request of any Note Party
(in each case, whether or not the transactions contemplated thereby shall be
consummated), including the Attorney Costs of one principal counsel for the
Required Holders and the Agents, (b) to pay or reimburse each Holder and the
Agents for all their costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
enforcement or preservation of any rights under this Agreement, the other Note
Documents and any other documents prepared in connection herewith or
therewith, including without limitation, Attorney Costs of one principal
counsel (unless such principal counsel may not represent all Holders as a
result of a conflict of interest of such Holders with respect to the
Obligations) for all Holders, and Attorney Costs for counsel to the Agents,
(c) to pay, indemnify, or reimburse each Holder and the Agents for, and hold
each Holder and the Agents harmless from, any and all costs and reasonable
expenses of perfecting and recording the Liens granted with respect to the
Collateral, including all recording and filing fees, and any and all
liabilities with respect to, or resulting from any delay in paying delinquent
or non-payment of any stamp, excise and similar taxes, if any, which may be
payable or determined to be payable in connection with the execution and
delivery of, or consummation or administration of any of the transactions
contemplated by, or any amendment, supplement or modification of, or any
waiver or consent under or in respect of, this Agreement, the other Note
Documents and any such other documents, and (d) to pay, indemnify or reimburse
each Holder, the Agents, their respective Affiliates, and their respective
officers, directors, trustees, employees, advisors, agents and controlling
Persons (each, an " _Indemnitee_ ") for, and hold each Indemnitee harmless
from and against, any and all other liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the execution,
delivery, enforcement, performance and administration of this Agreement, the
other Note Documents and any such other documents, whether direct, indirect
or consequential and whether based on any Laws (including securities and
environmental Laws), that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against
any such Indemnitee, in any manner relating to or arising out of any Note
Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including the
Holders agreement to receive the Notes hereunder), including, without
limitation, the fees and disbursements and other charges of legal counsel in
connection with claims, actions or proceedings by any Indemnitee against the
Issuer hereunder (all the foregoing in this clause (d), collectively, the "
_Indemnified Liabilities_ "), _provided_ that the Parent and the Issuer shall
have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnitee with respect to Indemnified
Liabilities to the extent such Indemnified Liabilities are found by a final
and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have
resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee.
All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly after written
demand therefor. Statements payable by the Issuer pursuant to this Section
shall be submitted to the Issuer at the address of the Issuer set forth in
_Schedule 9.02_ , or to such other Person or address as may be hereafter
designated by the Issuer in a notice to the Holders and the Administrative
Holder. To the extent that the undertakings to defend, 

     

 indemnify, pay and hold harmless set forth in this _Section 9.04_ may be
unenforceable in whole or in part because they are violative of any law
or public policy, the applicable Note Party shall contribute the maximum
portion that it is permitted to pay and satisfy under applicable law to the
payment and satisfaction of all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by
Indemnitees or any of them. The agreements in this Section shall survive
repayment of the Notes and all other amounts payable hereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section (other than clause (c) above)
shall not apply to any tax-related matter.

 

  9.05. Payments Set Aside. To the extent that any payment by
or on behalf of the Issuer is made to the Administrative Holder or any
Holder, or the Administrative Holder, or any Holder exercises its right of
set-off, and such payment or the proceeds of such set-off or any part thereof
is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set
aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the
Administrative Holder or such Holder in its discretion) to be repaid to a
trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under
any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery,
the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be
revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not
been made or such set-off had not occurred, and (b) each Holder severally
agrees to pay to the Administrative Holder upon demand its applicable share of
any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative Holder, plus
interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such payment is
made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in
effect.

to any such transfer, sale or assignment, Triarc and its Designated Persons
shall hold Notes (with respect to which it or any such Designated Person has
not sold a participation or granted a pledge or created a security interest)
having an aggregate principal amount outstanding in excess of 50% of the Total
Series A and Series B Outstandings on the effective date of such transfer,
sale or assignment;

 

  _provided_ , in each case of any assignment, sale or other transfer
pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii) above that (A) each of the Issuer and the
Administrative Holder shall have been given prior written notice of such
transfer, sale or assignment,(B) each such transfer, sale or assignment shall
be in a minimum principal amount of $500,000 or such lesser amount consented

transfer, sale or assignment shall execute and deliver to the Issuer (with a
copy to the Administrative Agent), for recording in the Register (as
hereinafter defined) an Assignment and Assumption, together with any Notes
subject to such assignment. Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and
recording, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and
Assumption, which effective date shall be at least five (5) Business Days
after the execution thereof, (1) the assignee thereunder shall be a party
hereto and, to the extent provided in such Assignment and Assumption, have the
rights and obligations of a Holder hereunder, and (2) the assigning Holder
thereunder shall, to the extent provided in such Assignment and Assumption,
be released from its obligations under this Agreement.

 

 

  (b) _Certain Representations and Warranties; Limitations;
Covenants_. By executing and delivering an Assignment and Assumption, the
parties to the assignment thereunder confirm to and agree with each other and
the other parties hereto as follows:

 

 

  (i) the assignee under such Assignment and Assumption is
acquiring Notes for its own account, for investment and not with a view to
any distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act;

 

  (ii) such assignee (A) understands that the Notes have not
been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and the Notes are
being issued by the Issuer in a transaction exempt from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and (B) agrees that it will not sell all or
any part of the Notes and the Notes may not be offered or sold, except
pursuant to effective registration statements under the Securities Act or
pursuant to applicable exemptions from registration under the Securities Act
and in compliance with applicable State laws;

 

  (iii) such assignee further understands that the exemption
from registration afforded by Rule 144 (the provisions of which are known to
the assignee) promulgated under the Securities Act depends on the satisfaction
of various conditions, and that, if applicable, Rule 144 may afford the basis
for sales only in limited amounts;

 

  (iv) such assignee is an " _Accredited Investor_ " (as
defined in Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act). The financial position of
such assignee is such that it can afford to bear the economic risk of holding
the Notes. Such assignee can afford to suffer the complete loss of
its investment in the Notes. The knowledge and experience of such assignee in
financial and business matters is such that it is capable of evaluating the
risks of the investment in the Notes. Such assignee acknowledges that no
representations, express or implied, are being made with respect to the
Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries, the Notes or otherwise, other than those
expressly set forth herein.

 

    

 

  (v) Except as disclosed in writing by each assignee, the
source of funds to be used by such assignee to pay the purchase price of the
Notes purchased by such assignee hereunder does not include assets of any
employee benefit plan (other than a plan exempt from the coverage of ERISA) or
plan or any other entity the assets of which consist of " _plan assets_ " as
defined in Department of Labor regulation Section 2510.3 -101. As used herein,
the term " _employee benefit plan_ " shall have the meaning assigned to such
term in Section 3 of ERISA, and the term " _plan_ " shall have the meaning
assigned thereto in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code.

 

  (vi) other than the representation and warranty that it is
the legal and beneficial owner of the interest being assigned thereby free
and clear of any adverse claim, the assigning Holder makes no representation
or warranty, express or implied, and assumes no responsibility with respect to
any statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with
this Agreement or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability,
genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement, the other Note Documents
or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or the
attachment, perfection or priority of any security interest or mortgage,

 

  (vii) the assigning Holder makes no representation or
warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to the
financial condition of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries or any other Person
primarily or secondarily liable in respect of any of the Obligations, or the
performance or observance by the Note Parties or any other Person primarily or
secondarily liable in respect of any of the Obligations of any of its
obligations under this Agreement or any of the other Note Documents or any
other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto;

 

  (viii) such assignee confirms that it has received a copy of
this Agreement, together with copies of the most recent financial statements
referred to in _Section 5.01_ and such other documents and information as it
has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to
enter into such Assignment and Assumption;

 

  (ix) such assignee will, independently and without reliance
upon the assigning Holder, the Administrative Holder or any other Holder and
based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the
time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action
under this Agreement;

 

  (x) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Agents to take
such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this
Agreement and the other Note Documents as are delegated to the Agents by the
terms hereof or thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably
incidental thereto;

 

  (xi) such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance
with this Agreement and the other Note Documents all of the obligations that
by the terms thereof are required to be performed by it as a Holder;

 

  (xii) such assignee represents and warrants that it is
legally authorized to enter into such Assignment and Assumption; and

 

  (xiii) such assignee acknowledges that it has complied with
the provisions of _Section 9.11_ to the extent applicable.

 

 

  (c) _Register_. The Issuer shall maintain a copy of each
Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation
of the names and addresses of the Holders, and of the principal amounts of the
Notes (and any interest thereon) owing to, each Holder pursuant to the terms
hereof from

  

 52    

 time to time (the " _Register_ "). The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive absent demonstrable error, and the Issuer, the
Administrative Holder and the Holders may treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Holder hereunder
for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.
The Register shall be available for inspection by the Issuer, the
Administrative Holder and any Holder, at any reasonable time and from time to
time upon reasonable prior notice.

 

  (d) _New Notes_. Upon its receipt of an Assignment and
Assumption executed by the parties to such assignment, the Issuer shall (i)
record the information contained therein in the Register and (ii) give prompt
notice thereof to the Issuer and the Holders (other than the assigning
Holder). Promptly after the effectiveness of any assignment by any Holder of
all or any portion of such Holders Notes, the Issuer (at its expense) shall
execute and deliver (x) to the assignee Holder, one or more Notes in an
aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of Notes
assigned to such assignee Holder and (y) to the assignor Holder, one or more
Notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal
amount, if any, of the Notes delivered by such Assignor Holder to the Issuer
that were not assigned to such assignee Holder.

 

  (e) _Participations_. Any Holder may from time to time and at
any time, without the consent of any Note Party, sell participations in all
or any portion of such Holders Notes to any other Person (other than a
Restricted Entity) that invests in notes, loans, or similar securities;
_provided_ that the terms of any such participation shall not entitle the
participant to direct such Holder as to the manner in which it votes in
connection with any amendment, supplement or other modification of this
Agreement or any waiver or consent with respect to any departure from the
terms hereof, in each case unless and to the extent that the subject matter
thereof is one as to which the consent of all Holders is required in order
to approve the same and _provided_ , _further_ , that after giving effect to
any participations pursuant to this clause (e), Triarc (and its Affiliates)
shall hold Notes with respect to which it has not sold a participation in
excess of 50% of the Total Series A and Series B Outstandings on the effective
date of such participation.

 

  (f) _Pledges_. Any Holder may from time to time and at any
time after the Assignment Trigger Date, without the consent of any Note
Party, pledge, collaterally assign or grant a security interest in all or any
portion of such Holders Notes to any other Person (other than a Restricted
Entity); _provided_ that no such pledge, collateral assignment or grant of
security interest shall act as a substitution of the applicable pledgee or
assignee for such Holder as a party to this Agreement or any other Note
Document except, in the case of a subsequent foreclosure, if such foreclosure
is made in compliance with the other provisions of this _Section 9.06_ ; and 
_provided_ , _further_ , that after giving effect to any such pledge,
collateral assignment or grant of security interest pursuant to this clause
(f), Triarc (and its Affiliates) shall hold Notes in excess of 50% of the
Total Series A and Series B Outstandings that are not subject to any, pledge,
collaterally assignment or any security interests. 

 

  (g) _Assignment by the Issuer_. Neither the Parent nor the
Issuer shall assign or transfer any of their respective rights or obligations
under this Agreement or any of the other Note Documents without the prior
written consent of the Administrative Holder and each of the Holders.

 

  (h) _Satisfaction of Indemnification Obligations_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any
Holder may from time to time, without the consent of any Note Party, assign,
transfer or deliver all or any portion of such Holders Notes to the Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries in satisfaction, in whole or in part, of such
Holders indemnification obligations under the Merger Agreement in accordance
with the terms thereof.

     

  9.07. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

 

  9.08. Integration. This Agreement, together with the other
Note Documents, comprises the complete and integrated agreement of the
parties on the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior
agreements, written or oral, on such subject matter. In the event of any
conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and those of any other Note
Document, the provisions of this Agreement shall control; _provided_ that the
inclusion of supplemental rights or remedies in favor of the Agents or
Holders in any other Note Document shall not be deemed a conflict with this
Agreement. Each Note Document was drafted with the joint participation of the
respective parties thereto and shall be construed neither against nor in favor
of any party, but rather in accordance with the fair meaning thereof.

 

  9.09. Survival of Representations and Warranties.
All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Note
Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in
connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery
hereof and thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or will be
relied upon by the Administrative Holder and each Holder, regardless of any
investigation made by the Administrative Holder or any Holder or on their
behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Holder or any Holder may
have had notice or knowledge of any Default or Event of Default at the time
any Note is purchased hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect
as long as any Note or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or
unsatisfied.

 

  9.10. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or
the other Note Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a)
the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this
Agreement and the other Note Documents shall not be affected or impaired
thereby and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to
replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions
the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision
in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such
provision in any other jurisdiction.

 

  9.11. Tax Forms.

 

  (a) Each Holder that is not a " _United States person_ "
within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a " _Foreign Holder_ ")
shall deliver to the Issuer and the Administrative Holder, prior to receipt
of any payment subject to withholding under the Code (or upon accepting an
assignment of an interest herein) or upon the reasonable request of the Issuer
or the Administrative Holder, two duly signed completed copies of either IRS
Form W-8BEN or any successor thereto (relating to such Foreign Holder and
entitling it to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax on all
payments to be made to such Foreign Holder by the Issuer pursuant to this
Agreement) or IRS Form W-8ECI or any successor thereto (relating to all
payments to be made to such Foreign Holder by the Issuer pursuant to this
Agreement) or, in the case of a Foreign Holder claiming exemption from U.S.
withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to
payments of " _portfolio interest_ ," a Form W-8BEN or any successor thereto
(and, if such Foreign Holder delivers a Form W-8, a certificate
representing that such Foreign Holder is not a bank for purposes of Section
881(c) of the Code, is not a 10-percent shareholder (within the meaning of
Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code) of the Issuer and is not a controlled
foreign corporation related to the Issuer (within the meaning of Section
864(d)(4) of the Code)) claiming complete exemption from U.S. withholding tax.
Thereafter and from time to time, each such Foreign Holder shall (A) promptly
submit to the Issuer and the Administrative Holder such additional duly
completed and signed copies of one of such forms (or such successor forms as
shall be adopted from time to time by the relevant United States taxing
authorities) as may then be required under then current United States laws
and regulations to avoid or reduce, or such evidence as is satisfactory to
the Issuer and the

     

 Administrative Holder of any available exemption from or reduction of,
United States withholding taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such
Foreign Holder by the Issuer pursuant to this Agreement, (B) promptly notify
the Issuer and the Administrative Holder of any change in circumstances which
would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption and (C) upon the Issuers
request, take such steps as shall not be disadvantageous to it, in
the reasonable judgment of such Holder, and as may be reasonably necessary to
avoid any requirement of applicable Laws that the Issuer make any deduction or
withholding for taxes from amounts payable to such Foreign Holder.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Foreign Holder shall not
be required to deliver any form pursuant to this _Section 9.11(a)_ that it is
not entitled or otherwise legally able to deliver. 

 

  (b) Each Holder that is a " _United States person_ " within
the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall deliver to the Issuer and
the Administrative Holder, prior to receipt of any payment subject to
withholding under the Code (or upon accepting an assignment of an interest
herein) or upon request of the Issuer or the Administrative Holder two duly
signed completed copies of IRS Form W-9. Thereafter and from time to time,
each such Holder shall (i) promptly submit to the Issuer and the
Administrative Holder such additional duly completed and signed copies of
such form (or such successor form as shall be adopted from time to time by the
relevant United States taxing authorities) as may then be required under then
current United States laws and regulations to avoid, or such evidence as is
satisfactory to the Issuer and the Administrative Holder of any available
exemption from, United States backup withholding taxes in respect of all
payments to be made to such Holder by the Issuer pursuant to this Agreement,
(ii) promptly notify the Issuer and the Administrative Holder of any change in
circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption, and
(iii) upon the Issuers request, take such steps as shall not
be disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Holder, and as
may be reasonably necessary to avoid any requirement of applicable Laws that
the Issuer make any deduction or withholding for taxes from amounts payable to
such Holder. If such Holder fails to deliver such forms, then the Issuer may
withhold from any payment to such Holder an amount equivalent to the
applicable back-up withholding tax imposed by the Code.

 

  (c) If any Governmental Authority asserts that the
Administrative Holder did not properly withhold or backup withhold, as the
case may be, any tax or other amount from payments made to or for the account
of any Holder, such Holder shall indemnify the Administrative Holder therefor,
including all penalties and interest, any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on
the amounts payable to the Administrative Holder under this Section, and
costs and expenses (including Attorney Costs) of the Administrative Holder.
The obligation of the Holders under this Section shall survive the repayment
of all other Obligations hereunder and the resignation of the Administrative
Holder. Nothing contained in this _Section 9.11(c)_ shall alter or otherwise
affect the indemnification obligations set forth in _Section 3.01_.

 

  9.12. Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction.

 

  (a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK APPLICABLE TO AGREEMENTS
MADE AND TO BE PERFORMED ENTIRELY WITHIN SUCH STATE; PROVIDED THAT THE
COLLATERAL AGENT AND EACH HOLDER SHALL RETAIN ALL RIGHTS ARISING UNDER FEDERAL
LAW.

 

  (b) THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY CONSENT, UNCONDITIONALLY AND
IRREVOCABLY, TO THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE FEDERAL AND STATE COURTS
OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND WAIVE ANY OBJECTION BASED ON VENUE OR FORUM NON
CONVENIENS WITH RESPECT TO ANY PROCEEDING RELATING TO ANY MATTER, CLAIM OR
DISPUTE ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER NOTE DOCUMENTS OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY IN EACH

     

 CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
TORT, EQUITY OR OTHERWISE OTHER THAN PURSUIT OF A JUDGMENT ON A NOTE WHERE
SUIT IS ALSO BROUGHT IN THE STATE WHERE ANY COLLATERAL IS LOCATED TO
TAKE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COLLATERAL. THE PARENT AND THE ISSUER FURTHER
CONSENT, GENERALLY, UNCONDITIONALLY AND IRREVOCABLY, TO THE NONEXCLUSIVE
JURISDICTION OF THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS OF EACH STATE WHERE ANY
COLLATERAL IS LOCATED IN RESPECT OF ANY PROCEEDING RELATING TO ANY MATTER,
CLAIM OR DISPUTE ARISING WITH RESPECT TO SUCH COLLATERAL INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO FORECLOSURES, AND THE PARENT AND THE ISSUER AGREE THAT COLLATERAL
AGENT AND HOLDERS SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO BRING ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING
AGAINST THE PARENT AND THE ISSUER OR THEIR PROPERTY IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER
JURISDICTION WHICH THE COLLATERAL AGENT OR HOLDERS DEEM NECESSARY OR
APPROPRIATE IN ORDER TO REALIZE ON THE COLLATERAL OR OTHER SECURITY FOR THE
OBLIGATIONS OR TO OTHERWISE ENFORCE ITS RIGHTS AGAINST THE PARENT OR THE
ISSUERS PROPERTY. THE PARENT AND THE ISSUER FURTHER IRREVOCABLY WAIVE
PERSONAL SERVICE OF ANY AND ALL PROCESS UPON THEM AND CONSENT TO THE SERVICE
OF PROCESS, GENERALLY, UNCONDITIONALLY AND IRREVOCABLY, AT THE ADDRESSES SET
FORTH HEREIN IN CONNECTION WITH ANY OF THE AFORESAID PROCEEDINGS IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE RULES APPLICABLE TO SUCH PROCEEDINGS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, THE PARENT AND THE ISSUER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY
OBJECTION WHICH THEY MAY NOW HAVE OR HAVE IN THE FUTURE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE
IN RESPECT OF ANY OF THE AFORESAID PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT IN THE COURTS REFERRED
TO ABOVE AND AGREE NOT TO PLEAD OR CLAIM IN ANY SUCH COURT THAT ANY SUCH
ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN
INCONVENIENT FORUM. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHT OF THE COLLATERAL
AGENT AND THE HOLDERS TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW OR TO
COMMENCE PROCEEDINGS OR OTHERWISE PROCEED AGAINST ANY BORROWER IN ANY
JURISDICTION. To the extent that the Parent or the Issuer has or may hereafter
acquire any immunity from the jurisdiction of any court or from any legal
process (whether through service or notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to the
Parent or the Issuer or their respective property, the Parent and the Issuer
hereby irrevocably waive such immunity in respect of their respective
obligations under this Agreement.

 

  9.13. Waiver of Right to Trial by Jury and Other Rights. TO
THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY KNOWINGLY,
VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND ANY RIGHT
OR CLAIM TO ANY CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, EXPECTANCY DAMAGES,
SPECIAL DAMAGES AND GENERAL DAMAGES IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION BASED
HEREON, ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, OR ANY
COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING, STATEMENT (WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN) OR
ACTION OF ANY PARTY OR ANY EXERCISE BY ANY PARTY OF ITS RESPECTIVE RIGHTS
HEREUNDER OR IN ANY WAY RELATING TO ANY NOTE OR ANY PROPERTY (INCLUDING ANY
ACTION TO RESCIND OR CANCEL THIS AGREEMENT, AND ANY CLAIM OR DEFENSE ASSERTING
THAT THIS AGREEMENT WAS FRAUDULENTLY INDUCED OR IS OTHERWISE VOID OR
VOIDABLE). THIS WAIVER IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR THE PARTIES HERETO TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND TO CONSUMMATE THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREUNDER.

     

  9.14. Time of the Essence. For all payments to be made and
all obligations to be performed under the Note Documents, time is of the
essence.

 ARTICLE II 
  
 GUARANTY

 

  _Section 2.1_ _Guaranty_. To induce the Purchasers to receive the
Notes as payment in full of the Aggregate Note Consideration, each Guarantor
hereby, jointly and severally, absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, the full and punctual
payment when due, whether at stated maturity or earlier, by reason of
acceleration, mandatory prepayment or otherwise in accordance with any Note
Document, of all the Obligations of the Issuer whether existing on the date
hereof or hereinafter incurred or created (the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ ").
This Guaranty by each Guarantor hereunder constitutes a guaranty of payment
and not of collection.

 

  _Section 2.2_ _Limitation of Guaranty_. Any term or provision of this
Guaranty or any other Note Document to the contrary notwithstanding, the
maximum aggregate amount for which any Subsidiary Guarantor shall be liable
hereunder shall not exceed the maximum amount for which such Subsidiary
Guarantor can be liable without rendering this Guaranty or any other Note
Document, as it relates to such Subsidiary Guarantor, subject to avoidance
under applicable Requirements of Law relating to fraudulent conveyance or
fraudulent transfer (including the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the
Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act and Section 548 of title 11 of the United
States Code or any applicable provisions of comparable Requirements of

     

 Law) (collectively, " _Fraudulent Transfer Laws_ "). Any analysis of the
provisions of this Guaranty for purposes of Fraudulent Transfer Laws shall
take into account the right of contribution established in _Section 2.3_ and,
for purposes of such analysis, give effect to any discharge of intercompany
debt as a result of any payment made under the Guaranty.

 

  _Section 2.3_ _Contribution_. To the extent that any Subsidiary
Guarantor shall be required hereunder to pay any portion of any Guaranteed
Obligation exceeding the greater of (a) the amount of the value actually
received by such Subsidiary Guarantor from the Acquisition and (b) the amount
such Subsidiary Guarantor would otherwise have paid if such Subsidiary
Guarantor had paid the aggregate amount of the Guaranteed Obligations
(excluding the amount thereof repaid by the Issuer and the Parent) in the same
proportion as such Subsidiary Guarantors net worth on the date enforcement
is sought hereunder bears to the aggregate net worth of all the Subsidiary
Guarantors on such date, then such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be reimbursed by
such other Subsidiary Guarantors for the amount of such excess, pro
rata, based on the respective net worth of such other Subsidiary Guarantors
on such date. The rights of the Subsidiary Guarantors set forth in this
Section 2.3 shall not be construed in any way to limit the liability of any
Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder. 

 

  _Section 2.4_ _Authorization; Other Agreements_. The Secured Parties
are hereby authorized, without notice to or demand upon any Guarantor and
without discharging or otherwise affecting the obligations of any Guarantor
hereunder and without incurring any liability hereunder, from time to time, to
do each of the following:

 

  (a) (i) modify, amend, supplement or otherwise change, (ii)
accelerate or otherwise change the time or place of payment or increase the
rate of interest or (iii) waive or otherwise consent to noncompliance with,
any Guaranteed Obligation or any Note Document;

 

  (b) apply to the Guaranteed Obligations any sums by whomever paid
or however realized to any Guaranteed Obligation in such order as provided in
the Note Documents;

 

  (c) refund at any time any payment received by any Secured Party
in respect of any Guaranteed Obligation;

 

  (d) (i) sell, exchange, enforce, waive, substitute, liquidate,
terminate, release, abandon, fail to perfect, subordinate, accept,
substitute, surrender, exchange, affect, impair or otherwise alter or release
any Pledged Collateral for any Guaranteed Obligation or any other guaranty
therefor in any manner, (ii) receive, take and hold additional Pledged
Collateral to secure any Guaranteed Obligation, (iii) add, release or
substitute any one or more other Guarantors, makers or endorsers of any
Guaranteed Obligation or any part thereof and (iv) otherwise deal in any
manner with the Issuer and any Guarantor, maker or endorser of any Guaranteed
Obligation or any part thereof; and

 

  (e) settle, release, compromise, collect or otherwise liquidate
the Guaranteed Obligations.

 

  _Section 2.5_ _Guaranty Absolute and Unconditional_. Each Guarantor
hereby waives and agrees not to assert any defense, whether arising in
connection with or in respect of any of the following or otherwise, and hereby
agrees that its obligations under this Guaranty are irrevocable, absolute and
unconditional and shall not be discharged as a result of or otherwise
affected by any of the following (which may not be pleaded and evidence of
which may not be introduced in any

     

 proceeding with respect to this Guaranty, in each case except as otherwise
agreed in writing by the Collateral Agent):

 

  (a) the invalidity or unenforceability of any obligation of the
Issuer or any Guarantor under any Note Document or any other agreement or
instrument relating thereto (including any amendment, consent or waiver
thereto), or any security for, or other guaranty of, any Guaranteed Obligation
or any part thereof, or the lack of perfection or continuing perfection
or failure of priority of any security for the Guaranteed Obligations or any
part thereof;

 

  (b) the absence of (i) any attempt to collect any Guaranteed
Obligation or any part thereof from the Issuer or any Guarantor or other
action to enforce the same or (ii) any action to enforce any Note Document or
any Lien thereunder;

 

  (c) the failure by any Person to take any steps to perfect and
maintain any Lien on, or to preserve any rights with respect to, any Pledged
Collateral;

 

  (d) any workout, insolvency, bankruptcy proceeding,
reorganization, arrangement, liquidation or dissolution by or against the
Issuer, any Guarantor or any other Subsidiaries of the Parent or any
procedure, agreement, order, stipulation, election, action or omission
thereunder, including any discharge or disallowance of, or bar or stay against
collecting, any Guaranteed Obligation (or any interest thereon) in or as a
result of any such proceeding;

 

  (e) any foreclosure, whether or not through judicial sale, and any
other sale of any Pledged Collateral or any election following the occurrence
of an Event of Default by any Secured Party to proceed separately against any
Pledged Collateral in accordance with such Secured Partys rights under any
applicable Requirement of Law; or

 

  (f) any other defense, setoff, counterclaim or any other
circumstance that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge
of the Issuer, any Guarantor or any of the other Subsidiaries of the Parent,
in each case other than the payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations.

 

  _Section 2.6_ _Waivers_. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives and agrees
not to assert any claim, defense, setoff or counterclaim based on diligence,
promptness, presentment, requirements for any demand or notice hereunder
including any of the following: (a) any demand for payment or performance and
protest and notice of protest; (b) any notice of acceptance; (c) any
presentment, demand, protest or further notice or other requirements of any
kind with respect to any Guaranteed Obligation (including any accrued but
unpaid interest thereon) becoming immediately due and payable; (d) the right
to require any Secured Party, as a condition to payment or performance by such
Guarantor, to proceed against the Issuer or any other Guarantor; (e) any
defense based upon a statute or rule of law which provides that the obligation
of a surety must be neither larger in amount or more burdensome than that of
the principal; (f) any defense based upon any Secured Partys errors
or omissions and (g) any other notice in respect of any Guaranteed Obligation
or any part thereof, and any defense arising by reason of any disability or
lack of authority or other defense of the Issuer or any Guarantor. Each
Guarantor further unconditionally and irrevocably agrees not to (x) enforce
or otherwise exercise any right of subrogation or any right of reimbursement
or contribution or similar right against the Issuer or any Guarantor by reason
of any Note Document or any payment made thereunder or (y) assert any claim,
defense, setoff or counterclaim it may have against any other Note Party or
set off any

     

 of its obligations to such other Note Party against obligations of such Note
Party to such Guarantor. No obligation of any Guarantor hereunder shall be
discharged other than by complete performance.

 

  _Section 2.7_ _Reliance_. Each Guarantor hereby assumes responsibility
for keeping itself informed of the financial condition of the Issuer, each
Guarantor and any other guarantor, maker or endorser of any Guaranteed
Obligation or any part thereof, and of all other circumstances bearing upon
the risk of nonpayment of any Guaranteed Obligation or any part thereof that
diligent inquiry would reveal, and each Guarantor hereby agrees that no
Secured Party shall have any duty to advise any Guarantor of information known
to it regarding such condition or any such circumstances. In the event any
Secured Party, in its sole discretion, undertakes at any time or from time to
time to provide any such information to any Guarantor, such Secured Party
shall be under no obligation to (a) undertake any investigation not a part of
its regular business routine, (b) disclose any information that such Secured
Party, pursuant to accepted or reasonable commercial finance or banking
practices, wishes to maintain confidential or (c) make any future disclosures
of such information or any other information to any Guarantor.

 GRANT OF SECURITY INTEREST

 

  _Section 3.1_ _Grant of Security Interest in Pledged Collateral_.
Each Grantor, as collateral security for the prompt and complete payment and
performance when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or
otherwise) of the Obligations of such Grantor (the " _Secured Obligations_
"), hereby mortgages, pledges and hypothecates to the Collateral Agent for the
benefit of the Secured Parties, and grants to the Collateral Agent for the
benefit of the Secured Parties a Lien on and security interest in, all of its
right, title and interest in, to and under the Pledged Collateral of such
Grantor.

 

 ARTICLE IV

 

 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

 

  To induce the Purchasers, the Holders and the Collateral Agent to
enter into the Note Documents, each Grantor hereby represents and warrants
each of the following to the Collateral Agent, the Purchasers, the Holders
and the other Secured Parties:

 

  _Section 4.1_ _Title; No Other Liens_. Except for the Lien granted to
the Collateral Agent pursuant to this Agreement and other Liens permitted
pursuant to clauses (a), (c) and (f) of Section 6.02 of the Note Purchase
Agreement, such Grantor owns each item of the Pledged Collateral free and
clear of any and all Liens or claims of others. Such Grantor (a) is the
record and beneficial owner of the Pledged Collateral pledged by it hereunder
constituting instruments or certificates and (b) has rights in or the power to
transfer each other item of Pledged Collateral in which a Lien is granted by
it hereunder, free and clear of any other Lien.

 

  _Section 4.2_ _Perfection and Priority_. The security interest
granted pursuant to this Agreement constitutes a valid and continuing
perfected security interest in favor of the Collateral Agent in all Pledged
Collateral subject to the completion of the filings of UCC financing
statements and other actions specified on  _Schedule 1_ (which, in the case
of all filings and other documents referred to on such schedule, have been
delivered to the Collateral Agent in completed

     

 and duly authorized form). Such security interest shall be prior to all
other Liens on the Pledged Collateral except for the Liens permitted by
clauses (a) and (f) of Section 6.02 of the Note Purchase Agreement
having priority over the Collateral Agents Lien by operation of law or
permitted pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement upon the delivery of all
Pledged Certificated Stock to the Collateral Agent, properly endorsed for
transfer to the Collateral Agent or in blank. Except as set forth in this
_Section 4.2_ , all actions by each Grantor necessary to protect and perfect
the Lien granted hereunder on the Pledged Collateral have been duly taken.

 

  _Section 4.3_ _Jurisdiction of Organization; Chief Executive Office_.
Such Grantors jurisdiction of organization, legal name and organizational
identification number, if any, and the location of such Grantors chief
executive office or sole place of business, in each case as of the date
hereof, is specified on  _Schedule 2_.

 

  _Section 4.4_ _Pledged Collateral_. (a) The Pledged Stock pledged by
such Grantor hereunder (a) is listed on _Schedule 3_ and constitutes that
percentage of the issued and outstanding equity of all classes of each issuer
thereof as set forth on  _Schedule 3_ , (b) has been duly authorized, validly
issued and is fully paid and nonassessable (other than Pledged Stock in
limited liability companies and partnerships) and (c) constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligation of the obligor with respect thereto, enforceable
in accordance with its terms and (d) except as set forth on Schedule 3, no
Capital Stock owned by any Grantor as of the date hereof constitutes Excluded
Pledged Collateral.

 

  (b) As of the Closing Date, all Pledged Collateral (other than
Pledged Uncertificated Stock) has been delivered to the Collateral Agent in
accordance with _Section 5.3(a)_.

 

  _Section 4.5_ _Enforcement_. No Permit, notice to or filing with
any Governmental Authority or any other Person or any consent from any Person
is required for the exercise by the Collateral Agent of its rights (including
voting rights) provided for in this Agreement or the enforcement of remedies
in respect of the Pledged Collateral pursuant to this Agreement, including
the transfer of any Pledged Collateral, except as may be required in
connection with the disposition of any portion of the Pledged Collateral by
laws affecting the offering and sale of securities generally.

 

  _Section 4.6_ _Representations and Warranties of the Note Purchase
Agreement_. The representations and warranties as to such Grantor made in
_Article IV_ ( _Representations and Warranties_ ) of the Note Purchase
Agreement are true and correct on the Closing Date and may be relied upon by
each of the Secured Parties.

 

 ARTICLE V 
  
 COVENANTS

 

  Each Grantor agrees with the Collateral Agent to the following, as
long as any Obligation remains outstanding (other than contingent
indemnification Obligations to the extent no claim giving rise thereto has
been asserted):

Documentation and_ _Consents_.

 

  (a) _Generally_. Such Grantor shall not, unless otherwise

Collateral.

 

  (b) Such Grantor shall maintain the security interest created by
this Agreement as a perfected security interest having at least the priority
described in _Section 4.2_ and shall defend such security interest and such
priority against the claims and demands of all Persons.

 

  (c) At any time and from time to time, upon the written request of
the Collateral Agent, such Grantor shall, for the purpose of obtaining or
preserving the full benefits of this Agreement and of the rights and powers

further documents, including an authorization to file (or, as applicable, the
filing) of any financing statement or amendment under the UCC (or other
filings under similar Requirements of Law) in effect in any jurisdiction with
respect to the security interest created hereby.

the Collateral Agent of all documents reasonably requested by the Collateral
Agent to maintain the validity, perfection and priority of the security
interests provided for herein, such Grantor shall not do any of the following:

>
>  
>
>   (ii) change its legal name or organizational identification
> number, if any, or corporation, limited liability company, partnership or

   _Section 5.3_ _Pledged Collateral_.

 

  (a) _Delivery of Pledged Collateral_. Such Grantor shall deliver
to the Collateral Agent, in suitable form for transfer and in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent all Pledged
Certificated Stock.

continuance of an Event of Default, the Collateral Agent shall have the
right, at any time in its sole discretion, to (i) transfer to or to register
in its name or in the name of its nominees any Pledged Collateral and (ii)
exchange any certificate or instrument representing or evidencing any Pledged
Collateral for certificates or instruments of smaller or larger denominations.

 

  (c) _Cash Distributions with respect to Pledged Collateral_.
Except during the continuance of an Event of Default or as otherwise provided
in _Article VI_ and subject to the

     

 limitations set forth in the Note Purchase Agreement, such Grantor shall be
entitled to receive all cash distributions paid in respect of the Pledged
Collateral.

 

  (d) _Voting Rights_. Except as provided in _Article VI_ , such
Grantor shall be entitled to exercise all voting, consent and corporate,
partnership, limited liability company and similar rights with respect to the
Pledged Collateral;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no vote shall be cast,
consent given or right exercised or other action taken by such Grantor that
would impair the Pledged Collateral or be inconsistent with or result in any
violation of any provision of any Note Document.

 

  _Section 5.4_ _Compliance with Note Purchase Agreement_. Such Grantor
agrees to comply with all covenants and other provisions applicable to it
under the Note Purchase Agreement and agrees to the same submission to
jurisdiction as that agreed to by the Issuer in the Note Purchase Agreement.

 

 ARTICLE VI

 

 REMEDIAL PROVISIONS

 

   _Section 6.1_ _Code and Other Remedies_.

 

  (a) _UCC Remedies_. During the continuance of an Event of Default,
the Collateral Agent may exercise, in addition to all other rights and
remedies granted to it in this Agreement and in any other instrument or
agreement securing, evidencing or relating to any Secured Obligation, all
rights and remedies of a secured party under the UCC or any other applicable
law.

 

  (b) _Disposition of Collateral._ Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, during the continuance of an Event of Default, the
Collateral Agent may, without demand of performance or other demand,
presentment, protest, advertisement or notice of any kind (except any notice
required by any applicable law) to or upon any Grantor or any other Person
(all and each of which demands, defenses, advertisements and notices are
hereby waived), (personally or through its agents or attorneys), (i) collect,
receive, appropriate and realize upon any Pledged Collateral and (ii) sell,
assign, convey, transfer, grant option or options to purchase and deliver any
Pledged Collateral (or enter into Contractual Obligations to do any of the
foregoing), in one or more parcels at public or private sale or sales, at any
exchange, brokers board or office of any Secured Party or elsewhere upon
such terms and conditions as it may deem advisable and at such prices as it
may deem best, for cash or on credit or for future delivery without assumption
of any credit risk. The Administrative Agent shall have the right, upon any
such public sale or sales and, to the extent permitted by the UCC and other
applicable Requirements of Law, upon any such private sale, to purchase the
whole or any part of the Pledged Collateral so sold, free of any right or
equity of redemption of any Grantor, which right or equity is hereby waived
and released.

 

  (c) _Application of Proceeds._ The Collateral Agent shall apply
the cash proceeds of any action taken by it pursuant to this _Section 6.1_ ,
after deducting all reasonable costs and expenses of every kind incurred in
connection therewith or incidental to the care or safekeeping of any Pledged
Collateral or in any way relating to the Pledged Collateral or the rights of
the Collateral Agent and any other Secured Party hereunder, including
reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements, to the payment in whole or in
part of the Secured Obligations,

     

 as set forth in the Note Purchase Agreement, and only after such application
and after the payment by the Collateral Agent of any other amount required by
any Requirement of Law, need the Collateral Agent account for the surplus, if
any, to any Grantor.

 

  (d) _Direct Obligation_. Neither the Collateral Agent nor any
other Secured Party shall be required to make any demand upon, or pursue or
exhaust any right or remedy against, any Grantor, any other Note Party or any
other Person with respect to the payment of the Obligations or to pursue or
exhaust any right or remedy with respect to any Pledged Collateral therefor
or any direct or indirect guaranty thereof. All of the rights and remedies of
the Collateral Agent and any other Secured Party under any Note Document shall
be cumulative, may be exercised individually or concurrently and not
exclusive of any other rights or remedies provided by any Requirement of Law.
To the extent it may lawfully do so, each Grantor absolutely and irrevocably
waives and relinquishes the benefit and advantage of, and covenants not to
assert against the Collateral Agent or any Secured Party, any valuation, stay,
appraisement, extension, redemption or similar laws and any and all rights or
defenses it may have as a surety, now or hereafter existing, arising out of
the exercise by them of any rights hereunder. If any notice of a proposed
sale or other disposition of any Pledged Collateral shall be required by law,
such notice shall be deemed reasonable and proper if given at least 10 days
before such sale or other disposition.

 

  _Section 6.2_ _Pledged Collateral_. (a) _Voting Rights_. During the
continuance of an Event of Default, upon notice by the Collateral Agent to the
relevant Grantor or Grantors, the Collateral Agent or its nominee may exercise
(A) any voting, consent, corporate and other right pertaining to the Pledged
Collateral at any meeting of shareholders, partners or members, as the case
may be, of the relevant issuer or issuers of Pledged Collateral or otherwise
and (B) any right of conversion, exchange and subscription and any other
right, privilege or option pertaining to the Pledged Collateral as if it were
the absolute owner thereof (including the right to exchange at its discretion
any Pledged Collateral upon the merger, amalgamation, consolidation,
reorganization, recapitalization or other fundamental change in the corporate
or equivalent structure of any issuer of Pledged Stock, the right to deposit
and deliver any Pledged Collateral with any committee, depositary, transfer
agent, registrar or other designated agency upon such terms and conditions as
the Collateral Agent may determine), all without liability except to account
for property actually received by it; _provided_ , _however_ , that subject to
any applicable law, the Collateral Agent shall have no duty to any Grantor to
exercise any such right, privilege or option and shall not be responsible for
any failure to do so or delay in so doing.

 

  (b) _Proxies_. In order to permit the Collateral Agent to exercise
the voting and other consensual rights that it may be entitled to exercise
pursuant to this Section and to receive all dividends and other distributions
that it may be entitled to receive pursuant to this Section, (i) each Grantor
shall promptly execute and deliver (or cause to be executed and delivered) to
the Collateral Agent all such proxies, dividend payment orders and other
instruments as the Collateral Agent may from time to time reasonably request
and (ii) without limiting the effect of  _clause (i)_ above, such Grantor
hereby grants to the Collateral Agent an irrevocable proxy to vote all or any
part of the Pledged Collateral and to exercise all other rights, powers,
privileges and remedies to which a holder of the Pledged Collateral would be
entitled (including giving or withholding written consents of shareholders,
partners or members, as the case may be, calling special meetings of
shareholders, partners or members, as the case may be, and voting at such
meetings), which proxy shall be effective, automatically and without the
necessity of any action (including any transfer of any Pledged Collateral on
the record books of

     

 the issuer thereof) by any other person (including the issuer of such
Pledged Collateral or any officer or agent thereof) during the continuance of
an Event of Default and which proxy shall terminate upon the cure or
waiver of any Event of Default then existing or the payment in full of the
Secured Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations to the
extent no claim giving rise thereto has been asserted).

 

  (c) _Authorization of the Issuer_. Each Grantor hereby expressly
irrevocably authorizes and instructs, without any further instructions from
such Grantor, each issuer of any Pledged Collateral pledged hereunder by such
Grantor to (i) comply with any instruction received by it from the Collateral
Agent in writing that states that an Event of Default is continuing and each
Grantor agrees that such issuer shall be fully protected from Liabilities to
such Grantor in so complying and (ii) unless otherwise expressly permitted
hereby or the Note Purchase Agreement, pay any dividend or make any other
payment with respect to the Pledged Collateral directly to the Collateral
Agent.

 

  _Section 6.3_ _Proceeds to be Turned over to and Held by Collateral
Agent_. Unless otherwise expressly provided in the Note Purchase Agreement or
this Agreement, all proceeds of any Pledged Collateral received by any Grantor
hereunder in cash or Cash Equivalents at any time when an Event of Default
shall be continuing shall be held by such Grantor in trust for the Collateral
Agent and the other Secured Parties, segregated from other funds of such
Grantor, and shall, promptly upon receipt by any Grantor, be turned over to
the Collateral Agent in the exact form received (with any necessary
endorsement). All such proceeds of Pledged Collateral and any other proceeds
of any Pledged Collateral received by the Collateral Agent in cash or Cash
Equivalents shall be held by the Collateral Agent in a cash
collateral account. All proceeds being held by the Collateral Agent in a cash
collateral account (or by such Grantor in trust for the Collateral Agent)
shall continue to be held as collateral security for the Secured Obligations
and shall not constitute payment thereof until applied as provided in the
Note Purchase Agreement.

 

  _Section 6.4_ _Sale of Pledged Collateral_.

 

  (a) Each Grantor recognizes that the Collateral Agent may be
unable to effect a public sale of any Pledged Collateral by reason of certain
prohibitions contained in the Securities Act and applicable state or foreign
securities laws or otherwise or may determine that a public sale is
impracticable, not desirable or not commercially reasonable and, accordingly,
may resort to one or more private sales thereof to a restricted group of
purchasers that shall be obliged to agree, among other things, to acquire such
securities for their own account for investment and not with a view to the
distribution or resale thereof. Each Grantor acknowledges and agrees that any
such private sale may result in prices and other terms less favorable than if
such sale were a public sale and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, that any such private sale
shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner. The
Collateral Agent shall be under no obligation to delay a sale of any Pledged
Collateral for the period of time necessary to permit the issuer thereof to
register such securities for public sale under the Securities Act or under
applicable state securities laws even if such issuer would agree to do so.

 

  (b) Each Grantor agrees to use its best efforts to do or cause to
be done all such other acts as may be necessary to make such sale or sales of
any portion of the Pledged Collateral pursuant to _Section 6.1_ and this
_Section 6.4_ valid and binding and in compliance with all applicable
Requirements of Law. Each Grantor further agrees that a breach of any covenant
contained herein will cause irreparable injury to the Collateral Agent and
other Secured Parties, 

     

 that the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties have no adequate
remedy at law in respect of such breach and, as a consequence, that each and
every covenant contained herein shall be specifically enforceable
against such Grantor, and such Grantor hereby waives and agrees not to assert
any defense against an action for specific performance of such covenants
except for a defense that no Event of Default is continuing under the Note
Purchase Agreement. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each
Grantor waives any and all rights of contribution or subrogation upon the sale
or disposition of all or any portion of the Pledged Collateral by Collateral
Agent.

 

  _Section 6.5_ _Deficiency_. Each Grantor shall remain liable for
any deficiency if the proceeds of any sale or other disposition of any
Pledged Collateral are insufficient to pay the Secured Obligations and the
fees and disbursements of any attorney employed by the Collateral Agent or any
other Secured Party to collect such deficiency.

 COLLATERAL AGENT

 

  _Section 7.1_ _Collateral Agent s Appointment as Attorney-in-Fact_.

 

  (a) Each Grantor hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the
Collateral Agent and any Related Person thereof, with full power of

such Grantor or in its own name, for the purpose of carrying out the terms of
the Note Documents, to take any appropriate action and to execute any
document or instrument that may be necessary to accomplish the purposes of the
Note Documents, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each
Grantor hereby gives the Collateral Agent and its Related Persons the power
and right, on behalf of such Grantor, without notice to or assent by such
Grantor, to do any of the following when an Event of Default shall be
continuing:

>
>  

      

>  
>
>  due or to become due at any time in respect of or arising out of any
> Pledged Collateral, (C) commence and prosecute any suit, action or
> proceeding at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction to
> collect any Pledged Collateral and to enforce any other right in respect of
> any Pledged Collateral, (D) defend any actions, suits, proceedings, audits,
> claims, demands, orders or disputes brought against such Grantor with
> respect to any Pledged Collateral, (E) settle, compromise or adjust any
> such actions, suits, proceedings, audits, claims, demands, orders or

> completely as though the Collateral Agent were the absolute owner thereof
> for all purposes and do, at the Collateral Agents option, at any time or
> from time to time, all acts and things that the Collateral Agent deems
> necessary to protect, preserve or realize upon any Pledged Collateral and
> the Secured Parties security interests therein and to effect the intent of
> the Note Documents, all as fully and effectively as such Grantor might do.
>
>  
>
>   (v) If any Grantor fails to perform or comply with any

>
>  

  

  The Collateral Agent agrees that except in connection with the
exercise of any powers granted in clause (ii) above, it shall not exercise any
power or authority granted under the Power of Attorney provided for in this
_Section 7.1(a)_ unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.

 

  (b) The expenses of the Collateral Agent incurred in connection
with actions undertaken as provided in this  _Section 7.1_ , together with
interest thereon at a rate set forth in _Section 2.04(b)_ of the Note
Purchase Agreement, from the date of payment by the Collateral Agent to the
date reimbursed by the relevant Grantor, shall be payable by such Grantor to
the Collateral Agent on demand.

 

  (c) Each Grantor hereby ratifies all that said attorneys shall
lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue of this  _Section 7.1_. All powers,
authorizations and agencies contained in this Agreement are coupled with an
interest and are irrevocable until this Agreement is terminated and
the security interests created hereby are released.

 

  _Section 7.2_ _Authorization to File Financing Statements_. Each
Grantor authorizes the Collateral Agent and its Related Persons, at any time
and from time to time, to file or record financing statements, amendments
thereto, and other filing or recording documents or instruments with respect
to any Pledged Collateral in such form and in such offices as the Collateral
Agent reasonably determines appropriate to perfect the security interests of
the Collateral Agent under this Agreement. Such Grantor also hereby ratifies
its authorization for the Collateral Agent to have filed any initial
financing statement or amendment thereto under the UCC (or other similar laws)
in effect in any jurisdiction if filed prior to the date hereof.

 

  _Section 7.3_ _Authority of Collateral Agent_. Each Grantor
acknowledges that the rights and responsibilities of the Collateral Agent
under this Agreement with respect to any action taken by the Collateral Agent
or the exercise or non-exercise by the Collateral Agent of any

     

 option, voting right, request, judgment or other right or remedy provided
for herein or resulting or arising out of this Agreement shall, as between the
Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties, be governed by the Note
Purchase Agreement and by such other agreements with respect thereto as may
exist from time to time among them, but, as between the Collateral Agent and
the Grantors, the Collateral Agent shall be conclusively presumed to be acting
as agent for the Secured Parties with full and valid authority so to act or
refrain from acting, and no Grantor shall be under any obligation or
entitlement to make any inquiry respecting such authority.

 

  _Section 7.4_ _Duty; Obligations and Liabilities_.

 

  (a) _Duty of Collateral Agent_. Subject to any applicable law, the
Collateral Agents sole duty with respect to the custody, safekeeping and
physical preservation of the Pledged Collateral in its possession shall be to
deal with it in the same manner as the Collateral Agent deals with similar
property for its own account. The powers conferred on the Collateral Agent
hereunder are solely to protect the Collateral Agents interest in the Pledged
Collateral and shall not, subject to applicable law, impose any duty upon the
Collateral Agent to exercise any such powers. The Collateral Agent shall be
accountable only for amounts that it receives as a result of the exercise of
such powers, and neither it nor any of its Related Persons shall be
responsible to any Grantor for any act or failure to act hereunder, except
for their own gross negligence or willful misconduct as finally determined by
a court of competent jurisdiction. In addition, the Collateral Agent shall not
be liable or responsible for any loss or damage to any Pledged Collateral, or
for any diminution in the value thereof, by reason of the act or omission of
any warehousemen, carrier, forwarding agency, consignee or other bailee if
such Person has been selected by the Collateral Agent in good faith.

 

  (b) _Obligations and Liabilities with respect to Pledged
Collateral_. No Secured Party and no Related Person thereof shall be liable
for failure to demand, collect or realize upon any Pledged Collateral or for
any delay in doing so or shall be under any obligation to sell or otherwise
dispose of any Pledged Collateral upon the request of any Grantor or any
other Person or to take any other action whatsoever with regard to any Pledged
Collateral. The powers conferred on the Collateral Agent hereunder shall not
impose any duty upon any other Secured Party to exercise any such powers. The
other Secured Parties shall be accountable only for amounts that they actually
receive as a result of the exercise of such powers, and neither they nor any
of their respective officers, directors, employees or agents shall
be responsible to any Grantor for any act or failure to act hereunder, except
for their own gross negligence or willful misconduct as finally determined by
a court of competent jurisdiction.

 

 ARTICLE VIII 
  
 MISCELLANEOUS

 

  _Section 8.1_ _Reinstatement_. Each Grantor agrees that, if any
payment made by any Note Party or other Person and applied to the Secured
Obligations is at any time annulled, avoided, set aside, rescinded,
invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential or otherwise required
to be refunded or repaid, or the proceeds of any Pledged Collateral are
required to be returned by any Secured Party to such Note Party, its estate,
trustee, receiver or any other party, including any Grantor, under any
bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then, to
the extent of such payment or repayment, any Lien or other Pledged Collateral
securing such liability shall be and remain in full force and effect, as fully
as if such payment had never been made. If, prior to any of the foregoing, (a)
any Lien or other Pledged Collateral

     

 securing such Grantors liability hereunder shall have been released or
terminated by virtue of the foregoing or (b) any provision of the Guaranty
hereunder shall have been terminated, cancelled or surrendered, such Lien,
other Pledged Collateral or provision shall be reinstated in full force and
effect and such prior release, termination, cancellation or surrender shall
not diminish, release, discharge, impair or otherwise affect the obligations
of any such Grantor in respect of any Lien or other Pledged Collateral
securing such obligation or the amount of such payment.

 

  _Section 8.2_ _Release of Pledged Collateral_.

 

  (a) At the time provided in Section 8.02(b) of the Note Purchase
Agreement, the Pledged Collateral shall automatically be released from the
Lien created hereby and this Agreement and all obligations (other than those
expressly stated to survive such termination) of the Collateral Agent and each
Grantor hereunder shall terminate, all without delivery of any instrument or
performance of any act by any party, and all rights to the Pledged Collateral
shall revert to the Grantors. Each Grantor is hereby authorized to file UCC
amendments at such time evidencing the termination of the Liens so released.
At the request and expense of any Grantor following any such termination, the
Collateral Agent shall deliver to such Grantor any Pledged Collateral of such
Grantor held by the Collateral Agent hereunder and execute and deliver to such
Grantor such documents as such Grantor shall reasonably request to evidence
such termination.

 

  (b) If the Collateral Agent shall be directed or permitted
pursuant to Section 8.02(b) of the Note Purchase Agreement to release any
Lien or any Pledged Collateral, such Pledged Collateral shall be released from
the Lien created hereby to the extent provided under, and subject to the terms
and conditions set forth in Section 8.02(b) of the Note Purchase Agreement.
In connection therewith, the Collateral Agent, at the request of any Grantor,
shall execute and deliver to such Grantor such documents as such Grantor shall
reasonably request to evidence such release.

 

  (c) Each Grantor shall automatically and without any further
action be released from its obligations hereunder in the event that the
Capital Stock of such Grantor shall be sold to any Person in a transaction
permitted by the Note Purchase Agreement. At the request and expense of the
Parent or any other Grantor, the Collateral Agent shall execute and deliver to
the Parent or such Grantor such documents as the Parent or such Grantor shall
reasonably request to evidence such release.

 

  _Section 8.3_ _Independent Obligations_. The obligations of each
Grantor hereunder are independent of and separate from the Secured
Obligations and the Guaranteed Obligations. If any Secured Obligation or
Guaranteed Obligation is not paid when due, or upon any Event of Default, the
Collateral Agent may, at its sole election, proceed directly and at once
against any Grantor and any Pledged Collateral to collect and recover the full
amount of any Secured Obligation or Guaranteed Obligation then due, without
first proceeding against any other Grantor, any other Note Party or any other
Pledged Collateral and without first joining any other Grantor or any other
Note Party in any proceeding.

 

  _Section 8.4_ _No Waiver by Course of Conduct_. No Secured Party shall
by any act (except by a written instrument pursuant to _Section 8.5_ ),
delay, indulgence, omission or otherwise be deemed to have waived any right or
remedy hereunder or to have acquiesced in any Default or Event of Default. No
failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on the part of any Secured
Party, any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof. No single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege
hereunder shall preclude any other or further

     

 exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. A
waiver by any Secured Party of any right or remedy hereunder on any one
occasion shall not be construed as a bar to any right or remedy that
such Secured Party would otherwise have on any future occasion.

 

  _Section 8.5_ _Amendments in Writing_. None of the terms or provisions
of this Agreement may be waived, amended, supplemented or otherwise modified
except in accordance with _Section 9.01_ of the Note Purchase Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that annexes to this Agreement may be supplemented
(but no existing provisions may be modified and no Pledged Collateral may be
released) through Pledge Amendments and Joinder Agreements, in substantially
the form of _Annex 1_ and _Annex 2_ , respectively, in each case duly
executed by the Collateral Agent and each Grantor directly affected thereby.

 

  _Section 8.6_ _Additional Grantors; Additional Pledged Collateral_.

 

  (a) _Joinder Agreements_. If, at the option of the Issuer or as
required pursuant to _Section 5.10_ of the Note Purchase Agreement, the
Issuer shall cause any Guarantor or any Person that pursuant to
_Section 5.10_ of the Note Purchase Agreement is required to become a
Guarantor and that is not a Grantor to become a Grantor hereunder, such Person
shall execute and deliver to the Collateral Agent a Joinder
Agreement substantially in the form of _Annex 2_ and shall thereafter for all
purposes be a party hereto and have the same rights, benefits and obligations
as a Grantor party hereto on the Closing Date.

 

  (b) _Pledge Amendments_. To the extent any Pledged Collateral
(other than pledged uncertificated stock) has not been delivered as of the
Closing Date, such Grantor shall deliver a pledge amendment duly executed by
the Grantor in substantially the form of _Annex 1_ (each, a " _Pledge
Amendment_ "). Such Grantor authorizes the Collateral Agent to attach each
Pledge Amendment to this Agreement.

 

  _Section 8.7_ _Notices_. All notices, requests and demands to or upon
the Collateral Agent or any Grantor hereunder shall be effected in the manner
provided for in _Section 9.02_ of the Note Purchase Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such notice, request or demand to or upon any Grantor
shall be addressed to the Issuers notice address set forth in such _Section
9.02_.

 

  _Section 8.8_ _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be
binding upon the successors and assigns of each Grantor and shall inure to
the benefit of each Secured Party and their successors and assigns; _provided_
, _however_ , that no Grantor may assign, transfer or delegate any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the Collateral Agent.

 

  _Section 8.9_ _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts and by different parties in separate counterparts,
each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of
which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Signature
pages may be detached from multiple separate counterparts and attached to a
single counterpart. Delivery of an executed signature page of this Agreement
by facsimile transmission or by electronic transmission shall be as effective
as delivery of a manually executed counterpart hereof.

 

  _Section 8.10_ _Severability_. Any provision of this Agreement being
held illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall not affect
any part of such provision not held illegal,

     

 invalid or unenforceable, any other provision of this Agreement or any part
of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

 

  _Section 8.11_ _Governing Law_. This Agreement and the rights and
obligations of the parties hereto shall be governed by, and construed and
interpreted in accordance with, the law of the State of New York.

 

  _Section 8.12_ _W_ _AIVER OF_ _J_ _URY_ _T_ _RIAL_. EACH PARTY HERETO
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH
RESPECT TO, OR DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION
WITH, ANY NOTE DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREIN OR RELATED
THERETO (WHETHER FOUNDED IN CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY
HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO OTHER PARTY AND NO RELATED PERSON OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER
AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
_SECTION 8.12_.

 

  EACH GRANTOR AGREES TO BE BOUND BY THE PROVISIONS OF _SECTION
9.12(B)_ OF THE NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT.

 ARTICLE II 
  
 GUARANTY

 

  _Section 2.1_ _Guaranty_. To induce the Purchasers to receive the
Notes as payment in full of the Aggregate Note Consideration, each Guarantor
hereby, jointly and severally, absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, the full and punctual
payment when due, whether at stated maturity or earlier, by reason of
acceleration, mandatory prepayment or otherwise in accordance with any Note
Document, of all the Obligations of the Issuer whether existing on the date
hereof or hereinafter incurred or created (the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ ").
This Guaranty by each Guarantor hereunder constitutes a guaranty of payment
and not of collection.

 

  _Section 2.2_ _Limitation of Guaranty_. Any term or provision of this
Guaranty or any other Note Document to the contrary notwithstanding, the
maximum aggregate amount for which any Subsidiary Guarantor shall be liable
hereunder shall not exceed the maximum amount for which such Subsidiary
Guarantor can be liable without rendering this Guaranty or any other Note
Document, as it relates to such Subsidiary Guarantor, subject to avoidance
under applicable Requirements of Law relating to fraudulent conveyance or
fraudulent transfer (including the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the
Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act and Section 548 of title 11 of the United
States Code or any applicable provisions of comparable Requirements of

     

 Law) (collectively, " _Fraudulent Transfer Laws_ "). Any analysis of the
provisions of this Guaranty for purposes of Fraudulent Transfer Laws shall
take into account the right of contribution established in _Section 2.3_ and,
for purposes of such analysis, give effect to any discharge of intercompany
debt as a result of any payment made under the Guaranty.

 

  _Section 2.3_ _Contribution_. To the extent that any Subsidiary
Guarantor shall be required hereunder to pay any portion of any Guaranteed
Obligation exceeding the greater of (a) the amount of the value actually
received by such Subsidiary Guarantor from the Acquisition and (b) the amount
such Subsidiary Guarantor would otherwise have paid if such Subsidiary
Guarantor had paid the aggregate amount of the Guaranteed Obligations
(excluding the amount thereof repaid by the Issuer and the Parent) in the same
proportion as such Subsidiary Guarantors net worth on the date enforcement
is sought hereunder bears to the aggregate net worth of all the Subsidiary
Guarantors on such date, then such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be reimbursed by
such other Subsidiary Guarantors for the amount of such excess, pro
rata, based on the respective net worth of such other Subsidiary Guarantors
on such date. The rights of the Subsidiary Guarantors set forth in this
Section 2.3 shall not be construed in any way to limit the liability of any
Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder. 

 

  _Section 2.4_ _Authorization; Other Agreements_. The Secured Parties
are hereby authorized, without notice to or demand upon any Guarantor and
without discharging or otherwise affecting the obligations of any Guarantor
hereunder and without incurring any liability hereunder, from time to time, to
do each of the following:

 

  (a) (i) modify, amend, supplement or otherwise change, (ii)
accelerate or otherwise change the time or place of payment or increase the
rate of interest or (iii) waive or otherwise consent to noncompliance with,
any Guaranteed Obligation or any Note Document;

 

  (b) apply to the Guaranteed Obligations any sums by whomever paid
or however realized to any Guaranteed Obligation in such order as provided in
the Note Documents;

 

  (c) refund at any time any payment received by any Secured Party
in respect of any Guaranteed Obligation;

 

  (d) (i) sell, exchange, enforce, waive, substitute, liquidate,
terminate, release, abandon, fail to perfect, subordinate, accept,
substitute, surrender, exchange, affect, impair or otherwise alter or release
any Pledged Collateral for any Guaranteed Obligation or any other guaranty
therefor in any manner, (ii) receive, take and hold additional Pledged
Collateral to secure any Guaranteed Obligation, (iii) add, release or
substitute any one or more other Guarantors, makers or endorsers of any
Guaranteed Obligation or any part thereof and (iv) otherwise deal in any
manner with the Issuer and any Guarantor, maker or endorser of any Guaranteed
Obligation or any part thereof; and

 

  (e) settle, release, compromise, collect or otherwise liquidate
the Guaranteed Obligations.

 

  _Section 2.5_ _Guaranty Absolute and Unconditional_. Each Guarantor
hereby waives and agrees not to assert any defense, whether arising in
connection with or in respect of any of the following or otherwise, and hereby
agrees that its obligations under this Guaranty are irrevocable, absolute and
unconditional and shall not be discharged as a result of or otherwise
affected by any of the following (which may not be pleaded and evidence of
which may not be introduced in any

     

 proceeding with respect to this Guaranty, in each case except as otherwise
agreed in writing by the Collateral Agent):

 

  (a) the invalidity or unenforceability of any obligation of the
Issuer or any Guarantor under any Note Document or any other agreement or
instrument relating thereto (including any amendment, consent or waiver
thereto), or any security for, or other guaranty of, any Guaranteed Obligation
or any part thereof, or the lack of perfection or continuing perfection
or failure of priority of any security for the Guaranteed Obligations or any
part thereof;

 

  (b) the absence of (i) any attempt to collect any Guaranteed
Obligation or any part thereof from the Issuer or any Guarantor or other
action to enforce the same or (ii) any action to enforce any Note Document or
any Lien thereunder;

 

  (c) the failure by any Person to take any steps to perfect and
maintain any Lien on, or to preserve any rights with respect to, any Pledged
Collateral;

 

  (d) any workout, insolvency, bankruptcy proceeding,
reorganization, arrangement, liquidation or dissolution by or against the
Issuer, any Guarantor or any other Subsidiaries of the Parent or any
procedure, agreement, order, stipulation, election, action or omission
thereunder, including any discharge or disallowance of, or bar or stay against
collecting, any Guaranteed Obligation (or any interest thereon) in or as a
result of any such proceeding;

 

  (e) any foreclosure, whether or not through judicial sale, and any
other sale of any Pledged Collateral or any election following the occurrence
of an Event of Default by any Secured Party to proceed separately against any
Pledged Collateral in accordance with such Secured Partys rights under any
applicable Requirement of Law; or

 

  (f) any other defense, setoff, counterclaim or any other
circumstance that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge
of the Issuer, any Guarantor or any of the other Subsidiaries of the Parent,
in each case other than the payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations.

 

  _Section 2.6_ _Waivers_. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives and agrees
not to assert any claim, defense, setoff or counterclaim based on diligence,
promptness, presentment, requirements for any demand or notice hereunder
including any of the following: (a) any demand for payment or performance and
protest and notice of protest; (b) any notice of acceptance; (c) any
presentment, demand, protest or further notice or other requirements of any
kind with respect to any Guaranteed Obligation (including any accrued but
unpaid interest thereon) becoming immediately due and payable; (d) the right
to require any Secured Party, as a condition to payment or performance by such
Guarantor, to proceed against the Issuer or any other Guarantor; (e) any
defense based upon a statute or rule of law which provides that the obligation
of a surety must be neither larger in amount or more burdensome than that of
the principal; (f) any defense based upon any Secured Partys errors
or omissions and (g) any other notice in respect of any Guaranteed Obligation
or any part thereof, and any defense arising by reason of any disability or
lack of authority or other defense of the Issuer or any Guarantor. Each
Guarantor further unconditionally and irrevocably agrees not to (x) enforce
or otherwise exercise any right of subrogation or any right of reimbursement
or contribution or similar right against the Issuer or any Guarantor by reason
of any Note Document or any payment made thereunder or (y) assert any claim,
defense, setoff or counterclaim it may have against any other Note Party or
set off any

     

 of its obligations to such other Note Party against obligations of such Note
Party to such Guarantor. No obligation of any Guarantor hereunder shall be
discharged other than by complete performance.

 

  _Section 2.7_ _Reliance_. Each Guarantor hereby assumes responsibility
for keeping itself informed of the financial condition of the Issuer, each
Guarantor and any other guarantor, maker or endorser of any Guaranteed
Obligation or any part thereof, and of all other circumstances bearing upon
the risk of nonpayment of any Guaranteed Obligation or any part thereof that
diligent inquiry would reveal, and each Guarantor hereby agrees that no
Secured Party shall have any duty to advise any Guarantor of information known
to it regarding such condition or any such circumstances. In the event any
Secured Party, in its sole discretion, undertakes at any time or from time to
time to provide any such information to any Guarantor, such Secured Party
shall be under no obligation to (a) undertake any investigation not a part of
its regular business routine, (b) disclose any information that such Secured
Party, pursuant to accepted or reasonable commercial finance or banking
practices, wishes to maintain confidential or (c) make any future disclosures
of such information or any other information to any Guarantor.

"), hereby mortgages, pledges and hypothecates to the Collateral Agent for the
benefit of the Secured Parties, and grants to the Collateral Agent for the
benefit of the Secured Parties a Lien on and security interest in, all of its
right, title and interest in, to and under the Pledged Collateral of such
Grantor.

 

 ARTICLE IV

 

 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

 

  To induce the Purchasers, the Holders and the Collateral Agent to
enter into the Note Documents, each Grantor hereby represents and warrants
each of the following to the Collateral Agent, the Purchasers, the Holders
and the other Secured Parties:

 

  _Section 4.1_ _Title; No Other Liens_. Except for the Lien granted to
the Collateral Agent pursuant to this Agreement and other Liens permitted
pursuant to clauses (a), (c) and (f) of Section 6.02 of the Note Purchase
Agreement, such Grantor owns each item of the Pledged Collateral free and
clear of any and all Liens or claims of others. Such Grantor (a) is the
record and beneficial owner of the Pledged Collateral pledged by it hereunder
constituting instruments or certificates and (b) has rights in or the power to
transfer each other item of Pledged Collateral in which a Lien is granted by
it hereunder, free and clear of any other Lien.

 

  _Section 4.2_ _Perfection and Priority_. The security interest
granted pursuant to this Agreement constitutes a valid and continuing
perfected security interest in favor of the Collateral Agent in all Pledged
Collateral subject to the completion of the filings of UCC financing
statements and other actions specified on  _Schedule 1_ (which, in the case
of all filings and other documents referred to on such schedule, have been
delivered to the Collateral Agent in completed

     

 and duly authorized form). Such security interest shall be prior to all
other Liens on the Pledged Collateral except for the Liens permitted by
clauses (a) and (f) of Section 6.02 of the Note Purchase Agreement
having priority over the Collateral Agents Lien by operation of law or
permitted pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement upon the delivery of all
Pledged Certificated Stock to the Collateral Agent, properly endorsed for
transfer to the Collateral Agent or in blank. Except as set forth in this
_Section 4.2_ , all actions by each Grantor necessary to protect and perfect
the Lien granted hereunder on the Pledged Collateral have been duly taken.

 

  _Section 4.3_ _Jurisdiction of Organization; Chief Executive Office_.
Such Grantors jurisdiction of organization, legal name and organizational
identification number, if any, and the location of such Grantors chief
executive office or sole place of business, in each case as of the date
hereof, is specified on  _Schedule 2_.

 

  _Section 4.4_ _Pledged Collateral_. (a) The Pledged Stock pledged by
such Grantor hereunder (a) is listed on _Schedule 3_ and constitutes that
percentage of the issued and outstanding equity of all classes of each issuer
thereof as set forth on  _Schedule 3_ , (b) has been duly authorized, validly
issued and is fully paid and nonassessable (other than Pledged Stock in
limited liability companies and partnerships) and (c) constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligation of the obligor with respect thereto, enforceable
in accordance with its terms and (d) except as set forth on Schedule 3, no
Capital Stock owned by any Grantor as of the date hereof constitutes Excluded
Pledged Collateral.

 

  (b) As of the Closing Date, all Pledged Collateral (other than
Pledged Uncertificated Stock) has been delivered to the Collateral Agent in
accordance with _Section 5.3(a)_.

 

  _Section 4.5_ _Enforcement_. No Permit, notice to or filing with
any Governmental Authority or any other Person or any consent from any Person
is required for the exercise by the Collateral Agent of its rights (including
voting rights) provided for in this Agreement or the enforcement of remedies
in respect of the Pledged Collateral pursuant to this Agreement, including
the transfer of any Pledged Collateral, except as may be required in
connection with the disposition of any portion of the Pledged Collateral by
laws affecting the offering and sale of securities generally.

 

  _Section 4.6_ _Representations and Warranties of the Note Purchase
Agreement_. The representations and warranties as to such Grantor made in
_Article IV_ ( _Representations and Warranties_ ) of the Note Purchase
Agreement are true and correct on the Closing Date and may be relied upon by
each of the Secured Parties.

 

 ARTICLE V

this Agreement as a perfected security interest having at least the priority

priority against the claims and demands of all Persons.

  (b) _Event of Default_. Subject to any applicable law, during the
continuance of an Event of Default, the Collateral Agent shall have the
right, at any time in its sole discretion, to (i) transfer to or to register
in its name or in the name of its nominees any Pledged Collateral and (ii)
exchange any certificate or instrument representing or evidencing any Pledged
Collateral for certificates or instruments of smaller or larger denominations.

 

  (c) _Cash Distributions with respect to Pledged Collateral_.
Except during the continuance of an Event of Default or as otherwise provided
in _Article VI_ and subject to the

     

 limitations set forth in the Note Purchase Agreement, such Grantor shall be
entitled to receive all cash distributions paid in respect of the Pledged
Collateral.

 

  (d) _Voting Rights_. Except as provided in _Article VI_ , such
Grantor shall be entitled to exercise all voting, consent and corporate,
partnership, limited liability company and similar rights with respect to the
Pledged Collateral;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no vote shall be cast,
consent given or right exercised or other action taken by such Grantor that
would impair the Pledged Collateral or be inconsistent with or result in any
violation of any provision of any Note Document.

 

  _Section 5.4_ _Compliance with Note Purchase Agreement_. Such Grantor
agrees to comply with all covenants and other provisions applicable to it
under the Note Purchase Agreement and agrees to the same submission to
jurisdiction as that agreed to by the Issuer in the Note Purchase Agreement.

 

 ARTICLE VI

 

 REMEDIAL PROVISIONS

 

 _Section 6.1_ _Code and Other Remedies_.

 

  (a) _UCC Remedies_. During the continuance of an Event of Default,
the Collateral Agent may exercise, in addition to all other rights and
remedies granted to it in this Agreement and in any other instrument or
agreement securing, evidencing or relating to any Secured Obligation, all
rights and remedies of a secured party under the UCC or any other applicable
law.

 

  (b) _Disposition of Collateral._ Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, during the continuance of an Event of Default, the
Collateral Agent may, without demand of performance or other demand,
presentment, protest, advertisement or notice of any kind (except any notice
required by any applicable law) to or upon any Grantor or any other Person
(all and each of which demands, defenses, advertisements and notices are
hereby waived), (personally or through its agents or attorneys), (i) collect,
receive, appropriate and realize upon any Pledged Collateral and (ii) sell,
assign, convey, transfer, grant option or options to purchase and deliver any
Pledged Collateral (or enter into Contractual Obligations to do any of the
foregoing), in one or more parcels at public or private sale or sales, at any
exchange, brokers board or office of any Secured Party or elsewhere upon
such terms and conditions as it may deem advisable and at such prices as it
may deem best, for cash or on credit or for future delivery without assumption
of any credit risk. The Administrative Agent shall have the right, upon any
such public sale or sales and, to the extent permitted by the UCC and other
applicable Requirements of Law, upon any such private sale, to purchase the
whole or any part of the Pledged Collateral so sold, free of any right or
equity of redemption of any Grantor, which right or equity is hereby waived
and released.

 

  (c) _Application of Proceeds._ The Collateral Agent shall apply
the cash proceeds of any action taken by it pursuant to this _Section 6.1_ ,
after deducting all reasonable costs and expenses of every kind incurred in
connection therewith or incidental to the care or safekeeping of any Pledged
Collateral or in any way relating to the Pledged Collateral or the rights of
the Collateral Agent and any other Secured Party hereunder, including
reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements, to the payment in whole or in
part of the Secured Obligations,

     

 as set forth in the Note Purchase Agreement, and only after such application
and after the payment by the Collateral Agent of any other amount required by
any Requirement of Law, need the Collateral Agent account for the surplus, if
any, to any Grantor.

 

  (d) _Direct Obligation_. Neither the Collateral Agent nor any
other Secured Party shall be required to make any demand upon, or pursue or
exhaust any right or remedy against, any Grantor, any other Note Party or any
other Person with respect to the payment of the Obligations or to pursue or
exhaust any right or remedy with respect to any Pledged Collateral therefor
or any direct or indirect guaranty thereof. All of the rights and remedies of
the Collateral Agent and any other Secured Party under any Note Document shall
be cumulative, may be exercised individually or concurrently and not
exclusive of any other rights or remedies provided by any Requirement of Law.
To the extent it may lawfully do so, each Grantor absolutely and irrevocably
waives and relinquishes the benefit and advantage of, and covenants not to
assert against the Collateral Agent or any Secured Party, any valuation, stay,
appraisement, extension, redemption or similar laws and any and all rights or
defenses it may have as a surety, now or hereafter existing, arising out of
the exercise by them of any rights hereunder. If any notice of a proposed
sale or other disposition of any Pledged Collateral shall be required by law,
such notice shall be deemed reasonable and proper if given at least 10 days
before such sale or other disposition.

 

  _Section 6.2_ _Pledged Collateral_. (a) _Voting Rights_. During the
continuance of an Event of Default, upon notice by the Collateral Agent to the
relevant Grantor or Grantors, the Collateral Agent or its nominee may exercise
(A) any voting, consent, corporate and other right pertaining to the Pledged
Collateral at any meeting of shareholders, partners or members, as the case
may be, of the relevant issuer or issuers of Pledged Collateral or otherwise
and (B) any right of conversion, exchange and subscription and any other
right, privilege or option pertaining to the Pledged Collateral as if it were
the absolute owner thereof (including the right to exchange at its discretion
any Pledged Collateral upon the merger, amalgamation, consolidation,
reorganization, recapitalization or other fundamental change in the corporate
or equivalent structure of any issuer of Pledged Stock, the right to deposit
and deliver any Pledged Collateral with any committee, depositary, transfer
agent, registrar or other designated agency upon such terms and conditions as
the Collateral Agent may determine), all without liability except to account
for property actually received by it; _provided_ , _however_ , that subject to
any applicable law, the Collateral Agent shall have no duty to any Grantor to
exercise any such right, privilege or option and shall not be responsible for
any failure to do so or delay in so doing.

 

  (b) _Proxies_. In order to permit the Collateral Agent to exercise
the voting and other consensual rights that it may be entitled to exercise
pursuant to this Section and to receive all dividends and other distributions
that it may be entitled to receive pursuant to this Section, (i) each Grantor
shall promptly execute and deliver (or cause to be executed and delivered) to
the Collateral Agent all such proxies, dividend payment orders and other
instruments as the Collateral Agent may from time to time reasonably request
and (ii) without limiting the effect of  _clause (i)_ above, such Grantor
hereby grants to the Collateral Agent an irrevocable proxy to vote all or any
part of the Pledged Collateral and to exercise all other rights, powers,
privileges and remedies to which a holder of the Pledged Collateral would be
entitled (including giving or withholding written consents of shareholders,
partners or members, as the case may be, calling special meetings of
shareholders, partners or members, as the case may be, and voting at such
meetings), which proxy shall be effective, automatically and without the
necessity of any action (including any transfer of any Pledged Collateral on
the record books of

     

 the issuer thereof) by any other person (including the issuer of such
Pledged Collateral or any officer or agent thereof) during the continuance of
an Event of Default and which proxy shall terminate upon the cure or
waiver of any Event of Default then existing or the payment in full of the
Secured Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations to the
extent no claim giving rise thereto has been asserted).

 

  (c) _Authorization of the Issuer_. Each Grantor hereby expressly
irrevocably authorizes and instructs, without any further instructions from
such Grantor, each issuer of any Pledged Collateral pledged hereunder by such
Grantor to (i) comply with any instruction received by it from the Collateral
Agent in writing that states that an Event of Default is continuing and each
Grantor agrees that such issuer shall be fully protected from Liabilities to
such Grantor in so complying and (ii) unless otherwise expressly permitted
hereby or the Note Purchase Agreement, pay any dividend or make any other
payment with respect to the Pledged Collateral directly to the Collateral
Agent.

 

  _Section 6.3_ _Proceeds to be Turned over to and Held by Collateral
Agent_. Unless otherwise expressly provided in the Note Purchase Agreement or
this Agreement, all proceeds of any Pledged Collateral received by any Grantor
hereunder in cash or Cash Equivalents at any time when an Event of Default
shall be continuing shall be held by such Grantor in trust for the Collateral
Agent and the other Secured Parties, segregated from other funds of such
Grantor, and shall, promptly upon receipt by any Grantor, be turned over to
the Collateral Agent in the exact form received (with any necessary
endorsement). All such proceeds of Pledged Collateral and any other proceeds
of any Pledged Collateral received by the Collateral Agent in cash or Cash
Equivalents shall be held by the Collateral Agent in a cash
collateral account. All proceeds being held by the Collateral Agent in a cash
collateral account (or by such Grantor in trust for the Collateral Agent)
shall continue to be held as collateral security for the Secured Obligations
and shall not constitute payment thereof until applied as provided in the
Note Purchase Agreement.

 

  _Section 6.4_ _Sale of Pledged Collateral_.

 

  (a) Each Grantor recognizes that the Collateral Agent may be
unable to effect a public sale of any Pledged Collateral by reason of certain
prohibitions contained in the Securities Act and applicable state or foreign
securities laws or otherwise or may determine that a public sale is
impracticable, not desirable or not commercially reasonable and, accordingly,
may resort to one or more private sales thereof to a restricted group of
purchasers that shall be obliged to agree, among other things, to acquire such
securities for their own account for investment and not with a view to the
distribution or resale thereof. Each Grantor acknowledges and agrees that any
such private sale may result in prices and other terms less favorable than if
such sale were a public sale and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, that any such private sale
shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner. The
Collateral Agent shall be under no obligation to delay a sale of any Pledged
Collateral for the period of time necessary to permit the issuer thereof to
register such securities for public sale under the Securities Act or under
applicable state securities laws even if such issuer would agree to do so.

 

  (b) Each Grantor agrees to use its best efforts to do or cause to
be done all such other acts as may be necessary to make such sale or sales of
any portion of the Pledged Collateral pursuant to _Section 6.1_ and this
_Section 6.4_ valid and binding and in compliance with all applicable
Requirements of Law. Each Grantor further agrees that a breach of any covenant
contained herein will cause irreparable injury to the Collateral Agent and
other Secured Parties, 

     

 that the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties have no adequate
remedy at law in respect of such breach and, as a consequence, that each and
every covenant contained herein shall be specifically enforceable
against such Grantor, and such Grantor hereby waives and agrees not to assert
any defense against an action for specific performance of such covenants
except for a defense that no Event of Default is continuing under the Note
Purchase Agreement. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each
Grantor waives any and all rights of contribution or subrogation upon the sale
or disposition of all or any portion of the Pledged Collateral by Collateral
Agent.

 

  _Section 6.5_ _Deficiency_. Each Grantor shall remain liable for
any deficiency if the proceeds of any sale or other disposition of any
Pledged Collateral are insufficient to pay the Secured Obligations and the
fees and disbursements of any attorney employed by the Collateral Agent or any
other Secured Party to collect such deficiency.

 

 ARTICLE VII 
  
 COLLATERAL AGENT

 

  _Section 7.1_ _Collateral Agent s Appointment as Attorney-in-Fact_.

 

  (a) Each Grantor hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the
Collateral Agent and any Related Person thereof, with full power of
substitution, as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable
power and authority in the place and stead of such Grantor and in the name of
such Grantor or in its own name, for the purpose of carrying out the terms of
the Note Documents, to take any appropriate action and to execute any
document or instrument that may be necessary to accomplish the purposes of the
Note Documents, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each
Grantor hereby gives the Collateral Agent and its Related Persons the power
and right, on behalf of such Grantor, without notice to or assent by such
Grantor, to do any of the following when an Event of Default shall be
continuing:

  

>  
>
>   (i) in the name of such Grantor, in its own name or otherwise,

>  
>
>   (ii) pay or discharge taxes and Liens levied or placed on or
> threatened against any Pledged Collateral or pay any insurance called for

> the premiums therefor and the costs thereof);
>
>  
>
>   (iii) execute, in connection with any sale provided for in
> _Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.4_ , any document to effect or otherwise
> necessary or appropriate in relation to evidence the sale of any Pledged

>
>

>  

  

  The Collateral Agent agrees that except in connection with the
exercise of any powers granted in clause (ii) above, it shall not exercise any
power or authority granted under the Power of Attorney provided for in this
_Section 7.1(a)_ unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.

 

  (b) The expenses of the Collateral Agent incurred in connection
with actions undertaken as provided in this  _Section 7.1_ , together with
interest thereon at a rate set forth in _Section 2.04(b)_ of the Note
Purchase Agreement, from the date of payment by the Collateral Agent to the
date reimbursed by the relevant Grantor, shall be payable by such Grantor to
the Collateral Agent on demand.

 

  (c) Each Grantor hereby ratifies all that said attorneys shall
lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue of this  _Section 7.1_. All powers,
authorizations and agencies contained in this Agreement are coupled with an
interest and are irrevocable until this Agreement is terminated and
the security interests created hereby are released.

 

  _Section 7.2_ _Authorization to File Financing Statements_. Each
Grantor authorizes the Collateral Agent and its Related Persons, at any time
and from time to time, to file or record financing statements, amendments
thereto, and other filing or recording documents or instruments with respect
to any Pledged Collateral in such form and in such offices as the Collateral
Agent reasonably determines appropriate to perfect the security interests of
the Collateral Agent under this Agreement. Such Grantor also hereby ratifies
its authorization for the Collateral Agent to have filed any initial
financing statement or amendment thereto under the UCC (or other similar laws)
in effect in any jurisdiction if filed prior to the date hereof.

 

  _Section 7.3_ _Authority of Collateral Agent_. Each Grantor
acknowledges that the rights and responsibilities of the Collateral Agent
under this Agreement with respect to any action taken by the Collateral Agent
or the exercise or non-exercise by the Collateral Agent of any

     

 option, voting right, request, judgment or other right or remedy provided
for herein or resulting or arising out of this Agreement shall, as between the
Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties, be governed by the Note
Purchase Agreement and by such other agreements with respect thereto as may
exist from time to time among them, but, as between the Collateral Agent and
the Grantors, the Collateral Agent shall be conclusively presumed to be acting
as agent for the Secured Parties with full and valid authority so to act or
refrain from acting, and no Grantor shall be under any obligation or
entitlement to make any inquiry respecting such authority.

 

  _Section 7.4_ _Duty; Obligations and Liabilities_.

 

  (a) _Duty of Collateral Agent_. Subject to any applicable law, the
Collateral Agents sole duty with respect to the custody, safekeeping and
physical preservation of the Pledged Collateral in its possession shall be to
deal with it in the same manner as the Collateral Agent deals with similar
property for its own account. The powers conferred on the Collateral Agent
hereunder are solely to protect the Collateral Agents interest in the Pledged
Collateral and shall not, subject to applicable law, impose any duty upon the
Collateral Agent to exercise any such powers. The Collateral Agent shall be
accountable only for amounts that it receives as a result of the exercise of
such powers, and neither it nor any of its Related Persons shall be
responsible to any Grantor for any act or failure to act hereunder, except
for their own gross negligence or willful misconduct as finally determined by
a court of competent jurisdiction. In addition, the Collateral Agent shall not
be liable or responsible for any loss or damage to any Pledged Collateral, or
for any diminution in the value thereof, by reason of the act or omission of
any warehousemen, carrier, forwarding agency, consignee or other bailee if
such Person has been selected by the Collateral Agent in good faith.

 

  (b) _Obligations and Liabilities with respect to Pledged
Collateral_. No Secured Party and no Related Person thereof shall be liable
for failure to demand, collect or realize upon any Pledged Collateral or for
any delay in doing so or shall be under any obligation to sell or otherwise
dispose of any Pledged Collateral upon the request of any Grantor or any
other Person or to take any other action whatsoever with regard to any Pledged
Collateral. The powers conferred on the Collateral Agent hereunder shall not
impose any duty upon any other Secured Party to exercise any such powers. The
other Secured Parties shall be accountable only for amounts that they actually
receive as a result of the exercise of such powers, and neither they nor any
of their respective officers, directors, employees or agents shall
be responsible to any Grantor for any act or failure to act hereunder, except
for their own gross negligence or willful misconduct as finally determined by
a court of competent jurisdiction.

 

 ARTICLE VIII 
  
 MISCELLANEOUS

 

  _Section 8.1_ _Reinstatement_. Each Grantor agrees that, if any
payment made by any Note Party or other Person and applied to the Secured
Obligations is at any time annulled, avoided, set aside, rescinded,
invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential or otherwise required
to be refunded or repaid, or the proceeds of any Pledged Collateral are
required to be returned by any Secured Party to such Note Party, its estate,
trustee, receiver or any other party, including any Grantor, under any
bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then, to
the extent of such payment or repayment, any Lien or other Pledged Collateral
securing such liability shall be and remain in full force and effect, as fully
as if such payment had never been made. If, prior to any of the foregoing, (a)
any Lien or other Pledged Collateral

     

 securing such Grantors liability hereunder shall have been released or
terminated by virtue of the foregoing or (b) any provision of the Guaranty
hereunder shall have been terminated, cancelled or surrendered, such Lien,
other Pledged Collateral or provision shall be reinstated in full force and
effect and such prior release, termination, cancellation or surrender shall
not diminish, release, discharge, impair or otherwise affect the obligations
of any such Grantor in respect of any Lien or other Pledged Collateral
securing such obligation or the amount of such payment.

 

  _Section 8.2_ _Release of Pledged Collateral_.

 

  (a) At the time provided in Section 8.02(b) of the Note Purchase
Agreement, the Pledged Collateral shall automatically be released from the
Lien created hereby and this Agreement and all obligations (other than those
expressly stated to survive such termination) of the Collateral Agent and each
Grantor hereunder shall terminate, all without delivery of any instrument or
performance of any act by any party, and all rights to the Pledged Collateral
shall revert to the Grantors. Each Grantor is hereby authorized to file UCC
amendments at such time evidencing the termination of the Liens so released.
At the request and expense of any Grantor following any such termination, the
Collateral Agent shall deliver to such Grantor any Pledged Collateral of such
Grantor held by the Collateral Agent hereunder and execute and deliver to such
Grantor such documents as such Grantor shall reasonably request to evidence
such termination.

 

  (b) If the Collateral Agent shall be directed or permitted
pursuant to Section 8.02(b) of the Note Purchase Agreement to release any
Lien or any Pledged Collateral, such Pledged Collateral shall be released from
the Lien created hereby to the extent provided under, and subject to the terms
and conditions set forth in Section 8.02(b) of the Note Purchase Agreement.
In connection therewith, the Collateral Agent, at the request of any Grantor,
shall execute and deliver to such Grantor such documents as such Grantor shall
reasonably request to evidence such release.

 

  (c) Each Grantor shall automatically and without any further
action be released from its obligations hereunder in the event that the
Capital Stock of such Grantor shall be sold to any Person in a transaction
permitted by the Note Purchase Agreement. At the request and expense of the
Parent or any other Grantor, the Collateral Agent shall execute and deliver to
the Parent or such Grantor such documents as the Parent or such Grantor shall
reasonably request to evidence such release.

 

  _Section 8.3_ _Independent Obligations_. The obligations of each
Grantor hereunder are independent of and separate from the Secured
Obligations and the Guaranteed Obligations. If any Secured Obligation or
Guaranteed Obligation is not paid when due, or upon any Event of Default, the
Collateral Agent may, at its sole election, proceed directly and at once
against any Grantor and any Pledged Collateral to collect and recover the full
amount of any Secured Obligation or Guaranteed Obligation then due, without
first proceeding against any other Grantor, any other Note Party or any other
Pledged Collateral and without first joining any other Grantor or any other
Note Party in any proceeding.

 

  _Section 8.4_ _No Waiver by Course of Conduct_. No Secured Party shall
by any act (except by a written instrument pursuant to _Section 8.5_ ),
delay, indulgence, omission or otherwise be deemed to have waived any right or
remedy hereunder or to have acquiesced in any Default or Event of Default. No
failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on the part of any Secured
Party, any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver

(other than pledged uncertificated stock) has not been delivered as of the
Closing Date, such Grantor shall deliver a pledge amendment duly executed by

Amendment_ "). Such Grantor authorizes the Collateral Agent to attach each
Pledge Amendment to this Agreement.

provided for in _Section 9.02_ of the Note Purchase Agreement; _provided_ ,

which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Signature
pages may be detached from multiple separate counterparts and attached to a
single counterpart. Delivery of an executed signature page of this Agreement
by facsimile transmission or by electronic transmission shall be as effective

held illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall not affect
any part of such provision not held illegal,

     

 invalid or unenforceable, any other provision of this Agreement or any part
of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

 

  _Section 8.11_ _Governing Law_. This Agreement and the rights and
obligations of the parties hereto shall be governed by, and construed and
interpreted in accordance with, the law of the State of New York.

HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH
RESPECT TO, OR DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION

  SECTION 2. _Subordination Terms._ Subject to the terms set forth in
_Section 3_ , the parties hereto agree as follows:

 

  2.1 _Debt Subordination._

 

  (a) The Series A Claims and all obligations of the Note
Parties under the Series A Note Documents shall, to the extent and in the
manner herein set forth, be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the
prior Payment in Full of the Series B Claims. Except as set forth in
subsection (b) below, until all Series B Claims have been Paid in Full, (i) no
Series A Holder shall be entitled to receive or retain payment of any kind in
respect of any Series A Claim and (ii) each Series A

     

 Holder agrees not to ask for, demand, accept or receive any payment in
respect of any Series A Claim. Nothing in this clause (a) or clause (b),
below, will serve to prohibit payment to or receipt by the Collateral Agent
of amounts to which it is entitled in respect of expense reimbursement or
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement or any Note Document.

 

 (b) Except as otherwise provided in this clause (b), and only to the extent provided for in the Series A Note Documents in their form existing on the date hereof (without giving effect to any modification thereof), Series A Holders may receive payments of interest on the Series A Notes, expense reimbursements and indemnification payments. Upon the happening of any Series B Payment Default, no Note Party shall be permitted to make, and no Series A Holder shall be entitled to receive from any Note Party, any payment on account of any Series A Claims until the earliest to occur of (i) the date such Series B Payment Default has been waived, cured or otherwise ceases to exist (in each case in accordance with the terms of the Series B Note Documents), and (ii) the date on which all Series B Claims shall have been Paid in Full. Upon (1) the happening of any Series B Covenant Default and (2) the giving of written notice thereof specifying that it is a "Payment Blockage Notice" under this _Section 2.1(b)_ by the Series B Administrative Holder to the Series A Administrative Holder and the Issuer, no Note Party shall be permitted to make, and no Series A Holder shall be entitled to receive from any Note Party, any payment on account of any Series A Claims until the earliest of (i) the 180th day from and including the date the Payment Blockage Notice is delivered, (ii) the date such Series B Covenant Default has been waived or cured or shall otherwise cease to exist (in each case in accordance with the terms of the Series B Note Documents) and (iii) the date on which all Series B Claims shall have been Paid in Full. No more than one Payment Blockage Notice may be delivered pursuant to the preceding sentence during any 360-day period. No facts or circumstances constituting a Series B Covenant Default existing on or prior to the date any Payment Blockage Notice is given may be used as a basis for any subsequent Blockage Notice, unless such Series B Covenant Event of Default has been in the interim cured or waived for a period of not less than 90 consecutive days and subsequently recurs. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, during any such blockage period described in this clause (b) Series A Holders shall be entitled to (i) add accrued and unpaid interest under the Series A Notes to principal on the Series A Notes, (ii) convert the principal of and accrued interest on the Series A Notes into equity of Parent, if such conversion is made prior to the commencement of any Insolvency Proceeding with respect to any Note Party and (iii) receive Reorganization Securities. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement (including any provision of Section 2), any Series A Holder may satisfy all or any portion of its indemnification obligations under Section 11.4 of the Merger Agreement by delivering to the Parent or any of its Affiliates one or more Series A Notes owned by it (or any portion thereof) having an aggregate principal amount equal to the amount of the indemnification payment required to be made by the Sellers Representative (as defined in the Merger Agreement) under Section 11.4 of the Merger Agreement. 

 

 (c) Without diminishing the foregoing prohibitions, in the event that any Note Party shall make any payment to any Series A Holder in respect of Series A Claims not expressly authorized by subsection (b) above, such payment shall be held in trust by such Series A Holder, for the benefit of the Series B Holders, and shall be paid over immediately (without necessity of demand) to the Series B Administrative Holder, for application in accordance with the Series B Note Documents to the payment of Series B Claims until the same shall have been Paid in Full. In the event of the failure of any Series A Holder to endorse any instrument for the payment of money so received by such Series A Holder, the Series B Administrative Holder is irrevocably appointed attorney-in-fact for the Series A Holders with full power to make such endorsement and with full power of substitution. 

 

 (d) Subject to the prior Payment in Full of all Series B Claims, the Series A Holders shall be subrogated to the rights of the holders of Series B Claims to receive payments or distributions of cash, property or securities of the Issuer applicable to the Series B Claims until the 

     

 Series A Claims shall be Paid in Full; and, for the purposes of such
subrogation, no such payments or distributions to the Series B Holders by or
on behalf of the Issuer or by or on behalf of the Series A Holders by
virtue of this _Section 2_ which otherwise would have been made to the Series
A Holders shall, as between the Issuer and the Series A Holders, be deemed to
be a payment by the Issuer to or on account of the Series B Claims, it being
understood that the provisions of this _Section 2_ are and are intended solely
for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Series A Holders, on
the one hand, and the Series B Holders, on the other hand. No Series B Holder
shall by virtue of this subrogation (i) owe any fiduciary or similar
obligation to any Series A Holder and (ii) be liable to such Series A
Holders for any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Series B Holders.

 

 (e) The provisions of this Agreement are for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Series A Holders on the one hand and the Series B Holders on the other hand with respect to the enforcement of rights and remedies and priority of payment of the various obligations of the Issuers and the other Note Parties to each of them. Nothing herein shall impair, as between the Issuer and each Noteholder, the obligations of the Issuer, which are unconditional and absolute, to pay to the Noteholder thereof the principal and interest on the Notes and any other liabilities encompassed in the Claims, all in accordance with their respective terms, subject to the prior Payment in Full of the Series B Claims as provided for herein. 

 

 (f) Notwithstanding any Default or Event of Default in respect of the Series A Claims, until the Series B Claims have been Paid in Full, no Series A Holder shall, without the prior written consent of the Series B Administrative Holder, until the expiration of any applicable Standstill Period: (1) accelerate all or any portion of the Series A Claims; (2) commence or join (unless the Series B Holders shall also join) in any involuntary proceeding against Issuer or any other Note Party under any bankruptcy, reorganization, readjustment of debt, arrangement of debt, receivership, liquidation or insolvency law or statute of any federal or state government; or (3) pursue any remedy or commence any action or proceeding against Issuer or any other Note Party to enforce payment of all or any part of the Series A Claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions in this clause (f) shall cease to apply upon (a) the commencement of any Insolvency Proceeding, (b) the acceleration of the Series B Claims, (c) institution or commencement by the Series B Administrative Holder or any holder of Series B Claims of any remedies against any Note Party in respect of the Series B Claims to enforce payment of, or foreclose upon or exercise other remedies with respect to Collateral or any deed or conveyance of any Collateral to any Series B Creditor in lieu of foreclosure thereof, (d) the final maturity of the Series A Claims or the Series B Claims, or (e) the date that all of the Series B Claims has been Paid in Full.

 

 (g) To the extent that any payment made on the Series B Claims is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or is required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any bankruptcy act, state or Federal law, common law or equitable cause or otherwise, and whether as a result of any demand, settlement, litigation or otherwise (such payment being hereinafter referred to as a "Voided Payment"), then to the extent of such Voided Payment that portion of the Series B Claims which had been previously satisfied by such Voided Payment shall be revived and continue in full force and effect as if such Voided Payment had never been made, and this _Section 2_  shall be reinstated with respect to such Voided Payment. 

 

 (h) Without the necessity of any reservation of rights against or any notice to or further assent by any Series A Holder, (i) any demand for payment of any Series B Claims made by the Series B Holders may be rescinded in whole or in part by the Series B Holders, (ii) the Series B Holders may exercise or refrain from exercising any rights and/or remedies against any Note Party and others, if any, liable under the Series B Claims, and (iii) the Series B Claims and any agreement or instrument evidencing, securing, or otherwise relating to the Series B Claims (including, without limitation, the Series B Note Documents), or any collateral security therefor or guaranty thereof or other right of any 

     

 nature with respect thereto, may be amended, extended, modified, continued,
accelerated, compromised, waived, surrendered or released by the Series B
Holders in any manner the Series B Holders deem in their best interests, all
without impairing, abridging, releasing or affecting in any manner the
subordination of the Series A Claims to the Series B Claims provided for
herein. Without limiting the foregoing, each Series A Holder waives any and
all notice of the creation, amendment, restatement, extension, acceleration,
compromise, continuation, waiver, surrender, release or modification of any
nature of the Series B Claims, or the Series B Note Documents, and notice of
or proof of reliance by any Series B Holder upon the subordination provided
for herein.

 

 (i) All Series A Note Documents shall bear a legend disclosing the existence of this Agreement in form and substance substantially similar to the following; _provided_ that any such legend shall be removed following the Repriority Event:

INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT AND THIS INSTRUMENT, THE PROVISIONS OF THE
INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT SHALL CONTROL.

 

 (j) Any financing statements filed while this _Section 2_ is in effect shall be filed for purposes of perfecting the Series B Liens before any financing statement is filed for purposes of perfecting the Series A Liens. 

 

  2.2 _Lien Subordination._

 

 All Series A Liens now or hereafter existing with respect to any Collateral, including without limitation judgment Liens, shall be subject, subordinate and junior in all respects and at all times to the Series B Liens now or hereafter existing with respect to such Collateral. To the extent the Claims are secured by a common Lien, the rights and interests of the Series A Holders in respect of such Lien shall be deemed to be subject, subordinate and junior in all respect to the rights of the Series B Holders in respect of such Lien. 

 

  2.3 _Enforcement Rights_.

 

 (a) Each Series A Holder agrees that until all Series B Claims have been Paid in Full, (i) it will not take any Enforcement Action with respect to any Collateral; and (ii) subject to the terms of this Agreement, Series B Administrative Holder may, at its option at any time while an Event of Default exists under the Series B Note Documents, take any Enforcement Action and exercise any right or remedy it deems appropriate in connection therewith with respect to the Collateral. Until the Series B Claims are Paid in Full, Series B Administrative Holder shall have the exclusive right to instruct the Collateral Agent in respect of any remedies to be taken in respect of Collateral. However, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, if the Series B Administrative Holder has not instructed the Collateral Agent to initiate Enforcement Action with respect to a substantial portion of the 

     

 Collateral, the Series A Administrative Holder may deliver written notice to
the Series B Administrative Holder requesting that such Enforcement Action be
taken and, if Series B Administrative Holder has not instructed
the Collateral Agent to initiate Enforcement Action with respect to a
substantial portion of the Collateral within 180 days after receipt of such
notice, then Series A Administrative Holder may so instruct the Collateral
Agent, provided, however, that if Series A Administrative Holder subsequently
pursues Enforcement Actions with respect to a substantial portion of the
Collateral, Series A Administrative Holder shall cease any Enforcement Action
then pending and shall not pursue further Enforcement Action.

 

 (b) Series A Administrative Holder, on behalf of itself and the other Series A Holders, agrees that it shall take such actions (at the sole cost and expense of Issuer) as Series B Administrative Holder shall request in connection with the exercise by Series B Holders of its rights set forth herein. 

 

 (c) Except as provided in subsections (d) and (e) hereof, if any Holder shall enforce its rights or remedies in violation of the terms of this Agreement, Issuer shall not be entitled to use such violation as a defense to any action by any Holder, nor to assert such violation as a counterclaim or basis for set-off or recoupment against any Holder. 

 

 (d) If any Series A Holder, contrary to this Agreement, commences or participates in any Enforcement Action against the Collateral, Note Parties, with the prior written consent of Series B Administrative Holder, may interpose as a defense or dilatory plea the making of this Agreement, and any Series B Holder may intervene and interpose such defense or plea in its or their name or in the name of Issuer. 

 

 (e) Should any Series A Holder, contrary to this Agreement, in any way take, or attempt to or threaten to take any action with respect to the Collateral (including, without limitation, any attempt to realize upon or enforce any remedy with respect to this Agreement), or fail to take any action required by this Agreement, any Series B Holder (in its or their own name or in the name of Issuer) or Issuer may obtain relief against such Series A Holder by injunction, specific performance and/or other appropriate equitable relief, it being understood and agreed by Series A Administrative Holder on behalf of each Series A Holder that (A) Series B Holders damages from its actions may at that time be difficult to ascertain and may be irreparable, and (B) each Series A Holder waives any defense that Issuer and/or Series B Holders cannot demonstrate damage and/or be made whole by the awarding of damages.

 

  2.4 _Standstill and Waivers_. Each Series A Holder agrees that until
the Series B Claims are Paid in Full:

 

 (a) it will not oppose, object to, interfere with, hinder or delay, in any manner, whether by judicial proceedings (including without limitation the filing of an Insolvency Proceeding) or otherwise, any foreclosure, sale, lease, exchange, transfer or other disposition of the Collateral by Series B Administrative Holder or any other Series B Holder or any other Enforcement Action taken by or on behalf of Series B Administrative Holder or any other Series B Holder (provided, however, that the foregoing will prohibit Series A Holders from enforcing restrictions on asset sales set forth in the Series A Note Documents only if (i) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Series B Note Documents or (ii) such restrictions were added after the date hereof without either the consent of Series B Administrative Holder or the addition of the same restriction in the Series B Note Documents); 

 

 (b) except as provided in _Section 2.3(a)_ , it has no right to (i) direct Collateral Agent to exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to the Collateral or any Series A Note Document, (ii) consent or object to the exercise by Series B Administrative Holder or any other Series B 

     

 Holder of any right, remedy or power with respect to the Collateral or
pursuant to the Series B Note Documents or to the timing or manner in which
any such right is exercised or not exercised (or, to the extent it may
have any such right described in this clause (c), whether as a junior lien
creditor or otherwise, it hereby irrevocably waives such right);

 

 (c) it will not commence judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to take possession of any Collateral, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to enforce its interest in or realize upon, the Collateral or pursuant to the Series A Note Documents; and 

 

 (d) except as provided in _Section 2.3(a)_ , it will not take any other Enforcement Actions against Collateral under the Series A Note Documents. 

 

 (e) Nothing in the foregoing shall prohibit Series A Holders from (i) bidding for or purchasing Collateral at a foreclosure sale or in any private sale process, (ii) joining in any foreclosure proceeding for the purpose of protecting its Liens or (iii) receiving proceeds of Collateral pursuant to _Section 2.6_. 

 

  2.5 _Insolvency or Liquidation Proceedings._

 

 (a) In the event of an Insolvency Proceeding, the Series B Holders shall be entitled in any such proceeding to receive Payment in Full, of all Series B Claims before any Series A Holder is entitled in such proceeding to receive any payment on account of the Series A Claims owed to such Series A Holder, and to that end in any such proceeding, so long as any Series B Claim remains outstanding, any payment or distribution of any kind or character (other than any Reorganization Securities) whether in cash or in other property, to which any Series A Holder would be entitled but for the provisions hereof, shall be delivered to the Series B Administrative Holder for distribution to the Series B Holders to the extent necessary to make Payment in Full, of all Series B Claims remaining unpaid, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to the holders of Series B Claims. 

 

 (b) Upon the commencement of an Insolvency Proceeding with respect to Issuer or any other Note Party, Series A Holder shall be deemed, in order to effectuate the subordination set forth above, to have granted to the Series B Administrative Holder, as agent for the Series B Holders, as of the date of the commencement of such Insolvency Proceeding the right, subject to the terms of this Agreement, to collect all payments and distributions of any kind and description, whether in cash or other property, paid or payable in respect of any claims or demands of Series A Holder against Issuer or any other Note Party arising from the Series A Claims until the Payment in Full of all Series B Claims. Upon the commencement of an Insolvency Proceeding, each Series A Holder shall also be deemed to have granted to the Series B Administrative Holder, as agent for the Series B Holders, the full right (but not the obligation), subject to the terms of this Agreement, in its own name or in its name as attorney in fact for such Series A Holder, to collect and enforce said claims and demands of such Series A Holder by suit or otherwise (except for any proof of claim) in any Insolvency Proceeding. 

 

 (c) Until the Series B Claims are Paid in Full, each Series A Holder agrees that it shall not, in or in connection with any Insolvency Proceeding, file any pleadings or motions, take any position at any hearing or proceeding of any nature, or otherwise take any action whatsoever, in each case in respect of any of the Collateral, including, without limitation, with respect to the determination of any Liens or claims held by Series B Administrative Holder (including the validity and enforceability thereof) or any other Series B Holder or the value of any claims of such parties under Section 506(a) of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise; provided that (i) Series A Administrative Holder may defend against any 

     

 action in a bankruptcy to avoid its Lien on the Collateral, (ii) Series A
Holders shall be entitled to file any necessary responsive or defensive
pleadings in opposition to any motion, claim, adversary proceeding or
other pleading made by any person objecting to or otherwise seeking the
disallowance of the claims of Series A Holders, including without limitation
any claims secured by the Collateral, if any, in each case in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, and (iii) Series A Holders shall be entitled to
file any proof of claim and other filings and make any arguments and motions
that are, in each case, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, with
respect to the Series A Claims and the Collateral.

 

 (d) Until the Series B Claims are Paid in Full, if any Note Party becomes subject to any Insolvency Proceeding, and if Series B Administrative Holder or Series B Holders desire to consent (or not object) to the use of cash collateral on which Series B Holders or any other creditor has a Lien or to provide financing to any Note Party under the Bankruptcy Code or to consent (or not object) to the provision of such financing to any Note Party by any Person ("DIP Financing"), then Series A Holders agree that they (i) will be deemed to have consented to, and will raise no objection to, the use of such cash collateral or to such DIP Financing, (ii) will not request or accept any form of adequate protection or any other relief in connection with the use of such cash collateral or such DIP Financing except as set forth in subsection (f) below, and (iii) to the extent the Liens in favor of Series B Holders are subordinated or _pari passu_ with such DIP Financing, will subordinate (and will be deemed hereunder to have subordinated) the Liens in favor of Series A Holders (x) to such DIP Financing with the same terms and conditions as the Liens in favor of Series B Holders are subordinated thereto (and such subordination will not alter in any manner the terms of this Agreement), (y) to any adequate protection provided to Series B Holders and (z) to any "carve-out" for administrative, professional and United States Trustee fees agreed to by Series B Administrative Holder or Series B Holders; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) subject to any such "carve" out under the foregoing clause (z), the Series A Holders retain a Lien on the Collateral (including proceeds thereof-arising after the commencement of such proceeding) with the same priority as existed prior to the commencement of the case under the Bankruptcy Code (junior in priority to the Liens securing such DIP Financing as described above), (B) the Series A Holders receive (without objection from the Series B Holders) a replacement Lien on post-petition assets in which the Series B Holders have a replacement Lien securing the Series B Claims, with the same priority as existed prior to the commencement of the case under the Bankruptcy Code (junior in priority to the Liens securing such DIP Financing, provided that the inability of the Series A Holders to receive a Lien on actions under Chapter 5 of the Bankruptcy Code and proceeds thereof shall not affect the agreements and waivers set forth in this clause (d)), and (C) the aggregate principal amount of the DIP Financing together with the principal amount of the Series B Claims does not exceed the Maximum First Lien Principal Amount. Nothing in this paragraph will restrict the Series A Holders from raising any objection to the terms of the DIP Financing that could be raised by an unsecured creditor. 

 

 (e) Series A Holders agree that until the Series B Claims are Paid in Full, they will not seek relief from the automatic stay or from any other stay in any Insolvency Proceeding or take any action in derogation thereof, in each case in respect of any Collateral, without the prior written consent of Series B Administrative Holder (which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld). 

 

 (f) Series A Holders agree that until the Series B Claims are Paid in Full, they shall not object to, contest, or support any other Person objecting to or contesting, (i) any request by Series B Administrative Holder or any other Series B Holder for adequate protection, (ii) any objection by Series B Administrative Holder or any other Series B Holder to any motion, relief, action or proceeding based on a claim of a lack of adequate protection or (iii) the payment of interest, fees, expenses or other amounts to Series B Administrative Holder or any other Series B Holder under Section 506(b) or 506(c) of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything contained in this _Section 2_ , in any Insolvency Proceeding, (x) Series A Holders may seek, support, accept or retain adequate protection (A) 

     

 only if Series B Holders are granted adequate protection that includes
replacement Liens on additional collateral and superpriority claims and (B)
solely in the form of (1) a replacement Lien on such additional
collateral, subordinated to the Liens in favor of Series B Holders and such
DIP Financing on the same basis as the other Liens in favor of Series A
Holders are so subordinated to the Series B Claims under this Agreement
subject to the "carve-out" in  _Section 2.5(d)(iii)(z)_ above and (2) solely
to the extent that the Collateral pledged to secure the Series A Claims has
been diminished in connection with such Insolvency Proceeding, superpriority
claims junior in all respects to the superpriority claims granted to Series B
Holders, and (y) in the event Series A Administrative Holder receives adequate
protection, including in the form of additional collateral, then Series A
Holders agree that Series B Administrative Holder shall have a senior Lien and
claim on such adequate protection as security for the Series B Claims and that
any Lien on any additional collateral securing the Series A Claims shall
be subordinated to the Liens on such collateral securing the Series B Claims
and any other Liens granted to Series B Holders as adequate protection, with
such subordination to be on the same terms that the other Liens securing the
Series A Claims are subordinated to such Series B Claims under this
Agreement.

 

 (g) Neither Series A Administrative Holder nor any other Series A Holder shall, in an Insolvency Proceeding or otherwise, oppose any sale or disposition of any assets of any Note Party that is supported by Series B Holders, and Series A Administrative Holder and each other Series A Holder will be deemed to have consented under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code (and otherwise) to any sale supported by Series B Holders and to have released its Liens in such assets upon the consummation of such sale so long as the net proceeds thereof are used to pay down the Series B Claims. 

 

 (h) Series A Administrative Holder and each other Series A Holder acknowledges and agrees that (i) the grants of Liens pursuant to the Series B Note Documents and the Series A Note Documents constitute two separate and distinct grants of Liens and (ii) because of, among other things, their differing rights in the Collateral, the Series A Claims are fundamentally different from the Series B Claims and must be separately classified in any plan of reorganization proposed or adopted in an Insolvency Proceeding. To further effectuate the intent of the parties as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, if it is held that the claims of Series B Holders and Series A Holders in respect of the Collateral constitute only one secured claim (rather than separate classes of senior and junior secured claims), then Series A Holders hereby acknowledge and agree that all distributions shall be made as if there were separate classes of senior and junior secured claims against Note Parties in respect of the Collateral with the effect being that, to the extent that the aggregate value of the Collateral is sufficient (for this purpose ignoring all claims held by Series A Holders), Series B Holders shall be entitled to receive, in addition to amounts distributed to them in respect of principal, pre-petition interest and other claims, all amounts owing in respect of post-petition interest before any distribution is made in respect of the claims held by Series A Administrative Holder or any other Series A Holder, with Series A Administrative Holder and each other Series A Holder hereby acknowledging and agreeing to turn over to Series B Holders amounts otherwise received or receivable by it to the extent necessary to effectuate the intent of this sentence, even if such turnover has the effect of reducing the claim or recovery of Series A Holders. 

 

 (i) Nothing contained herein shall prohibit or in any way limit Series B Administrative Holder or any other Series B Holder from objecting in any Insolvency Proceeding or otherwise to any action taken by Series A Administrative Holder or any other Series A Holder, including the seeking by Series A Administrative Holder or any other Series A Holder of adequate protection or the asserting by Series A Administrative Holder or any other Series A Holder of any of its rights and remedies under the Series A Note Documents or otherwise. 

 

 (j) To the extent that Series A Administrative Holder or any other Series A Holder has or acquires rights under Section 363 or Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code with respect to 

     

 any of the Collateral, Series A Administrative Holder and each other Series
A Holder agrees not to assert any of such rights without the prior written
consent of Series B Administrative Holder; _provided_ that if requested by
Series B Administrative Holder, Series A Administrative Holder shall timely
exercise such rights in the manner requested by Series B Administrative
Holder, including any rights to payments in respect of such rights.

 

 (k) Each Series A Holder hereby waives any right to charge, or encourage or request any party to charge, the Collateral pursuant to Section 506(c) of the Bankruptcy Code. Each Series A Holder will not challenge or oppose, join with any party challenging or opposing or encourage any party to oppose or challenge or take any action whatsoever to impair the exercise by the Series B Holders of the rights and remedies granted to the Series B Holders in the Series B Note Documents. 

 

 (l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, in an Insolvency Proceeding, Series A Holders may raise any objection or take any other action that could otherwise be raised or taken by an unsecured creditor. 

 

  2.6 _Distributions of Payments and Proceeds of Collateral._

 

  All amounts received by Collateral Agent or any Noteholder in respect
of any Claims during the continuation of any Event of Default under any of the
Note Documents (other than Reorganization Securities received by the Series A
Holders in accordance with _Section 2_ hereof), and all realizations upon the
Collateral or any part thereof (whether occurring before or after the
commencement of a case under the Bankruptcy Code and including realizations
resulting from sales by a Note Party under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy
Code), including, without limitation, any realizations by way of an
Enforcement Action, shall be applied as follows: 

  

 

 (i) _First_ , to the Collateral Agents reasonable costs and expenses of sale,  collection or other realization, including reasonable legal expenses, liabilities and advances made or incurred by the Collateral Agent in connection therewith, and all amounts for which the Collateral Agent is entitled to indemnification hereunder; 

 

 (ii) _Second_ , to Series B Administrative Holders costs and expenses of sale, collection or other realization, including reasonable legal expenses, liabilities and advances made or incurred by Series B Administrative Holder in connection therewith, and all amounts for which Series B Administrative Holder is entitled to indemnification under the Series B Note Documents; 

 

 (iii) _Third_ , to the Series B Claims until the Series B Claims are Paid in Full in accordance with the Series B Note Documents; 

 

 (iv) _Fourth_ , to Series A Administrative Holders costs and expenses of sale, collection or other realization, including reasonable legal expenses, liabilities and advances made or incurred by Series A Administrative Holder in connection therewith, and all amounts for which Series A Administrative Holder is entitled to indemnification under the Series A Note Documents; 

 

 (v) _Fifth_ , to the Series A Claims until the Series A Claims are Paid in Full in accordance with the Series A Note Documents; and 

 

 (vi) _Sixth_ , to the parties entitled thereto as their interests may appear or as otherwise required by applicable law. 

   

  2.7 _Releases of Security Interests_. While any Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing under the Series B Note Documents:

 

 (a) Series A Holders will cooperate and provide any necessary or appropriate releases with respect to the Collateral to permit an Enforcement Action by Series B Administrative Holder, free and clear of Series A Holders Lien. 

 

 (b) In the event of a sale or other disposition of Collateral by a Note Party in accordance with the terms of the Series B Note Documents or, if required under the Series B Note Documents, with the consent of Series B Holders, if such Series B Holders are releasing their first priority Lien in connection therewith, the Lien of Series A Holders on such Collateral automatically shall be released and discharged to the extent the Lien of Series B Holders on such Collateral is released and discharged, and Series A Administrative Holder shall promptly execute and deliver any releases or other documents requested by Series B Administrative Holder to evidence such release and discharge; _provided_ that the Liens of Secured Parties in such Collateral shall attach to the Proceeds of such sale or other disposition, and the provisions of this Agreement shall be otherwise applicable to such Proceeds (including any provisions with respect to priority of Liens in such Proceeds, or application thereof to the Claims of Secured Parties). 

 

 (c) Until the Series B Claims are Paid in Full, Series A Administrative Holder, for itself and on behalf of Series A Holders, hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints Series B Administrative Holder and any officer or agent of Series B Administrative Holder, with full power of substitution, as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority in the place and stead of Series A Administrative Holder or such holder or in Series B Administrative Holders own name, from time to time in Series B Administrative Holders discretion, for the purpose of carrying out the terms of this _Section 2.7_ , to take any and all appropriate action and to execute any and all documents and instruments which may be necessary to accomplish the purposes of this  _Section 2.7_ , including any endorsements or other instruments of transfer or release. 

 

 (d) In connection with any Enforcement Action, Series A Holders agree that Series B Holders may release or refrain from enforcing Series A Holders Lien in the Collateral, or permit the use or consumption of such Collateral by a Note Party free of such Series A Holders Lien, in each case to the same extent that Series B Holders release, refrain from enforcing or permit the use or consumption of such Collateral by a Note Party free of their own Lien, without incurring any liability to Series A Holders. 

 

  2.8 _Waiver of Right to Require Marshaling_. Each Series A Holder
expressly waives any right that it otherwise might have to require any Series
B Holder to marshal assets or to resort to Collateral in any particular order
or manner, whether provided for by common law or statute. No Series B Holder
shall be required to enforce any guaranty or any Lien given by any Person as
a condition precedent or concurrent to the taking of any Enforcement Action.

 

  2.9 _Series A Holders Option to Purchase Series B Notes._

 

 (a) Without prejudice to the enforcement of remedies, the Series B Holders agree that upon and during the continuation of a Purchase Event (as defined below), one or more of the Series A Holders may request, and the Series B Holders hereby offer the Series A Holders the option, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Series B Claims (other than unmatured contingent obligations) at the time of purchase at par and accrued and unpaid interest, fees and expense reimbursement claims, without warranty or representation or recourse (except for representations and warranties required to be made by assigning lenders pursuant to the Assignment 

     

 and Assumption (as such term is defined in the Series B Note Documents)) and
to assume all other obligations of the Series B Holders pursuant to the Series
B Note Documents and this Agreement (including, without
limitation, obligations under _Section 4_ of this Agreement). If such right
is exercised, the exercising party shall give written notice of such exercise
to the Series B Holders, and upon receipt of such notice the Series B Holders
shall be obligated to sell the Series B Claims as contemplated hereby and the
parties shall endeavor to close promptly thereafter but in any event within
ten (10) Days of delivery of an exercise notice. A Purchase Event shall exist
(a) following the acceleration of the maturity of any Notes until the
rescission or annulment of such acceleration pursuant to applicable Note
Documents, (b) upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under any
Note Document; (c) upon the commencement of an Insolvency Proceeding; (d)
taking of any Enforcement Actions by or at the instruction of any Series B
Holder, and (e) the onset of any Standstill Period (each, a "Purchase Event").
The foregoing notwithstanding, a Purchase Event and the purchase right granted
under this _Section 2.9_  shall cease to exist thirty (30) days after the
initial occurrence of such Purchase Event. If one or more of the Series A
Holders exercise such purchase right, it shall be exercised pursuant to
documentation mutually acceptable to such Series A Holders and Required
Series B Holders. If none of the Series A Holders exercise such right during
such Purchase Event, the Series B Holders shall have no further obligations
pursuant to this _Section 2.9(a)_ in respect of such Purchase Event. In any
event, prior to the closing of any sale of Series B Claims hereunder, Series B
Holders may take any actions in their sole discretion in respect of their
rights under the Series B Note Documents, without regard to the Series A
Holders rights hereunder, provided, however, that during the ten-day period
after one or more Series A Holders has given notice exercising its purchase
option hereunder, Series B Holders will not take any Enforcement Action or
waive or release any Lien unless, in the good faith determination of the
Series B Administrative Holder, delay of the Enforcement Action would have a
reasonable likelihood of causing a diminution in the value of the Collateral
or a waiver or forfeiture of rights in respect of Liens, it being further
understood nothing in this sentence will prohibit the receipt and application
of Proceeds of Collateral and other payments in accordance with  _Section
2.6_.

 

 (b) Without prejudice to the enforcement of remedies, the Series B Holders agree that at any time on or before June 30, 2008, one or more of the Series A Holders may request, and each Series B Holders hereby offers the Series A Holders the option, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the aggregate principal amount of its respective Repriority Claims at par and accrued and unpaid interest, without warranty or representation or recourse (except for representations and warranties required to be made by assigning lenders pursuant to the Assignment and Assumption (as such term is defined in the Series B Note Documents)). If such right is exercised, the exercising party shall give written notice of such exercise to the Series B Holders, and upon receipt of such notice the Series B Holders identified in such notice shall be obligated to sell the Repriority Claims identified in such notice as contemplated hereby and the parties shall endeavor to close the corresponding Repriority Claims Purchase Event promptly thereafter but in any event within ten (10) Days of delivery of an exercise notice. If one or more of the Series A Holders exercise such purchase right, it shall be exercised pursuant to documentation mutually acceptable to such Series A Holders and Required Series B Holders. If none of the Series A Holders exercise such right by June 30, 2008, the Series B Holders shall have no further obligations pursuant to this _Section 2.9(b)_ in respect of such Repriority Claims Purchase Event. In any event, prior to the closing of any sale of Repriority Claims hereunder, Series B Holders may take any actions in their sole discretion in respect of their rights under the Series B Note Documents, without regard to the Series A Holders rights hereunder, provided, however, that during the ten-day period after one or more Series A Holders has given notice exercising its purchase option hereunder, Series B Holders will not take any Enforcement Action or waive or release any Lien unless, in the good faith determination of the Series B Administrative Holder, delay of the Enforcement Action would have a reasonable likelihood of causing a diminution in the value of the Collateral or a waiver or forfeiture of rights in respect of Liens, it being further understood nothing in this sentence will prohibit the receipt and application of Proceeds of Collateral and other payments in accordance with _Section 2.6_. 

     

  2.10 _Further Assurances_.

 

  The Series A Holders and Series A Administrative Holder shall
cooperate in all respects with the Series B Holder and Series B Administrative
Holder, and take all action reasonably requested by the Series B Holders and
Series B Administrative Holder to effectuate this Section 2.

 

  2.11 _Restriction on Amendments_. The Noteholders shall not, without
the consent of the requisite voting majority of the Series A Holders under the
Series A Note Documents and the requisite voting majority of the Series B
Holders under the Series B Note Documents, amend or modify Note Documents
to: 

 

  (a) shorten the final maturity of, or require any scheduled
payment of, principal or require additional mandatory payments of principal
(but nothing in this paragraph restricts acceleration of obligations as a
remedy for default);

 

  (b) increase interest rates (except by application of default
interest provided for in the Note Documents as in effect on the date hereof);

 

  (c) add a covenant or an Event of Default that would directly
restrict one or more Note Parties from making payments under the Note
Documents which would otherwise be permitted under the Note Documents as in
effect on the date hereof;

 

  (d) add any new Event of Default or covenant under the Note
Documents, or make any Event of Default or covenant more restrictive.

 

  SECTION 3. _Repriority Event_. If the Repriority Event occurs on or
before June 30, 2008, then _Section 2_ shall immediately cease to apply and
this _Section 3_ shall immediately commence to apply. Conversely, the terms
of this _Section 3_ shall not apply prior to the Repriority Event, and if the
Repriority Event has not occurred on or prior to June 30, 2008, then _Section
2_ shall continue to apply after such date, regardless of any amounts
subsequently received by Series B Holders, and this _Section 3_ shall be
deemed terminated and of no further force or effect. The parties hereto agree
that the following terms shall apply in the event this _Section 3_ applies in
accordance with the foregoing:

 

 3.1 _Pari Passu Status_. The Claims shall be deemed to be pari passu and equal in right of payment, and all Liens securing the Claims shall be deemed to be equal in priority, and shall be deemed to equally and ratably secure all Claims, notwithstanding the time or order of filing of any financing statements or any other action taken in respect of attachment or perfection of any Liens. 

 

  3.2 _Allocation of Payments._

 

  Except for the payments described in the definition of the term
"Repriority Event" resulting in the application of this _Section 3_ , all
payments of principal and interest in respect of Notes shall be made ratably
to the Noteholders in proportion to each Noteholders Pro Rata Share. Expense
reimbursements and indemnification payments may be received and retained by
the parties entitled thereto under the Note Documents. Any payment received by
a Noteholder in violation of the first sentence of this _Section 3.2_ shall
be received in trust for the benefit of all Noteholders, and shall be
delivered to the Collateral Agent for distribution to the Noteholders in
accordance with parts " _Third_ " and " _Fourth_ " of _Section 3.3_.

     

  3.3 _Distributions of Payments and Proceeds of Collateral._

 

  All amounts received by Collateral Agent or any Noteholder in respect
of any Claims after an Event of Default in respect of any Note Document, and
all realizations upon the Collateral or any part thereof (whether occurring
before or after the commencement of a case under the Bankruptcy Code and
including realizations resulting from sales by a Note Party under Section 363
of the Bankruptcy Code), including, without limitation, any realizations by
way of an Enforcement Action, shall be applied as follows:

  

 

 (i) _First_ , to the Collateral Agents reasonable costs and expenses of sale,  collection or other realization, including reasonable legal expenses, liabilities and advances made or incurred by the Collateral Agent in connection therewith, and all amounts for which the Collateral Agent is entitled to indemnification hereunder; 

 

 (ii) _Second_ , to Series B Administrative Holders and Series A Administrative Holders costs and expenses of sale, collection or other realization, including reasonable legal expenses, liabilities and advances made or incurred by Series B Administrative Holder or Series A Administrative Holder in connection therewith, and all amounts for which Series B Administrative Holder or Series A Administrative Holder is entitled to indemnification under the Note Documents (it being agreed that to the extent amounts available for distribution under this clause are insufficient to cover all such amounts, such amounts shall be paid ratably in proportion to the amounts so tendered for payment by the Series B Administrative Holder and Series A Administrative Holder, respectively); 

 

 (iii) _Third_ , to the pro rata payment of interest accrued in respect of all Claims; 

 

 (iv) _Fourth_ , to the pro rata payment of all other Claims until all Claims are Paid in Full in accordance with the Note Documents; and 

 

 (v) _Fifth_ , to the parties entitled thereto as their interests may appear or as otherwise required by applicable law. 

 

 3.4 _Amendment and Waiver of Note Documents._

 

 (a) Any amendment to or waiver of the terms of any of the Note Documents (other than this Agreement) shall require the consent of Required Noteholders, and any such amendment or waiver to which Required Noteholders and the Issuer have given their written consent shall be binding on the Noteholders as if the same had consented thereto and any such amendment, waiver or consent shall apply automatically to any comparable provision of any other Note Document automatically, without the consent of the parties thereto and without any other action of any other Person, _provided_ that without the written consent of each Noteholder affected thereby, no such amendment, waiver or consent shall: 

   

 

 (i) postpone any date fixed by any Note Document for any payment of the principal amount or interest due to the  Noteholders (or any of them); 

 

 (ii) reduce the principal or principal amount of, or the rate of interest specified herein on, any Note, or any other amounts payable under any other Note Document; _provided_ that only the consent of the Required Noteholders shall be necessary 

 

 

   

 

 to amend the definition of " _Default Rate_ " set forth in any Note Document
or to waive any obligation of the Issuer to pay interest at the Default Rate;

 

 (iii) change _Section 2.07_ of either of the Note Purchase Agreements in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby; 

 

 (iv) change _Section 9.01_ of either of the Note Purchase Agreements or the definition of " _Required Holders_ " set forth therein or any other provision thereof specifying the number, identity or percentage of Noteholders party thereto required to amend, waive or otherwise modify any rights thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent thereunder; 

 

 (v) release all or substantially all of the Collateral securing the Claims or release all or substantially all of the Guarantors from their obligations under the Note Documents; 

 

 (vi) alter any provisions, or waive any payment, with respect to any prepayment or redemption of the Notes, including providing for any such prepayment or redemption on any basis other than pro rata based on the aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding; 

 

 (vii) waive a Default or an Event of Default in the payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, under, and in each case defined in, the respective Note Purchase Agreements; 

 

 (viii) make any Claim payable in any currency other than U.S. Dollars; 

 

 (ix) impair the right of any Noteholder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to the Notes; or 

 

 (x) except as expressly permitted in the Note Documents, consent to the assignment or transfer by any Note Party of any of their rights or obligations under this Agreement or any other Note Document. 

 

 (b) Any amendment or supplement to any Note Document which has been consented to by any Note Party and which is beneficial to the Noteholders party thereto shall be deemed to apply for the equal and ratable benefit of all other Noteholders with respect to Note Documents to which they are party. Any Noteholder may waive the benefit of this subsection (b) to the extent such waiver would not conflict with to subsection (a) above. 

 

  3.5 _Acceleration of Notes._

 

  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Note Document, except
in the case of automatic acceleration upon an Insolvency Proceeding (or
similar event), no election by any Noteholder or group thereof to declare the
principal amount outstanding under any Notes due prior to its stated maturity
or to become subject to a mandatory offer to purchase by a Note Party, shall
be effective unless approved by Required Noteholders.

   

   3.6 _Further Assurances_. 

 

  The Series B Holders and Series B Administrative Holder shall
cooperate in all respects with the Series A Holder and Series A Administrative
Holder, and take all action reasonably requested by the Series A Holders and
Series A Administrative Holder to or effectuate this Section 3.

 

  SECTION 4. _Appointment of Collateral Agent_. _Appointment and
Authorization of_ _Collateral Agent._

 

  Each Noteholder hereby irrevocably appoints, designates and authorizes
the Collateral Agent to take such action as contractual representative on its
behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and each Collateral Document
and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated
to it by the terms of this Agreement or any other Collateral Document,
together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere herein or in
any other Note Document, the Collateral Agent shall not have any duties or
responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, nor shall the
Collateral Agent have or be deemed to have any trustee or fiduciary
relationship with any Noteholder or participant, and no implied covenants,
functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read
into this Agreement or any other Note Document or otherwise exist against the
Collateral Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence,
the use of the term "agent" herein and in the other Note Documents with
reference to the Collateral Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or
other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any
applicable Law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market
custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an
administrative relationship between independent contracting parties. The
provisions of this Section 4 are solely for the benefit of the Collateral
Agent and the Noteholders and no Note Party shall have any rights as a third
party beneficiary of any of the provisions thereof. In performing its
functions and duties hereunder, the Collateral Agent shall act solely as an
agent of the Noteholders and does not assume and shall not be deemed to have
assumed any obligation towards or relationship of agency or trust with or for
any Note Party.

 

  4.2 _General Immunity._

 

 (a) The Collateral Agent shall not be responsible to any Noteholder for the execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability, collectibility or sufficiency hereof or any other Note Document or for any representations, warranties, recitals or statements made herein or therein or made in any written or oral statements or in any financial or other statements, instruments, reports or certificates or any other documents furnished or made by any Noteholders or by or on behalf of any Note Party in connection with the Note Documents and the transactions contemplated thereby or for the financial condition or business affairs of any Note Party or any other Person liable for the payment of any Obligations, nor shall the Collateral Agent be required to ascertain or inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, conditions, provisions, covenants or agreements contained in any of the Note Documents or as to the use of the proceeds of the Notes or as to the existence or possible existence of any Event of Default or Default or to make any disclosures with respect to the foregoing. Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, Collateral Agent shall not have any liability arising from confirmations of the outstanding amount of the Notes. 

 

 (b) Neither the Collateral Agent, nor any of its officers, partners, directors, employees, agents or affiliates shall be liable to Noteholders for any action taken or omitted by the Collateral Agent under or in connection with any of the Note Documents except to the extent caused by the Collateral Agents or Collateral Agents gross negligence, willful misconduct or breach of this Agreement or any Note Document. The Collateral Agent shall be entitled to refrain from any act or the taking of any action (including the failure to take an action) in connection herewith or any of the other 

     

 Note Documents or from the exercise of any power, discretion or authority
vested in it hereunder or thereunder unless and until the Collateral Agent
shall have received instructions in respect thereof from the Series
B Administrative Holder (if _Section 2_ applies) or the Required Noteholders
(if _Section 3_ applies) and, upon receipt of such instructions from the
Series B Administrative Holder (if _Section 2_ applies) or the Required
Noteholders (if _Section 3_ applies) the Collateral Agent shall be entitled
to act or (where so instructed) refrain from acting, or to exercise such
power, discretion or authority, in accordance with such instructions. Without
prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, (i) the Collateral Agent shall
be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any
communication, instrument or document believed by it to be genuine and correct
and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person or Persons, and shall be
entitled to rely and shall be protected in relying on opinions and judgments
of attorneys (who may be attorneys for Issuer and/or other Note Parties),
accountants, experts and other professional advisors selected by it; and (ii)
no Noteholder shall have any right of action whatsoever against the Collateral
Agent as a result of its acting or (where so instructed) refraining from
acting hereunder or any of the other Note Documents in accordance with the
instructions of the Series B Administrative Holder (if _Section 2_ applies) or
the Required Noteholders (if _Section 3_ applies).

 

 (c) The Collateral Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers under this Agreement or under any other Note Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Collateral Agent. The Collateral Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Affiliates. The exculpatory, indemnification and other provisions of this Agreement (including _Section 4.2(b)_ ) shall apply to the Affiliates of the Collateral Agent. All of the rights, benefits, and privileges (including the exculpatory and indemnification provisions) of this _Section 4.2_ shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Affiliates of any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities as sub-agent as if such sub-agent and Affiliates were named herein. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to each sub-agent appointed by Collateral Agent, (i) such sub-agent shall be a third party beneficiary under this Agreement with respect to all such rights, benefits and privileges (including exculpatory rights and rights to indemnification) and shall have all of the rights and benefits of a third party beneficiary, including an independent right of action to enforce such rights, benefits and privileges (including exculpatory rights and rights to indemnification) directly, without the consent or joinder of any other Person, against any or all of the Note Parties and the Noteholders, (ii) such rights, benefits and privileges (including exculpatory rights and rights to indemnification) shall not be modified or amended without the consent of such sub-agent, and (iii) such sub-agent shall only have obligations to Collateral Agent and not to any Note Party, Noteholder or any other Person and no Note Party, Noteholder or any other Person shall have any rights, directly or indirectly, as a third party beneficiary or otherwise, against such sub-agent. 

 

  4.3 _Collateral Matters._

 

  The Noteholders irrevocably authorize the Collateral Agent, at its
option and in its discretion:

 

 (a) to take any action with respect to the Collateral which may be necessary to perfect and maintain perfected the Liens upon the Collateral granted pursuant to any of the Note Documents; 

 

 (b) to release any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Collateral Agent under any Note Document (i) upon termination of the Payment in Full of all Obligations, (ii) that is sold or to be sold as part of or in connection with any Disposition permitted under each of the Note Purchase Agreements, (iii) in accordance with any provision for the release thereof provided for in the Note Documents or this Agreement, (iv) pursuant to the instructions of the Series B Administrative 

     

 Holder in accordance with _Section 2.7_ of this Agreement (so long as such
provision applies) in connection with any Enforcement Action, or (v)
subject to _Section 3.4(a)(v)_ hereof and _Section 9.01_ of each of the Note
Purchase Agreements, and so long as  _Section 3_ applies, if so requested (or
consented to) by the Required Noteholders;

 

 (c) to subordinate any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Collateral Agent under any Note Document to the holder of any Lien on such property that is permitted by _Section 6.02_ of each of the Note Purchase Agreements; 

 

 (d) to take any action to permit any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Collateral Agent under any Note Document to be equal in priority with the Liens securing the Claims to the extent permitted by Section 6.02 of each of the Note Purchase Agreements; and 

 

 (e) following any such release or subordination described in the preceding clauses (b) and (c), to deliver to the Issuer or any other Person, at its expense, any Collateral so released that is then held by the Collateral Agent hereunder and to execute and deliver to the Issuer or any other Person such releases or other documents as the Issuer or such Person shall request to evidence or effectuate such release or subordination of Liens (including UCC termination statements, intercreditor agreements and collateral agency agreements). 

 

 (f) Upon request by the Collateral Agent at any time, the Series B Administrative Holder (if _Section 2_ applies) or the Required Noteholders (if _Section 3_ applies) will confirm in writing the Collateral Agents authority to release or subordinate its interest in particular types or items of property pursuant to this _Section 4.3_. 

 

  4.4 _Duties in the Case of Enforcement._

 

  In case one of more Events of Default have occurred and shall be
continuing, the Collateral Agent shall, if (a) so requested (or consented to)
by the Series B Administrative Holder (if _Section 2_ applies) or the
Required Noteholders (if _Section 3_  applies) and (b) the Noteholders have
provided to the Collateral Agent such additional indemnities and assurances
against expenses and liabilities as the Collateral Agent may reasonably
request, proceed to enforce the provisions of any Note Documents authorizing
the sale or other disposition of all or any part of the Collateral (or any
other property which is security for the Obligations) and exercise all or any
such other legal and equitable and other rights or remedies as it may have in
respect of such Collateral (or such other property). The Series B
Administrative Holder (if _Section 2_ applies) or the Required Noteholders (if
_Section 3_ applies) may direct the Collateral Agent in writing as to the
method and the extent of any such sale or other disposition to the extent
permitted under the terms hereof, the Noteholders hereby agreeing to
indemnify and hold the Collateral Agent harmless from all liabilities incurred
in respect of all actions taken or omitted in accordance with such directions,
provided that the Collateral Agent need not comply with any such direction to
the extent that the Collateral Agent reasonably believes the Collateral
Agents compliance with such direction to be unlawful or commercially
unreasonable in any applicable jurisdiction.

 

  4.5 _Right to Indemnity._

 

  Each Noteholder, in proportion to its Pro Rata Share at the time any
claim therefor is made, severally agrees to indemnify Collateral Agent, to the
extent that Collateral Agent shall not have been reimbursed by any Note Party
(but without limiting any Note Partys reimbursement obligations), for and
against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses (including counsel fees and
disbursements) or disbursements of any kind or nature

   

 whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against
Collateral Agent in exercising its powers, rights and remedies or performing
its duties hereunder or under the other Note Documents or otherwise in its
capacity as Collateral Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the other Note Documents; _provided_ , no Noteholder shall be
liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
resulting solely from Collateral Agents gross negligence or willful
misconduct or breach of this Agreement or any Note Document. If any indemnity
furnished to Collateral Agent for any purpose shall, in the opinion of
Collateral Agent, be insufficient or become impaired, Collateral Agent may
call for additional indemnity and cease, or not commence, to do the acts
indemnified against until such additional indemnity is furnished; provided, in
no event shall this sentence require any Noteholder to indemnify Collateral
Agent against any liability, obligation, loss, damage, penalty, action,
judgment, suit, cost, expense or disbursement in excess of such Noteholders
Pro Rata Share thereof; and _provided_ , _further_ , this sentence shall not
be deemed to require any Noteholder to indemnify Collateral Agent against any
liability, obligation, loss, damage, penalty, action, judgment, suit, cost,
expense or disbursement described in the proviso in the immediately preceding
sentence.

 

  4.6 _Instruction of Collateral Agent._

 

 (a) If any Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Collateral Agent shall, at the request of the Series B Administrative Holder (if _Section 2_ applies) or the Required Noteholders (if _Section 3_ applies), take any or all of the following actions: 

  

 

 (i) exercise on behalf of itself and the Noteholders all rights and remedies available to it and the Noteholders under the  Collateral Documents or applicable law, which shall include the rights, powers and remedies (i) granted to secured parties under the UCC or other applicable Uniform Commercial Code; or (ii) granted to the Collateral Agent under any other applicable  Law any other agreement between any Note Party and the Collateral Agent; 

 

 (ii) All such rights, powers and remedies shall be cumulative and not alternative and enforceable, in Collateral Agents or the discretion of the Series B Administrative Holder (if _Section 2_ applies) or the Required Noteholders (if _Section 3 _ applies), alternatively, successively, or concurrently on any one or more occasions, and shall include the right to apply to a court of equity for an injunction to restrain a breach or threatened breach by any Note Party of this Agreement or any of the Note Documents. Any single or partial exercise of, or forbearance, failure or delay in exercising any right, power or remedy shall not be, nor shall any such single or partial exercise of, or forbearance, failure or delay be deemed to be a limitation, modification or waiver of any right, power or remedy and shall not preclude the further exercise thereof; and every right, power and remedy of the Collateral Agent or the Noteholders shall continue in full force and effect until such right, power and remedy is specifically waived by an instrument in writing executed and delivered with respect to each such waiver by such parties. 

 

 (b) The Collateral Agent shall not take any action at the instruction of or for the benefit of Series A Holders if Series A Holders would be prohibited from taking such action by _Section 2_ of this Agreement. 

   

  4.7 _Successor Collateral Agent._

 

 (a) The Collateral Agent may resign at any time by giving twenty days prior written notice thereof to the Noteholders and the Issuer. Upon any such notice of resignation, the Series B Administrative Holder (if _Section 2_ applies) or the Required Noteholders (if _Section 3_ applies) shall have the right to appoint a successor Collateral Agent. The Collateral Agents resignation shall become effective twenty days after delivery by the Collateral Agent of the notice referred to in the first sentence of this _Section 4.7_ (the "Resignation Date"). On the Resignation Date, such retiring Collateral Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. After any retiring Collateral Agents resignation hereunder as Collateral Agent, the provisions of this  _Section 4_ shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Collateral Agent hereunder. Any successor Collateral Agent appointed pursuant to this Section shall, upon its acceptance of such appointment, become the successor Collateral Agent for all purposes hereunder. 

 

 (b) If the Repriority Event does not timely occur, Series B Holders may at any time thereafter appoint a replacement Collateral Agent. 

 

 (c) In the event the Collateral Agent resigns or is replaced, the Issuer and the Noteholders shall cooperate in every manner reasonably requested by the Series B Administrative Holder (if _Section 2_ applies) or the Required Noteholders (if _Section 3_ applies) and the successor Collateral Agent to facilitate the transfer of Liens (and perfection thereof), Collateral and related responsibilities to such replacement Collateral Agent, which cooperation shall include modification of the terms applicable to the Collateral Agent to the extent necessary to conform to such replacement Collateral Agents standard terms for such engagements. Each of the Noteholders acknowledges and agrees in advance that such modifications may include additional waivers and other terms that diminish the rights of the Noteholders relating to the Collateral Agent. 

 

 (d) Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the Initial Collateral Agent may assign its rights and obligations hereunder to any of its Affiliates without the consent of any other Person. 

 

  4.8 _Amendments._

 

  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement or in any
Note Document, no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and
signed by the Collateral Agent, affect the rights or duties of the Collateral
Agent under this Agreement or any other Note Document.

 

  SECTION 5. _Miscellaneous_.The allocation of claim and Lien priorities
set forth in this Agreement shall govern the relationship and the relative
priority of the Noteholders with respect to the Collateral irrespective of the
time or order of attachment or perfection of any of Liens, the time or order
of filing of financing statements, the acquisition of purchase money or other
Liens, the time of giving or failure to give notice of the acquisition or
expected acquisition of purchase money or other Liens, the rules for
determining priority under the UCC or any other law or rule governing
relative priorities of Secured Parties, and the fact that any Liens with
respect to any Collateral are subordinated, voided, avoided, invalidated or
lapsed, or any other circumstances whatsoever. Any Lien granted to secure
Claims is intended by the Note Parties, and shall deemed for all purposes, to
constitute two separate Lien grants, one for the purpose of securing the
Series B Claims, and one for the purpose of securing Series A Claims,
the relative priorities of which shall be determined by the terms of this
Agreement.

 

 (b) Each of the Collateral Agent, Series A Administrative Holder and each Series A Holder agrees that it shall not directly or indirectly take any action to contest or challenge the 

     

 validity, legality, enforceability, perfection or priority of any of the
Series B Claims, any of the documents or instruments evidencing such Series B
Claims or Series B Liens. Each of the Collateral Agent, Series
B Administrative Holder and each Series B Holder agrees that it shall not
directly or indirectly take any action to contest or challenge the validity,
legality, enforceability, perfection or priority of any of the Series A
Claims, any of the documents or instruments evidencing such Series A Claims
or Series A Liens. Each Holder hereby acknowledges that the provisions of this
Agreement are intended to be enforceable at all times, whether before or after
any Insolvency Proceeding or other proceeding. Each Holder hereby waives any
right to require the Holders to marshall the Collateral for the Claims.

 

 (c) For the purposes of the allocation of priorities, any claim of a right of set-off shall be treated in all respects as a security interest, and no claimed right of set-off shall be asserted by (x) any Series A Holder to defeat or diminish the rights or priorities of any Series B Lien or Series B Claim, or (y) any Series B Holder to defeat or diminish the rights or priorities of any Series A Lien or Series A Claim. 

 

 (d) The parties hereto agree that, except in an Insolvency Proceeding (and to the extent not otherwise prohibited by this Agreement) Series B Holders shall not, without the consent of Series A Administrative Holder, acquire or hold, directly or indirectly, any Lien on any assets of any Note Party securing any Series B Claims which assets are not also subject to Lien of the priority required by this Agreement in favor of the Series A Holders under the Series A Note Documents. Collateral Agent shall not accept, and no Note Party shall grant, any Lien for the purpose of securing Series B Claims unless this subsection (d) shall have been complied with in full, and any Lien so granted in violation of this sentence shall be deemed to have been granted for the purpose of securing Series A Claims. 

 

 (e) Each party to this Agreement shall promptly execute and deliver to any other party hereto any and all financing statements, subordination agreements and other documents reasonably requested by such party to the extent necessary to effectuate the terms of this Agreement. 

 

 (f) All terms used in this Agreement and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings as set forth in Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in the State of New York as in effect from time to time. Except as otherwise provided herein, priority shall be in accordance with the provisions of the UCC. 

 

 (g) The parties hereto agree that until all Series B Claims have been Paid in Full, Series A Holders shall not, without the consent of Series B Administrative Holder, acquire or hold, directly or indirectly, any Lien on any assets of any Note Party securing any Series A Claims which assets are not also subject to the first priority Lien in favor of the Series B Holders under the Series B Note Documents unless the Series B Holders have intentionally released their Lien on Collateral prior to the occurrence of any Event of Default. If any Series A Holder shall, in violation of this Agreement, acquire or hold any Lien on any assets of any Note Party securing any Series A Claims, which assets are not also subject to the first priority Lien in favor of Series B Holders under the Series B Note Documents, then Series A Holders shall, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other Series A Note Document, (i) be deemed to hold and have held such Lien for the benefit of Series B Administrative Holder as security for the Series B Claims and shall assign such Lien to Collateral Agent for the benefit of Series B Administrative Holder (in which case Collateral Agent may retain a junior Lien on such assets for the benefit of Series A Administrative Holder subject to the terms hereof) or (ii) if so requested by Series B Administrative Holder, release such Lien. Collateral Agent shall not accept, and no Note Party shall grant, any Lien for the purpose of securing Series A Claims unless this subsection (g) shall have been complied with in full, and any Lien so granted in violation of this sentence shall be deemed to have been granted for the purpose of securing Series B Claims. 

     

 (h) The parties hereto agree that until all Series A Claims have been Paid in Full, Series B Holders shall not, without the consent of Series A Administrative Holder, acquire or hold, directly or indirectly, any Lien on any assets of any Note Party securing any Series B Claims which assets are not also subject to the second priority Lien in favor of the Series A Holders under the Series A Note Documents unless the Series B Holders have intentionally released their Lien on Collateral prior to the occurrence of any Event of Default. If any Series B Holder shall, in violation of this Agreement (and except as permitted by Section 2.5), acquire or hold any Lien on any assets of any Note Party securing any Series B Claims, which assets are not also subject to the second priority Lien in favor of Series A Holders under the Series A Note Documents, then Series B Holders shall, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other Series B Note Document, (i) be deemed to hold and have held such Lien for the benefit of Series A Administrative Holder as security for the Series A Claims and shall assign such Lien to Collateral Agent for the benefit of Series A Administrative Holder (in which case Collateral Agent may retain a senior Lien on such assets for the benefit of Series B Administrative Holder subject to the terms hereof) or (ii) if so requested by Series A Administrative Holder, release such Lien. Collateral Agent shall not accept, and no Note Party shall grant, any Lien for the purpose of securing Series B Claims unless this subsection (h) shall have been complied with in full, and any Lien so granted in violation of this sentence shall be deemed to have been granted for the purpose of securing Series A Claims. 

 

 (i) Subject to _Section 5(q)_ , this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by Series B Holders, Series A Holders, Collateral Agent and in each case their respective successors and assigns, including without limitation in relation to any replacement agreement or facility existing at any time to refund, refinance, replace or renew (including subsequent or successive refinancings, replacements and renewals) the Series B Note Purchase Agreement or the Series A Note Purchase Agreement. Each party hereto represents and warrants that it is authorized to enter into this Agreement. 

 

 (j) This Agreement, which the parties hereto expressly acknowledge is a "subordination agreement" under Section 510(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, shall be effective before and after the commencement of an Insolvency Proceeding. All references in this Agreement to any Note Party shall include such Note Party as a debtor-in-possession and any receiver or trustee for such Note Party in any Insolvency Proceeding. 

 

 (k) This Agreement is intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement relating to the subject matter hereof and is intended as a complete statement of the terms and conditions of their agreement relating to the subject matter hereof. 

 

 (l) No failure or delay on the part of any Secured Party in the exercise of any power, right, remedy or privilege under this Agreement shall impair such power, right, remedy or privilege or shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power, right or privilege preclude any other or further exercise of any other power, right or privilege. The waiver of any such right, power, remedy or privilege with respect to particular facts and circumstances shall not be deemed to be a waiver with respect to other facts and circumstances. 

 

 (m) Each notice hereunder shall be in writing and may be personally served or sent by fax or United States mail or courier service and shall be deemed to have been given when delivered in person or by courier service and signed for against receipt thereof, upon receipt of fax, or three Business Days after depositing it in the United States mail with postage prepaid and properly addressed. Unless otherwise specified in a notice mailed or delivered in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this _Section 5(m)_ , notices, demands, instructions and other communications in writing shall be given to or made upon the respective parties hereto at their respective addresses indicated on the signature pages hereof. In the event that Collateral Agent or any Noteholder shall be required by the

     

 UCC or any other applicable law to give any notice to any other Noteholder,
such notice shall be given in accordance with this paragraph and, as between
such parties, five days notice shall be conclusively deemed to be
commercially reasonable.

 

 (n) This Agreement and any amendments, waivers, consents or supplements hereto or in connection herewith may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto or thereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, but all such counterparts together shall constitute but one and the same instrument; signature pages may be detached from multiple separate counterparts and attached to a single counterpart so that all signature pages are physically attached to the same document. This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution of a counterpart hereof by each of the parties hereto. 

 

 (o) In case any provision in or obligation under this Agreement shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions or obligations, or of such provision or obligation in any other jurisdiction, shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. 

 

 (p) THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND SHALL BE CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK (INCLUDING SECTION 5-1401 OF THE GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK).

 

 (q) This Agreement shall terminate (except with respect to unasserted indemnification obligations) upon Payment in Full of all Series B Claims without further action on the part of the parties hereto. 

 

 (r) Amendments; Waivers. No amendment, modification, supplement, termination, consent or waiver of or to any provision of this Agreement nor any consent to any departure therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the requisite voting majority of Series B Holders under the terms of the Series B Note Purchase Agreement and the requisite voting majority of Series A Holders under the terms of the Series A Note Purchase Agreement, and, solely if such amendment, modification, supplement, termination, consent or waiver is to Section 3.4 hereof or the definition of Repriority Event or is materially adverse to or otherwise materially changes the obligations of any Note Party, Issuer; provided, however, that Issuer shall be deemed to have given its consent five Business Days after the date notice of any such amendment, modification, supplement, termination, consent or waiver has been delivered to Issuer unless such consent is expressly refused by Issuer prior to such day. Any waiver of any provision of this Agreement, or any consent to any departure from the terms of any provisions of this Agreement, shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given. 

 

 (s) Each of the Noteholders and the Collateral Agent understands that the Issuer has undertaken to provide collateral and additional guarantees for the Fifth Third Facility, and to cause the Note Documents and Liens securing same to be subordinated to the Fifth Third Facility and Liens securing same. The Noteholders and the Collateral Agent agree to reasonably cooperate with the Issuers efforts to provide such collateral, on terms reasonably acceptable to the Noteholders, and the Noteholders agree to subordinate their respective Claims to the Fifth Third Facility, and to modify their respective Note Documents as necessary to accommodate such collateral (including the priority of the Liens with respect thereto) and additional guarantees, provided such subordination terms, and any such modifications, are reasonably acceptable to the Noteholders. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the acceptance of the Noteholders will be determined by the requisite voting majority of Series B Holders 

     

 under the terms of the Series B Note Purchase Agreement and the requisite
voting majority of Series A Holders under the terms of the Series A Note
Purchase Agreement (if Section 2 applies) or the Required Noteholders
(if Section 3 applies). The Issuer agrees that modification of the Fifth
Third Facility will be made subject to restrictions in substantially the form
of those set forth in _Section 2.11_ mutatis mutandis, and that the waiver of
such restrictions will require the consent of the requisite voting majority of
Series B Holders under the terms of the Series B Note Purchase Agreement and
the requisite voting majority of Series A Holders under the terms of the
Series A Note Purchase Agreement (if Section 2 applies) or the Required
Noteholders (if Section 3 applies).

     

  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have duly executed this
Agreement as of the date first above written.
