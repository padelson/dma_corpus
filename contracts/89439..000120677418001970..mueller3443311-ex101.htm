and Transaction Expenses on a basis consistent with the definitions of Closing
Net Working Capital (including _Exhibit A_ ), Closing Indebtedness, Closing
Cash and Transaction Expenses and in accordance with GAAP consistently applied
(the " _Closing Statement_ "). The provisions set forth in this _Section 1.05_
are not intended to permit the introduction of principles, policies,
practices, procedures, methodologies, classifications, methods, conventions,
assumptions, judgments or estimation techniques in preparing the Closing
Statement or determining the amounts of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Cash or Transaction Expenses or the Purchaser Adjustment
Amount or Seller Adjustment Amount, as the case may be, that are different
from those used in the determination of the respective amounts estimated
pursuant to _Section 1.02(a)_ or that are not in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied or as set forth on _Exhibit A_.

 

(b) During the thirty (30) days immediately following the Representative's
receipt of the Closing Statement and any period of dispute thereafter until
submission of any disagreements to the Accounting Firm pursuant to _Section
1.05(c)_ , the Representative may make inquiries of the Purchaser and its
accountants regarding questions concerning or disagreements with the Closing
Statement arising in the course of its review thereof, and the Purchaser shall
reasonably cooperate, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
any such accountants to cooperate, with and respond to such inquiries. After
delivery of the Closing Statement to the Representative, Purchaser shall
provide (subject to customary confidentiality restrictions) the Representative
(or, if requested, the Representative's auditors) with reasonable access at
reasonable times to the books, records (including work papers, schedules,
memoranda and other documents) and relevant accounting personnel of the
Company solely for purposes of their review of the Closing Statement. The
Purchaser agrees that following the Closing it will not, and it will cause the
Company not to, take any actions with respect to the books, records, policies
and procedures of the Company that would obstruct or prevent the preparation
of the Closing Statement or the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital,
Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash or Transaction Expenses, or the
Representative's review of the foregoing, in each case, as provided in this
_Section 1.05_.

 

(c) If the Representative disagrees with any part of the Purchaser's
calculation of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash
and Transaction Expenses, the Representative shall, within thirty (30) days
after the Representative's receipt of the Closing Statement, notify the
Purchaser in writing of such disagreement by setting forth the
Representative's calculation of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Cash or Transaction Expenses (an " _Objection Notice_
"). If an Objection Notice is not delivered to the Purchaser within thirty
(30) days after the Representative's receipt of the Closing Statement, the
Closing Statement shall be final, binding, and non-appealable by the parties
hereto. During the fifteen (15) days immediately following the delivery of an
Objection Notice, or such longer period as the Representative and the
Purchaser may agree in writing, the Representative and the Purchaser shall
seek in good faith to resolve in writing any differences that they may have
with respect to any matter specified in the Objection Notice, and all such
discussions related thereto shall be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules
of Evidence (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) and any applicable
similar state rule, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Representative
and the Purchaser. In the event that the Purchaser and the Representative
resolve in writing all such disagreements, the amounts for Closing Net Working
Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Transaction Expenses so agreed
in writing by the Purchaser and the Representative shall be final, binding,
and non-appealable by the parties hereto. In the event that the Purchaser and
the Representative are unable to resolve all such disagreements within such
fifteen (15) day period after the Purchaser's receipt of such Objection Notice
or such longer period as the Representative and the Purchaser may have agreed
in writing, the Purchaser and the Representative shall submit such remaining
disagreements to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (" _PWC_ "), or, if the Purchaser
and the Representative cannot so agree within fifteen (15) days following a
determination that PWC is unavailable, the accounting firm mutually selected
by a panel consisting of the accounting firm that has been proposed by
Purchaser and the accounting firm that has been proposed by the Representative
(the firm to which such matters are so submitted for resolution, the "
_Accounting Firm_ ").

     

(d) The Purchaser and the Representative shall cause the Accounting Firm to
make a determination with respect to all remaining disagreements regarding the
computation of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash
and Transaction Expenses identified in the Objection Notice as soon as
practicable and in any event within thirty (30) days after its retention. The
Accounting Firm shall consider only those items and amounts in the Purchaser
and the Representative's respective calculations of Closing Net Working
Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Transaction Expenses (as set
forth on the Closing Statement or Objection Notice, as applicable) that are
identified as being items and amounts to which the Purchaser and the
Representative have been unable to agree. In resolving any disputed item, the
Accounting Firm may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest
value for such item claimed by either party or less than the smallest value
for such item claimed by either party (as set forth on the Closing Statement
or Objection Notice, as applicable). The Accounting Firm's determination of
Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and
Transaction Expenses shall be based solely on written materials submitted by
the Purchaser and the Representative ( _i.e._ , not on the basis of an
independent review) and in accordance with GAAP consistently applied and the
guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement, including the
definitions of "Net Working Capital" (including _Exhibit A_ ), "Indebtedness,"
"Cash" and "Transaction Expenses." The determination of Closing Net Working
Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Transaction Expenses by the
Accounting Firm shall be final, binding and non-appealable by the parties
hereto.

 

(e) The costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm in determining Closing Net
Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Transaction Expenses
shall be borne by the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Representative, on
the other hand, based upon the percentage that the portion of the aggregate
contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the aggregate amount
actually contested by such party. For example, if the Purchaser claims Closing
Net Working Capital is $1,000 less than the amount determined by the
Representative, and the Representative contests only $500 of the amount
claimed by the Purchaser, and if the Accounting Firm ultimately resolves the
dispute by awarding the Purchaser $300 of the $500 contested, then the costs
and expenses of the Accounting Firm will be allocated 60% ( _i.e._ , 300 ÷
500) to the Representative and 40% ( _i.e._ , 200 ÷ 500) to the Purchaser. In
connection with its determination of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Transaction Expenses, the Accounting Firm
shall, pursuant to the terms of this _Section 1.05(e)_ , also determine the
allocation of its fees and expenses between the Purchaser and the
Representative, which such determination shall be final, binding and non-
appealable by the parties hereto.

     

(f) Within five (5) Business Days after Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Transaction Expenses are finally determined
pursuant to this _Section 1.05_ :

  

(i) if (A) the result of Closing Net Working Capital, _plus_ Closing Cash,
_minus_ Closing Indebtedness, _minus_ Transaction Expenses, in each case as
finally determined pursuant to _Section 1.05(b)_ or _Section 1.05(d)_ , is
less than (B) the result of Estimated Closing Net Working Capital, _plus_
Estimated Cash, _minus_ Estimated Indebtedness, _minus_ Estimated Transaction
Expenses, then the Purchaser shall be paid an amount equal to such deficit
(the " _Purchaser Adjustment Amount_ ") out of the Escrow Amount;

  

(ii) if (A) the result of Closing Net Working Capital, _plus_ Closing Cash,
_minus_ Closing Indebtedness, _minus_ Transaction Expenses, in each case as
finally determined pursuant to _Section 1.05(b)_ or _Section 1.05(d)_ , is
greater than (B) the result of Estimated Closing Net Working Capital, _plus_
Estimated Cash, _minus_ Estimated Indebtedness, _minus_ Estimated Transaction
Expenses, then the Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Company to, pay to the
Representative, for the benefit of the Sellers, an amount equal to such excess
(the " _Seller Adjustment Amount_ "), to be further delivered by the
Representative to each Seller in accordance with its respective Allocation
Percentage; and

  

(iii) any payment to be made pursuant to this _Section 1.05(f)_ (the "
_Purchase Price Adjustments_ ") shall (y) be treated by all parties for tax
purposes as adjustments to the Transaction Price and (z) be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to, as applicable, the account(s)
designated in writing by the Purchaser prior to such payment or the account(s)
designated in writing by the Representative prior to such payment, for the
benefit of the Sellers, as applicable.

 

(g) The Purchaser agrees that the adjustments to Estimated Closing Net Working
Capital, Estimated Indebtedness, Estimated Cash and Estimated Transaction
Expenses provided for in this _Section 1.05_ , and the dispute resolution
provisions provided for in this _Section 1.05_ , shall be the exclusive
remedies for the matters addressed by this _Section 1.05_ , except as
contemplated by _Section 9.01(f)_.

 

(h) The parties agree that (i) the Representative and any of the Sellers and
their Affiliates may engage BDO USA LLP and its Affiliates to advise or
represent them in connection with the determination of any Purchase Price
Adjustment and the matters addressed by this _Section 1.05_ and (ii) the
Purchaser and its Affiliates may engage Deloitte and Touche LLP, KPMG LLP and/or
their respective Affiliates to advise or represent it in connection with the
determination of any Purchase Price Adjustment and the matters addressed by
this _Section 1.05_. Each party will enter into such waivers as BDO USA LLP,
Deloitte and Touche LLP, KPMG LLP or each of their respective Affiliates, as the
case may be, shall reasonably require to permit BDO USA LLP, Deloitte and Touche
LLP, KPMG LLP and each of their respective Affiliates, as the case may be, to
provide such advice or representation.

     

1.06 _Withholding_. Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the Transaction Price payable hereunder, or any other payment otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement, the amounts required to be deducted and
withheld under the Code, or any provision of any U.S. federal, state, local or
foreign Tax Law. Any amounts so withheld shall be paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Body. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld and
remitted to the appropriate Governmental Body, such deducted and withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Sellers. If the Purchaser determines that amounts must be withheld
pursuant to this _Section 1.06_ , the Purchaser shall notify the
Representative as soon as reasonably practicable, but no later than two days
after such determination, and the Purchaser shall allow the Representative to
provide any additional forms or other information reasonably necessary for the
Purchaser not to be required to withhold a portion of the Transaction Price.

 

1.07 _Target EBITDA_. For purposes hereof, " _Target EBITDA_ " shall be
$21,000,000. To the extent any Non-Maintenance Capital is invested during any
Performance Period, the Target EBITDA for such Performance Period shall be
adjusted upwards by an amount equal to 4% multiplied by the amount of such
Non-Maintenance Capital invested. As used herein, the term " _Non-Maintenance
Capital_ " shall mean any capital invested in the Company by Purchaser or its
Affiliates for the purpose of funding any capital expenditures by the Company
for the purpose of expanding the capacity of the Company's business as
otherwise conducted immediately prior to the date hereof; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Non-Maintenance Capital shall not include any investment made
in connection with the actual or anticipated conduct of any new line of
business by the Company (" _New Business Capital Investment_ "). In the event
the Purchaser or its Affiliates desire to invest any Non-Maintenance Capital
during any Performance Period, the Purchaser shall provide written notice
thereof to the Representative, identifying the amount and purpose of such Non-
Maintenance Capital.

 

1.08 _EBITDA Payment_.

 

(a) For the first two 12-month periods beginning from the Closing Date (the
first such 12-month period, the " _Year 1 Performance Period_ ", the second
such 12-month period, the " _Year 2 Performance Period_ ", and each, a "
_Performance Period_ "), Purchaser shall, within sixty (60) days after the end
of each Performance Period, deliver to the Representative a detailed written
statement of the Purchaser's calculation of the amount of the EBITDA for such
Performance Period (the " _Performance Period EBITDA_ ") and such documents
and work papers reasonably necessary to review the basis therefor.

     

(b) During the period following delivery of the Performance Period EBITDA
until final resolution of such Performance Period EBITDA in accordance with
this _Section 1.08_ , the Representative shall have access, during regular
business hours, to the books and records of the Company relating to the
Performance Period EBITDA calculation solely for the purpose of reviewing the
computation of the Performance Period EBITDA made by the Purchaser.

 

(c) If the Representative disagrees with all or any portion of the Performance
Period EBITDA delivered by the Purchaser, the Representative shall notify the
Purchaser of the same in writing within thirty (30) days after receipt of the
Performance Period EBITDA and any other information required to be furnished
by the Purchaser to the Representative in respect thereof. If the
Representative does not object within such thirty (30) day period, the
Purchaser's calculation of the applicable Performance Period EBITDA shall be
final and binding on the parties.

 

(d) If the Representative disagrees with all or any portion of the applicable
Performance Period EBITDA delivered by the Purchaser and provides notice of
such disagreement in accordance with _Section 1.08(c)_ above, the parties
shall negotiate in good faith to reach an agreement on the same during the
fifteen (15) day period following delivery of such notice of disagreement by
the Representative, and all such discussions related thereto shall be governed
by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence (as in effect as of the date of
this Agreement) and any applicable similar state rule, unless otherwise agreed
in writing by the Representative and the Purchaser. If the Representative and
the Purchaser are unable to reach an agreement during such fifteen (15) day
period, such disagreement and the determination of the Performance Period
EBITDA shall be submitted for determination to the Accounting Firm, whose
determination shall be final, binding and non-appealable by the parties
hereto. If such disagreement and the determination of the Performance Period
EBITDA are submitted to the Accounting Firm for resolution, then: (i) the
Representative and the Purchaser shall execute any agreement(s) reasonably
required by the Accounting Firm to accept its engagement pursuant to this
_Section 1.08(d)_ ; (ii) the Purchaser shall promptly furnish or cause to be
furnished to the Accounting Firm such work papers and other documents and
information relating to the computation of the applicable Performance Period
EBITDA as the Accounting Firm may request and are available to the Purchaser;
(iii) each party shall be afforded the opportunity to present to such
Accounting Firm, with a copy to the other party, any other written material
relating to the computation of the Performance Period EBITDA for such period;
(iv) the Accounting Firm shall not attribute a value to any disputed amount
greater than the greatest amount proposed by either party nor an amount less
than the least amount proposed by either party; and (v) the fees, costs and
expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be shared by the Representative, on the
one hand, and the Purchaser on the other, in the same manner as _Section
1.05(e)_.

 

(e) In the event that the Performance Period EBITDA in a given Performance
Period is less than the Target EBITDA, then no payment will be made by the
Purchaser to the Sellers pursuant to this _Section 1.08_. In the event that
the Performance Period EBITDA in a given Performance Period is greater than
the Target EBITDA, the Sellers shall become entitled to an earn-out payment of
$2.0 million (the " _Base Earnout Payment_ "). In the event that the
Performance Period EBITDA exceeds the Target EBITDA (i) by more than $1.0
million but less than $2.0 million, the Sellers shall become entitled to an
additional earn-out payment of $1.0 million, (ii) by more than $2.0 million
but less than $3.0 million, the Sellers shall become entitled to an additional
earn-out payment of $2.0 million, or (iii) by more than $3.0 million, the
Sellers shall become entitled to an additional earn-out payment of $3.0
million (each of the amounts specified in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above,
an " _Additional Earnout Payment_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall the aggregate amount of the Base Earnout Payment and any
Additional Earnout Payment in respect of any one Performance Period exceed
$5.0 million. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the sum of the
Performance Period EBITDA in respect of the Year 1 Performance Period and the
Performance Period EBITDA in respect of the Year 2 Performance Period exceeds
$50.0 million, then the Sellers shall become entitled to an additional special
earn-out payment of $2.0 million (the " _Special Earnout Payment_ "). The
Purchaser shall pay the Representative (for the benefit of the Sellers) by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to accounts designated by the
Representative, the amounts, if any, owed to the Sellers pursuant to this
_Section 1.08(e)_ , (i) in the case of any Base Earnout Payment or Additional
Earnout Payment, within ninety (90) days after the ending of the applicable
Performance Period (or, if later, upon resolution of any dispute relating to
the applicable Performance Period EBITDA pursuant to this _Section 1.08_ ) and
(ii) in the case of any Special Earnout Payment, within ninety (90) days after
the ending of the Year 2 Performance Period (or, if later, upon resolution of
any dispute relating to the applicable Performance Period EBITDA pursuant to
this _Section 1.08_ ).

     

1.09 _Calculation of EBITDA_. For purposes of this Agreement, " _EBITDA_ "
means, for the applicable period, net income (or loss) plus the sum of
interest expense net of interest income, federal income Tax expense, if any,
depreciation and amortization, of the Company, in each case, determined in
accordance with GAAP as consistently applied by the Company prior to the date
hereof and subject to the following:

  

(a) EBITDA shall be computed without regard to "extraordinary items" of gain
or loss as that term shall be defined by GAAP;

  

(b) EBITDA shall not include any gains, losses or profits realized from the
sale, exchange or other disposition of any assets other than in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice;

  

(c) EBITDA shall not include any earnings realized from the acquisition or
purchase of any business, division or Person;

  

(d) EBITDA shall not include any earnings realized from the acquisition or
purchase of any assets of any business, division or Person other than in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice;

  

(e) EBITDA shall not include any earnings realized or derived from any New
Business Capital Investment.

 

(f) No deduction shall be made for any general or allocated management fees,
overhead expenses, corporate charges or compensation to the management of the
Purchaser and its respective Affiliates (other than the Company);

  

(g) No deduction shall be made for (i) any expenses, losses or charges,
including any legal or accounting fees and expenses, or litigation costs,
arising out of, or incurred directly or indirectly in connection with, this
Agreement, (ii) any amount for which the Purchaser is entitled to an indemnity
hereunder or (iii) any consulting fees paid under the Bhatia Consulting
Agreement or the Cox Consulting Agreement;

      

(h) EBITDA shall be computed without taking into account any adverse effect of
any and all purchase accounting adjustments required to be recorded by the
Purchaser after the Closing in accordance with GAAP, including, without
limitation, any and all additional depreciation, amortization or other expense
resulting from the write-up of any asset and any amortization of goodwill or
other intangibles relating to the acquisition of the Company by the Purchaser;

  

(i) The intercompany sales and products of the Company, if any, to the
Purchaser or its Affiliates shall be calculated at a gross margin equal to the
gross margin obtained on sales to unrelated third parties at the lowest fees,
prices and rates charged by the Company to any of its customers for similar
volumes of goods and services of the same or comparable type and scope.

 

(j) If, after the Closing Date, the Purchaser (i) sells, leases, transfers or
otherwise disposes of assets (other than sales of assets in the ordinary
course of business) or the business (whether by merger, sale of equity
securities or otherwise) of the Company, or (ii) causes the Company to shut
down or discontinue any current line of business, then in each case the
Purchaser and the Representative shall agree on a fair and reasonable
adjustment to the calculation of the payments contemplated by _Section 1.08_
to reflect the impact of such transaction (and, if unable to agree thereon,
shall submit such matter to the Accounting Firm for resolution, as soon as
possible and, if practicable, prior to the consummation of such transaction,
on a basis consistent with the procedures set forth in _Section 1.08(d)_ ).

 

1.10 _Conduct of the Company During Performance Period_. During the
Performance Period:

  

(a) the Purchaser shall maintain separate books and records for the Company's
business sufficient for the calculation of Performance Period EBITDA;

  

(b) the Purchaser shall conduct and operate the Company's business in good
faith and shall not intentionally take any action the primary purpose of which
is to reduce the EBITDA in respect of any Performance Period; and

  

(c) the Purchaser shall not cause or permit the sale of any products or
services currently sold or provided by the Company to be diverted to, made or
provided by, the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company)
if the primary purpose of such sale is to reduce the EBITDA in respect of any
Performance Period, and in any case any sales of such products or services by
the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company) shall be
deemed to have been made by the Company for purposes of _Sections 1.08_ and
_1.09_ and any other provisions of this Agreement to the extent related to the
payments contemplated in such Sections _1.08_ and _1.09_.

the accurate preparation of financial statements in accordance with the

acknowledges that he is familiar with the Company's trade secrets and with
other Confidential Information. The Restricted Party acknowledges and agrees
that the Company would be irreparably damaged if the Restricted Party were to
provide services to or otherwise participate in the business of any Person
competing with the Company in a similar business and that any such competition
by the Restricted Party (or its Affiliates) would result in a significant loss
of goodwill by the Company. The Restricted Party further acknowledges and
agrees that the covenants and agreements set forth in this _Section 5.01_ were
a material inducement to the Purchaser to enter into this Agreement and to
perform its obligations hereunder, and that the Purchaser would not obtain the
benefit of the bargain set forth in this Agreement as specifically negotiated
by the parties hereto if the Restricted Party breached the provisions of this
_Section 5.01_. Therefore, the Restricted Party agrees, in further
consideration of the amounts to be paid hereunder for the Shares and the
goodwill of the Company sold by the Restricted Party and his Affiliates, that
until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing, the Restricted Party shall
not (and shall cause his Affiliates not to) directly or indirectly own any
interest in or otherwise provide financial assistance to, manage, control,
participate in (whether as an officer, director, employee, partner, agent,
representative or otherwise), consult with, render services for, or in any
other manner engage anywhere in the Restricted Territories (as defined below)
in any business engaged directly or indirectly in the Business; provided, that
nothing herein shall prohibit the Restricted Party or any of the Restricted
Party's Affiliates from being a passive owner of not more than 2% of the
outstanding equity securities of any class of a company or business which is
publicly traded so long as none of such Persons has any active participation
in the business of such company or business. The geographic limitation for the
obligations contemplated by this _Section 5.01(a)_ (the " _Restricted
Territories_ ") is any territory, (i) in which the Purchaser or the Company
provides its products, services, or activities on the Closing Date or (ii) in
which the Purchaser or the Company has committed plans to provide its
products, services, or activities during the twelve (12) months prior to the
Closing Date. The Restricted Party acknowledges that the geographic
restrictions set forth above are reasonable and necessary to protect the
goodwill of the Company's Business.

 

(b) _Non-Solicitation_. The Restricted Party agrees that until the fifth (5th)
anniversary of the Closing, the Restricted Party shall not (and shall cause
his Affiliates not to) directly, or indirectly through another Person, (i)
induce or attempt to induce any employee of the Company to leave the employ of
the Company, or in any way interfere with the relationship between the Company
and any employee thereof, (ii) hire any person who was an employee of the
Company at any time during the six (6) month period immediately prior to the
date on which such hiring would take place (it being conclusively presumed by
the parties so as to avoid any disputes under this _Section 5.01(b)_ that any
such hiring within such six (6)-month period is in violation of clause (i)
above), or (iii) call on, solicit or service any customer, strategic partner,
supplier, vendor, licensee, licensor or other business relation of the Company
(including any Person that was a customer, strategic partner, supplier, vendor
or other potential business relation of the Company at any time during the one
(1)-year period immediately prior to such call, solicit or service), induce or
attempt to induce such Person to cease doing business with the Company, or in
any way interfere with the relationship between any such customer, strategic
partner, supplier, vendor, licensee or business relation and the Company
(including making any negative public statements or communications about the
Company) in a manner harmful to the Company.

     

(c) _Non-Disparagement_. The Restricted Party agrees that he shall not (and
shall cause his Affiliates not to) (i) make any negative statement or
communication regarding the Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates, directors, officers or employees or (ii) make any derogatory or
disparaging statement or communication regarding the Purchaser, the Company or
any of their respective Affiliates, directors, officers or employees. Nothing
in this _Section 5.01(c)_ shall limit Restricted Party's or any of his
Affiliates' ability to make true and accurate statements or communications in
connection with any disclosure such Person reasonably believes is required
pursuant to applicable Law, in response to incorrect, disparaging or
derogatory public statements to the extent reasonably necessary to correct or
refute such public statements or in connection with any dispute, litigation or
other proceeding related to the this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

(d) _Confidentiality_. The Restricted Party agrees that he shall not (and
shall cause his Affiliates and representatives not to) disclose and to treat
and hold as confidential all proprietary and/or confidential information
(including know-how, processes, trade secrets, customer lists and other
matters that are propriety and/or confidential) of the Company, the Business
or the transactions contemplated hereby, either oral or written, as well as
any proprietary and/or confidential reports, analyses, compilations, data,
studies or other documents developed or prepared by any party which contain or
otherwise reflect or are generated from such proprietary and/or confidential
information (collectively, " _Confidential Information_ ") and, except as
otherwise expressly permitted by this Agreement, refrain from using any of the
Confidential Information (other than for the benefit of the Company and the
Purchaser as an employee thereof after the Closing Date) and, upon the request
of the Company at any time after the Closing, deliver promptly to the
Purchaser or destroy all tangible embodiments (and all copies) of the
Confidential Information which are in the Restricted Party's possession or
under the Restricted Party's control and provide confirmation thereof in
writing; provided, however, that the Restricted Party and his Affiliates and
representatives may retain copies of the Confidential Information to the
extent that such retention is required to demonstrate compliance with
applicable Law, provided such retained information shall remain subject to the
confidentiality terms of this _Section 5.01(d)_. In the event that the
Restricted Party or any of the Restricted Party's Affiliates or
representatives is requested or required by applicable Law (including, without
limitation, by oral question or request for information or documents in any
legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand, or
similar process) to disclose any Confidential Information, the Restricted
Party shall notify the Purchaser promptly of the request or requirement so
that the Purchaser may seek an appropriate protective order or waive
compliance with the provisions of this _Section 5.01(d)_. If, in the absence
of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, the Restricted
Party or any of the Restricted Party's Affiliates or representatives is
required to disclose any Confidential Information to any tribunal, the
Restricted Party may disclose the Confidential Information to the tribunal;
provided that the Restricted Party shall use his commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain, at the request and expense of the Purchaser, an order or
other assurance that confidential treatment shall be accorded to such portion
of the Confidential Information required to be disclosed as the Purchaser
shall designate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of this
Agreement, Confidential Information shall not include information which (i) is
or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a
disclosure by any Seller or any of such Seller's Affiliates or representatives
in violation of this Agreement or any other confidentiality obligation to
which any of them is bound or (ii) becomes known to the Restricted Party or
any of his representatives from a third party (excluding, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Purchaser or the Company or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives) who is not known by the Restricted Party to be bound by any
confidentiality obligation to the Purchaser with respect to such information.

     

(e) _Enforcement_. If, at the time of enforcement of the covenants contained
in this _Section 5.01_ (the " _Restrictive Covenants_ "), a court shall hold
that the duration, scope or area restrictions stated herein are unreasonable
under circumstances then existing, the parties agree that the maximum
duration, scope or area reasonable under such circumstances shall be
substituted for the stated duration, scope or area and that the court shall be
allowed and directed to revise the restrictions contained herein to cover the
maximum period, scope and area permitted by Law. The Restricted Party has
consulted with legal counsel regarding the Restrictive Covenants and based on
such consultation has determined and hereby acknowledges that the Restrictive
Covenants are reasonable in terms of duration, scope and area restrictions and
are necessary to protect the goodwill of the Company's business and the
substantial investment in the Company made by the Purchaser in this Agreement.
The Restricted Party further acknowledges and agrees that the Restrictive
Covenants are being entered into by him in connection with the sale by the
Restricted Party of the Shares and the goodwill of the Company's Business
pursuant to this Agreement and not directly or indirectly in connection with
the Restricted Party's relationship with the Company.

 

(f) If the Restricted Party breaches, or threatens to commit a breach of, any
of the Restrictive Covenants, the Purchaser and the Company shall have the
following rights and remedies, each of which rights and remedies shall be
independent of the others and severally enforceable, and each of which is in
addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies available to
the Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates at Law or in
equity: the right and remedy to have the Restrictive Covenants specifically
enforced, including through seeking a temporary restraining order and/or
preliminary or permanent injunction, by any court of competent jurisdiction,
it being agreed that any breach or threatened breach of the Restrictive
Covenants would cause irreparable injury to the Company and that money damages
would not provide an adequate remedy to the Company.

 

(g) For purposes of this _Section 5.01_ only, the term " _Business_ " shall
mean any business which would directly or indirectly compete with any part of
the business of the Company or the Purchaser or any business that the Company
is preparing to engage in.

 

5.02 _Regulatory Filings_. The Sellers and the Company shall (a) make or cause
to be made all filings and submissions under any Laws or regulations
applicable to the Company for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (b) coordinate and cooperate with the
Purchaser in exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the
Purchaser may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and (c) (i)
supply promptly any additional information and documentary material that may
be requested in connection with such filings, (ii) make any further filings
pursuant thereto that may be necessary, proper or advisable in connection
therewith and (iii) use reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary
to obtain all required clearances.

     

5.03 _Affiliate Obligations and Arrangements_. Except as set forth on
_Schedule 5.03_ , the Sellers and the Company shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, take such actions, if any, as may be necessary so
that, concurrently with or prior to the Closing, all Affiliate Agreements are
terminated and discharges without any further liability or obligation of the
Company thereunder and deemed to be void and of no further force and effect.

 

ARTICLE VI

 

COVENANTS OF THE PURCHASER

 

6.01 _Access to Books and Records_. From and after the Closing, the Purchaser
shall, and shall cause the Company to, provide the Sellers, the Representative
and their agents with reasonable access, during normal business hours, and
upon reasonable advance notice, to the books and records of the Company with
respect to periods or occurrences prior to the Closing Date and reasonable
access, during normal business hours, and upon reasonable advance notice, to
employees, officers, advisors and accountants of the Purchaser and the
Company, in each case solely for purposes of enabling the Sellers to prepare
Tax Returns or respond to Tax audits or inquiries relating to the period prior
to the Closing Date. Unless otherwise consented to in writing by the
Representative, neither the Purchaser nor the Company shall, for a period of
seven years following the Closing Date, destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of
any of the books and records of the Company for any period prior to the
Closing Date without first offering to surrender to the Representative such
books and records or any portion thereof that the Purchaser or the Company may
intend to destroy, alter or dispose of.

 

6.02 _Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification_.

 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any Person may have under any
other agreement, from the Closing Date through the sixth anniversary of the
Closing Date, the Purchaser shall continue to ensure all rights to
indemnification and exculpation (now existing) in favor of each present (as of
immediately prior to the Closing) and former officer, director, or manager of
the Company (each, an " _Indemnified Person_ "), against all claims, losses,
liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs
and expenses, including attorneys' fees and disbursements, incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining
to (i) the fact that the Indemnified Person is or was an officer, director, or
manager of the Company or (ii) matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Closing Date related to actions or omissions taken by the Indemnified
Persons in their capacities as officers, directors or managers of the Company
or taken at the request of the Company at or prior to the Closing Date
(including this Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated
hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Closing Date,
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. In the event of any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (x) each Indemnified Person
will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from the Purchaser within ten
(10) business days of receipt by the Purchaser from the Indemnified Person of
a request therefor; _provided_ that any person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by applicable Law
and by the articles of incorporation or bylaws, (or equivalent organizational
documents) of the Company, (y) neither the Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates
shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any
proceeding or threatened action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim in
which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Person hereunder,
unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional
release of such Indemnified Person from all liability arising out of such
action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim (including all attorney's
fees and expenses) or such Indemnified Person otherwise consents and (z) the
Purchaser and its Affiliates shall cooperate in the defense of such matter.

     

(b) For a period of six (6) years following the Closing Date, the Purchaser
shall not, and shall not permit the Company to, amend, repeal or modify any
provision in the Company's certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or
equivalent organizational documents) relating to the exculpation or
indemnification of, or advancement of expenses to, any Indemnified Person as
in effect immediately prior to the Closing, and shall cause all such
provisions to be observed by the Company, it being the intent of the parties
that any Indemnified Person shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law.

 

(c) At the Closing, the Company shall have purchased without lapses in
coverage, a fully pre-paid and irrevocable "tail" insurance policy (the " _D
andO Policy_") naming the Indemnified Persons as direct beneficiaries with a
claims period of at least six (6) years from the Closing Date from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's
current insurance carrier with respect to directors' liability insurance in an
amount and scope at least as favorable as the Company's existing policies with
respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing Date. The
Purchaser shall not, or shall cause the Company to not, cancel or change such
insurance policies in any respect. The Purchaser and the Sellers (as a
Transaction Expense) shall each be responsible for fifty percent (50%) of the
premium and other fees and expenses related to the DandO Policy.

 

(d) In the event that the Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person or
(ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties or assets to any
Person, then, in each case, the successors and assigns of such Persons, as the
case may be, shall expressly assume and be bound by the obligations set forth
in this _Section 6.02_.

 

(e) This _Section 6.02_ is intended to be for the benefit of each of the
Indemnified Persons and may be enforced by any such Indemnified Person as if
such Indemnified Person were a party to this Agreement. The obligations of the
Purchaser under this _Section 6.02_ shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to adversely affect any Person to whom this _Section 6.02_
applies without the consent of such affected Person.

     

6.03 _Facility Closings; Employee Layoffs_. For a period of ninety (90) days
after the Closing Date, neither the Purchaser nor the Company shall, terminate
employees of the Company, except in full compliance with all requirements of
the WARN Act. The Purchaser shall cause the Company to comply with any and all
applicable notice or filing requirements under the WARN Act, and will
indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers from any liabilities, losses, damages,
obligations, costs or expenses, arising as a result of or related to, in whole
or in part, the Purchaser's or the Company's actions or omissions occurring on
or after the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the indemnification
contemplated by this _Section 6.03_ shall not be subject to any of the
survival or other limitation or exclusive remedy provisions of _Article IX_.

 

6.04 _Transaction Expenses_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable, and in any case at or before the next
regularly scheduled payroll date of the Company, the Purchaser shall either
cause the Company to pay or pay on behalf of the Company, to the applicable
employee or service provider, all Transaction Expenses described in clause (b)
of the definition thereof in _Section 11.01_.

 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing, and in any case
within ten (10) Business Days after receiving an invoice with respect thereto,
the Purchaser shall either cause the Company to pay or pay on behalf of the
Company, to the applicable person or entity to whom such Transaction Expenses
are owed, all Transaction Expenses described in clauses (a) and (f) of the
definition thereof in _Section 11.01_ to the extent such are not paid by wire
transfer at Closing as described in _Section 1.04(d)_.

against any and all Losses to the extent arising out of:

(g) any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to any
Affiliate Agreement, excluding any contract, agreement or understanding set
forth on _Schedule 5.03_ ;

 

(h) any investigation or defense of any allegations arising from, or relating
to, a potential violation of the representations contained in _Section
2.21(a)_ and _(b)_ , regardless of whether such allegations are ultimately
determined by a Governmental Body to consist of a violation of the Anti-
Corruption Laws; or

 

(i) any Specified Losses.

 

7.03 _Limitations on Indemnification of the Purchaser_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 7.02_ , the Sellers shall have
no liability for Losses under _Section 7.02(a)_ or _Section 7.02(c)_ unless
and until such Losses are in the aggregate in excess of $500,000 (the "
_Deductible_ ") (in which event the Sellers shall have liability under and in
accordance with _Section 7.02(a)_ or _Section 7.02(c)_ only to the extent such
Losses exceed the Deductible in the aggregate); _provided_ that the foregoing
Deductible shall not apply to any Losses arising from the breach of any
Fundamental Representation or losses resulting from Fraud.

 

(b) All claims for indemnification made by or for the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties under _Section 7.02_ shall first be satisfied from the Escrow Account
pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement to the extent funds remain in
the Escrow Account to satisfy such claim. Except with respect to Losses that
are based upon, attributable to or resulting from a breach of, or inaccuracy
in, the Fundamental Representations or resulting from Fraud, (i)
notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 7.02_ , the maximum aggregate
liability of Sellers with respect to any Losses under _Section 7.02(a)_ or
_Section 7.02(c)_ shall not exceed $1,128,000 (the " _Cap_ "), other than with
respect to any Specified Losses incurred as a result of a breach of any of the
representations and warranties (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt,
Fundamental Representations) contained in _Article II_ , for which the maximum
aggregate liability of Sellers shall not exceed the Cap _plus_ $5,000,000 (the
" _Specified Loss Cap_ "), and (ii) the funds in the Escrow Account shall be
the sole source of recovery from the Sellers with respect to any of the
Sellers' indemnification obligations under _Section 7.02(a)_ , _Section
7.02(c)_ and (other than with respect to Specified Losses that are based upon
attributable to or resulting from a breach of the Fundamental Representations
or resulting from Fraud) _Section 7.02(i)_.

    

(c) The Purchaser and the Sellers each acknowledge that the Purchaser has
obtained the RandW Insurance Policy for coverage of the Sellers' indemnification
obligations pursuant to _Section 7.02(a)_ and _Section 7.02(c)_ with respect
to the representations and warranties of the Company and the Sellers contained
in this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
with respect to any and all Losses that are based upon, attributable to or
resulting from a breach of, or inaccuracy in, any of the representations or
warranties made by the Company and the Seller in this Agreement under _Section
7.02(a)_ and _Section 7.02(c)_ , the Purchaser Indemnified Parties' sole and
exclusive recourse for the Sellers' indemnification obligations under _Section
7.02(a)_ and _Section 7.02(c)_ shall be limited to the funds in the Escrow
Account (up to the Cap or the Specified Loss Cap, as applicable) and the RandW
Insurance Policy, except for Losses that are based upon, attributable to or
resulting from a breach of, or inaccuracy in, the Fundamental Representations
or resulting from Fraud; provided, that with respect to any such Losses with
respect to the Fundamental Representations, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
must use its commercially reasonable efforts to recover from the RandW Insurance
Policy with respect to such Losses prior to seeking indemnification from the
Sellers (other than with respect to the funds in the Escrow Account). For the
avoidance of doubt, (a) other than with respect to the funds remaining in the
Escrow Account, the Sellers shall have no liability with respect to claims
made hereunder pursuant to _Section 7.02(a)_ and _Section 7.02(c)_ even in the
event a claim is denied in whole or in part by the RandW Carrier, except as set
forth in this _Article VII_ with respect to Fundamental Representations or
Losses resulting from Fraud, and (b) the Sellers' liability for any claim
based on _Section 9.02_ (other than _Section 7.02(a)_ and _Section 7.02(c)_ )
shall not be limited, except as expressly set forth in this _Article VII_.

Sellers with respect to any Specified Losses shall not exceed the Specified
Loss Cap; _except_ for Specified Losses incurred as a result of a breach of
any of the representations and warranties (excluding for the avoidance of
doubt, Fundamental Representations) contained in _Article II_ , in which case
the maximum aggregate liability shall not exceed the Cap plus the Specified
Loss Cap.

 

(e) The Sellers shall reasonably cooperate with Purchaser and take any and all
actions as Purchaser may reasonably request, in each case at the Purchaser's
expense, in respect of any claims by Purchaser pursuant to the RandW Insurance
Policy.

 

(f) Without limiting the generality of the other limitations set forth in this
_Article VII_ , the maximum aggregate, cumulative liability of the Sellers in
satisfaction of claims for indemnification under _Section 7.02_ (inclusive,
for the avoidance of doubt, of all amounts paid out of the Escrow Account on
behalf of the Sellers and all amounts paid outside of the Escrow Account by
the Sellers), shall not in the aggregate on a cumulative basis exceed an
amount equal to the Transaction Price.

      

 7.04 _Indemnification of the Sellers_. Subject to the limitations set forth
herein, from and after the Closing, the Purchaser shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Sellers (and their respective stockholders, members, managers,
directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates, partners, successors and
assigns) from and against any and all Losses to the extent arising out of:

 (a) any representation or warranty of the Purchaser contained in this
Agreement or any certificate, schedule, exhibit or annex or other document
furnished by Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, provided that Purchaser
shall not be liable to any Seller for Losses with respect to any breach of any
representation or warranty of the Purchaser contained in this Agreement unless
the aggregate Losses from all such breaches exceed the Deductible, and further
provided that the Deductible shall not apply to the Purchasers
indemnification obligations with respect the Fundamental Representations or
with respect to Fraud; or

 (b) any breach of any covenant contained in this Agreement requiring
performance by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates prior to the Closing or
by the Purchaser, any of its Affiliates or the Company after the Closing.

 

 7.05 _Indemnification Procedures for Third Party Claims_.

 

 (a) In order for a party (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") to be entitled to any
indemnification under this Agreement in respect of a claim or demand made by
any Person against the Indemnified Party, other than any Tax Proceeding (a "
_Third Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party must notify (i) the Purchaser,
in the case of indemnification pursuant to _Section 7.04_ , or (ii) each
Seller from which indemnification is being sought, in the case of
indemnification pursuant to _Section 7.02_ (in each case, as applicable, the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") (with a copy, in the case of clause (ii), to the
Representative), in each case, in writing, and in reasonable detail, of the
Third Party Claim as promptly as reasonably possible after receipt; _provided_
that failure to give such notification on a timely basis shall not affect the
indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party
shall have been materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. Thereafter,
the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party (with a copy,
where the Indemnifying Party is a Seller, to the Representative), as soon as
reasonably possible after the Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of
all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified
Party relating to the Third Party Claim; _provided_ that failure to give such
notification on a timely basis shall not affect the indemnification provided
hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually
and materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.

 

 (b) If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof at its expense with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and paid for by such
Indemnifying Party if it gives notice to the Indemnified Party within ten (10)
Business Days after receipt of notice of such Third Party Claim from the
Indemnified Party of its intention to do so; _provided_ that the Indemnifying
Party shall not be entitled to assume or maintain control of the defense of
any Third Party Claim if (i) such Third Party Claim relates to or arises in
connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or
investigation or (ii) such Third Party Claim seeks an injunction, equitable
relief, or other non-monetary remedies against the Indemnified Party. If the
Indemnifying Party does not assume such defense, the Indemnifying Party shall
continue to have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ
counsel, at its own expense, separate from any counsel employed by the
Indemnified Party, it being understood that the Indemnified Party shall
control such defense. If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof
and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed
by the Indemnifying Party, it being understood, however, that the Indemnifying
Party shall control such defense, and the Indemnified Party shall not be
entitled to indemnification for legal expenses subsequently incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof; _provided_ that,
subject to the limitations in this _Article VII_ , the Indemnified Party shall
be entitled to indemnification for the fees and expenses of counsel employed
by the Indemnified Party for any period during which the Indemnifying Party
has not assumed the defense thereof or if the Indemnified Party has been
advised by its outside counsel that there may exist a conflict of interest
that would make it inappropriate for the same counsel to represent both the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party. All the parties hereto that are
party to, or an Indemnifying Party with respect to, any Third Party Claim
shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution of such Third Party Claim. Such
cooperation shall include: (x) retaining and providing to the Indemnifying
Party of records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Third
Party Claim, (y) assisting with the collection and preparation of discovery
materials, and (z) making employees and other representatives and advisors
available on a mutually convenient basis to prepare for or appear as witnesses
at depositions, court proceedings or trials and to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the defense
of any Third Party Claim if the defense and conduct of the Third Party Claim
is handled by the insurer pursuant to the RandW Insurance Policy.

   (c) Neither the Indemnifying Party nor the Indemnified Party (in either
case, the " _Settling Party_ ") shall, without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party, respectively (the " _Non-
Settling Party_ ") (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or permit a default
or consent to entry of any judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim
unless (i) the claimant and the Settling Party provide to the Non-Settling
Party an unqualified release from all liability in respect of such Third Party
Claim, (ii) such settlement or compromise does not contain any admission of
liability or wrongdoing by such Non-Settling Party and (iii) such settlement
or compromise does not impose any sanctions, restrictions or obligations
(including the payment of money damages, unless the Settling Party will be
solely responsible for all of such money damages) on the Non-Settling Party,
_provided_ , that with respect to any Third Party Claim where indemnification
is being sought under the RandW Insurance Policy, the prior written consent of
the insurer must be obtained to settle, compromise or discharge any Third
Party Claim to the extent required under the RandW Insurance Policy.

   (d) The Representative shall act on behalf of all Sellers as Indemnifying
Parties in the case of all Third Party Claims with respect to which a
Purchaser Indemnified Party is seeking indemnification pursuant to _Section
9.02_.

 

 7.06 _Indemnification Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims_. The
Indemnified Party shall deliver written notice to the Indemnifying Party
promptly upon its discovery of any matter for which the Indemnifying Party may
be liable to the Indemnified Party hereunder that does not involve a Third
Party Claim (a " _Non-Third Party Claim_ "), which written notice shall also
(a) state the factual basis for such claim, (b) to the extent known or
reasonably calculable, the Indemnified Partys good faith estimate of the
amount of its Losses and (c) to the extent known, the date such item was paid
or accrued. The Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate and assist the
Indemnifying Party in determining the validity of any claim for indemnity by
the Indemnified Party and in otherwise resolving such matters. Such assistance
and cooperation shall include retaining and providing the Representative and
its representatives reasonable access to (y) books, records and other
documents (including work papers, memoranda, financial statements, Tax
Returns, Tax schedules and work papers, Tax rulings, and other determinations,
etc.) relating to or containing information relevant to such claim in their
possession and (z) the Purchasers and the Companys employees, accountants
and other professional advisors (including making the Companys chief
financial officer, accountants and attorneys reasonably available to respond
to reasonable written or oral inquiries of the Representative and its
representatives), provided that in no event shall Purchaser be required to
provide such access in the event such access would jeopardize the availability
of attorney-client, work product or other similar privileges, violate
applicable law or breach bona fide confidentiality obligations owed to third
parties. The Representative shall act on behalf of all Sellers as Indemnifying
Parties in the case of all Non-Third Party Claims with respect to which a
Purchaser Indemnified Party is seeking indemnification pursuant to _Section
7.02(a)_ or Section _7.02(b)_. A Non-Third Party Claim includes a claim with
respect to a Tax Proceeding, which is also subject to the provisions in
Section 9.03.

 

 7.07 _Procedures for Payment of Losses_. Subject in each case to the
limitations set forth in this _Article VII_ , any amount payable to any
Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Article VII_ shall be satisfied as
follows:

 

 (a) In the case of any amount payable to a Purchaser Indemnified Party, with
respect to claims of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties related to (i) any
breach of any representation or warranty (except for Losses that are based
upon, attributable to or resulting from a breach of, or inaccuracy in the
Fundamental Representations or losses resulting from Fraud), such amount shall
be satisfied (A) first from the Escrow Account pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement and (B) then solely from the RandW Carrier pursuant to the RandW
Insurance Policy (and regardless of whether such claim is denied in whole or
in part by the RandW Carrier, the Sellers shall have no liability with respect
to such claims except as described in the foregoing clause (A)), (ii) any
breach of any Fundamental Representation, such amount shall be satisfied (A)
first from the Escrow Account pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement,
(B) next from the RandW Carrier pursuant to the RandW Insurance Policy and (C) to
the extent such claim is denied in whole or in part by the RandW Carrier despite
the use of commercially reasonable efforts by the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties to recover such amount from the RandW Insurance Policy, then such claim
shall be satisfied by the Sellers or (iii) any breach of any covenant in this
Agreement, such amount shall be satisfied (A) first by the Escrow Account
pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement and then (B) shall be satisfied
by the Sellers. Any amount payable to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties under
this _Section 7.07(a)_ shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available
funds within five (5) Business Days following such time as the amount payable
has been agreed between the parties or has been fully and finally determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction.

   (b) In the case of any amount payable to a Seller Indemnified Party, the
Purchaser shall be required to pay all of the sums so due and owing to the
Seller Indemnified Parties by wire transfer of immediately available funds
within five (5) Business Days following such time as the amount payable has
been agreed between the parties or has been fully and finally determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction.

 

 (c) The parties agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this
_Article VII_ (including any payment received by the Purchaser under the RandW
Insurance Policy) as an adjustment to the Transaction Price to the extent
permitted by Law.

 

 7.08 _Losses Net of Insurance_. The amount of any and all indemnification
payments in respect of Losses under this _Article VII_ shall be determined net
of any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under insurance
policies, indemnities or other reimbursement arrangements, except for any
amounts recovered under the RandW Insurance Policy (collectively, " _Alternative
Arrangements_ ") with respect to such Losses (which amounts the Purchaser
agrees to, and shall cause its Affiliates and representatives to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain). If an indemnification payment is
received by a Purchaser Indemnified Party, and any Purchaser Indemnified Party
or the Company later receives proceeds or recoveries from any Alternative
Arrangement in respect of the related Losses, the Purchaser shall immediately
pay to the Representative, for the benefit of the Sellers, a sum equal to the
lesser of (y) the actual amount of such proceeds or recoveries or (z) the
actual amount of the indemnification payment previously paid by the Sellers
(inclusive, for the avoidance of doubt, of both amounts paid out of the Escrow
Account and amounts paid outside of the Escrow Account) with respect to such
Losses.

 

 7.09 _Other Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Article VII_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, this _Article VII_ shall be
subject to the following limitations.

 

 (a) In no event shall any Purchaser Indemnified Party be entitled to recover
or make a claim against the Escrow Amount or any Seller, regardless of the
legal theory under which such liability or obligation may be sought to be
imposed, whether sounding in contract or tort, or whether at law or in equity,
or otherwise, for any amounts in respect of punitive damages or Consequential
Damages, except for punitive damages or Consequential Damages solely to the
extent actually paid to an unrelated third party as a result of a final non-
appealable judgment.

 

 (b) No Purchaser Indemnified Party shall have the right to recover under
_Section 7.02_ with respect to any Loss or alleged Loss to the extent such
Loss or alleged Loss served to reduce the Closing Net Working Capital or
Closing Cash or increase the Closing Indebtedness or Transaction Expenses
pursuant to _Section 1.05_.

   (c) Any Loss for which any Purchaser Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification under _Section 7.02_ shall be determined without duplication
of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such Loss
constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement.

 

 (d) No breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained herein shall give rise to any right on the part of the Purchaser,
after the Closing, to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

 7.10 _Subrogation_. In the event of payment by or on behalf of any
Indemnifying Party to any Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Article VII_ in
connection with any claim or demand by any Person other than the parties or
their respective Affiliates, such Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to
and shall stand in the place of such Indemnified Party as to any events or
circumstances in respect of which such Indemnified Party may have any right,
defense or claim relating to such claim or demand against any claimant or
plaintiff asserting such claim or demand. Such Indemnified Party shall
cooperate with such Indemnifying Party in a reasonable manner, and at the cost
of such Indemnifying Party, in presenting any subrogated right, defense or
claim and effecting any such subrogation.

 

 7.11 _Termination of Indemnification_. The rights of the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties under _Section 7.02_ in respect of a breach of
representation or warranty or covenant shall terminate when the applicable
representation or warranty or covenant terminates pursuant to _Section 7.01_ ;
provided, however, that such rights to recover shall not terminate, and shall
continue, with respect to any item as to which such Indemnified Party shall
have, prior to the expiration of the applicable period, previously made a
claim by delivering a written notice to the Indemnifying Party in accordance
with _Section 7.05_ or _Section 7.06_ , as applicable.

 

 7.12 _Exclusive Remedy_.

 

 (a) Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that from and after the
Closing, its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims
relating, directly or indirectly, to the subject matter of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, regardless of the legal theory under
which such liability or obligation may be imposed, whether sounding in
contract or tort, or whether at law or in equity, or otherwise, subject to and
without limiting the rights of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties to recover
under the RandW Insurance Policy, shall be resolved exclusively pursuant to the
provisions set forth in this _Article VII_ (subject to any claims related to
the matters described in _Section 1.05_ or _Section 9.05_ , which shall be
resolved as expressly provided therein). In furtherance of the foregoing, each
of the parties hereby waives, from and after the Closing, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes
of action such party or any of its Affiliates may have against any other party
relating (directly or indirectly) to the subject matter of this Agreement
arising under or based upon any federal, state, local or foreign statute, Law
or ordinance or otherwise, including any rights, claims or causes of action
with respect to any environmental, health or safety matters (including all
matters arising under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, or any other Environmental Laws).

   (b) The parties hereto agree that the provisions in this Agreement relating
to indemnification, and the limits imposed on remedies with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including _Section 7.02_
and this _Section 7.12_ ), constitute an integral part of the consideration
given to the Sellers, were specifically bargained for between sophisticated
parties and were specifically taken into account in the determination of the
amounts to be paid to each of the Sellers hereunder.

 

 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 7.12_ shall not limit any
partys rights under _Section 10.13_ (subject to the terms, conditions and
limitations set forth therein).

 

 7.13 _Escrow Release_. After the Closing, the Escrow Amount will be released
as follows:

 

 (a) If no indemnifiable claim for any Specified Losses made or incurred by
or asserted against the Purchaser Indemnified Parties remains then unresolved
or in dispute, a portion of the Escrow Amount equal to $5,000,000 less any
portion of the Escrow Amount previously released to any Purchaser Indemnified
Parties with respect to any Specified Losses shall be released to the
Representative, for distribution to the Sellers, on the twelve (12) month
anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Specified Loss Termination Date_ ").

 

 (b) If no indemnifiable claim for any Losses (other than Specified Losses)
made or incurred by or asserted against the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
remains then unresolved or in dispute, any portion of the Escrow Amount still
held in escrow by the Escrow Agent shall be released to the Representative for
distribution to the Sellers on the Escrow Termination Date.

 

 (c) To the extent any claim for indemnification hereunder by any Purchaser
Indemnified Party remains unresolved or in dispute on the Specified Loss
Termination Date or the Escrow Termination Date, as applicable, (i) an amount
equal to the estimated Losses with respect to such disputed or unresolved
claim shall be withheld from the release of the Escrow Amount that would
otherwise be made on such date and shall continue to be held by the Escrow
Agent in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and this _Section 7.13_ until
such claim has been resolved and (ii) an amount equal to any remaining portion
of the Escrow Amount that would otherwise be released on such date (excluding,
for the avoidance of doubt, any portion of the remaining Escrow Amount
retained pursuant to the immediately preceding clause (i)) shall be released
to the Representative for distribution to the Sellers on the Specified Loss
Termination Date or the Escrow Termination Date, as applicable.

 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS AND COVENANTS

 

 8.01 _Further Assurances_. From time to time, as and when requested by any
party hereto and at such partys expense, any other party shall execute and
deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents and
instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other
actions as such requesting party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to
evidence and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including, without limitation, whether on or after the Closing, executing and
delivering the Title Affidavits. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this _Section 8.01_ , any costs incurred by the Company
(including, without limitation, any legal fees incurred by the Company) in
connection with the execution and delivery of the Title Affidavits shall be
borne by the Company at its sole cost and expense. The Company shall pay all
costs, fees and expenses to record releases of mortgages and/or deeds of trust
which secure any Indebtedness to Compass Bank and its Affiliates.

   8.02 _Employees and Employee Benefits_.

 

 (a) _Salary and Wages_. Effective as of the Closing and continuing for one
(1) year thereafter (or if earlier, the date of the Retained Employees
termination of employment with the Company), the Purchaser shall, or shall
cause its Affiliates and the Company to, provide to all employees of the
Company immediately prior to the Closing Date, including those on layoff,
medical, disability, family or other leave of absence (provided that such
employees continue employment with the Company following such leave of
absence), paid or unpaid (the " _Retained Employees_ ") employee benefits
that, in the aggregate, are no less favorable than those provided by the
Purchaser and its Affiliates to similarly-situated employees from time to time
or those provided to the Retained Employees immediately prior to the Closing.
Without limiting the foregoing, for a period beginning on the Closing and
continuing for a one (1) year period thereafter (or if earlier, the date of
the Retained Employees termination of employment with the Company), the
Purchaser shall or shall cause its Affiliates and the Company to provide to
each Retained Employee who remains in the employment of the Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates (including the Company) with a base salary or wage rate and
annual target cash bonus opportunity at least equal to the base salary or wage
rate and annual target cash bonus opportunity in effect for such Retained
Employee immediately prior to the Closing. Nothing in this _Section 8.02(a)_
shall obligate the Purchaser or the Company to continue (and shall not prevent
the Purchaser or the Company from modifying or terminating) the employment of
any such Retained Employee.

 

 (b) _Employee Service Credit_. The Purchaser (i) shall give, or cause the
Company to give, each Retained Employee credit under any benefit plan or
personnel policies that cover the Retained Employee after the Closing Date,
including any vacation, sick leave and severance policies, for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and entitlement to vacation, sick leave and severance
benefits for the Retained Employees service with the Company and its
Affiliates prior to the Closing Date; _provided, however,_ that such service
shall not be recognized (w) to the extent that such recognition would result
in a duplication of benefits, (x) to the extent that such service was not
recognized under the corresponding Plan immediately prior to Closing, (y) to
the extent that prior service is not recognized for other employees of
Purchaser and its Affiliates or (z) for purposes of benefit accruals under any
defined benefit pension plan or retiree welfare plan or arrangement, (ii)
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to allow such Retained Employees to
participate in each plan providing welfare benefits, including medical, life
insurance, long-term disability insurance and long-term care insurance,
without regard to preexisting-condition limitations, waiting periods, evidence
of insurability or other exclusions or limitations not imposed on the Retained
Employee by the corresponding Plans immediately prior to the Closing Date, and
(iii) if any of the Welfare Plans are terminated prior to the end of the plan
year that includes the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to credit the Retained Employee with any expenses that were
covered by the Plans for purposes of determining deductibles, co-pays and
other applicable limits under any similar replacement plans.

   

 

 (c) _Vacation Pay and Personal Holidays_. The Purchaser shall cause the
Company to continue to credit to each Retained Employee all vacation and
personal holiday pay that the Retained Employee is entitled to use but has not
used as of the Closing Date, including any earned vacation or personal holiday
pay to be used in future years, and shall assume all liability for the payment
of such amounts.

 

 (d) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing set forth in this _Section 8.02_
shall (i) confer any rights or remedies upon any employee or former employee
of the Company, any Retained Employee or upon any other Person other than the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns, (ii) be construed
to establish, amend, or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement or (iii) alter or limit the Purchasers or the Companys ability
to amend, modify or terminate any specific benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement at any time.

 

 8.03 _Seller Release_. Effective upon the Closing, except for Fraud or for
those matters described on _Schedule 5.03_ , each Seller, in each case on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates and their respective successors and
assigns, hereby irrevocably waives, acquits, remises, discharges and forever
releases Purchaser, the Company, and their respective equityholders, officers,
directors, members, managers, employees, agents, representatives and
Affiliates (collectively, the " _Purchaser Released Parties_ "), from any and
all liabilities and obligations, in each case whether absolute or contingent,
liquidated or unliquidated, known or unknown, matured or unmatured or
determined or determinable, and whether arising under any Law, contract,
agreement, arrangement, commitment, undertaking or understanding, whether
written or oral (other than this Agreement and any of the other agreements
executed and delivered in connection herewith, but, in each case, only to the
extent set forth herein or therein) or otherwise at law or in equity, on or
prior to the date of this Agreement, and each of the Purchaser Releasers
hereby agrees that it shall not seek to recover any amounts in connection
therewith or thereunder from any of the Purchaser Released Parties (except as
provided for in this Agreement or any of the other agreements executed and
delivered in connection herewith, but, in each case, only to the extent set
forth herein or therein).

 

 8.04 _Certain Consents_. The Purchaser acknowledges that certain consents to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement described on _Schedule 2.05_
have not been obtained and may not be obtained. The Purchaser agrees that
neither the Company nor any of the Sellers shall have any Liability whatsoever
to the Purchaser (and the Purchaser shall not be entitled to assert any
claims) arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any such consents
that may have been or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or because of the default, acceleration or
termination of or loss of right under any such contract or other agreement as
a result thereof.

    8.05 _R andW Insurance Policy_.

  

 (a) The parties acknowledge that the Purchaser has obtained the RandW
Insurance Policy, in the amount of $16,000,000 bound as of the date hereof and
to remain in effect with respect to particular representations and warranties
for such time as such representations and warranties survive (as set forth in
the RandW Insurance Policy). Each party hereto shall: (i) use commercially
reasonable efforts to take all actions required to be taken by such party at
the Closing under the RandW Insurance Policy in order to satisfy any conditions
to the effectiveness of the RandW Insurance Policy or the coverage to be
provided thereby and (ii) execute and deliver all documents, instruments,
certificates and other writings required to be executed and delivered by such
party under the RandW Insurance Policy at the Closing in order to satisfy any
conditions to the effectiveness of the RandW Insurance Policy or the coverage to
be provided thereby. The Purchaser and the Sellers (as a Transaction Expense)
shall each be responsible for fifty percent (50%) of the premium and other
fees and expenses charged by the RandW Carrier related to the RandW Insurance
Policy.

 

 (b) The Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit any other Person insured
under the RandW Insurance Policy to, terminate, amend or alter any rights or
remedies under the RandW Insurance Policy without the prior written consent of
the Representative (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

 

 8.06 _Representation_. The parties to this Agreement each acknowledge that
Kelly Hart and Hallman LLP (" _KHH_ ") currently serves as counsel to both (i)
the Company on the one hand and/or (ii) certain of the Sellers on the other
hand, in each case including in connection with the negotiation, preparation,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. There may come a time, including
after consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, when
the interests of Sellers on the one hand, and the Company on the other hand
may no longer be aligned or when, for any reason, the Sellers, KHH or the
Company believe that KHH can no longer, or should no longer, represent both
the Sellers on the one hand, and the Company on the other hand. The parties
understand and specifically agree that KHH may withdraw from representing the
Company and continue to represent the Sellers even if the interests of the
Sellers on the one hand, and the interests of the Company on the other hand,
are or may be adverse, including in connection with any dispute arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and even though KHH may have represented the Company in a matter
substantially related to such dispute or may be handling ongoing matters for
the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, and Purchaser and the
Company hereby consent thereto and waive any conflict of interest arising
therefrom. Each of the parties further agrees that, as to all communications
among KHH, the Company and the Sellers relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the attorney-client privilege, the expectation
of client confidence and all other rights to any evidentiary privilege that
attach as a result of KHH representing the Company in connection therewith
shall survive the Closing and shall remain in effect, provided that any such
privilege, from and after the Closing, shall belong to the Sellers and shall
not pass to or be claimed by the Company or any of its Affiliates. In
furtherance of the foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees to take the
steps necessary to ensure that any privilege attaching as a result of KHH
representing the Company relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall survive the Closing, remain in effect and be controlled by the
Sellers. As to any privileged attorney-client communications between KHH on
the one hand, and any of the Company on the other hand, prior to the Closing
Date relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(collectively, the " _Privileged Communications_ "), each of Purchaser and the
Company, together with any of their respective Affiliates, successors or
assigns, agrees that no such Person may access, use or rely on any of the
Privileged Communications in any action or claim against or involving any of
the parties hereto after the Closing. In addition, if the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, the Company shall have no
right of access to or control over any of KHH's records related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which shall become the property
of (and be controlled by) the Sellers. Furthermore, in the event of a dispute
between the Sellers on the one hand, and the Company on the other hand,
arising out of or relating to any matter in which KHH acted for them both
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, none of the
attorney-client privilege, the expectation of client confidence or any other
rights to any evidentiary privilege will protect from disclosure to the
Sellers any information or documents developed or shared during the course of
KHH's representation of the Sellers on the one hand, and the Company on the
other hand, relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

      

ARTICLE IX

  

TAX MATTERS

  

9.01 _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns; Tax Refunds; Amended Tax Return;
and Certain Post-Closing Tax Benefits_.

  

(a) Except as provided in _Section 9.01(b)_ , any Tax Return of the Company to
be filed on or after the Closing Date for any Straddle Period shall be
prepared and timely filed, or caused to be prepared and timely filed, by the
Purchaser (at its sole cost). With respect to Tax Returns related to a
Straddle Period, such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with
the last previous similar Tax Return except as required by applicable law, and
shall not be filed without the prior written consent of the Representative
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The
Purchaser shall cause the Company to provide the Representative with a copy of
such proposed Tax Return (and such additional information regarding such Tax
Return as may reasonably be requested by the Representative) as soon as
reasonably practicable. The Purchaser and the Representative shall use good
faith efforts to resolve any dispute regarding the preparation of Tax Returns
on or after the Closing Date attributable to Pre-Closing Tax Periods. If the
Purchaser and the Representative are unable to resolve any dispute regarding
the preparation of such Tax Returns, they shall refer such dispute to the
Accounting Firm, whose determination shall be final and conclusive on the
parties. The costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm in determining the Tax
Return shall be borne by the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the
Representative, on the other hand, in inverse proportion to the extent such
party prevails on the Tax matter resolved by the Accounting Firm, which
proportionate allocation shall be calculated based on the relative dollar
value of the original amounts in dispute and shall be determined by the
Accounting Firm at the time the determination of such firm is rendered on the
merits of the dispute regarding the Tax Returns. Nothing herein shall prevent
the Company from filing such Tax Return on its due date during the pendency of
a dispute; _provided_ that such Tax Return shall be filed on a basis
consistent with the last previous similar return except as otherwise required
by applicable Law; _provided_ , _further_ , that such filing shall not
prejudice the rights or obligations of the parties upon resolution of the
dispute (it being understood that if the Tax Return so filed differs from such
final Tax Return reflecting resolution of the dispute, the Company will
promptly file any necessary amended or supplemental return or request for
refund). The Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company, to cooperate with
the Representative (including filing amended returns) to obtain any refunds or
credits that would result in the payment to the Representative, for the
benefit of any Seller, under this _Article IX_.

     

(b) The Representative (on behalf of the Company) shall timely file or cause
to be timely filed when due (taking into account all extensions properly
obtained) all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to
the Company for any taxable year or period ending on or prior to the Closing
Date and the Representative shall remit or cause the Sellers to remit any
Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. Such Tax Returns shall not be filed
without the prior written consent of the Purchaser (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed), and the Purchaser shall cause
the Company to do all things reasonably necessary to cause such Tax Returns to
be filed. The Sellers shall be responsible for and shall pay any and all Taxes
with respect to the Company relating to all periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date and the portion through the end of the Closing Date for any
Straddle Period, but only to the extent that such Taxes are not reflected as a
liability on the Balance Sheet or otherwise included as a liability for
purposes of adjusting the Transaction Price pursuant to _Section 1.05_.

  

(c) Any Tax refunds that are received by the Purchaser or the Company, and any
amounts credited against Tax (in lieu of receiving a refund) to which the
Purchaser or the Company become entitled, in each case, in respect of the
Company and related to any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be for the account of
the Sellers except to the extent such Tax refund or credit against Tax is
reflected in the calculation of Net Working Capital, and the Purchaser shall
promptly pay, or cause to be paid, any such refund or the amount of any such
credit by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s)
designated in writing by the Representative prior to such payment, for the
benefit of the Sellers and further distribution to each Seller in accordance
with its respective Allocation Percentage.

  

(d) Except as required by applicable Laws, the Company, as applicable, shall
not, and the Purchaser shall cause the Company not to, file an amended Tax
Return for any taxable period that begins before the Closing Date without the
prior written consent of the Representative (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  

(e) For purposes of determining the allocation of Taxes for a Straddle Period,
the Taxes which are attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending
on the Closing Date, and the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after
the Closing Date, shall be determined by assuming that the Company had a
taxable year or period which ended on the Closing Date and by determining the
portion of the Taxes for the entire period which is attributable to the
portion of the Straddle Period that is assumed to end on the Closing Date
based on interim closing of the books as of the end of the day on the Closing
Date, except that property or ad valorem Taxes shall be apportioned by
assuming that an equal portion of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period is
allocable to each day in such Straddle Period. In determining the Taxes
attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on, and the portion
of the Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date, exemptions or
allowances that are calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction for
depreciation, shall be apportioned on a time basis by assuming that an equal
portion of such exemptions or allowances for the entire Straddle Period is
allocable to each day in such Straddle Period.

     

(f) The Representative will cause any tax sharing agreement or similar
arrangement with respect to Taxes involving the Company to be terminated
effective as of the Closing Date, to the extent any such agreement or
arrangement relates to the Company, and after the Closing Date the Company
shall have no obligation under any such agreement or arrangement for any past,
present or future period.

  

9.02 _Transfer Taxes_. At the Closing or, if due thereafter, promptly when
due, all gross receipts, transfer Taxes, gains Taxes, real property transfer
Taxes, sales Taxes, use Taxes, excise Taxes, stamp Taxes, conveyance Taxes and
any other similar Taxes applicable to, arising out of or imposed upon the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_
") shall be paid 50% by Purchaser and 50% by Sellers (as a Transaction
Expense). The Purchaser shall prepare any Tax Returns with respect to such
Taxes, and the Representative shall cooperate with the Purchaser in the
preparation and filing of such Tax Returns, and, if required by applicable
law, the Representative and Sellers will, join in the execution of any such
Tax Returns and other documentation. The expense of Transfer Tax filings shall
be paid 50% by Purchaser and 50% by Sellers.

  

9.03 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_.

  

(a) The Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, and
their respective Affiliates shall cooperate in the conduct of any Tax
Proceeding, for which one party could reasonably require the assistance of
such other party in obtaining any reasonably necessary information. Such
cooperation shall include furnishing prior years' Tax Returns or return
preparation packages illustrating previous reporting practices or containing
historical information to the extent relevant to the conduct of the Tax
Proceeding, and furnishing such other information within such party's
possession requested by the other party to the extent relevant to the conduct
of the Tax Proceeding. Such cooperation and information also shall include
forwarding copies of appropriate notices and forms or other communications
received from or sent to any Governmental Body which relate to the Company and
providing copies of all relevant Tax Returns, together with accompanying
schedules and related workpapers, documents relating to rulings or other
determinations by any Governmental Body and records concerning the ownership
and tax basis of property, which the requested party may possess.

  

(b) The Representative may, in its sole discretion, control any Tax Proceeding
for which the Purchaser could be entitled to receive any payment pursuant to
_Section 7.02(a)_ , _Section 7.02(b)_ , or _Section 7.02(e)_. The Purchaser
shall control all other Tax Proceedings with respect to the Company, subject
to the provisions of this _Section 9.03(b)_. The Representative shall consult
with the Purchaser regarding any Tax Proceeding that the Representative
controls with respect to the Company, provide the Purchaser with information
and documents related thereto, permit the Purchaser or its representative to
attend any such Tax Proceeding and not settle any such issue without the
consent of the Purchaser (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). To the extent the Purchaser is controlling any Tax
Proceeding as a result of the Representative's decision not to control a Tax
Proceeding as provided in the first sentence of this _Section 9.03(b)_ , the
Purchaser shall consult with the Representative regarding any Tax Proceeding
with respect to the Company or the applicable Seller regarding any Tax
Proceeding with respect to the applicable Seller that includes any item the
adjustment of which could entitle the Purchaser to receive any payment
pursuant to _Section 7.02_ , provide the Representative or such Seller, as
applicable with information and documents related thereto, permit the
Representative or such Seller, as applicable, and its representatives to
attend any such Tax Proceeding and not settle any such issue without the
consent of the Representative or such Seller, as applicable (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed).

     

9.04 _Section 338(h)(10) Election_.

  

(a) The Sellers agree that, upon the request of the Purchaser prior to the
expiration of the time period specified by applicable Law in which to make
such election, each Seller will join the Purchaser in making a timely,
irrevocable and effective election under section 338(h)(10) of the Code and
any similar provision of state or local law (each, a " _Section 338(h)(10)
Election_ ") with respect to the Purchaser's purchase of the Company. To
facilitate such election, at the Closing, each Seller shall deliver to the
Purchaser IRS Form 8023 or successor forms and any similar forms under state
or local law (each a " _Form 8023_ ") with respect to Purchaser's purchase of
the Company, which Form 8023 shall have been duly executed by authorized
Persons on behalf of such Seller. If the Purchaser elects to make one or more
Section 338(h)(10) Elections, prior to the due date thereof, the Purchaser
shall (i) cause the applicable Form 8023 to be duly executed by an authorized
Person for the Purchaser; (ii) complete the schedules required to be attached
thereto (including providing appropriate information for each entity for which
the Purchaser elects to make a Section 338(h)(10) Election); (iii) provide a
copy of the executed Form 8023 and schedules to the Sellers; and (iv) duly and
timely file the Form 8023 as prescribed by Treasury Regulation 1.338(h)(10)-1
or applicable provision under state or local law. Purchaser, the
Representative, and Sellers shall take all necessary steps to properly make a
Section 338(h)(10) Election in accordance with applicable laws and under any
comparable provision of state, local or foreign law for which a separate
election is permissible. Purchaser, the Representative, and Sellers agree to
cooperate in good faith with each other in the preparation and timely filing
of any Tax Returns required to be filed in connection with the making of such
an election, including the exchange of information and the joint preparation
and filing of Form 8023 and related schedules.

  

(b) Sellers shall not revoke the Company's election to be taxed as an S
corporation within the meaning of Code Section 1361 and Code Section 1362 (or
under state or local law), or a subsidiary's status as a qualified subchapter
S subsidiary, and shall not take or allow any action that would result in the
termination of the Company's status as an S corporation (or any subsidiary's
status as a qualified subchapter S subsidiary).

  

9.05 _Purchase Price Allocation_. In connection with the Section 338(h)(10)
Election, the Purchaser and Sellers agree that the Transaction Price and other
amounts required to be taken into account under Section 1060 of the Code (the
" _Allocable Amount_ ") will be allocated among the Purchased Assets in a
manner consistent with Sections 338 and 1060 of the Code (the " _Allocation
Principles_ "). On or prior to the date that is 180 days after the Closing
Date, the Purchaser shall provide to the Representative the Purchaser's
proposed allocations of the Allocable Amount in accordance with the Allocation
Principles and in a manner consistent with Sections 338 and 1060 of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. Within 30 days after the date of the
delivery by the Purchaser to the Representative of the Purchaser's proposed
allocation of the Allocable Amount, the Representative shall deliver written
notice to the Purchaser (the " _Seller Allocation Notice_ ") of any proposed
changes to such allocations. Should the Representative fail to timely deliver
a Seller Allocation Notice to Purchaser, the Sellers shall be deemed to have
agreed with the Purchaser's proposed allocation of the Allocable Amount upon
the expiration of such 30 day period. Should the Representative timely deliver
a Seller Allocation Notice, the Representative and the Purchaser shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve any disputed items set forth therein and
shall reduce such agreement to writing. Should the parties fail to resolve any
disputed items within 30 days of timely delivery of a Seller Allocation
Notice, the parties shall submit the disagreement to resolution by the
Accounting Firm. Such allocation, as agreed in writing by the parties or as
determined by the Accounting Firm, shall be referred to herein as the "
_Section 338 Allocation_." The costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm in
connection with such determination shall be borne by fifty percent (50%) by
the Purchaser and fifty percent (50%) by the Representative. The Purchaser and
the Sellers shall each timely file any forms and statements required under
U.S. federal or state income Tax Laws consistent with such Section 338
Allocation. The Section 338 Allocation shall be revised to take into account
subsequent adjustments to the Transaction Price in the manner provided by
Sections 338 and 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder and
consistent with the principles described in this _Schedule 9.05_. The
Purchaser and the Sellers shall file all Tax Returns and information reports
(including Internal Revenue Service Forms 8883 and 8023, or any other forms or
reports required to be filed pursuant to Section 338 of the Code or any
comparable provisions of state or local law) in a manner consistent with the
Section 338 Allocation and shall not take any position with respect to Taxes
which is inconsistent with such Section 338 Allocation, as finally determined,
except in both cases as otherwise required by a Final Determination.

 _Notices to the Sellers_ :

  

to the address of the respective Seller set forth on _Schedule 1.04(a)_
attached hereto, with a copy to the Representative.

  

10.04 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, except that neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations hereunder may be assigned or
delegated by either the Purchaser, any of the Sellers or the Company without
the prior written consent of the Purchaser and the Representative.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, from and after the Closing, the Purchaser shall
be permitted, without the consent of the Representative and the Sellers to (a)
assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement and any of the
provisions hereof to (i) an Affiliate of the Purchaser and (ii) any purchaser
of all or substantially all of the equity or assets of the Purchaser (or other
purchaser of all or any portion of the Purchaser or its respective business)
or (b) make a collateral assignment to any lender (or an agent thereof) of the
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates for security purposes; provided that
notwithstanding any such assignment, the Purchaser will remain responsible for
all of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement.

  

10.05 _Amendment and Waiver_. Except as provided herein, any provision of this
Agreement may be amended or waived only in a writing signed by the Purchaser,
the Company and the Representative. No waiver of any provision hereunder or
any breach or default thereof shall extend to or affect in any way any other
provision or prior or subsequent breach or default.

  

10.06 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, including Section 6.02, nothing expressed or referred to in this
Agreement will be construed to give any Person other than the parties to this
Agreement any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim under or with respect
to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement; provided, however, that
(a) each Indemnified Person is an intended third party beneficiary of, and
shall have the right to enforce, the provisions set forth in _Section 6.02_ ,
(b) KHH is an intended beneficiary of, and shall have the right to enforce,
the provisions set forth in _Section 8.06_ and (c) each Non-Recourse Party is
an intended beneficiary of, and shall have the right to enforce, the
provisions set forth in _Section 10.07_.

     

10.07 _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to this
Agreement may only be brought against, the Persons that are expressly named as
parties to this Agreement. Except to the extent named as a party to this
Agreement, no Person that is not a named party to this Agreement, including
any past, present or future shareholder, member, partner, manager, director,
officer, employee, Affiliate, agent or representative of any party to this
Agreement (each, a " _Non-Recourse Party_ ") will have any liability (whether
in contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any of the representations,
warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations or liabilities of any
of the parties to this Agreement or for any claim based upon, arising out of
or related to this Agreement; provided that nothing in this _Section 10.07_
shall limit in any way any claim for Fraud.

  

10.08 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement
shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be
prohibited by or invalid under applicable Law, such provision shall be
ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without
invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of
this Agreement.

  

10.09 _Construction_. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to
be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent,
and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any Person. The
headings of the sections and paragraphs of this Agreement have been inserted
for convenience of reference only and shall in no way restrict or otherwise
modify any of the terms or provisions hereof.

  

10.10 _Disclosure Schedules_. The Disclosure Schedules have been arranged for
purposes of convenience in separately numbered sections corresponding to the
sections of this Agreement; provided, however, that each section of the
Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to incorporate by reference all
information disclosed in any other section of the Disclosure Schedules to the
extent the relevance of such information to such other section of the
Disclosure Schedules is readily apparent on the face of such disclosure.
Capitalized terms used in the Disclosure Schedules and not otherwise defined
therein have the meanings given to them in this Agreement. The specification
of any dollar amount or the inclusion of any item in the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement, the Disclosure Schedules or the
attached exhibits is not intended to imply that the amounts, or higher or
lower amounts, or the items so included, or other items, are or are not
required to be disclosed (including whether such amounts or items are required
to be disclosed as material or threatened) or are within or outside of the
ordinary course of business, and no party shall use the fact of the setting of
the amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any item in this Agreement, the
Disclosure Schedules, or exhibits in any dispute or controversy between the
parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not set forth or included
in this Agreement, the Disclosure Schedules, or exhibits is or is not required
to be disclosed (including whether the amount or items are required to be
disclosed as material or threatened) or are within or outside of the ordinary
course of business. In addition, matters reflected in the Disclosure Schedules
are not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be
reflected in the Disclosure Schedules. Such additional matters are set forth
for informational purposes only and do not necessarily include other matters
of a similar nature. No information set forth in the Disclosure Schedules
shall be deemed to broaden in any way the scope of the parties'
representations and warranties. The information contained in this Agreement,
in the Disclosure Schedules, and exhibits hereto is disclosed solely for
purposes of this Agreement, and no information contained herein or therein
shall be deemed to be an admission by any party hereto to any third party of
any matter whatsoever, including any violation of Law or breach of contract.

     

10.11 _Complete Agreement_. This Agreement (including all Disclosure
Schedules, Annexes and Exhibits hereto) contains the entire agreement of the
parties respecting the sale and purchase of the Company and supersedes all
prior agreements among the parties respecting the sale and purchase of the
Company. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises with respect to this Agreement, the terms and provisions of the
execution version of this Agreement shall control and prior drafts of this
Agreement and the documents referenced herein shall not be considered or
analyzed for any purpose (including in support of parol evidence proffered by
any Person in connection with this Agreement), shall be deemed not to provide
any evidence as to the meaning of the provisions hereof or the intent of the
parties with respect hereto and shall be deemed joint work product of the
parties. The sole and exclusive remedies for any breach of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, including any representations and warranties set
forth herein or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or as an
inducement to enter into this Agreement, or any claim or cause of action
otherwise arising out of or related to the sale and purchase of the Company
will be those remedies available at law or in equity for breach of contract
only as such contractual remedies have been further limited or excluded
pursuant to the express terms of this Agreement; and the parties hereby agree
that neither party hereto will have any remedies or cause of action (whether
in contract or in tort, at law or equity) for any statements, communications,
disclosures, failures to disclose, representations or warranties not set forth
in this Agreement.

  

10.12 _Conflict Between Transaction Documents_. The parties hereto agree and
acknowledge that to the extent any terms and provisions of this Agreement are
in any way inconsistent with or in conflict with any term, condition or
provision of any other agreement, document or instrument contemplated by this
Agreement, this Agreement shall govern and control.

  

10.13 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement is not performed
in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached, including if
the parties hereto fail to take any action required of them hereunder to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. It is accordingly
agreed that (a) the parties hereto shall be entitled to seek an injunction or
injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in the courts described in _Section 10.14_ without proof of
damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled under this Agreement and (b) the right of specific performance
and other equitable relief is an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, neither the Company nor
the Purchaser would have entered into this Agreement. The parties hereto agree
not to assert that a remedy of specific performance or other equitable relief
is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, and
not to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate
remedy or that the parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at law. The
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this _Section
10.13_ shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, in no event shall this _Section 10.13_ be used, alone or
together with any other provision of this Agreement, to require the Company to
remedy (or to require Sellers to cause the Company to remedy) any breach of
any representation or warranty of the Company made herein.

     

10.14 _Jurisdiction and Exclusive Venue_. EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY
AGREES THAT ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT BROUGHT BY ANY OTHER PARTY OR ITS SUCCESSORS OR ASSIGNS SHALL BE
BROUGHT AND DETERMINED ONLY IN ANY FEDERAL OR STATE COURT LOCATED IN NEW YORK
COUNTY, NEW YORK, AND EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE
EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE AFORESAID COURTS FOR ITSELF AND WITH RESPECT TO
ITS PROPERTY, GENERALLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY, WITH REGARD TO ANY SUCH ACTION OR
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH OF THE PARTIES AGREES NOT TO COMMENCE ANY ACTION,
SUIT OR PROCEEDING RELATING THERETO EXCEPT IN THE COURTS DESCRIBED ABOVE IN
NEW YORK, OTHER THAN ACTIONS IN ANY COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION TO ENFORCE
ANY JUDGMENT, DECREE OR AWARD RENDERED BY ANY SUCH COURT IN NEW YORK AS
DESCRIBED HEREIN, AND NO PARTY WILL FILE A MOTION TO DISMISS OR TRANSFER ANY
ACTION FILED IN A STATE OR FEDERAL COURT IN NEW YORK, ON ANY JURISDICTIONAL OR
VENUE-RELATED GROUNDS, INCLUDING THE DOCTRINE OF FORUM NON-CONVENIENS OR
PURSUANT TO 28 U.S.C. §§ 1404 OR 1407.

  

10.15 _Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

  

(a) This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract or
tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any claim
or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to any representation
or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement) will be governed by
and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York,
including its statutes of limitations, without regard to conflicts of law
principles of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction that would cause
the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York to apply.

  

(b) EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, THE DOCUMENTS AND AGREEMENTS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY
AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND THEREBY IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND THEREFORE HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT, ANY DOCUMENT OR AGREEMENT CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND THEREBY, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT
OR ANY OTHER THEORY. EACH PARTY HERETO (I) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (II) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES
HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 10.15_.

      

10.16 _Representative_.

 

(a) Each Seller hereby constitutes and appoints the Representative as his or
its agent to act for and on behalf of each such Seller in all matters relating
to or arising out of this Agreement. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this _Section 10.16_ , the Purchaser hereby acknowledges that the
Representative shall serve as the sole representative of the Sellers, from and
after the date hereof, with respect to the matters set forth in this Agreement
and any other document or agreement contemplated hereby or thereby, such
service to be without compensation except for the reimbursement of out of
pocket expenses and indemnification specifically provided herein. The
Representative has accepted such designation as of the date hereof. The
relationship created herein is not to be construed as a joint venture or any
form of partnership between or among the Representative or any other Seller or
the Purchaser for any purpose of U.S. federal or state law, including federal
or state income Tax purposes.

 

(b) Effective as of the date hereof, the Representative shall be the agent,
proxy and attorney-in-fact for each Seller for all purposes of this Agreement,
including full power and authority: (i) to take all actions that the
Representative considers necessary or desirable in connection with the
defense, pursuit, negotiation or settlement of any determinations relating to
the payment or determination of the Purchaser Adjustment Amount or the Seller
Adjustment Amount and to sue, defend, negotiate, settle and compromise any
claims made by or against, and other disputes with, the Purchaser or any other
Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to this Agreement or any of the
agreements, instruments, documents or transactions contemplated hereby or
executed in connection herewith, (ii) to engage and employ agents and
representatives (including accountants, legal counsel and other professionals)
and to incur such other expenses as he shall deem necessary or prudent in
connection with the administration of the foregoing, (iii) to provide for all
expenses incurred in connection with the administration of the foregoing, (iv)
to disburse, or cause to be disbursed, to the Sellers any funds received
(including by the Representative) on behalf of the Sellers under this
Agreement, (v) to pay amounts pursuant to _Section 10.16(f)_ , (vi) to take
all other actions and exercise all other rights which the Representative in
his sole discretion considers necessary or appropriate in connection with this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, including execution and delivery of the
Escrow Agreement, and any amendment or waiver to this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement, and the other agreements, instruments and documents contemplated
hereby or executed in connection herewith. All decisions and acts by the
Representative shall be binding upon all Sellers, and no Seller shall have the
right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same.

     

(c) In the event that any Person authorized hereunder as part of the
Representative shall die, become incapacitated, resign or otherwise fail to
act on behalf of the Sellers for any reason, the Representative shall include
such other Person as shall be acceptable to the continuing representative, and
such substituted representative, together with the continuing representative,
together shall be deemed to be the Representative for all purposes of this
Agreement.

 

(d) The Representative is authorized to act on behalf of the Sellers
notwithstanding any dispute or disagreement among the Sellers, and the other
parties hereto shall be entitled to rely on any and all action taken by the
Representative without any liability to, or obligation to inquire of, any
Seller even if such party shall be aware of any actual or potential dispute or
disagreement among the Sellers. Each of the other parties hereto is expressly
authorized to rely on the genuineness of the signature of the Representative
and, upon receipt of any writing which reasonably appears to have been signed
by the Representative, the other parties hereto may act upon the same without
any further duty of inquiry as to the genuineness of the writing.

 

(e) Neither the Representative nor any of his agents or other representatives
or Affiliates shall incur any liability to any Seller by virtue of the failure
or refusal of such Persons for any reason to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or relating to the performance of their duties
hereunder. Neither the Representative nor any of his agents or other
representatives or Affiliates shall be liable to any Seller relating to the
performance of his duties under this Agreement for any errors in judgment,
negligence, oversight, breach of duty or otherwise, regardless of the legal
theory under which such liability or obligation may be sought to be imposed,
whether sounding in contract or tort, or whether at law or in equity, or
otherwise, except to the extent it is finally determined in a court of
competent jurisdiction by clear and convincing evidence that the actions taken
or not taken by the Representative constituted gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Representative and his agents and other representatives and
Affiliates shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Sellers against all
Losses paid or incurred in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or
claim to which any of such Persons is made a party by reason of the fact that
he was acting as the Representative pursuant to this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Representative shall not be entitled to indemnification
hereunder to the extent he is finally determined in a court of competent
jurisdiction by clear and convincing evidence that the actions taken or not
taken by the Representative constituted gross negligence or willful
misconduct. For the avoidance of doubt, the indemnification contemplated by
this _Section 10.16(e)_ shall not be subject to any of the survival or other
limitation or exclusive remedy provisions of _Article VII_.

 

(f) Any amount owing to the Representative from any Seller pursuant to this
_Section 10.16_ shall be deductible at the option of the Representative from
