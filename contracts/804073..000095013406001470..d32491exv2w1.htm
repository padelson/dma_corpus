 _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_  

   

 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (hereinafter called this " _ _Agreement__ "), dated as of January 29, 2006, among LOWRANCE ELECTRONICS, INC., a corporation incorporated in the State of Delaware (the " _ _Company__ "), SIMRAD YACHTING AS, a stock corporation incorporated under the laws of Norway (" _ _Parent__ "), and NAVICO ACQUISITION CORP., a corporation incorporated in the State of Delaware and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _ _Merger Sub__ ," the Company and Merger Sub being hereinafter sometimes collectively referred to as the " _ _Constituent Corporations__ "). 

  

RECITALS 

   

 WHEREAS, the board of directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have adopted resolutions approving and declaring advisable this Agreement, the transaction contemplated hereby and the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, in each case upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; 

  

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a condition and inducement to Parents and Merger Subs willingness to enter into this Agreement, each of Darrell J. Lowrance and Ronald G. Weber are entering into a Tender Agreement with Merger Sub in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit 2_ (collectively, the " _ _Tender Agreements__ "); and 

  

 WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this Agreement. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the Top-Up Option Agreement and the Tender Agreements, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 

   

 _The Offer and Merger_  

   

 1.1. _The Offer_. (a) As long as (i) this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with its terms and (ii) none of the events or conditions described in _Exhibit 1_ shall exist or shall have occurred and be continuing, Merger Sub shall, as promptly as practicable and in no event later than ten (10) business days after the 

   ##### 

  

 

date hereof, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _ _Exchange Act__ ")) a tender offer
to purchase all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.10
per share (the " _ _Common Stock__ "), of the Company (the " _ _Shares__ ")
at a price of $37.00 per Share in cash, net to the seller but subject to
any required withholding of Taxes, subject to the conditions set forth in
_Exhibit 1_ and the requirements of this Agreement (such tender offer and
price as they may from time to time be amended in accordance with this
Agreement, the " _ _Offer__ " and the " _ _Offer Price__ ", respectively).
Subject to Merger Subs right to extend the Offer as permitted by this
Agreement, the Offer shall initially expire at midnight (New York City time)
on the date which is 20 business days after the date on which the Offer was
commenced (determined as provided in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange
Act). If any of the conditions set forth in _Exhibit 1_ are not satisfied or
waived by Merger Sub as of any then scheduled expiration time for the Offer,
then Merger Sub may, from time to time in its sole discretion, extend the
expiration time for the Offer in maximum increments of 10 business days to no
later than June 30, 2006 (the " _ _Outside Date__ ");  _provided, however,_
that notwithstanding the foregoing (i) Merger Sub may extend the Offer for
any period required by any applicable Law (as defined in Section 5.1(i)) and
(ii) after acceptance for payment of Shares for a further period of time not
to exceed twenty (20) business days by means of a subsequent offering period
under Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act. Merger Sub expressly reserves the
right to amend or modify the terms and conditions of the Offer in its sole
discretion;  _provided, however,_ that notwithstanding the foregoing Merger
Sub may not waive the Minimum Condition, impose any conditions other than
those set forth in _Exhibit 1_, modify the conditions on _Exhibit 1_ (other
than to waive any conditions on _Exhibit 1_ to the extent permitted by this
Agreement), decrease the Offer Price below $37.00 per Share, change the form
of consideration payable in the Offer, reduce the number of Shares sought in
the Offer, extend the Offer other than as permitted by the immediately
preceding sentence or amend any terms of the Offer in a manner adverse to the
holders of Shares, in each case without the prior written consent of the
Company. On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer and this
Agreement, Merger Sub shall pay for all Shares validly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase
pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable after the expiration of the
Offer. Merger Sub may, at any time, transfer or assign to one or more
Subsidiaries of Parent the right to purchase all or any portion of the Shares
tendered pursuant to the Offer, but any such transfer or assignment shall not
relieve Merger Sub of its obligations under this Agreement or the Offer.
Whenever this Agreement requires Merger Sub to take any action,
such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of
Parent that it will cause Merger Sub to take such action. 

   

 For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _ _business day__ " shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act. 

  

 (b) On the date of commencement, Parent and Merger Sub shall file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (" _ _SEC__ "), pursuant to and in accordance with Rule 14d-3 and Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act (" _ _Regulation M-A__"), a 

   ##### 

  

 

Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer, which shall
contain an offer to purchase and a related letter of transmittal and summary
advertisement (such Schedule TO and the documents included therein pursuant
to which the Offer will be made, together with any supplements or amendments
thereto, the " _ _Offer Documents__ ") and to cause the Offer Documents to
be disseminated to holders of Shares as and to the extent required by the
applicable federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder (collectively, the " _ _Securities Laws__ "). The Offer Documents
shall comply in all material respects with the Securities Laws. Each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees to use all reasonable efforts to
respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Offer Documents or the Offer and to promptly correct any information provided
by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such
information shall become false or misleading in any material respect or as
otherwise required by the Securities Laws. Parent and Merger Sub shall take
all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Offer Documents and to cause
the Offer Documents, as so amended or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC
and to be disseminated to the holders of Shares, in each case as and to the
extent required by Securities Laws. The Company and its counsel shall be
given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents
(including any amendments or supplements thereto) before they are filed with
the SEC or disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. Parent and Merger
Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel with copies of any
written comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that Parent,
Merger Sub or their counsel receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments and shall
give the Company a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
any written or oral responses to such comments. The Company hereby consents
to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the recommendations of the board
of directors of the Company (the " _ _Company Board__ ") described in Section
5.1(c) as such recommendation may be amended and until such recommendation
may be withdrawn, in each case as permitted by this Agreement. 

   

 1.2. _Company Actions_. (a) On the date the Offer Documents are first filed with the SEC, the Company shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer containing the recommendations described in Section 5.1(c) (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _ _Schedule 14D-9__") and shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to the holders of Shares with the Offer Documents, in each case in a manner that complies with Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act and the Securities Laws. The Schedule 14D-9 will comply as to form in all material respects with the Securities Laws. The Company shall deliver copies of the proposed form of the Schedule 14D-9 to Parent within a reasonable time prior to the filing thereof with the SEC for review and comment by Parent and its counsel. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use all reasonable efforts to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise 

   ##### 

  

 

required by the Securities Laws. The Company shall take all steps necessary to
amend or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so
amended or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to
the holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the
Securities Laws. The Company shall provide Parent and its counsel with copies
of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that the
Company or its counsel receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments and shall give
Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any written or oral
responses to such comments. The Company agrees to use all reasonable efforts
to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Schedule 14D-9. 

   

 (b) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly furnish or cause to be furnished to Merger Sub (i) a list of the names and addresses of the record holders of Shares as of the most recent practicable date, as well as mailing labels containing such names and addresses and (ii) security position lists, computer files and any other information identifying the beneficial owners of Shares as of the most recent practicable date which the Company or the transfer agent have in their possession or control or can obtain without unreasonable effort or expense. The Company will furnish or cause to be furnished to Merger Sub such additional information (including updates of the items provided pursuant to the preceding sentence) and such other assistance as Parent may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial owners of Shares. Subject to the requirements of applicable law, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Merger, Parent and Merger Sub and their agents shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and files, will use such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, will, upon request, deliver, and will use their reasonable best efforts to cause their agents to deliver, to the Company all copies of such information then in their possession or control. 

  

 1.3. _Company Directors_. (a) Promptly upon the purchase of, and payment for, any Shares by Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer which represent at least a majority of the Shares outstanding (determined on a fully diluted basis) and at all times thereafter, Merger Sub shall be entitled to elect or designate to the Company Board such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, as is equal to the product of the total number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to the directors elected or designated by Merger Sub pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the percentage of the outstanding Shares (determined on a fully diluted basis) that are then beneficially owned by Merger Sub and its affiliates. As used in this Agreement, the terms " _ _beneficial ownership__ " (and its correlative terms) and " _ _affiliate__ " shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in Rule 13d-3 and Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, respectively. Upon any exercise of such right by Merger Sub, the Company shall use its best efforts to take all such actions as are necessary to (i) elect or designate to the Company Board the individuals designated by Merger Sub and permitted to be so elected or designated by the 

   ##### 

  

 

preceding sentence, including but not limited to promptly filling vacancies or
newly created directorships on the Company Board, increasing the size of the
Company Board (including by amending the Bylaws of the Company if necessary
so as to increase the size of the Company Board) and/or securing the
resignations of such number of its incumbent directors, and (ii) cause the
directors so elected or designated to constitute the same percentage (rounded
up to the next whole number) of the members of each committee of the Company
Board as such directors represent of the Company Board, in each case to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law and the rules of the
Nasdaq National Market (" _ _Nasdaq__ "). The Companys obligations under
this Section 1.3(a) shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly upon execution
of this Agreement take all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) and
Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3(a),
including mailing to shareholders (together with the Schedule 14D-9) the
information required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as is necessary to
enable Merger Subs designees to be elected or designated to the
Company Board. Merger Sub shall supply the Company with, and be solely
responsible for, information with respect to Merger Subs designees and
Parents and Merger Subs respective officers, directors and affiliates to
the extent required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1. The provisions of this
Section 1.3(a) are in addition to and shall not limit any rights that any of
Merger Sub, Parent or any of their respective affiliates may have as a holder
or beneficial owner of Shares as a matter of applicable law with respect to
the election of directors or otherwise. 

   

 (b) In the event that Merger Subs designees are elected or designated to the Company Board pursuant to Section 1.3(a), then, until the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause (i) the members of the Company Board on the date of this Agreement (the " _ _Existing Directors__ ") to remain as directors on the Company Board, (ii) the Existing Directors (other than the chief executive officer of the Company) to remain as members of the audit committee of the Company Board and (iii) such audit committee to comply with all requirements of the Securities Laws and Nasdaq applicable thereto (collectively, the " _ _Audit Committee Requirements__ "). If any Existing Director is unable to serve due to death, disability or resignation, the remaining Existing Director(s) (or, if none of the Existing Directors are then in office, the members of the Company Board) shall be entitled to elect or designate another Person (or Persons) who will satisfy the Audit Committee Requirements to fill such vacancy and each such Person shall be deemed to be an Existing Director for purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to the Effective Time when Merger Subs designees constitute a majority of the Company Board, Merger Sub shall cause such designees not to approve any amendment or termination by the Company of, or any waiver by the Company of, any of its rights under, this Agreement that would materially and adversely affect the holders of Shares (other than Parent and Merger Sub) or extend the time for performance of Parents or Merger Subs obligations under this Agreement, unless such action is approved by a majority of the Existing Directors. 

   ##### 

  

  

 1.4. _The Top-Up Option_. (a) The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the " _ _Top-Up Option__ ") to purchase that number of shares of Common Stock (the " _ _Top-Up Option Shares__ ") equal to the lowest number of shares of Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of Common Stock owned by Parent and Merger Sub at the time of such exercise, shall constitute one share more than ninety percent (90%) of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock (determined on a fully diluted basis and assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares), at a price per share equal to the Offer Price. 

  

 (b) The Top-Up Option shall only be exercisable once in whole and not in part within ten (10) business days after the date on which Merger Sub accepts for payment and pays for Shares pursuant to the Offer (the " _ _Purchase Date__ "); _provided, however,_ that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable and shall terminate on the Purchase Date if (i) the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares would require shareholder approval under the rules of Nasdaq or (ii) the number of Top-Up Option Shares would exceed the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock; and, _provided, further,_ that the Top-Up Option shall terminate concurrently with the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. While the Top-Up Option is outstanding, the Company will not issue or reserve for issuance any shares of Common Stock or any securities or other rights convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, any shares of Common Stock. 

  

 (c) In the event Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub shall so notify the Company in writing, and shall set forth in such notice (i) the number of shares of Common Stock that will be owned by Parent and Merger Sub immediately preceding the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares and (ii) the place and time for the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares (the " _ _Top-Up Closing__ "). The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice, notify Parent and Merger Sub in writing of the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding and the number of Top-Up Option Shares. At the Top-Up Closing, Merger Sub shall pay the Company the aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Option Shares and the Company shall cause to be issued to Merger Sub a certificate representing the Top-Up Option Shares. 

  

 1.5. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.7), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the " _ _Surviving Corporation__ ") and the separate corporate existence of the Company, with all its rights, privileges, powers and franchises, shall continue unaffected by the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects specified in the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended (the " _ _DGCL__ "). 

  

 1.6. _Closing_. Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Company and Parent, the closing for the Merger (the " _ _Closing__ ") shall take place at the offices of 

   ##### 

  

 

Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 125 Broad Street, New York, New York, at 9:00 A.M. on
the first business day (the " _ _Closing Date__ ") following the first day on
which all of the conditions set forth in Article VII are satisfied or waived
in accordance with this Agreement (other than any such conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions). 

   

 1.7. _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable following the Closing, Parent and the Company will cause a Certificate of Merger (the " _ _Certificate of Merger__ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided in Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time when the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as may be agreed by the parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the " _ _Effective Time__ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Parent and Merger Sub own at least 90% of the outstanding Common Stock after consummation of the Offer and, if applicable, exercise of the Top-Up Option, then the parties agree to effect the Merger without a meeting of shareholders of the Company pursuant to Section 253 of the DGCL.

 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock;_ 
  _Exchange of Certificates_  

   

 4.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of any capital stock of the Company: 

  

 (a) _Merger Consideration_. Each Share issued and outstanding at the Effective Time, other than Excluded Shares (as defined below), shall be converted into, and become exchangeable for, the right to receive, without interest, an amount in cash equal to the Offer Price (the " _ _Merger Consideration__ "). At the Effective Time, all Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall no longer be outstanding and shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate representing any of such Shares (each, a " _ _Certificate__ ") shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration for such Shares upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section 4.2. 

  

 As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below: 

  

 " _ _Excluded Shares__ " means any (i) Shares owned by (a) Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (collectively, the " _ _Parent Companies__ ") or (b) the Company or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company and, in each case described in clause (a) or (b), not held on behalf of third parties or (ii) Shares as to which the record holder thereof has exercised appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (" _ _Dissenting Shares__ " and " _ _Dissenting Stockholders__ ", respectively). 

   ##### 

  

  

 " _ _Subsidiary__ " means, with respect to any Person, any entity (whether or not incorporated) of which such Person, any of its other Subsidiaries or any combination of any of the foregoing (i) owns or controls, directly or indirectly, at least a majority of the capital stock or other ownership interests that by their terms have the voting power to elect a majority of the board of directors of such entity (or, if such entity is not a corporation, of the other Persons who perform a similar function for such entity) or (ii) otherwise is entitled to elect or appoint a majority of such board of directors (or, if such entity is not a corporation, such other Persons). 

  

 " _ _Person__ " means any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 5.1(d)) or other entity of any kind or nature. 

  

 (b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share issued or outstanding as of the Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist without payment of any consideration therefor (except to the extent that such cancellation of any Excluded Shares held by Parent, the Company or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries would result in U.S. federal income tax to Parent, the Company or any of such Subsidiaries, in which case such Excluded Shares shall not be considered "Excluded Shares" for any purpose under this Agreement). 

  

 (c) _Treatment of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, no par value , of Merger Sub issued and outstanding at the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and each certificate which previously represented any shares of common stock of Merger Sub shall thereafter be deemed to represent the same number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 4.2. _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company to act as agent for the holders of Shares in connection with the Merger (the " _ _Paying Agent__ ") and to receive the funds to which holders of Shares shall become entitled pursuant to Section 4.1. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent sufficient cash to satisfy the aggregate amounts due under this Agreement in respect of the Shares converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 4.1(a) (the " _ _Exchange Funds__ "). 

  

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate whose Shares were converted pursuant to Section 4.1 into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form 

   ##### 

  

 

and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for
payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the
Paying Agent with a duly executed copy of such letter of transmittal and
compliance with all such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each
Share formerly represented by such Certificate, without interest thereon, and
the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of
the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition precedent of payment that (x) the Certificate so surrendered shall
be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and
(y) the Person requesting such payment shall have established to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that all transfer and other
taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered have
been paid or are not required to be paid. Until surrendered as contemplated
by this Section 4.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
in cash as contemplated by this Section 4.2. No interest will accrue or be
paid in respect of the Merger Consideration payable upon surrender of a
Certificate or otherwise. 

   

 (c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. At any time following six (6) months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of Certificates pursuant to Section 4.2(b) (or for which such disbursement is pending subject only to the Paying Agents routine administrative procedures) and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration upon due surrender of their Certificates, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. 

  

 (e) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent or the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as it is required to 

   ##### 

  

 

deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the " _ _Code__ "), or any provision of state, local
or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld
by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such deducted and
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holders of Shares in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made. 

   

 (g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will pay the Merger Consideration in respect of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate. 

  

 4.3. _Dissenters  Rights_. No Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to any Merger Consideration in respect of the Dissenting Shares owned by such Dissenting Stockholder unless and until the holder thereof shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such holders right to dissent from the Merger under the DGCL and unless and until any such failure, withdrawal or loss occurs such Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such Dissenting Shares. If any Person who otherwise would be deemed a Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to properly perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to dissent with respect to any Dissenting Shares, such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be treated as though such Shares had been converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 4.1 hereof. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law received by the Company relating to stockholders rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demand for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisals of Dissenting Shares, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands. 

  

ARTICLE V 

   

 _Representations and Warranties_  

   

 5.1. _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except as set forth in the disclosure letter (subject to Section 9.12(c) of this Agreement) delivered to 

   ##### 

  

 

Parent by the Company prior to entering into this Agreement (the " _ _Company
Disclosure Letter__ "), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent
and Merger Sub that: 

   

 (a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation or other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation or other legal entity in each jurisdiction where such ownership, operation or conduct requires such qualification, except where all such failures to be so organized, qualified or in good standing or to have such power or authority, taken together, would not reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). The Company has made available to Parent a complete and correct copy of the certificate of incorporation and by-laws (or other comparable governing instruments) of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, each as amended to the date of this Agreement, and each certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or other comparable governing instruments) so delivered is in full force and effect. The Company is in compliance with the terms of its certificate of incorporation as amended and restated through the date of this Agreement (the " _ _Company Certificate__ ") and its bylaws as amended through the date of this Agreement (the " _ _Bylaws__ " and, collectively with the Company Certificate, the " _ _Company Governing Documents__ "). 

  

 As used in this Agreement, the term " _ _Company Material Adverse Effect__ " means (i) a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, cash flow, assets, liabilities, business or prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and (ii) any effect that would prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of the Company to consummate, or Parent to receive the benefits of, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided, however,_ that any such effect resulting from (x) any action for which the Company requires and requests Parents consent under Section 6.1 and such consent is not granted, (y) conditions (including changes in economic, financial market, regulatory or political conditions) that generally affect the participants in the industries in which the Company participates except to the extent that they negatively affect the Company disproportionately compared such other participants, or (z) any disruption of employee, customer, supplier or other similar relationships or other events or circumstances primarily resulting from or which are primarily attributable to the execution or announcement of the merger agreement and the identity of the Parent, shall not be considered a Company Material Adverse Effect for purposes of this Agreement. 

  

 (b) _Capital Structure_. The authorized capital stock of the Company consists solely of 10,000,000 shares of Common Stock, of which 5,135,516 shares were issued and outstanding as of the close of business on January 27, 2006. Since such date, the Company has not issued any shares of Common Stock. All of the outstanding shares of Common Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and 

   ##### 

  

 

nonassessable. The Company has no shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance
other than 50,000 Shares reserved for issuance pursuant to the Companys
Amended and Restated 2001 Stock Option Plan (the " _ _Stock Plan__ "). There
are no options to purchase Common Stock or other awards granted under the
Stock Plan or rights outstanding in respect of securities of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries under any other Company Benefit Plan (collectively, "
_ _Company Options and Awards__ "). Each of the outstanding shares of capital
stock or other securities of each of the Companys Subsidiaries is duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and owned by the
Company or by a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company,
free and clear of any lien, pledge, security interest, claim or other
encumbrance (collectively, " _ _Liens__ "). Except for the Top-Up Options,
there are no preemptive or other options, warrants, rights, conversion
rights, convertible or exchangeable securities, "phantom" stock rights, stock
appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights, calls, stock-
based performance units, commitments, Contracts, arrangements or undertakings
of any kind to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by
which any of them is bound (i) obligating the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered
or sold, shares of capital stock or other equity interests in, or any
security convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, any capital
stock of or other equity interest in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or any Voting Debt, (ii) obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
issue, grant, extend or enter into any such option, warrant, call, right,
security, commitment, Contract, arrangement or undertaking or (iii) that give
any Person the right to receive any economic benefit or right similar to or
derived from the economic benefits and rights occurring to holders of shares
of capital stock of or other equity interests in, or any security
convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, any capital stock of or
other equity interest in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
Voting Debt, and no such obligations, instruments or securities are
authorized, issued or outstanding. There are no voting trusts or other
arrangements or understandings to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting of any capital stock of or
other equity interest in the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company
does not have outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations
the holders of which have the right to vote (or are convertible into or
exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with the stockholders of
the Company on any matter (" _ _Voting Debt__ "). The Company does not own,
directly or indirectly, any voting interest that may require a filing
by Parent or any of its affiliates under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _ _HSR Act__ "). Exhibit 21 to
the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31,
2005, includes all of the Subsidiaries of the Company that, as of the date of
this Agreement are "Significant Subsidiaries" (as defined in Rule 1-02 of
Regulation S-X of the SEC). 

   

 (c) _Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness_. (i) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority and has taken all corporate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions, in each case subject only to adoption of this 

   ##### 

  

 

Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock (the " _ _Company Requisite Vote__ ").
This Agreement is a valid and legally binding obligation of the Company
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject
to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium
and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors
rights and to general equity principles (the " _ _Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception__ "). 

   

 (ii) At a meeting duly called and held prior to execution of this Agreement the Company Board unanimously adopted resolutions (a) approving, adopting and declaring advisable this Agreement and the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, the " _ _Transactions__ ") and determining that the terms of the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and to the holders of the Shares (collectively, the " _ _Board Approval__ ") and (b) recommending that the holders of Shares accept the Offer, tender their Shares to Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer, and adopt this Agreement (the " _ _Board Recommendation__ "). Such resolutions are sufficient to cause Section 203 of the DGCL not to apply to Parent, Merger Sub, this Agreement and the Transactions. The Company has been advised by each of its directors and officers that each such Person intends to tender all Shares owned by such Person pursuant to the Offer. 

  

 (iii) The Company Board has received the written opinion of its financial advisor, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. (" _ _J.P. Morgan__ "), dated of the date of this Agreement, to the effect that and on the basis of and subject to the matters set forth therein, as of such date that the $37.00 per Share to be received by the holders of the Shares in the Offer and the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. A signed copy of such opinion has been delivered to Parent. 

  

 (d) _Governmental Filings; No Violations; Certain Contracts, Etc_. (i) Other than the filings or notices (A) pursuant to Section 1.7, (B) required under the HSR Act, the German Act Against Restraints of Competition, the Norwegian Competition Act or the Investment Canada Act or (C) required to be made under the Exchange Act or with Nasdaq, no notices, reports, applications or other filings are required to be made by the Company with, nor are any consents, registrations, approvals, permits, clearances or authorizations required to be obtained by the Company from, any governmental or regulatory authority, agency, commission, body, court or other legislative, executive or judicial governmental entity (" _ _Governmental Entity__ "), in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other Transactions. 

  

 (ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company do not, and the consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, constitute or result in (A) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the Company Governing Documents or the comparable governing instruments of any of its Subsidiaries, (B) a breach or violation of, a 

   ##### 

  

 

termination (or right of termination) or a default under, the acceleration of
any obligations or the creation of a Lien on the assets of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) pursuant
to, any agreement, lease, license, contract, note, mortgage, indenture,
arrangement or other obligation (a " _ _Contract__ ") binding upon
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, assuming that the necessary
consents, approvals and filings referred to in clauses (A) through (D) of
Section 5.1(d)(i) are duly obtained and/or made, any Laws or governmental or
non-governmental permit or license to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is subject or (C) any change in the rights or obligations of
any party under any such Contracts, except, in the case of clause (B) or (C)
above, for any breach, violation, termination, default, acceleration or
creation that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. Section 5.1(d) of
the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a correct and complete list of
Company Material Contracts (as defined in Section 5.1(q)) pursuant to which
consents or waivers are or may be required prior to consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (whether or not subject to
the exception set forth with respect to clauses (B) and (C) above). 

   

 (iii) Without limiting the generality of clause (ii) above, neither the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement by the Company nor the consummation by the Company of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will require the receipt of any consent pursuant to, or give rise to any right of termination under, any of the Contracts referenced in item 2 of Schedule 5.1(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter except for any such consents and any such termination rights which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect if not obtained (in the case of such consents) or if exercised (in the case of such termination rights). 

  

 (iv) Section 5.1(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a correct and complete list of all material claims held by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, as creditors or claimants, with respect to debtors or debtors-in-possession subject to proceedings under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code (the " _ _Bankruptcy Code__ "), together with a correct and complete list of all orders entered by the applicable United States Bankruptcy Court with respect to each such proceeding. None of such orders, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 (e) _Company Reports; Financial Statements_. (i) The Company has made available to the Parent each registration statement, report, form, proxy or information statement or other document filed or furnished by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with or to the SEC since July 31, 2005 (the " _ _Company Audit Date__ "), including (i) the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2005 and (ii) the Companys Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the period ended October 31, 2005, each in the form (including exhibits, annexes and any amendments thereto) filed with the SEC (collectively with each other, any such registration statements, 

   ##### 

   

 

reports, forms, proxy or information statements or other documents so filed or
furnished subsequent to the date of this Agreement and any amendments to any
of the foregoing, the " _ _Company Reports__ "). The Company and its
Subsidiaries have filed or furnished, as applicable, with or to the SEC all
registration statements, reports, forms, proxy or information statements and
other documents required to be so filed or furnished by them pursuant to
applicable securities statutes, regulations, policies and rules since the
Company Audit Date. Each of the Company Reports, at the time first filed with
or furnished to the SEC, complied or will comply (as applicable) in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act
and Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and complied in all
material respects with the then applicable accounting standards. As of their
respective dates, the Company Reports did not, and any Company Reports filed
with the SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement will not, contain any

 (C) required to be performed after the date of this Agreement pursuant to
the terms of Contracts or applicable Law; or

 (i) _Employee Benefits_. 

  

 (i) All benefit and compensation plans, contracts, policies or arrangements covering current or former employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _ _Employees__ ") and current or former directors of the Company, including, but not limited to, "employee benefit plans" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ _ERISA__ "), and deferred compensation, stock option, stock purchase, stock appreciation rights, Company stock based, incentive and bonus plans (the " _ _Company Benefit Plans__ ") are listed on Schedule 5.1(i)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter, and each Company Benefit Plan which has received a favorable opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service (" _ _IRS__ "), including any master or prototype plan, has been separately identified. True and complete copies of all Company Benefit Plans listed on Schedule 5.1(i)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter, including, but not limited to, any trust instruments, insurance contracts and, with respect to any employee stock ownership plan, loan agreements forming a part of any Company Benefit Plans, and all amendments thereto have been provided or made available to Parent. 

  

 (ii) No Company Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA (a " _ _Multiemployer Plan__ "). All Company Benefit Plans are in substantial compliance with ERISA, the Code and other applicable Laws. Each Company Benefit Plan which is subject to ERISA (the " _ _Company ERISA Plans__ ") that is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a " _ _Company Pension Plan__ ") and that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS for all tax law changes prior to the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 or has applied to the IRS for such favorable determination letter within the applicable remedial amendment period under Section 401(b) of the Code, and the Company is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in the loss of the qualification of such Company Pension Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code. Any voluntary employees beneficiary association within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code which provides benefits under a Company Benefit Plan has (i) received an opinion letter from the IRS recognizing its exempt status under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code and (ii) filed a timely notice with the IRS pursuant to Section 505(c) of the Code, and the Company is not aware of 

   ##### 

  

 

circumstances likely to result in the loss of such exempt status under Section
501(c)(9) of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
engaged in a transaction with respect to any Company ERISA Plan that,
assuming the taxable period of such transaction expired as of the date
hereof, could subject the Company or any Subsidiary to a tax or penalty
imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred or reasonably
expects to incur a tax or penalty imposed by Section 4980F of the Code or
Section 502 of ERISA or any liability under Section 4071 of ERISA. 

   

 (iii) No liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan", within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by any of them, or the single-employer plan of any entity which is considered one employer with the Company under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (a " _ _Company ERISA Affiliate__ "). No notice of a "reportable event", within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived or extended, other than pursuant to Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (" _ _PBGC__ ") Reg. Section 4043.66, has been required to be filed for any Company Pension Plan or by any Company ERISA Affiliate within the 12-month period ending on the date hereof or will be required to be filed in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No notices have been required to be sent to participants and beneficiaries or the PBGC under Section 302 or 4011 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. 

  

 (iv) All contributions required to be made under each Company Benefit Plan, as of the date hereof, have been timely made and all obligations in respect of each Company Benefit Plan have been properly accrued and reflected in the most recent consolidated balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference in the Company Reports prior to the date hereof. Neither any Company Pension Plan nor any single-employer plan of a Company ERISA Affiliate has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and no Company ERISA Affiliate has an outstanding funding waiver. It is not reasonably anticipated that required minimum contributions to any Company Pension Plan under Section 412 of the Code will be materially increased by application of Section 412(l) of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has provided, or is required to provide, security to any Company Pension Plan or to any single-employer plan of a Company ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code. 

  

 (v) Under each Company Pension Plan which is a single-employer plan, as of the last day of the most recent plan year ended prior to the date hereof, the actuarially determined present value of all "benefit liabilities", within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as determined on the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in such Company Pension Plans most recent actuarial valuation), did not exceed the then current value of the assets of such Company Pension Plan, and there has 

   ##### 

  

 

been no material change in the financial condition of such Company Pension
Plan since the last day of the most recent plan year. 

   

 (vi) As of the date hereof, there is no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, litigation relating to the Company Benefit Plans. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations for retiree health and life benefits under any Company ERISA Plan or collective bargaining agreement. The Company or its Subsidiaries may amend or terminate any such plan at any time without incurring any liability thereunder other than in respect of claims incurred prior to such amendment or termination. 

  

 (vii) There has been no amendment to, announcement by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage under, any Company Benefit Plan which would increase the expense of maintaining such plan above the level of the expense incurred therefor for the most recent fiscal year. Neither the execution of this Agreement, stockholder adoption of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (w) entitle any employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay or any increase in severance pay upon any termination of employment after the date hereof, (x) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or result in any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or result in any other obligation pursuant to, any of the Company Benefit Plans, (y) limit or restrict the right of the Company or, after the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Parent to merge, amend or terminate any of the Company Benefit Plans or (z) result in payments under any of the Company Benefit Plans which would not be deductible under Section 162(m) or Section 280G of the Code. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any contract, agreement or arrangement with any officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with or in contemplation of any of the Transactions. 

  

 (viii) Substantially all of the key employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries and all of the Companys executive officers have executed the Companys Patent, Trade Secret and Copyright Agreement in substantially the same form as the one that has been provided to Parent. 

  

 (j) _Compliance with Laws and Regulations; Permits_. The businesses of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries have not been, and are not being, conducted in material violation of any federal, state, local or foreign law, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, injunction, decree, arbitration award, agency requirement, license or permit of any Governmental Entity (any of the foregoing, a " _ _Law__ ", and, collectively, " _ _Law__ " or " _ _Laws__ "). To the knowledge of the officers of the Company, no material change is required in the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries processes, properties or procedures for them to continue to comply with such Laws, and the Company has not received any notice or communication of any material noncompliance with any such Laws that has not been cured as of the date of this Agreement. The 

   ##### 

  

 

Company and each of its Subsidiaries have obtained and are in substantial
compliance with all material governmental licenses, permits, certificates,
approvals and authorizations (" _ _Permits__ ") required or necessary for the
conduct of their businesses and the use of their properties and assets as
presently conducted and used, and neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has received written notice from any Governmental Entity of
any material noncompliance with any such Permits that has not been cured as
of the date of this Agreement. 

   

 (k) _Takeover Statutes_. The Company Board has taken (and not revoked) all action necessary to ensure that Section 203 of the DGCL will not impose any additional procedural, voting, approval, fairness or other restrictions on the timely consummation of the Transactions or restrict, impair or delay the ability of (i) Parent or Merger Sub to engage in any of the Transactions with the Company, (ii) Parent or Merger Sub to vote or otherwise exercise all rights as a stockholder of the Company or (iii) Parent or Merger Sub to exercise or enforce any rights under the Tender Agreements. No "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation (each a " _ _Takeover Statute__ ") or any anti-takeover provision in the Companys certificate of incorporation or by-laws is applicable to the Shares, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Tender Agreements. 

  

 (l) _Affiliate Transactions_. There are no loans, leases or other continuing transactions between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any present or former stockholder, director or officer thereof or any member of such officers, directors or stockholders family, or any Person controlled (within the meaning of such term in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) by such executive officer, director or stockholder or his or her family that are not disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of SEC Regulation S-K. No director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective spouses or family members, owns directly or indirectly on an individual or joint basis any interest in, or serves as an officer or director or in another similar capacity of, any supplier or other independent contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any organization which has a Contract or arrangement with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

discussions or negotiations with any Person who has made a Qualifying
Acquisition Proposal; or (C) approving or recommending to the holders of
Shares a Qualifying Acquisition Proposal (or agreeing to take any such
action), if and only to the extent that, (1) in the case of any action

 (b) The Company agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

benefit of such Person by or on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and to destroy all summaries, analyses or extracts of or based
upon such information in the possession of such Person or any of its
Representatives. The Company agrees that it will take the necessary steps to
promptly inform its Representatives of the obligations undertaken in this

provision of any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it is a
party without the prior written consent of Parent. 

   

 (c) The Company agrees that it will notify Parent as promptly as practicable (and, in any event, within 24 hours) if any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal are received by, any information relating thereto is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations relating thereto are sought to be initiated or continued with, it or any of its Representatives, indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the material terms and conditions of any proposal or offer and thereafter shall keep Parent informed, on a current basis, as to the status and terms of any such proposal or offer and the status of any such discussions or negotiations.

Any such revisions which Parent offers in writing to make which, if accepted by the Company, would be legally binding on the parties to this Agreement are referred to herein as " _ _Revised Terms__ ".

 6.3. _Board Recommendation_. The Company Board shall not make a Change In Recommendation at any time prior to the purchase of Shares by Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer unless: (i) the Company shall have provided written notice to Parent that the Company Board intends to take such action, at least three (3) business days shall have elapsed since the date on which Parent received such notice and the Company shall have complied with the applicable provisions of Section 6.2(c), (ii) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consulting with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors and taking into account any Revised Terms, that failing to take such action would be a breach by the directors of the Company of their fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (iii) if the Change In Recommendation is being made primarily as a result of an Acquisition Proposal, such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal (it being agreed and understood by the parties that any Change in Recommendation shall not alter the Company Boards approval of this Agreement, the Tender Agreements and the Transactions (including for purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL).

The Company and Parent shall cooperate with one another in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement.

lock box arrangements in connection with the foregoing and to conduct a due
diligence investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection
with any bank financing, including access to outside accountants and
key customers and key suppliers); _provided_ that (1) such requested
cooperation does not materially and adversely interfere with the ongoing
operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (2) none of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or
other similar fee or incur any other expense in connection with their
cooperation in the funding process prior to the Effective Time.

 6.9. _Employee Benefits_. Parent agrees, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary thereof, to use good faith efforts to provide the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries with pension and welfare benefits under employee benefit plans (other than plans involving the issuance of securities of the Company or Parent) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those currently provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to such employees; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing hereto shall preclude Parent or any of its affiliates from terminating 

   ##### 

  

 

Company Benefit Plans, or require Parent or any of its affiliates to retain
the employment of any particular employee of the Company. 

   

 6.10. _Expenses_. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the transactions contemplated in  _Article IV_. Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.2, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such expense, except that expenses incurred in connection with the filing fees for the HSR notification and report form and Schedule TO and the publishing, printing or mailing of the Offer Documents, Schedule 14D-9 and, if applicable, the Proxy Statement (but not the attorneys fees related thereto, which shall be paid by the party incurring such expense) shall be shared equally by Parent and the Company. 

  

 6.11. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. (a) Parent agrees that, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will indemnify and hold harmless each past and present director and officer of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries (in each case, for acts or failures to act in such capacity) (the " _ _Indemnified Parties__ "), against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities (collectively, " _ _Costs__ ") incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company would have been permitted under Delaware law and its certificate of incorporation or by-laws as in effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify such Person (and Parent shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, _provided_ , _however_ , that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification). 

  

 (b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (a) of this Section 6.11, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof.

that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated
hereby is prohibited by applicable Law. 

   

 (c) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain the Companys existing officers and directors liability insurance (" _ _D andO Insurance__") for a period of six years after the Effective Time so long as the annual premium therefor is not in excess of 200% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement, which is set forth on Section 6.11 of the Company Disclosure Letter (the " _ _Current Premium__ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the existing DandO Insurance exceeds 200%, expires, is terminated or cancelled during such six-year period, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain as much DandO Insurance as can be obtained for the remainder of such period for a premium not in excess (on an annualized basis) of 200% of the Current Premium (such 200% amount, the " _ _Maximum Annual Premium__ "). In addition, the Company may purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy prior to the Effective Time on terms and conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties than the existing directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company; _provided_ , that the amount paid by the Company shall not exceed six times the Maximum Annual Premium. If such "tail" prepaid policy has been obtained by the Company prior to the Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policy in full force and effect, for its full term, and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder, and all other obligations under this Section 6.11(c) shall terminate.

 (b) In the event that either: 

  

 (i) at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to its termination a bona fide Acquisition Proposal (assuming, for this purpose only, that all references to "15%" in the definition of such term were changed to "40%") (a " _ _Covered Proposal__ ")) shall have been made (or, if made prior to the date of this Agreement, been reaffirmed thereafter) to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or its stockholders or any Person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make a Covered Proposal with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and thereafter this Agreement is terminated (A) by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section

Parent or its affiliates) within 15 months after the date on which
this Agreement is so terminated. 

   

 (c) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 8.2, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or Merger Sub commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the fee, charges or expenses to which reference is made in this Section 8.2, the Company shall pay to Parent or Merger Sub its reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties hereby acknowledge that in the event that the Termination Fee and/or out-of-pocket expenses become payable and are paid by the Company pursuant to this Section 8.2, the Termination Fee and out-of-pocket expenses shall be Parents and Merger Subs sole and exclusive remedy for monetary damages under this Agreement.

This Agreement (including any exhibits hereto), the Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure Letter and the Confidentiality Agreement, dated January 4, 2006, between Parent and the Company (the " _ _Confidentiality Agreement__ ") constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements, understandings, representations and warranties both written and oral, among the parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof. 

  

 9.8. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in Section 8.2 (Effect of Termination and Abandonment), this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than the parties who are signatories hereto any rights or remedies hereunder. 

  

 9.9. _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. 

  

 9.10. _Definitions_. Each of the terms set forth in _Annex A_ is defined in the Section of this Agreement set forth opposite such term. 

  

 9.11. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability or the other provisions hereof. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the 

   ##### 

  

 

application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction. 

   

 9.12. _Interpretation; Construction_. (a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." 

  

 (b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement. 

  

 (c) Each of the Company and Parent has or may have set forth information in its respective disclosure letter in a section thereof that corresponds to the section of this Agreement to which it relates. A matter set forth in one section of a disclosure letter need not be set forth in any other section of the disclosure letter so long as its relevance to the latter section of the disclosure letter or section of the Agreement is readily apparent on the face of the information disclosed in the disclosure letter to the Person to which such disclosure is being made. The fact that any item of information is disclosed in a disclosure letter to this Agreement shall not be construed to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement. Such information and the dollar thresholds set forth herein shall not be used as a basis for interpreting the terms "material," "Company Material Adverse Effect," "Parent Material Adverse Effect" or other similar terms in this Agreement. 

  

 9.13. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of law or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may designate, by written notice to the Company, another wholly owned direct or indirect Subsidiary to be a Constituent Corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, in which event all references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such other subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made herein with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties made with respect to such other Subsidiary as of the date of such designation. Any purported assignment in violation of this Agreement is void. 

   ##### 

   

  

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the duly authorized officers of the parties hereto as of the date first written above.

 _Conditions to the Offer_  

   

 Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer or this Agreement and without limiting Merger Subs right to extend the Offer as permitted by this Agreement, Merger Sub shall not be obligated to accept for payment any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer until the expiration or early termination of all waiting periods applicable to the Offer under the HSR Act, the German Act Against Restraints of Competition and the Norwegian Competition Act ( _collectively,_ the " _ _Antitrust Condition__ ") and Merger Sub shall not be obligated to accept for payment or pay for, and may delay the acceptance for payment of or payment for, any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer if (i) as of the expiration time for the Offer there shall not have been validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that number of Shares which, together with all other Shares owned by Parent or Merger Sub, would represent at least a majority of the number and voting power of the outstanding Shares (determined on a fully diluted basis) (the " _ _Minimum Condition__ ") or (ii) on or after the date of this Agreement and at or prior to the time of payment for any Shares pursuant to the Offer (whether or not any Shares have theretofore been accepted for payment), any of the following events or conditions shall occur or exist: 

   

 (a) there shall be pending any suit, action or proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity against Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company that seeks to (i) prohibit or impose any material limitations on the ownership or operation by the Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company of all or a material portion of their businesses or assets, taken as a whole, or to compel Parent or Merger Sub or their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates to dispose of, license or hold separate any material portion of the business or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries or Parent and its Subsidiaries, in each case taken as a whole, (ii) restrain or prohibit the making or consummation of the Offer or the Merger, (iii) obtain from the Company, Parent or any of their Subsidiaries damages in connection with the consummation of the Offer or the Merger which suit, action or proceeding would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, cash flow, assets, liabilities, business or prospects of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iv) prohibit or impose material limitations on the ability of Merger Sub to accept for payment, pay for or purchase the Shares pursuant to the Offer or the Merger, or (v) prohibit or impose material limitations on the ability of Merger Sub or Parent to effectively to exercise full rights of ownership of the Shares, including the right to vote the Shares purchased or owned by them on all matters properly presented to the Companys shareholders;  

   

 (b) there shall be any statute, law, rule, regulation, order, writ, injunction, decree or award enacted, entered, enforced, promulgated or deemed 

   ##### 

  

    

applicable to the Offer or Merger by or on behalf of a Governmental Entity, or
any other action shall be taken by a Governmental Entity, which would
reasonably be expected to result, directly or indirectly, in any of the
consequences referred to in paragraph (a) above; 

   

 (c) since the date of this Agreement, any fact, change, event, development or circumstance shall have occurred, arisen or come into existence or become known to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub which, individually or in the aggregate, have had or would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect; 

   

 (d) (i) any representation and warranty made by the Company in Section 5.1(a), 5.1(b), 5.1(c), 5.1(d)(ii)(A), or 5.1(k) of this Agreement shall not have been true and correct in all material respects when made or as of any subsequent date (assuming it was made on and as of such subsequent date) or (ii) any of the other representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall not have been true and correct when made or as of any subsequent date (assuming it was made on and as of such subsequent date) without giving effect to any materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect qualifications contained therein, except in the case of this clause (ii) only for any such failures to be true and correct which, individually or in the aggregate, have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect; _provided, however,_ that notwithstanding the foregoing for purposes of this condition any such representation and warranty which is expressly given as of a specified earlier date will only be required to be true and correct as of such earlier date; 

   

 (e) the Company shall have breached or failed to perform or comply with in any material respect any agreement or covenant of the Company under this Agreement; 

   

 (f) Merger Sub shall have failed to receive a certificate executed by the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, dated as of the scheduled expiration of the Offer, to the effect that the conditions set forth in paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) of this _Exhibit 1_ have not occurred; or 

   

 (g) this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms; 

 

which, in the sole judgment of Merger Sub or Parent, in any such case, and
regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any such condition (including
any action or inaction by Parent or any of its affiliates), makes it
inadvisable to proceed with such acceptance for payment or payment. 

   

 The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Merger Sub and Parent and may be asserted by Merger Sub or Parent regardless of the circumstances giving rise   ##### 

  

  

  

to such condition or may be waived by Merger Sub and Parent in whole or in
part at any time and from time to time in their sole discretion; _provided,
however,_ that neither the Minimum Condition or the Antitrust Condition may
be waived without the prior written consent of the Company. The failure by
Parent, Merger Sub or any other affiliate of Parent at any time to
exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such
right, the waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and
circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts
and circumstances and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that
may be asserted at any time and from time to time. 

   

 Terms used in this _Exhibit 1_ which are defined in the Merger Agreement shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Merger Agreement.

EXHIBIT 2 

   

Form of Tender Agreement 

   

January __, 2006 

   

[Name] 

   

[Address]

   

Dear Mr. [Name]: 

   

 This letter is to confirm our agreement regarding all of the shares of common stock, par value $0.10 per share (" _ _Common Stock__ "), of LOWRANCE ELECTRONICS, INC., a corporation incorporated under the laws of Delaware (the " _ _Company__ "), beneficially owned by you and your affiliates and any other shares of Common Stock as to which you or your affiliates may hereafter acquire beneficial ownership (collectively, the " _ _Subject Shares__ "), which agreement was required to induce SIMRAD YACHTING AS, a stock corporation incorporated under the laws of Norway (" _ _Parent__ "), and NAVICO ACQUISITION CORP., a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware (" _Merger Sub_ "), to enter into the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated the date hereof (the " _ _Merger Agreement__ "), among Parent, Merger Sub and the Company. Terms used but not defined herein which are defined in the Merger Agreement shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement. 

   

 Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, you hereby agree (i) as soon as practicable after the commencement of the Offer by Merger Sub but in no event later than the fifth business day after commencement of the Offer by Merger Sub you will tender, or cause to be tendered, and not withdraw all of the Subject Shares pursuant to the Offer, (ii) to vote or cause to be voted all of Subject Shares against any Acquisition Proposal other than the Offer and Merger, or any other matters which could reasonably be expected to impede, interfere, delay or adversely affect the consummation of the Offer, Merger or other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (iii) to comply with all restrictions and obligations imposed on Representatives by Section 6.2 of the Merger Agreement and (iv) not to sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber or dispose of, or grant a proxy or enter into a voting agreement or trust or similar arrangement with respect to, any of the Subject Shares (other than pursuant to this letter agreement or the Offer or to or with Parent or Merger Sub). In furtherance of your voting agreement in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence, you hereby revoke any and all previous proxies with respect to any of the Subject Shares and grant to Parent and such individuals or corporations as Parent may designate an irrevocable proxy to vote all of the Subject Shares owned by you in accordance with such clause. You hereby acknowledge that the proxy granted by the foregoing is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable. In addition, you hereby agree to execute such additional documents as Parent may reasonably request to effectuate its proxy and voting rights under this paragraph. You hereby authorize Merger Sub to notify the Companys transfer agent for the Shares that a stop transfer restriction is imposed   ##### 

  

  

  

with respect to all of the Subject Shares and that this letter agreement
places limits on the transfer of the Subject Shares. 

   

 You hereby represent and warrant that (i) you are the sole record and beneficial owner of, and have sole and full right, power and authority to sell and vote _ _Subject Shares, which represent all of the Subject Shares beneficially owned by you as of the date of this letter agreement, (ii) you will have or will obtain prior to the expiration of the Offer the sole and full right, power and authority to sell and vote any Subject Shares as to which you gain beneficial ownership after the date of this letter agreement, (iii) you have full power and authority to execute, deliver and perform your obligations under this letter agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, (iv) this letter agreement has been duly executed and delivered by you and constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of you, enforceable against you in accordance with its terms subject only to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception, and (v) neither the execution, delivery or performance by you of this letter agreement nor the consummation by you of the transactions contemplated hereby will constitute a violation of, or conflict with, or default under, any applicable Law or any contract, commitment, agreement, understanding, arrangement or restriction of any kind to which you or any of your affiliates are a party or by which you or any such affiliate or the Subject Shares are bound. 

   

 We each hereby agree that you are not making any agreement or understanding herein in any capacity other than in your capacity as a stockholder of the Company. Nothing contained in this letter agreement shall restrict you from taking in good faith and after consultation with outside counsel any actions, or in any way limit any actions that you may take, necessary to discharge your fiduciary duties as a director of the Company. 

   

 This letter agreement will terminate, and all rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall terminate, concurrently with the earlier of (i) the purchase of all of the Subject Shares in the Offer and (ii) termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms. No such termination shall relieve any party from liability for any willful breach of this letter agreement. 

   

 Each party shall be entitled, without prejudice to the rights and remedies otherwise available to such party, to specific performance of all of the other partys obligations hereunder. This letter agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to the conflict of laws principles thereof. Each of the parties shall pay its own expenses in connection with the execution and performance of this letter agreement. 

   

 This letter agreement (i) is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any person or entity other than the parties who are signatories hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, (ii) constitutes the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and 

    ##### 

  

    

(iii) may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed to be an original. No provision of this letter agreement may be
amended or waived unless such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed,
in the case of an amendment, by all parties hereto or, in the case of a
waiver, by the waiving party. No failure or delay by any party in exercising
any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor
shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The
rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of
any rights or remedies provided by law. 

   

 If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this letter agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this letter agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated. 

   

 If the foregoing correctly sets forth our agreement, please sign both copies of this letter agreement in the space provided below and return one copy to us, whereupon this letter agreement will constitute a binding agreement among us. 

  

Sincerely,
