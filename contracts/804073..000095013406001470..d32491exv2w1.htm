1934, as amended (the &#147;<U><I>Exchange Act</I></U>&#148;)) a tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding
shares of common stock, par value $0.10 per share (the &#147;<U><I>Common Stock</I></U>&#148;), of the Company (the
&#147;<U><I>Shares</I></U>&#148;) at a price of $37.00 per Share in cash, net to the seller but subject to any
required withholding of Taxes, subject to the conditions set forth in <U>Exhibit&nbsp;1</U> and the
requirements of this Agreement (such tender offer and price as they may from time to time be
amended in accordance with this Agreement, the &#147;<U><I>Offer</I></U>&#148; and the &#147;<U><I>Offer Price</I></U>&#148;,
respectively). Subject to Merger Sub&#146;s right to extend the Offer as permitted by this Agreement,
the Offer shall initially expire at midnight (New York City time) on the date which is 20 business
days after the date on which the Offer was commenced (determined as provided in Rule&nbsp;14d-1(g)(3)
under the Exchange Act). If any of the conditions set forth in <U>Exhibit&nbsp;1</U> are not satisfied
or waived by Merger Sub as of any then scheduled expiration time for the Offer, then Merger Sub
may, from time to time in its sole discretion, extend the expiration time for the Offer in maximum
increments of 10 business days to no later than June&nbsp;30, 2006 (the &#147;<U><I>Outside Date</I></U>&#148;);
<I>provided, however, </I>that notwithstanding the foregoing (i)&nbsp;Merger Sub may extend the Offer for any
period required by any applicable Law (as defined in Section&nbsp;5.1(i)) and (ii)&nbsp;after acceptance for
payment of Shares for a further period of time not to exceed twenty (20)&nbsp;business days by means of
a subsequent offering period under Rule&nbsp;14d-11 under the Exchange Act. Merger Sub expressly
reserves the right to amend or modify the terms and conditions of the Offer in its sole discretion;

Condition, impose any conditions other than those set forth in <U>Exhibit&nbsp;1</U>, modify the
conditions on <U>Exhibit&nbsp;1</U> (other than to waive any conditions on <U>Exhibit&nbsp;1</U> to the
extent permitted by this Agreement), decrease the Offer Price below $37.00 per Share, change the
form of consideration payable in the Offer, reduce the number of Shares sought in the Offer, extend
the Offer other than as permitted by the immediately preceding sentence or amend any terms of the
Offer in a manner adverse to the holders of Shares, in each case without the prior written consent
of the Company. On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Merger
Sub shall pay for all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that Merger
Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable after the expiration
of the Offer. Merger Sub may, at any time, transfer or assign to one or more Subsidiaries of
Parent the right to purchase all or any portion of the Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, but
any such transfer or assignment shall not relieve Merger Sub of its obligations under this
Agreement or the Offer. Whenever this Agreement requires Merger Sub to take any action, such
requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent that it will cause
Merger Sub to take such action.

expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). The Company has made
available to Parent a complete and correct copy of the certificate of incorporation and by-laws (or
other comparable governing instruments) of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, each as
