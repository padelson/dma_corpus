(c) The Parent shall have forty-five (45) days following receipt of the

Closing Dividend Amount and the Preliminary Tangible Book Value set forth in
the Preliminary Statement (the " _Dispute Notice_ "), specifying the reasons
therefor in reasonable detail. The Parent shall be conclusively deemed to
have accepted all items and amounts contained in the Preliminary Statement

believes that any such withholding or deduction is required under applicable
Tax Law with respect to any payment under this Agreement, then it shall give
written notice (setting forth, in reasonable detail, the authority, basis and
method of calculation for such proposed withholding or deduction) to the
Parent as reasonably practicable prior to making such payment, and it shall
provide the Parent a reasonable opportunity to provide any applicable
certificates, forms or documentation that would reduce or eliminate, and will

deficiency in any TMR Group Entitys internal control over financial
reporting (whether or not remediated) and (2) no change in such TMR Group

waiver of default is presently in effect, in the payment of any principal or

their beneficiaries and dependents), or under which any TMR Group Entity has
any current or potential liability. _Section_ __ _ 3.14(a)_ of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule identifies each Company Benefit Plan that is sponsored or

(b) Neither the Parent, the Companies nor any of their Affiliates has engaged

ERISA that would reasonably be expected to subject any TMR Group Entity or any
TMR Group Entity Plan to a Tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of
the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA in an amount which could be material. Each
Company Benefit Plan which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of

this Agreement, " _Controlled Group Liability_ "

Section 302 of ERISA and (iii) under Sections 412 and 4971 of the Code, and "

that are, or were at the relevant time, treated together with any TMR Group
Entity as a "single employer" within the meaning of Section 414 of the Code
or Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA.

(d) All payments relating to compensation or benefits for any Employee
required to be made by any TMR Group Entity under the terms of any Company
Benefit Plan or by Law (including all contributions (including all employer
contributions and employee salary reduction contributions), insurance premiums
or intercompany charges) with respect to all prior periods have been deducted
and timely made when due and are appropriately reflected on the Reference
Balance Sheets.

(e) None of the TMR Group Entities have any obligations for retiree welfare
benefits other than coverage mandated by applicable Law (including employer
subsidies for such coverage that continue during an applicable severance
period). No current or former Employee has any legal entitlement to benefits
in excess of those set out under the terms of the Company Benefit Plans. No
announcements have been made or assurances have been given or implied as to
the introduction, continuance, increase or improvement of any retirement,
death or disability benefits or as to the enhancement of any benefits in
connection with the Closing.

(f) Other than as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.14(f)_ of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, none of the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
shareholder or other approval of this Agreement, nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement could, either alone or in
combination with another event, (i) entitle any current or former Employee to
severance pay (other than severance pay required by any Law), (ii) accelerate
the time of payment or vesting or increase the amount of compensation due to
any current or former Employee or (iii) result in any payment becoming due, or
increase the amount of any compensation or benefits otherwise payable, under
any TMR Group Entity Plan.

 

(g) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, shareholder or other
approval of this Agreement, nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement could, either alone or in combination with
another event, result in the payment of any amount that could, individually or
in combination with any other such payment, constitute an "excess
parachute payment" as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code. No person is
entitled to receive any additional payment (including any tax gross-up or
other payment) from any TMR Group Entity as a result of the imposition of the
excise Taxes required by Section 4999 of the Code or any Taxes required by
Section 409A of the Code.

(h) There are no pending, in-progress or, to the Parents Knowledge,
threatened Actions against or relating to the TMR Group Entity Plans, the
assets of any of the trusts under such plans or the plan sponsor or the plan
administrator, or against any fiduciary of the TMR Group Entity Plans with
respect to the operation of such plans (other than routine benefits claims)
that could reasonably be expected to result in any material liability to the
TMR Group Entities. No TMR Group Entity Plan is presently under audit,
investigation or examination (nor has written notice been received of a
potential audit, investigation or examination) by any Governmental Authority.

(i) Each TMR Group Entity Plan has been established, administered and funded
in compliance in all material respects with its terms and the applicable
provisions of ERISA, the Code and other applicable Laws. There is not now,
nor, to the Parents Knowledge, do any circumstances exist that could

assets of any TMR Group Entity under ERISA or the Code with respect to a
Company Benefit Plan.

 

(j) Each TMR Group Entity Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation

the Code.

appropriate, based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions, and does not have
unfunded liabilities or liabilities that could reasonably be imposed upon the
assets of any TMR Group Entity by reason of such Non-U.S. Plan, (ii) is in
compliance in all material respects with its terms and all applicable Laws,
and (iii) if intended or required to be qualified, approved or registered with
a Governmental Authority or under applicable Tax rules, is and has been so
qualified, approved or registered and, to the Parents Knowledge, nothing has
occurred that could reasonably be expected to result in the loss of such
qualification, approval or registration, as applicable.

with or an "associate" of any company that participates in, or has at any
time participated in, a scheme to which Section 38 or 43 of the UK Pensions
Act 2004 applies. For these purposes "connected" and "associate" have the
meanings given to them in Sections 249 and 435 of the UK Insolvency Act 1986,
respectively.

(m) The UK Group Personal Pension provided by Scottish Widows (the " _UK
Pension Plan_ ") is used to meet employer duties under the UK Pensions Act
2008. The UK Pension Plan provides only money purchase benefits within the

under the UK Finance Act 2004 for the purposes of HM Revenue and Customs.

(n) Any benefits payable on the death of an employee while in employment
(other than a return of his own contributions and contributions paid in
respect of him) or during a period of sickness or disability are fully
insured, and all premiums due to the insurance company have been paid in full.

correct and complete list of all Material Reinsurance Contracts in effect as
of September 30, 2018. The Parent has made available to the Acquiror, prior to

Reinsurance Contract. Each Reinsurance Contract is in full force and effect
and is a valid and binding obligation of the Reinsurance Entity or Norwood
that is a party thereto and, to the Knowledge of the Parent, each other party
to such Reinsurance Contract. All reinsurance premiums due under each of the
Material Reinsurance Contracts have been paid in full when due or, where the
Reinsurance Entities are the assuming reinsurer, have been adequately accrued
or reserved for by such Reinsurance Entity. None of the TMR Group Entities or
Norwood is party to any Action by or against any counterparty to a
Reinsurance Contract resulting from any material amounts recoverable or
payable by such Reinsurance Entity or Norwood pursuant to a Reinsurance
Contract since January 1, 2016. Each Reinsurance Contract is enforceable
against the Reinsurance Entity or Norwood that is a party thereto and, to the
Knowledge of the Parent, each such other party, in accordance with its terms
(subject in each case to the effect of any applicable
bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, or similar Laws now or
hereafter in effect relating to or affecting creditors rights and remedies
generally and subject, as to enforceability, to the effect of general
equitable principles (regardless 

 



-24- 

    

 of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law)). No
Reinsurance Entity or Norwood that is a party to a Reinsurance Contract or, to
the Knowledge of the Parent, any other party to such Reinsurance Contract is
in material default or material breach of such Reinsurance Contract, and there
does not exist any event, condition or omission that would constitute such a
material default or material breach (with or without the giving of notice or
lapse of time, or both) or that would permit the termination, cancellation,
avoidance, recission or acceleration of performance of any material obligation
of the Reinsurance Entity or Norwood or, to the Knowledge of the Parent, any
other party to such Reinsurance Contract. Since January 1, 2016, none of the
Parent, the TMR Group Entities, Norwood and the TMR Branches has received any
written notice of any material default under any Material
Reinsurance Contract. Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.16(a)(ii)_ of
the Parent Disclosure Schedule, no Material Reinsurance Contract contains any
provision providing that any such other party thereto may terminate, cancel,
modify, accelerate or commute the same by reason of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Since January 1, 2016, none of the Parent, the TMR Group Entities,
Norwood and the TMR Branches have received any written notice from any other
party to a Material Reinsurance Contract (i) that the financial condition of

the Transferred Subsidiaries (the " _Investment Assets_ "). Each of the
Reinsurance Entities has good title to all of the material Investment Assets
it purports to own, free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens.

Section 3.18. _Insurance_.  _Section_ __ _ 3.18_ of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule contains a list of all policies of property, fire and casualty,
product liability, workers compensation and other forms of insurance
(including self-insurance programs) of any TMR Group Entity. True, correct
and complete copies of all such insurance policies have been made available to
the Acquiror. All such policies are in full force and effect (and all premiums
due and payable thereon have been paid in full on a timely basis), and no
written notice of cancellation, termination or revocation or other written
notice that any such insurance policy is no longer in full force or effect or
that the issuer of any such insurance policy is not willing or able
to perform its obligations thereunder has been received by any TMR Group
Entity __ and, to the Knowledge of Parent, none of the TMR Group Entities is
in default of any provision thereof or duty associated therewith. The limits
of all such policies have not been materially eroded or exhausted and there
have been no material claims asserted under such policies or relating to the
properties, assets or operations of any TMR Group Entity since the Reference
Balance Sheet Date. All such policies covering any TMR Group Entity __ are
entered into by a TMR Group Entity, and the TMR Group Entities are not insured
by the Parents or its Affiliates (other than the TMR Group Entities) (as the
case may be) blanket insurance policies or by any of their self-insured
programs.

Group Entity under any of the Real Property Leases, except for such default
that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 reasonably likely to result in the loss of the attorney-client, attorney
work-product or any similar privilege or contravene any confidentiality
obligations or applicable Law (it being understood that each party shall
cooperate in any reasonable efforts and requests for waivers, joint defense
agreements or similar that would enable otherwise required disclosure to the
other party to occur without so jeopardizing privilege or contravening such
confidentiality obligations or Law) or (y) any books and records or other
information of the Parent or any of its Affiliates that do not relate,
directly or indirectly, to the Business or any of the TMR Group Entities or

party hereto or its employees, agents or Representatives, the party holding
such records shall (a) provide to the requesting party or its employees,
agents or Representatives reasonable access to such records during normal
business hours and (b) permit the requesting party or its employees, agents
or Representatives to make copies of such records, in each case at no cost to
the requesting party or its employees, agents or Representatives (other than

herein shall require either party to disclose any information to the other if
such disclosure would be reasonably likely to result in the loss of the
attorney-client, attorney work-product or any similar privilege or contravene
any applicable Law or Governmental Order (it being understood that each party
shall cooperate in any reasonable efforts and requests for waivers, joint
defense agreement or similar that would enable otherwise required disclosure
to the other party to occur without so jeopardizing privilege or contravening
such Law or Governmental Order). Such records may be sought under this
_Section_ __ _ 5.04_ for any reasonable purpose, including to the extent
reasonably required in connection with the audit, accounting, financial
reporting, tax, litigation, federal, foreign or state securities disclosure
or other similar needs of the party seeking such records. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any and all such records may be destroyed by a party if such
destroying party sends to the other party hereto written notice of its intent
to destroy such records, specifying in reasonable detail the contents of the
records to be destroyed; such records may then be destroyed after the 60 _th_
day following such notice unless the other party hereto notifies the
destroying party that such other party desires to obtain possession of such
records, in which event the destroying party at the requesting partys expense
shall transfer the records to such requesting party and such requesting party
shall pay all reasonable expenses of the destroying party in connection
therewith. In addition, following the Closing each party agrees to provide,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective employees, agents
or Representatives to provide, such cooperation and assistance to the other
party, its Subsidiaries and their respective employees, agents or
Representatives (including, for the avoidance of doubt, such partys
auditors), as may be reasonably requested by such other party upon reasonable
advance written notice, in connection with the audit, accounting, financial
reporting, tax, litigation, federal, foreign or state securities disclosure or
other similar needs of such requesting party;  _provided_ that such
cooperation and assistance shall be provided at the requesting partys

information or have applicable professional or ethical obligations to do so;
(ii) disclosures pursuant to the terms of a Governmental Order or as required
to be disclosed by any Governmental Authority; and (iii) disclosures required

_further_ that in the case of disclosures contemplated by _Section_ __ _
5.05(b)(ii)_ or _(iii)_ , the disclosing party shall, to the extent permitted
by Law, and other than in the event of an investigation by a Governmental
Authority not targeted at the Transaction Agreements or the transactions
contemplated thereby, give written notice thereof to the other party so that
such other party may seek an appropriate protective order (at such other
partys expense); _provided_ _further_ that the foregoing requirements of

reasonably necessary to be disclosed in connection with any Action or in any
dispute with respect to the Transaction Agreements (including in response to
any summons, subpoena or other legal process or formal or informal
investigative demand issued to the disclosing party in the course of any
litigation, arbitration, mediation, investigation or administrative
proceeding), or (3) any such information was or becomes available to such
party on a non-confidential basis and from a source (other than a party
hereto or any Affiliate or Representative of such party) that is not bound by
a confidentiality agreement with respect to such information. Each of the
parties hereto shall instruct its Affiliates and Representatives having access
to such information as to such obligation of confidentiality; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the parties hereto may disclose information about the Tax

cause to be taken any action that they are aware or should reasonably be aware
would have the effect of delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of any
such required authorizations, consents, orders or approvals.

(b) The parties hereto shall promptly make (which shall in no event be later

notifications with all Governmental Authorities that are reasonably necessary,

(c) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the sharing of information, each of
the Parent and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Acquiror, on the
other hand, shall promptly notify each other of any material communication it
receives from any Governmental Authority and permit the other party to review
and comment on in advance any proposed communication by such party to
any Governmental Authority and each shall provide the other with copies of
all correspondence, filings or communications between such party or any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of
the staff of any Governmental Authority, on the other hand, in each case to
the extent relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement.
Neither party shall agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental
Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement

permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other party hereto the
opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. Subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Parent, the Companies and the Acquiror shall
coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information
and providing such assistance as the other party may reasonably request
in connection with the foregoing; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing
shall not require the Acquiror, Parent, any TMR Group Entity or any of their
respective Affiliates (i) to disclose any information that in the
reasonable judgment of the Parent, any TMR Group Entity or any of their
respective Affiliates (as the case may be) would result in the disclosure of
any trade secrets of third parties or violate any of its obligations with
respect to confidentiality or (ii) to disclose any privileged information or
confidential competitive information of the Parent, any TMR Group Entity or
any of their respective Affiliates; and _provided_ _further_ that the

3.04_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule (other than the Letters of Credit,
which shall be subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.11_ and other than Reinsurance
Contracts (a " _Third Party Consent_ ")); _provided_ , _however_ , that
neither Parent nor Acquiror shall be required to commence or participate in
litigation or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any
third party to obtain any such Third Party Consent unless the Acquiror agrees,
in its sole discretion, to pay 100% of any costs associated therewith; and
_provided,_ _further_ , that neither Parent nor Acquiror shall be required to
take any action with respect to any third party unless such action is
conditioned upon the Closing. The Parent and Acquiror shall each bear

connection with the procurement of any Third Party

 



-47- 

    

 Consents; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not incur or agree to
incur any such expense without the prior written consent of Acquiror. In the
event that, despite the reasonable best efforts of the parties to obtain a
Third Party Consent, such Third Party Consent has not been obtained prior to
the Closing, Parent and the Acquiror shall continue to cooperate with each
other and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such Third Party
Consent as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Closing.

(e) In the event Parent or any TMR Group Entity receives notice from any __

contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, Parent shall promptly notify the
Acquiror, and to the extent elected by the Acquiror, reasonably cooperate with
the Acquiror and use commercially reasonable efforts to receive a waiver by
such Person of such termination, cancellation or acceleration right.

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, including this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.06_ or the "reasonable best efforts" standard, nothing in
this Agreement shall require the Acquiror to take or refrain from taking or to
agree to it or its Affiliates taking or refraining from taking any action, or
to suffer to exist any restriction, condition or requirement imposed by a
Governmental Authority, which would, or would reasonably be expected to: (A)
impose any material limitations on the Acquirors or its
Affiliates ownership or operation of all or any material portion of its or
any of its Affiliates businesses, operations or assets (including the TMR
Group Entities), (B) compel the Acquiror or any of its Affiliates to sell,
divest or hold separate, before or after the Closing Date, (1) all or any

portion of the business, operations or assets of the TMR Group Entities other
than _de minim_ _i_ _s_ amounts, (C) require the Acquiror or any of its
Affiliates to take any action (or agree to refrain from taking any action to
the extent inconsistent with the Ordinary Course of Business), including an
amendment of any Transaction Agreement or the sale, lease, license, disposal
or holding separate by the Business or Acquiror or any of its Affiliates of
any assets, rights, product lines, licenses, categories of assets or business

connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, (D)
require Acquiror or any of its Affiliates to alter any agreement, change any

be derived by Acquiror and its Affiliates under the Transaction Agreements;
provided, that a requirement that Acquiror or any of its Affiliates enter into
any direct or indirect guarantee, capital maintenance agreement, keep-well or
other requirement to fund money into the TMR Group Entities shall be an
Acquiror Burdensome Condition or (E) otherwise have a material adverse effect
on the business, assets, liabilities, operations or results of operations or
condition (financial or otherwise) of (x) the Acquiror and its Affiliates
(excluding the TMR Group Entities), taken as a whole, or (y) the TMR Group
Entities, taken as a whole (each of the conditions or restrictions described
in clauses (A), (B), (C), (D) and (E) above, an " _Acquiror Burdensome
Condition_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the following shall
constitute an Acquiror

whether an Acquiror Burdensome Condition has occurred or exists: (i) any
actual or proposed change in Law generally applicable to reinsurers and
insurers or their controlling persons after the date hereof; (ii) the failure
of Parent or any Company to obtain any required Governmental Approvals to
effect all or any portion of the Pre-Closing Dividend and (iii) any
restriction on the declaration or payment of dividends or distributions by any
TMR Group Entity that (aa) would be otherwise required by applicable Law
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, applies generally to all Persons meeting
criteria under such Law as opposed to the Acquiror or its Affiliates
individually), (bb) would apply only for so long as the relevant TMR Group
Entity fails to meet an applicable solvency capital, risk-based capital,
surplus or other similar solvency or capital ratio or measure that is required
by applicable Law or (cc) terminates within a reasonable period following the
Closing not to exceed the period set forth on  _Section_ __ _ 5.06(f)_ of

necessary to terminate or commute, concurrently with the Closing, all
Intercompany Agreements, whether written or oral, and to settle, discharge,
offset, pay or repay in full all Intercompany Payables and Intercompany
Receivables, regardless of their maturity, for the amount due (including any
accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the date of payment), fees and
other amounts due or outstanding thereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that
this _Section_ __ _ 5.07_ shall not apply to any Intercompany Agreement set

cancel, modify, accelerate or commute such Surviving Intercompany
Agreement and (y) any right to claim a breach, default or Lien under such
Surviving Intercompany Agreement, in each case as a result of the Transaction
Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby or as a result of any
action or event occurring prior to the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt,
this _Section_ __ _ 5.07_ shall not apply to (a) any Contract between a third
party, on the one hand, and the Parent or any of its Affiliates, on the other
hand, to which any TMR Group Entity is not a party, but under which any TMR
Group Entity may otherwise derive benefits, such as enterprise-wide licenses
or "master" agreements or (b) any Contract among (i) a third party, (ii) the
Parent or any of its Affiliates and (iii) any TMR Group Entity _;_ _provided_
_,_ _however_ , that as to such Contracts covered by clauses (a) and (b),

its Affiliates in or to any of the Parent Names and Marks unless the
applicable Parent Names and Marks are asserted, directly or indirectly,
against Acquiror or any of its Affiliates.

(b) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.08(c)_, following the Closing Date,
the Acquiror shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, reasonably promptly

days after the Closing Date or as otherwise specified in this _Section_ __ _
5.08_, __ such period to be extended for an additional period not to exceed
one hundred and eighty (180) days only if and to the extent any consent,
approval or non-disapproval of Governmental Authorities becomes reasonably
necessary before the use of the Parent Names and Marks can be discontinued

during the initial one hundred and eighty (180) day period, the TMR Group
Entities shall have the right to use all materials bearing the Parent Names
and Marks, including signage, advertising, promotional materials, packaging,
inventory, electronic materials, collateral goods, stationery, business cards,
websites, invoices, receipts, forms, product, training and service literature
and materials, and other materials (" _Materials_ ") solely as such Materials
were used in connection with or contemplated to be used in connection with the
Business as of the Closing, and solely to the extent such use cannot
commercially reasonably be avoided, _provided_ that the Acquiror shall, and
shall cause the TMR Group Entities to, commence the removal, destruction, and
exhaustion, as applicable, of the Parent Names and Marks from all such
Materials promptly following the Closing Date; and _provided_ _further_ that
the Acquiror shall, and shall cause the TMR Group Entities to, reasonably
promptly after the Closing Date cease all use of the Parent Names and Marks

that after the Closing Date the Acquiror and its Affiliates shall not
expressly, or by implication, do business as or represent themselves as the
Parent or its Affiliates (other than a TMR Group Entity) and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to correct any confusion to clarify that the
TMR Group Entities are no longer affiliated with the Parent or any of its
Affiliates.

(d) Within ninety (90) days of the Closing, the Acquiror shall execute,
or shall cause the execution of, such amended organizational documents with
respect to the TMR Group Entities such that the TMR Group Entities can effect
a change in their respective names, to a name not containing any of the Parent
Names and Marks or any confusingly similar derivation, translation,
adaptation, combination or variation thereof and cause the TMR Group Entities
to file such amended organizational documents with the applicable Governmental
Authority, subject to any then outstanding consent, approval or non-
disapprovals of all Governmental Authorities that become reasonably necessary.

(e) To the extent that a TMR Group Entity owns any rights in or to any Parent
Names and Marks, including any registrations or applications for
registrations thereof in any jurisdiction, such TMR Group Entity hereby
assigns and transfers to the Parent (or its designated Affiliate) all right,
title and interest in and to the Parent Names and Marks, and the Acquiror
shall cause such TMR Group Entity to promptly execute any documents and
perform any acts that are requested by the Parent in order to effectuate or
register such assignment (at Parents expense). Should the Acquiror or any of
its Affiliates, following the Closing Date, become aware of any domain name
registration by a TMR Group Entity that includes or incorporates any of the
Parent Names and Marks, the Acquiror shall promptly notify the Parent of the
existence of such domain name registration and, upon the Parents request,
shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, promptly assign and transfer all
right, title and interest in or to such domain name registration to the Parent
(or its designated Affiliate), and promptly execute any documents and perform
any acts that are requested by the Parent in order to effectuate or register
such assignment (at Parents expense).

intentional misconduct. The Parent shall, and shall cause each Parent Releasor
to, refrain from, directly or indirectly, asserting any claim or demand or
commencing, instituting or causing to be commenced, any legal proceeding of
any kind against any Company Releasee based upon any matter released pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 5.09(a)_. The parties hereto hereby acknowledge and
agree that the execution of this Agreement shall not constitute an
acknowledgment of or an admission by any Parent Releasor or Company Releasee

precedent upon which any liability may be asserted.

 Value of such Delphi Securities on the books of the relevant TMR Group
Entities as of such replacement date, and (ii) subject to the immediately
following proviso, pay the entirety of the Pre-Closing Dividend with cash or
U.S. treasury securities; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall have the
right in its sole discretion to pay any portion of the Pre-Closing Dividend

Securities by any TMR Group Entity, Parent will provide to the Acquiror a
reasonably detailed list of Delphi Securities that will be part of such
replacement or transfer, including the CUSIP, book yield, market yield,

_further_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing proviso, such period of
tolling shall not be extended (x) for greater than twelve (12) months in the

other activities conducted by the Business, that are undertaken by any
Affiliate of the Holding Company, so long as such Person is not primarily
engaged in the Business or (b) reinsurance pools or schemes
covering catastrophe, terrorism, earthquake, flood or other risks that are
supported, administered, funded or required to be entered into by Governmental
Authorities;

 



-57-

or

(iii) knowingly solicit or assist in the solicitation of any supplier,
licensee or service provider with whom the Business has a commercial
relationship, whether by contract or otherwise, for the purpose of causing

such commercial relationship.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in 
_Section_ __ _ 5.14(a)_ shall preclude the Holding Company or any of its
Subsidiaries from (i) acquiring (by asset purchase, stock purchase, merger,
reinsurance, consolidation or otherwise), directly or indirectly, the
stock, business or assets of any Person that at the time of such acquisition
is engaged in, or owns any interest in or controls, manages, or operates any
Person that is engaged in, a Competitive Business that would otherwise be
prohibited by  _Section_ __ _ 5.14(a)_ (such Competitive Business being
referred to herein as an " _Acquired Competitive Business_ ") so long as such
Acquired Competitive Business generated no more than twenty percent (20%) of
the net revenues of the combined businesses that are being acquired as part
of the same transaction or related transactions in which such Acquired
Competitive Business is being acquired (measured over the last twelve (12)
months for which such financial data are available prior to the execution of
the definitive agreement for such acquisition (or the date of the consummation
of such acquisition if there is no such definitive agreement)); or (ii)
owning, directly or indirectly, as a passive, non-controlling investor
(without any membership on the board of directors or similar governing body of
such Person), up to an aggregate of five percent (5%) of any class of
securities of a Person that are registered under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended, or an equivalent Law in a foreign jurisdiction.

(c) During the Restricted Period, the Holding Company shall not, and the
Holding Company shall cause each of its Subsidiaries not to, directly or
indirectly, solicit or assist in the solicitation of any individual who on the
Closing Date is an employee of the TMR Group Entities without the prior

advertisement in a newspaper, online or through an employment agency.

(d) During the Restricted Period, the Holding Company and its Subsidiaries
shall hold in confidence, and not disclose to any Person without the
authorization of the Acquiror, any Exclusive Business Confidential
Information; _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section_ __ _ 5.14(d)_ shall
not be construed as prohibiting: (i) disclosures to legal counsel,
independent accountants and other Representatives who agree to maintain the
confidential nature of the Exclusive Business Confidential Information or have
applicable professional or ethical obligations to do so; (ii) disclosures
pursuant to the terms of a Governmental Order or as required to be disclosed
by any Governmental Authority; and (iii) disclosures required by any
applicable Law, including to the extent the Holding Company is advised by its
legal counsel that it is required to make such

 



-58- 

    

 disclosure in order to avoid violating applicable securities Laws or rules
of a national securities exchange to which the Holding Company or its
Affiliates is subject; _provided_   _further_ that, in the case of
disclosures contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 5.14(d)(ii)_ or _(iii)_ , the
Holding Company shall, to the extent permitted by Law, give prior written
notice thereof to the Acquiror so that the Acquiror or its Affiliates may
seek an appropriate protective order and/or waive in writing compliance with
the non-disclosure provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.14(d)_.

 

(e) Each of the parties has carefully read this _Section_ __ _ 5.14_ and
considered the restraints imposed upon the Holding Company and its
Subsidiaries, and is in full accord as to the necessity of such restrictive
covenants for the reasonable and proper protection of the Acquiror, its
Affiliates and the TMR Group Entities, and agrees that each restraint imposed
by the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.14_ is fair and reasonable with
respect to subject matter, geographic scope and time period. It is expressly
understood and agreed that although the Holding Company and the Acquiror
consider such covenants to be fair and reasonable, if a judicial
determination is made by a court of competent jurisdiction that the time or
any other restriction contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.14_ is an invalid or
unenforceable restriction against the Holding Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.14_ shall not be
rendered void but shall be deemed amended to apply to such maximum time and to
such maximum extent as such court may judicially determine or indicate to be
enforceable. Alternatively, if any court of competent jurisdiction finds that
any restriction contained in this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, and
such restriction cannot be amended so as to make it enforceable, such finding
shall not affect the enforceability of any of the other restrictions contained
herein, which shall be given full force and effect without regard to such
finding.

 

(f) The Holding Company represents, stipulates and acknowledges on behalf of
itself and its Subsidiaries that: (i) the restrictive covenants contained in
this _Section_ __ _ 5.14_ are a material inducement to the Acquiror to enter
into this Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, for
which the Holding Company will receive a substantial financial benefit, and
(ii) it would impair the goodwill acquired by the Acquiror and reduce the
value of the TMR Group Entities obtained by the Acquiror through the
transactions contemplated hereby if the Holding Company were to breach
its obligations contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.14_.

(g) _Representations and Warranties of the Holding Company_. 

(i) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Holding
Company. Assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the other
parties hereto, this Agreement constitutes, or upon execution and delivery
thereof will constitute, the legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Holding Company, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject
in each case to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, reorganization,
insolvency, moratorium or similar Laws now or hereafter in effect relating to
or affecting creditors rights and remedies generally and subject, as to
enforceability, to the effect of general equitable principles (regardless of
whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law).

 



-59- 

    

(ii) The execution and delivery by the Holding Company of, and
the consummation by the Holding Company of the transactions contemplated by,
this Agreement does not and will not (a) violate or conflict with the
organizational documents of the Holding Company, (b) conflict with or violate
any Law or other Governmental Order applicable to the Holding Company or by
which the Holding Company or any of its respective properties or assets is
bound or subject or (c) result in any breach of, or constitute a default (or
event which, with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default) under, or give to any Person any rights of termination,
acceleration or cancellation of or result in the creation of any Lien (other
than Permitted Liens) on any of the assets or properties of the Holding
Company or any of its Affiliates pursuant to, any material contract to which
the Holding Company or any of its Affiliates is a party or by which any of
them or any of their respective properties or assets is bound or subject,
except, in the case of clauses (b) and (c) of this _Section_ __ _
5.14(g)(i)_, for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults,
terminations, accelerations, cancellations or creations as would
not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, materially
impair or delay the ability of the Holding Company to perform its obligations
under this _Section_ __ _ 5.14_.

 

Section 5.15. _Notification; Cooperation_.

 

(a) From the date hereof through the Closing Date, each of the Parent, on the

representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becoming
untrue or inaccurate or it failing to comply with or satisfy in any respect
any covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement that would result in a failure of a condition set forth in _Section_
__ _ 8.01_, _Section_ __ _ 8.02_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.03_; (v) any
other event that would or would reasonably be expected to result in,

VIII_ not being capable of being fulfilled by the Outside Date; (vi) any
written notice received by such party from a Governmental Authority or third
party seeking to restrain or prohibit the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Transaction Agreements; or (vii) the commencement of any
Action against such party or its Affiliates that would materially and
adversely affect the ability of such party or its Affiliates to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction Agreements. No
notification made pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 5.15_ shall have the
effect of satisfying any condition set forth in _Article VIII_ , nor shall any

of any party to claim or obtain indemnification under this Agreement or
otherwise enforce its rights and remedies under this Agreement.

reserves, funds or provisions for losses, claims, premiums, expenses and other
liabilities for such Large Claim or Disputed Claim calculated in accordance
with IFRS or UK GAAP, as applicable, and the historical reserving practices of

destroy, all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Persons by
or on behalf of Parent or its Affiliates subject to the terms of such
Parent Confidentiality Agreement. At the Closing, Parent or its Affiliates
shall assign to the Acquiror all of their rights under any Parent
Confidentiality Agreement relating to confidentiality obligations of any
Person (and related remedies in the event such Person breaches such
obligations) with respect to any "Confidential Information" (as such term is

has been included in the Closing Tangible Book Value), all UK Group Relief as
the Parent may at its sole discretion direct in writing in respect of any Tax
accounting period of the relevant TMR Group Entity commencing on or before
Closing.

 

(b) The Acquiror hereby undertakes that it shall, and shall ensure that each
TMR Group Entity will (i) not revoke or cancel without written Parent
consent, (ii) use all reasonable endeavors to ensure that full effect is given

given to this _Section_ __ _ 7.08(b)_.

Entity to the Parent or any member of the Parents group for which that TMR
Group Entity has received consideration is denied or revoked, the Acquiror
shall ensure that the TMR Group Entity repays that consideration. To the
extent that the receipt of, or entitlement to, such consideration is taken
into account in the determination of Closing Tangible Book Value, the Parent
shall be obliged to repay that amount of the Purchase Price, and in any such
case the TMR Group Entitys obligation to repay that consideration and the
Parents obligation to repay that amount shall be satisfied as follows: the
Acquiror shall ensure that the TMR Group Entity pays the Acquiror that amount
directly and the Parent shall pay that amount directly to the relevant member
of the Parents group.

Section 7.09. _Other Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the provisions
of _Article X_ shall not apply to any indemnity provided under _Section_ __ _
7.03(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.03(b)_, except for _Section_ __ _ 10.01_
(Survival), _Section_ __ _ 10.05_ (Payment), _Section_ __ _
10.07_ (Exclusive Remedies) and _Section_ __ _ 10.08_ (Additional
Indemnification Provisions), and Parent shall have no liability under _Article

provisions of this _Article VII_ and of _Article X_ , the provisions of this
_Article VII_ shall govern.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, where, as a
result of any Taxes, the payment of an amount in respect of an indemnity under
this _Article VII_ or _Article X_ directly to an Acquiror Indemnified Party
imposes a greater burden on the Parent than the payment of such amount
directly to any TMR Group Entity, the Parent may, subject to the prior written
consent of Acquiror (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), pay that amount directly to such TMR Group Entity.

(c) Any claim for indemnity under this _Article VII_ may be made at no time
later than six (6) months after the expiration of the applicable Tax statute
of limitations with respect to the relevant Taxable period (including all
periods of extension, whether automatic or permissive).

 

(d) For all Tax purposes, the parties hereto shall treat the sale and purchase
of the Shares hereunder as a sale of the Shares by the Parent to the
Acquiror, and the parties hereto shall report the sale and purchase of the
Shares consistently for all Tax purposes. The Acquiror agrees and covenants
that none of the Acquiror or any Affiliate of the Acquiror shall (i) make any
election under Section 338 of the Code (or other similar state, local or

(10%) of the Indemnity Base. For purposes of determining whether the threshold
set forth in clause (iii) of this _Section_ __ _ 10.02(b)_ has been met
or exceeded, any amount paid by the Parent for Losses pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 10.02(a)(i)_ or _(a)(iv)_ , other than any Losses in respect of the

Section 10.04. _Notification of Claims_.

 

(a) A Person that may be entitled to be indemnified under this Agreement (the
" _Indemnified Party_ ") shall promptly notify the party or parties liable
for such indemnification (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing of any
claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought under this _Article X_ ,
including any pending or threatened claim or demand by a third party that the
Indemnified Party has determined has given or could reasonably give rise to a
right of indemnification under this Agreement (including a pending or
threatened claim or demand asserted or unasserted, known or unknown or
accrued or unaccrued, by a third party against the Indemnified Party) (each,
a " _Third Party Claim_ "), describing in reasonable detail the facts and
circumstances (to the extent known based on the then available information)
with respect to the subject matter of such claim or demand; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure to provide such notice shall not release the
Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this _Article X_ except
to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such
failure. The parties agree that (i) in this _Article X_ they intend to shorten
(in the case of the limited survival periods specified in _Section_ __ _
10.01_) and lengthen (in the case of the indefinite survival periods
specified in _Section_ __ _ 10.01_) (as the case may be) the applicable
statute of limitations period with respect to certain claims; (ii) notices for
claims in respect of a breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement (other than a Post-Closing Covenant or a Pre-Closing Covenant) must
be delivered prior to the expiration of any applicable survival
period specified in _Section_ __ _ 10.01_ for such representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement; (iii) notices for claims in respect of a breach of a
Post-Closing Covenant or Pre-Closing Covenant must be delivered prior to the
date that is 60 days after the last day of the effective period of such Post-
Closing Covenant or Pre-Closing Covenant and (iv) any claims for
indemnification for which notice is not timely delivered in accordance with
this _Section_ __ _ 10.04(a)_ shall be expressly barred and are hereby
waived; _provided_ _further_ that, if, prior to such applicable date, a party
hereto shall have notified the other party hereto in accordance with the
requirements of this _Section_ __ _ 10.04(a)_ of a claim for indemnification
under this _Article X_ (whether or not formal legal action shall have been
commenced based upon such claim), such claim shall continue to be subject to
indemnification in accordance with this _Article X_ notwithstanding the
passing of such applicable date.

 

(b) Upon receipt of a notice of a claim for indemnity from an Indemnified
Party pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.04(a)_ in respect of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party may, by notice to the Indemnified Party
delivered within twenty (20) Business Days of the receipt of notice of such
Third Party Claim (and, for the avoidance of doubt, any failure to deliver
any such notice within such time period shall be deemed an election not to
assume any such defense and control), assume the defense and control of any
Third Party Claim, with its own counsel and at its own expense, but shall
allow the Indemnified Party an opportunity to participate in the defense of
such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall bear the reasonable fees,
costs and expenses of one (1) such separate counsel if (i) an actual or
potential conflict of interest makes representation by the same counsel
inappropriate or (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall have authorized the
Indemnified Party to employ separate counsel at the Indemnifying Partys
expense. The Indemnified Party may take any actions reasonably necessary to
defend such Third Party Claim prior to the time that it receives a notice from
the Indemnifying Party as contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence.
The Parent or the Acquiror (as the case may be) shall, and shall cause each of
its Affiliates and Representatives to, cooperate fully with the Indemnifying
Party in the 

 



-77- 

    

 defense of any Third Party Claim, which cooperation shall include
designating a liaison counsel to whom the Indemnifying Party may direct
notices and other communications, and upon the reasonable request of the
Indemnifying Party, use reasonable efforts to make witnesses available, and
provide records and documents. If the Indemnifying Party has assumed the
defense of a Third Party Claim and is in compliance with its obligations under
this  _Section_ __ _ 10.04(b)_ (or if the twenty (20) Business Day period
has not yet elapsed), then the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), consent to a settlement,
compromise or discharge of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any
Third Party Claim, unless such settlement, compromise, discharge or entry of
any judgment does not (1) involve any finding or admission of any violation
of Law or admission of any wrongdoing by any Person, (2) provides solely for
the payment of money, and (3) does not affect any other claims that may be
made against the Indemnified Party in a manner adverse to such Indemnified
Party, and the Indemnifying Party shall (x) pay or cause to be paid all
amounts arising out of such settlement or judgment concurrently with the
effectiveness of such settlement or judgment (unless otherwise provided in
such judgment), (y) not encumber any of the material assets of any Indemnified
Party or agree to any restriction or condition that would apply to or
materially adversely affect any Indemnified Party or the conduct of
any Indemnified Partys business and (z) obtain, as a condition of any
settlement, compromise, discharge, entry of judgment (if applicable), or other
resolution, a complete and unconditional release of, or dismissal with
prejudice of claims against, any Indemnified Party potentially affected by
such Third Party Claim from all matters that were asserted in connection with
such claims and any and all liabilities in respect of such Third Party Claim.
The Indemnified Party shall not settle, compromise or consent to the entry of
any judgment with respect to any claim or demand for which it is seeking
indemnification from the Indemnifying Party or admit to any liability with
respect to such claim or demand without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Article X_
(including _Section_ __ _ 10.02_ and _Section_ __ _ 10.03_), no Indemnifying
Party shall have any liability under this _Article X_ for any Losses arising
out of or in connection with any Third Party Claim that is settled or
compromised by an Indemnified Party without the consent of such Indemnifying
Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(d) In the event any Indemnifying Party receives a notice of a claim for
indemnity from an Indemnified Party pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 10.04(a)_
that does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall notify
the Indemnified Party within twenty (20) Business Days following its receipt
of such notice whether the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the
Indemnified Party under this _Article X_. The Indemnified Party shall
reasonably cooperate with and assist the Indemnifying Party in determining the
validity of any such claim for indemnity by the Indemnified Party.

Section 10.05. _Payment_. In the event a claim or any Action for
indemnification under _Article_ _VII_ or this _Article_ _X_ has been finally
determined, the amount of such final determination shall be paid (a) if the
Indemnified Party is an Acquiror Indemnified Party, by the Parent to the
Indemnified Party and (b) if the Indemnified Party is a Parent Indemnified
Party, by the Acquiror to the Indemnified Party, in each case on demand by
wire

 



-78- 

    

 transfer of immediately available funds to the applicable account designated
by the applicable Indemnified Party. A claim or an Action, and the liability
for and amount of damages therefor, shall be deemed to be " _finally
determined_ " for purposes of this _Article X_ or _Article VII_ (as the case
may be) when the parties hereto have so determined by mutual agreement or, if
disputed, when a final non-appealable Governmental Order has been entered into
with respect to such claim or Action.

 

Section 10.06. _Limitation on Liability_. In no event shall any amount,
description, liability or reserve (x) reflected in the Virtual Data Room, (y)
set forth in (1) the Financial Statements or (2) the Statutory Statements or
(z) otherwise actually or constructively known to Acquiror or any other
Acquiror Indemnified Parties on or prior to the Closing Date, limit,
preclude, or otherwise prevent any indemnification claims pursuant to _Article
VII_ or this _Article X_ (except, in each case, to the extent any such amount,
description, liability, or reserve is disclosed in the Parent Disclosure
Schedule (other than the Financial Statements and Statutory Statements
attached thereto, except to the extent a Financial Statement or Statutory
Statement is specifically referenced in a _Section 3.06(a)_ of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule); _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing exclusion
shall not limit, preclude or prevent any indemnification claims pursuant to
Article VII); _provided_ , _further_ , that an Acquiror Indemnified Party
shall not be entitled to collect on a Loss hereunder to the extent it has
already collected on the same Loss under the Reserve Development Agreement.

 

Section 10.07. _Exclusive Remedies_. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees
that (a) prior to the Closing, other than in the case of intentional breach,
willful misconduct or fraud by the Parent or its Affiliates or
Representatives, the sole and exclusive remedy of the Acquiror for any breach
or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement or any certificate or instrument delivered hereunder shall be, in
the event that each of the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ has not been
satisfied or waived, refusal to close the purchase and sale of the Shares
hereunder; (b) following the Closing, other than in the case of intentional
breach, willful misconduct or fraud, (i) the indemnification provisions of
this _Article X_ and _Article VII_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of
the parties hereto for any breach of the representations or warranties
contained in this Agreement and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, no breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained herein shall give rise to any right on the part of any
party hereto to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; and (c) following the Closing, the indemnification
provisions of this _Article X_ and,  _Article VII_ shall be the sole and
exclusive monetary remedies of the parties hereto for any breach of any Pre-
Closing Covenant or any Post-Closing Covenant, but without prejudice to any
remedies available under any of the other Transaction Agreements and, with
respect to any Post-Closing Covenant, without prejudice to any remedy
available under _Section_ __ _ 11.12_.

 

Section 10.08. _Additional Indemnification Provisions_.

 

(a) The Parent and the Acquiror agree, for themselves and on behalf of their
respective Affiliates and Representatives, that with respect to each
indemnification obligation set forth in this _Article X_ , any Transaction
Agreement or any other document executed or delivered in connection with the
Closing: (i) each such obligation shall be calculated net of any Eligible
Insurance Proceeds, and (ii) in no event shall the Parent have any liability
or obligation to any Acquiror Indemnified Party to the extent that any Loss,
or any portion thereof, for which indemnification is sought hereunder is
specifically reserved for in the Closing Statement.

 



-79- 

    

(b) Any amount payable by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Article X_
shall be paid promptly and payment shall not be delayed pending any
determination of Eligible Insurance Proceeds. In any case where an Indemnified
Party recovers from a third Person any Eligible Insurance Proceeds or any
other amount in respect of any Loss for which an Indemnifying Party has
actually reimbursed it pursuant to this _Article X_ , such Indemnified Party
shall promptly pay over to the Indemnifying Party the amount of such Eligible
Insurance Proceeds, but not in excess of the sum of (i) any amount previously
paid by the Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party in
respect of such claim and (ii) any amount expended by the Indemnifying Party
in pursuing or defending any claim arising out of such matter.

(c) The parties hereto shall treat any indemnification payment made under this
Agreement as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. 

(d) If any portion of Losses to be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party may be
covered, in whole or in part, by third party insurance coverage, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly give notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party
(a " _Notice of Insurance_ "). If the Indemnifying Party so requests within
one hundred and eighty (180) days after receipt of a Notice of Insurance, the
Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to collect (at
the Indemnifying Partys expense) the maximum amount of cash insurance
proceeds thereunder, in which event all such cash proceeds actually
received, net of costs reasonably incurred by the Indemnified Party in
seeking such collection, shall be considered " _Eligible Insurance Proceeds_."

 

(e) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the same Loss may be subject
to indemnification under more than one subsection of  _Section_ __ _
10.02(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 10.03(a)_, respectively; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall an Indemnified Party be entitled to duplicative
recoveries for the same underlying Loss under this _Article X_ , _Section_ __
_ 7.03_ or under any Transaction Agreement.

(f) For purposes of _Article VII_ and this _Article X_ , in respect of the
representations and warranties set forth in _Article III_ or _Article IV_
herein, any and all "Company Material Adverse Effect", "Acquiror Material
Adverse Effect", "material adverse effect", "materiality" and similar
exceptions and qualifiers and any similar thresholds set forth in such
representations and warranties shall be disregarded (or, in the case of
"Company Material Adverse Effect," be read as "adverse effect") for purposes
of determining whether any such representation or warranty has been breached
or determining the amount of Losses resulting therefrom.

 

(g) In determining the amount of the payment necessary to indemnify any party
against, or reimburse any party for, Losses with respect to
each indemnification obligation set forth in this _Article X_ , the amount of
such Losses shall be (i) reduced by any Tax benefit actually realized and
utilized over the amount of any Tax detriment actually suffered, determined on
a "with and without" basis (the " _Net Tax Benefit_ ") by Indemnified Party
(or any Affiliate

 



-80- 

    

 thereof), as the result of sustaining or paying such Losses (including as
the result of facts or circumstances due to which the Indemnified Party
sustained or paid such Losses) in the taxable year during which such Losses
are sustained and (ii) grossed up for any Taxes deducted at source from any
payment to the Indemnified Party (or any Affiliate thereof) or payable by the
Indemnified Party (or any Affiliate thereof) in respect of the receipt of
such payment. If any Net Tax Benefits are realized by the Indemnified Party,
as the result of sustaining or paying such Losses (including as the result of
facts or circumstances due to which the Indemnified Party sustained or
paid such Losses), after the payment in respect of such Losses was made
(without offset therefor), the Indemnified Party shall repay the amount of
such Net Tax Benefits as and when realized.

 

Section 10.09. _Mitigation_. Each of the parties hereto agrees to take
reasonable steps as required under applicable Law to mitigate its respective
Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event or condition which would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that are indemnifiable
hereunder.

 

Section 10.10. _Reserves_. Subject to the proviso in the following sentence,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in the other
Transaction Agreements, the Acquiror acknowledges and agrees that none of the
Parent or its Affiliates or their respective Representatives makes any
representation or warranty (express or implied), and nothing contained
herein or in any other Transaction Agreements or any other agreement,
document or instrument to be delivered in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements or such other
agreement, document or instrument is intended or shall be construed to be a
representation or warranty (express or implied) of the Parent or its
Affiliates or their respective Representatives, for any purpose of this
Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements or any other agreement, document
or instrument to be delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements or such other agreement,
document or instrument, with respect to (a) the adequacy or sufficiency of
the reserves of any of the Reinsurance Entities, (b) the effect of the
adequacy or sufficiency of the reserves of any of the Reinsurance Entities on
any "line item" or asset, liability or equity amount or (c) the future
experience or profitability arising from the Business or that the reserves
held by the Reinsurance Entities or the assets supporting such reserves have
been or will be adequate or sufficient for the purposes for which they were
established or that the reinsurance recoverables taken into account in
determining the amount of such reserves will be collectible. The Acquiror
further acknowledges and agrees that no fact, condition, development or issue
relating to the adequacy or sufficiency of the reserves of any of the
Reinsurance Entities may be used, directly or indirectly, to demonstrate or
support the breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement, any other Transaction Agreements or any other
agreement, document or instrument to be delivered in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements
or such other agreement, document or instrument; _provided_ , _however_ , that
this  _Section_ __ _ 10.10_ shall not prevent a claim for a breach of any
representation or warranty made in _Section_ __ _ 3.06(g)_ or any claim under
the Reserve Development Agreement or TPC Agreement.

B-1

    

_Exhibit C_

 

Form Of Opinion



     | A. |

The Acquiror is incorporated as an exempted company limited by shares and
existing under the laws of Bermuda and is a separate legal entity. The
Acquiror is in good standing with the Registrar of Companies of Bermuda. 

---|---|--- 



     | B. |

The Acquiror has the requisite capacity and power to enter into, execute and
deliver the Documents to which it is a party and to perform its obligations
under them. The performance by the Acquiror of its obligations under the Stock
Purcahse Agreement will not violate the memorandum of association or bye laws
of the Acquiror nor any applicable law, regulation, order or decree in
Bermuda. 

---|---|--- 



     | C. |

The issuance of RenRe Shares to be delivered to the Parent has been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Acquiror.
When duly issued and paid for pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of
the Stock Purchase Agreement and the resolutions the RenRe Shares will be
validly issued, fully paid, non-assessable shares of the Acquiror. 

---|---|--- 



     | D. |

No consent, approval, licence or authorisation is required from any
governmental, judicial or public body or authority in Bermuda in connection
with the issue or listing of the RenRe Shares. 

---|---|--- 



     | E. |

The choice of the law of the State of New York as the governing law of the
Stock Purchase Agreement is a valid choice of law and would be recognised and
given effect to in any action brought before a court of competent jurisdiction
in Bermuda, except for those laws (i) which such court considers to be
procedural in nature; (ii) which are revenue or penal laws or (iii) the
application of which would be inconsistent with public policy, as such term is
interpreted under the laws of Bermuda. The submission in the Stock Purchase
Agreement to the jurisdiction of the New York Courts is valid and binding
upon the Acquiror. 

---|---|--- 



     | F. |

A final and conclusive judgment of a competent foreign court (other than a
court of jurisdiction to which the Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act
1958 applies, and it does not apply to the courts of New York) against the
Acquiror based upon the Stock Purchase Agreement under which a sum of money is
payable (not being a sum payable in respect of taxes or other charges of a
like nature, in respect of a fine or other penalty, or in respect of multiple
damages as defined in the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1981) may be the
subject of enforcement proceedings in the Supreme Court of Bermuda under the
common law doctrine of obligation by action on the debt evidenced by the
judgment of such competent foreign court. A final opinion as to the
availability of this remedy should be sought when the facts surrounding the
foreign courts judgment are known, but, on general principles, we would
expect such proceedings to be successful provided that: 

---|---|--- 
 



C-1

         | (a) |

the court which gave the judgment was competent to hear the action in
accordance with private international law principles as applied in Bermuda;
and 

---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

the judgment is not contrary to public policy in Bermuda, has not been
obtained by fraud or in proceedings contrary to natural justice and is not
based on an error in Bermuda law. 

---|---|--- 

Enforcement of such a judgment against assets in Bermuda may involve the
conversion of the judgment debt into Bermuda dollars, but the Bermuda Monetary
Authority has indicated that its present policy is to give the consents
necessary to enable recovery in the currency of the obligation.

 

For the purposes of the above, the term "good standing" means that the
Acquiror has received Certificate of Compliance from the Registrar of
Companies.

agreement, upon the request of any party, pre-hearing discovery may be
conducted as the panel shall determine in its sole discretion to be in the
interest of fairness, full disclosure, and a prompt hearing, decision and
award by the panel. The panel shall be the final judge of the procedures of
the panel, the conduct of the arbitration of the rules of evidence, the rules
