iii  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of October 7, 2012 (this " _Agreement_
"), by and between NBT Bancorp Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Buyer_ "), and
Alliance Financial Corporation, a New York corporation (f/k/a Cortland First
Financial Corporation) (the " _Company_ ").

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Buyer and the Company have
determined that it is in the best interests of their respective corporations
and shareholders to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the strategic

Buyer, with Buyer being the surviving corporation and continuing its
corporate existence under the laws of the State of Delaware (the " _Merger_
");

WHEREAS, as a condition to the willingness of Buyer to enter into this
Agreement, the Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of
the Company has entered into a Voting Agreement with Buyer dated as of the
date hereof (the " _Voting Agreement_ "), substantially in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit A,_ pursuant to which such shareholder has agreed, among
other things, to vote his shares of the Companys common stock, par value
$1.00 per share (the " _Company Common Stock_ "), in favor of the approval of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Voting Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, after the Effective Time of the Merger, on a date selected by Buyer,
Alliance Bank, N.A. (the " _Company Bank_ ") will merge with and into NBT

WHEREAS, the parties intend the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within

reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code; and

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,

hereby, the parties agree as follows:

1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ ") and the
New York Business Corporation Law (the " _NYBCL_ "), and in reliance upon the
representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein, at the Effective
Time, the Company shall merge with and into Buyer, the separate corporate
existence of the Company shall cease and Buyer shall survive and continue its
corporate existence under its Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and the
laws of the State of Delaware (Buyer, as the surviving corporation in the
Merger, being sometimes referred to herein as the " _Surviving Corporation_
"). 1.2 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, as promptly as practicable after
all of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ shall have been satisfied
or, if permissible, waived by the party entitled to the benefit of the same,
Buyer and the Company shall (a) execute and file with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger in a form reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer and the Company, in accordance with the DGCL, and (b)
execute and file with the Department of State of the State of New York a

in accordance with the terms hereof (the " _Baseline Closing Date_ "), (b) at
the election of Buyer, on the last Business Day of the month in which the
Baseline Closing Date occurs or (c) if the Baseline Closing Date occurs
in the second half of a fiscal quarter of Buyer, at the election of Buyer, on
the last Business Day of such fiscal quarter (such day hereinafter referred to
as the " _Closing Date_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Closing may
take place at such other place, time or date as may be mutually agreed upon
in writing by Buyer and the Company.

1.5  _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. The Certificate of
Incorporation of Buyer, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until

1.6 _Directors of the Surviving Corporation_. The directors of Buyer
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the
Surviving Corporation, each of whom shall serve in accordance with the

shall expand the size of its Board of Directors by three (3) seats in
connection with the Merger and designate Jack H. Webb and two (2) other
members of the Company Board to be named after the date hereof and prior to
the Effective Time, each of whom meets the qualifications for directors set
forth in the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and is mutually agreed upon
by Buyer and the Company, to serve on the Board of Directors of the Surviving
Corporation (the " _Company Director Designees_ "). The Company Director
Designees shall be appointed to the Board of Directors of the Surviving
Corporation in a manner such that the classes of the Board of

 



2  Directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be as nearly equal in number as
possible. The Company Director Designees shall also be appointed to the Board
of Directors of the Buyer Bank in accordance with the Bylaws of the Buyer
Bank and effective immediately following the Effective Time.

1.7 _Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The officers of Buyer
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

1.8 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a
"reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement
shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and
361 of the Code.

1.9 _Bank Merger_.

(a) As soon as practicable after consummation of the Merger (or on such later
date as Buyer shall specify), the Company Bank shall be merged with and into
the Buyer Bank (the " _Bank Merger_ "). The Buyer Bank shall be the surviving

later date as Buyer shall specify), Buyer shall cause the Buyer Bank, and the
Company shall cause the Company Bank, to enter into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger providing for the Bank Merger (the " _Bank Merger Agreement_ "). The
Bank Merger Agreement shall be in a form to be specified by Buyer and
reasonably approved by the Company (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed).

1.10 _Additional Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, Buyer
shall consider or be advised that any further deeds, documents, assignments or
assurances in law or any other acts are necessary or desirable to (a) vest,
perfect or confirm, or record or otherwise, in Buyer its right, title or
interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of the
Company, or (b) otherwise carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the
Company and its officers and directors shall be deemed to have granted to
Buyer an irrevocable power of attorney to execute and deliver, in such
official corporate capacities, all such deeds, assignments or assurances in
law or any other acts as are necessary or desirable to (x) vest, perfect or
confirm, of record or otherwise, in Buyer its right, title or interest in, to
or under any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company or (y)
otherwise carry out the purposes of this Agreement, and the officers and
directors of Buyer are authorized in the name of the Company or otherwise to

ARTICLE II

MERGER CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

 

2.1 _Merger Consideration_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at
the Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Buyer, the Company, any shareholder of the Company or
any shareholder of Buyer:

 



3 (a) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Buyer (" _Buyer
Common Stock_ ") that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (together with the associated stock purchase rights which are
attached to, and trade with, the Buyer Common Stock) shall remain outstanding
following the Effective Time and shall be unchanged by the Merger.

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock held as Treasury Stock immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired at the Effective
Time without any conversion thereof, and no payment shall be made with respect
thereto.

(c) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Treasury Stock) shall become and be
converted into, as provided in and subject to the limitations set forth in
this Agreement, the right to receive 2.1779 shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ")
of Buyer Common Stock (together with the associated stock purchase rights
which are attached to, and trade with, the Buyer Common Stock) (the " _Merger
Consideration_ ").

2.2 _Rights as Shareholders; Stock Transfers_. All shares of Company Common
Stock, when converted as provided in _Section 2.1(c)_, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") previously evidencing
such shares shall thereafter represent only the right to receive for each such
share of Company Common Stock, the Merger Consideration and, if applicable,
any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock in accordance
with _Section 2.3_. At the Effective Time, holders of Company Common Stock
shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, shareholders of the Company,
other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock as provided under this _Article
II_. After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of shares of Company Common Stock, other than
transfers of Company Common Stock that have occurred prior to the Effective
Time.

2.3 _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no
fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock and no certificates or scrip therefor,
or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the Merger. In lieu
thereof, Buyer shall pay to each holder of a fractional share of Buyer Common
Stock an amount of cash (without interest) determined by multiplying the
fractional share interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled by
the average of the daily closing prices during the regular session of Buyer
Common Stock on The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (" _NASDAQ_ ") (as reported in
_The Wall Street Journal_ or, if not reported therein, in another
authoritative source) for the five (5) consecutive trading days ending on the
third Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date, rounded to the
nearest whole cent.

2.4 _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(a) At or before the Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of
Certificates, (i) Buyer shall cause to be delivered to a bank or trust
company designated by Buyer and reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "), for exchange in accordance with this _Article II_,
certificates representing the shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable pursuant

 



4  to this _Article II_ (" _New Certificates_ ") and (ii) Buyer shall deliver,
or shall cause to be delivered, to the Exchange Agent an aggregate amount of
cash sufficient to pay the estimated amount of cash to be paid in lieu of
fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock (such New Certificates and cash
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

 

(b) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, and provided that
the Company has delivered, or caused to be delivered, to the Exchange Agent
all information which is necessary for the Exchange Agent to perform its
obligations as specified herein, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder
of record of a Certificate or Certificates a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration into
which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate or
Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to _Section 2.1_ and _Section
2.3_ of this Agreement. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate for exchange
and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed
letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a New
Certificate representing that number of shares of Buyer Common Stock to which
such former holder of Company Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant
to this Agreement and (ii) a check representing the amount of cash (if any)
payable in lieu of a fractional share of Buyer Common Stock which such former
holder has the right to receive in respect of the Certificate surrendered
pursuant to this Agreement, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section
2.4(b)_, each Certificate (other than Certificates representing Treasury
Stock) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration provided in
_Section 2.1_ and _Section 2.3_ and any unpaid dividends and distributions
thereon as provided in _Section 2.4(c)_. No interest shall be paid or accrued
on (x) any cash in lieu of fractional shares or (y) any such unpaid dividends
and distributions payable to holders of Certificates.

(c) No dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time with respect to Buyer Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such
Certificate in accordance with this _Section 2.4_. After the surrender of a
Certificate in accordance with this _Section 2.4_, the record holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions,
without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with
respect to shares of Buyer Common Stock represented by such Certificate.

(d) The Exchange Agent and Buyer, as the case may be, shall not be obligated
to deliver a New Certificate or New Certificates representing shares of Buyer
Common Stock (or any cash in lieu of fractional shares) to which a holder of
Company Common Stock would otherwise be entitled as a result of the Merger
until such holder surrenders the Certificate or Certificates representing the
shares of Company Common Stock for exchange as provided in this  _Section
2.4_, or an appropriate affidavit of loss and indemnity agreement and/or a
bond in an amount as may be required in each case by Buyer. If any New
Certificates evidencing shares of Buyer Common Stock are to be issued in a
name other than that in which the Certificate evidencing Company Common Stock
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a

 



5  condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall
be properly endorsed or accompanied by an executed form of assignment separate
from the Certificate and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the
Person requesting such exchange pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or
other tax required by reason of the issuance of a New Certificate for shares
of Buyer Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of
the Certificate surrendered or otherwise establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of the Company for six (6) months after the Effective Time (as
well as any interest or proceeds from any investment thereof) shall be
delivered by the Exchange Agent to Buyer. Any shareholders of the Company who
have not theretofore complied with _Section 2.4(b)_ shall thereafter look
only to the Surviving Corporation for the Merger Consideration deliverable in
respect of each share of Company Common Stock such shareholder holds as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case without any interest
thereon. If outstanding Certificates for shares of Company Common Stock are
not surrendered or the payment for them is not claimed prior to the date on
which such shares of Buyer Common Stock or cash would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any governmental unit or agency, the unclaimed items
shall, to the extent permitted by abandoned property and any other applicable
law, become the property of Buyer (and to the extent not in its possession
shall be delivered to it), free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled to such property. Neither the Exchange Agent nor
any party to this Agreement shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock represented by any Certificate for any consideration paid to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws. Buyer and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the stock
transfer books of the Company to establish the identity of those Persons
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration specified in this Agreement,
which books shall be conclusive with respect thereto. In the event of a
dispute with respect to ownership of any shares of Company Common Stock
represented by any Certificate, Buyer and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled
to deposit any Merger Consideration represented thereby in escrow with an
independent third party and thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims
thereto.

(f) Buyer (through the Exchange Agent, if applicable) shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as
Buyer is required to deduct and withhold under applicable law. Any amounts so
deducted and withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by Buyer.

2.5 _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. In the event Buyer or the Company changes (or
establishes a record date for changing) the number of, or provides for the
exchange of, shares of Buyer Common Stock or Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock split, stock
dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, or similar transaction with
respect to the outstanding Buyer Common Stock or Company Common Stock and the
record date therefor shall be prior to the Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio
shall be proportionately and appropriately adjusted; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, for the avoidance of doubt, no such adjustment shall be made with regard
to the Buyer Common Stock if (a) Buyer issues additional shares of Buyer
Common Stock and receives consideration for such shares in a bona

 



6  fide third party transaction, (b) Buyer issues additional shares of Buyer
Common Stock under its Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or (c) Buyer issues
employee or director stock grants or similar equity awards or shares of Buyer
Common Stock upon the exercise or settlement thereof.

Company Common Stock granted under the Companys 2010 Restricted Stock Plan
and 1998 Long Term Incentive Compensation Plan (collectively, the "
_Restricted Stock Plans_ ") shall vest in full so as to no longer be subject
to any forfeiture or vesting requirements pursuant to the terms of the
Restricted Stock Plans, and all such shares of Company Common Stock shall be
considered outstanding shares for all purposes of this Agreement, including,
without limitation, for purposes of the right to receive the Merger
Consideration with respect thereto. The Company Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee thereof administering the Restricted Stock Plans) shall adopt
such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to effect the
foregoing.

2.7 _Deferred Compensation Plans_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take such action as is necessary with respect to any stock-based
deferred compensation plans of the Company to provide that, without any action
on the part of Buyer, the Company or any participant in such plan, as of the
Effective Time, all amounts held in participant accounts and denominated in
Company Common Stock (" _Company Deferred Stock Units_ ") shall be converted
into rights with respect to a number of shares of Buyer Common Stock that is
equal to the number of Company Deferred Stock Units immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded to the nearest whole
share). Effective as of the date of this Agreement, the Company shall not
issue any shares of Company Common Stock or sell any shares of Company Common
Stock held in treasury pursuant to any stock-based deferred compensation plan.

2.8 _Dividend Reinvestment Plan_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall suspend purchases of Company Common Stock under the Companys dividend
reinvestment plan (the " _DRIP_ ") and take such action as is necessary to
terminate the DRIP and distribute all shares of Company Common Stock and the
value of all cash held in participants plan accounts in accordance with the
terms of the DRIP. Prior to the Effective Time, in no event shall the Company
issue any shares of Company Common Stock or sell any shares of Company Common
Stock held in treasury pursuant to the DRIP.

2.9 _Reservation of Right to Revise Structure_. Buyer may at any time change
the method of effecting the business combination contemplated by this
Agreement if and to the extent that it deems such a change to be desirable;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such change shall (a) alter or change the
amount of the consideration to be issued to holders of Company Common Stock as
merger consideration as currently contemplated in this Agreement, (b)
reasonably be expected to materially impede or delay consummation of the
Merger, (c) adversely affect the federal income tax treatment of holders of
Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger, or (d) require submission
to or approval of the Companys shareholders after the plan of merger set
forth in this Agreement has been approved by the Companys shareholders. In
the event that Buyer elects to make such a change, the parties agree
to execute appropriate documents to reflect the change.

(l) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries currently computes its taxable

its Subsidiaries has agreed, or is required, to make any adjustment

adjustment. None of the Company or its Subsidiaries will be required to
include amounts in income, or to exclude items of deduction, in a taxable
period beginning after the Closing Date as a result of a change in method of
accounting occurring prior to the Closing Date. The Company is not and has not
been a United States real property holding company within the meaning of
Section 897(c)(2) of the Code. No property of any of the Company or its
Subsidiaries is "tax exempt use property" within the meaning of Section 168(h)

memoranda and similar documents issued by a Governmental Authority within the
past five (5) years relating to the federal, state, local or foreign Taxes due
from or with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and (iii) any
closing letters or agreements entered into by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with any Governmental Authority within the past five (5) years
with respect to Taxes.

(o) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice of
deficiency or assessment from any Governmental Authority for any amount of Tax
that has not been fully settled or satisfied, and to the Knowledge of the
Company, no such deficiency or assessment is proposed.

(p) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has ever participated in a
"reportable transaction" within the meaning of Section 1.6011-4(b) of the
Treasury Regulations (or any predecessor provision), and each of the Company
and its Subsidiaries has disclosed on its federal income Tax Returns all
positions taken therein that could give rise to a substantial understatement
of income tax within the meaning of Section 6662 or Section 6662A of the Code.

 



16 (q) None of the Company or its Subsidiaries will be required to include any
item of income in, or exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income for
any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a
result of any: (i) closing agreement as described in Section 7121 of the Code
(or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local, or foreign income

from any period ending on or before the Closing Date to any period ending
after the Closing Date.

 

(r) As of the date hereof, the Company is aware of no reason why the Merger

3.14 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) _Schedule 3.14(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true,
complete and correct list of every Employee Program (as defined below) that

determination or approval letter from the IRS with respect to such
qualification, or may rely on an opinion letter issued by the IRS with
respect to a prototype plan adopted in accordance with the requirements for
such reliance, or has time remaining for application to the IRS for a
determination of the qualified status of such Company Employee Program for
any period for which such Company Employee Program would not otherwise be
covered by an IRS determination and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no event
or omission has occurred that would cause any Company Employee Program to lose
such qualification.

(d) Each Company Employee Program is and has been operated in compliance with
applicable laws and regulations and is and has been administered in
accordance with applicable laws and regulations and with its terms. No
litigation or governmental administrative proceeding, audit or other
proceeding (other than those relating to routine claims 

 



17  for benefits) is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
with respect to any Company Employee Program or any fiduciary or service
provider thereof, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, there is no
reasonable basis for any such litigation or proceeding. All payments and/or
contributions required to have been made with respect to all Company Employee
Programs either have been made or have been accrued in accordance with
the terms of the applicable Company Employee Program and applicable law.

(e) No Company Employee Program is a single employer pension plan (within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA) for which the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate could incur liability under Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA or a plan
maintained by more than one employer as described in Section 413(c) of the
Code.

(f) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.14(f)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the Company nor any current ERISA Affiliate maintains or
contributes to, or within the past six (6) years has maintained or contributed
to, any Employee Program that is or was subject to Title IV of ERISA, Section
412 of the Code, Section 302 of ERISA or is a Multiemployer Plan and neither
the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability under Title IV
of ERISA that has not been paid in full.

 

(g) With respect to any Company Employee Program that is subject to Title IV
of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, none of the
following has occurred or existed, nor will any of the following occur or
exist as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement: (i) a
failure to make on a timely basis any contribution (including,
without limitation, any installment) required under Section 302 or 303 of
ERISA or Section 412 of the Code; (ii) the filing of an application for a
waiver described in Section 412(c) of the Code and Section 303 of
ERISA; (iii) a "reportable event" within the meaning of ERISA Section 4043,
for which the notice requirement is not waived by the regulations thereunder;
(iv) an event or condition which presents a material risk of a
plan termination or any other event that may cause the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate to incur liability or have a lien imposed on its assets under Title
IV of ERISA; or (v) "unfunded benefit liabilities" within the meaning of
ERISA Section 4001(a)(18).

(h) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.14(h)_ , neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the shareholder approval of this Agreement, nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby could (either alone
or in conjunction with any other event) (i) result in, or cause the
accelerated vesting payment, funding or delivery of, or increase the amount
or value of, any payment or benefit to any employee, officer, director or
other service provider of the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates; (ii)
limit the right of the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates to amend,
merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any Company Employee
Program or related trust; (iii) result in any "parachute payment" as defined
in Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code (whether or not such payment is considered
to be reasonable compensation for services rendered); or (iv) result in a
requirement to pay any tax "gross-up" or similar "make-whole" payments to any
employee, director or consultant of the Company or an ERISA Affiliate.

(i) No Company Employee Program, individually or collectively, could give rise
to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to Section
162(m) of the Code or any other provision of the Code or any similar foreign
law, as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement alone or
together with any other event. 

 



18 (j) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.14(j)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, none of the Company Employee Programs provides health care or any
other non-pension benefits to any employees after their employment is
terminated (other than as required by Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA
or similar state law) and the Company has never promised to provide such
post-termination benefits.

(k) Each Company Employee Program may be amended, terminated, or otherwise
modified by the Company to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law,
including the elimination of any and all future benefit accruals thereunder
and no employee communications or provision of any Company Employee Program
has failed to effectively reserve the right of the Company or the ERISA
Affiliate to so amend, terminate or otherwise modify such Company Employee
Program. Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has announced
its intention to modify or terminate any Company Employee Program or adopt
any arrangement or program which, once established, would come within the
definition of a Company Employee Program.

 

(l) Since December 31, 2004 and through December 31, 2008, each Company
Employee Program that constitutes in any part a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code (each, a "
_NQDC Plan_ ") has been operated and maintained in accordance with a good
faith, reasonable interpretation of Section 409A of the Code with respect to
amounts deferred (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) after
December 31, 2004. From and after January 1, 2009, each Company NQDC Plan has
been operated and maintained in operational and documentary compliance with
Section 409A of the Code and applicable guidance thereunder. No payment to be
made under any Company Employee Program is, or to the Knowledge of the
Company, will be, subject to the penalties of Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code.

(m) No Company Employee Program is subject to the laws of any jurisdiction
outside the United States.

organizing activity or any similar activity or dispute.

3.16 _Insurance_. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is insured, and
during each of the past three (3) calendar years has been insured, for
reasonable amounts with financially sound and reputable insurance companies

Knowledge of the Company, no such claim has been denied. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries is in breach of or default under any insurance
policy, and there has not occurred any event that, with the lapse of time or
the giving of notice or both, would constitute such a breach or default. The
value of the BOLI set forth on _Schedule 3.16_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule is fairly and accurately reflected on the Companys balance sheet as
of December 31, 2011\.

Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement with any

6.4 _Access; Information_.

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the
exchange of information, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, afford Buyer and

 



47  its officers, employees, counsel, accountants, advisors and other authorized
representatives (collectively, the " _Buyer Representatives_ "), access,
during normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective
Time, to all of its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records
(including, without limitation, work papers of independent auditors), and to
its officers, employees, accountants, counsel or other representatives, and,
during such period, it shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, furnish
promptly to Buyer and the Buyer Representatives (i) a copy of each material

case may be, are not permitted to disclose under applicable law), and (ii) all
other information concerning the business, properties and personnel of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as Buyer or any Buyer Representative may
reasonably request. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access
jeopardizes the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or

judgment or decree. Consistent with the foregoing, the Company agrees to make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under the circumstances in
which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

(a) The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the respective
officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, financial advisors,
attorneys, accountants, consultants, affiliates and other agents of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Company Representatives_ ")
not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, induce or knowingly
encourage, or take any action to facilitate the making of, any inquiry, offer
or proposal which constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal; (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding any Acquisition Proposal or furnish, or otherwise afford access, to
any Person (other than Buyer) any information or data with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to an Acquisition
Proposal; (iii) release any Person from, waive any provisions of, or fail to
enforce any confidentiality agreement or standstill agreement to which the
Company is a party; or (iv) enter into any agreement, agreement in principle
or letter of intent with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or approve or
resolve to approve any Acquisition Proposal or any agreement, agreement in
principle or letter of intent relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Any
violation of the foregoing restrictions by any of the Company
Representatives, whether or not such Company Representative is so authorized
and whether or not such Company Representative is purporting to act on behalf
of the Company or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this
Agreement by the Company. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall, and shall
cause each of the Company Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any and all existing discussions, negotiations, and
communications with any Persons with respect to any existing or potential
Acquisition Proposal.

 



48 For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean
any inquiry, offer or proposal (other than an inquiry, offer or proposal from
Buyer), whether or not in writing, contemplating, relating to, or that could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Transaction. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Acquisition Transaction_ " shall mean (A) any transaction
or series of transactions involving any merger, consolidation,
recapitalization, share exchange, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (B) any
transaction pursuant to which any third party or group acquires or would
acquire (whether through sale, lease or other disposition), directly or
indirectly, any assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries representing, in the aggregate, 15% or more of the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis; (C) any issuance, sale
or other disposition of (including by way of merger, consolidation, share
exchange or any similar transaction) securities (or options, rights or
warrants to purchase or securities convertible into, such securities)
representing 15% or more of the votes attached to the outstanding securities
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (D) any tender offer or exchange
offer that, if consummated, would result in any third party or group
beneficially owning 15% or more of any class of equity securities of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or (E) any transaction which is
similar in form, substance or purpose to any of the foregoing transactions,
or any combination of the foregoing.

(b) Notwithstanding  _Section 6.5(a)_, prior to the date of the Company
Meeting, the Company may take any of the actions described in clause (ii) of
_Section 6.5(a)_ if, but only if, (i) the Company has received a bona fide
unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of
this _Section 6.5_; (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with and having considered the advice of its outside legal
counsel and a nationally recognized, independent financial advisor, that (A)
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior Proposal and (B) it is required to take such actions to comply with
its fiduciary duties to the Companys shareholders under applicable law;
(iii) the Company has provided Buyer with at least three (3) Business Days
prior notice of such determination; and (iv) prior to furnishing or affording
access to any information or data with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal, the Company
receives from such Person a confidentiality agreement with terms no less
favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement. The Company shall promptly provide to Buyer any non-public
information regarding the Company or its Subsidiaries provided to any other
Person which was not previously provided to Buyer, such
additional information to be provided no later than the date of provision of
such information to such other party.

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any bona
fide written proposal (on its most recently amended or modified terms, if
amended or modified) made by a third party to enter into an Acquisition
Transaction on terms that the Company Board determines in its good faith
judgment, after consultation with and having considered the advice of outside
legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation (x)
would, if consummated, result in the acquisition of all, but not less than
all, of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or all, or
substantially all, of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis; (y) would result in a transaction that (A) involves
consideration to the holders of the shares of Company Common Stock that is
more favorable, from a financial point of view, than the consideration to be
paid to the Companys shareholders 

 



49  pursuant to this Agreement, considering, among other things, the nature of
the consideration being offered and any material regulatory approvals or other
risks associated with the timing of the proposed transaction beyond or in
addition to those specifically contemplated hereby, and which proposal is not
conditioned upon obtaining financing and (B) is, in light of the other terms
of such proposal, more favorable to the Companys shareholders than the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (z) is
reasonably likely to be completed on the terms proposed, in each case taking
into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of
the proposal.

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Buyer
in writing if any proposals or offers are received by, any information is
requested from, or any negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated
or continued with, the Company or the Company Representatives, in each case in
connection with any Acquisition Proposal, and such notice shall indicate the
name of the Person initiating such discussions or negotiations or making such
proposal, offer or information request and the material terms and conditions
of any proposals or offers (and, in the case of written materials relating to
such proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or discussion,
providing copies of such materials (including e-mails or other electronic
communications) except to the extent that such materials constitute
confidential information of the party making such offer or proposal under an
effective confidentiality agreement). The Company agrees that it shall keep
Buyer informed, on a reasonably current basis, of the status and terms of any
such proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or discussions
(including any amendments or modifications to such proposal, offer or
request).

(d) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw,
qualify, amend or modify, or propose to withdraw, qualify, amend or modify, in
a manner adverse to Buyer in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including the Merger), the Company Recommendation, fail to
reaffirm the Company Recommendation within five (5) Business Days following a
request by Buyer, or make any statement, filing or release, in connection
with the Company Meeting or otherwise, inconsistent with the Company
Recommendation (it being understood that taking a neutral position or no
position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal shall be considered an
adverse modification of the Company Recommendation); (ii) approve or
recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal; or
(iii) enter into (or cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter
into) any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or
other agreement (A) related to any Acquisition Transaction (other than a
confidentiality agreement entered into in accordance with the provisions of
_Section 6.5(b)_) or (B) requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail
to consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement.

(e) Notwithstanding _Section 6.5(d)_, prior to the date of the Company
Meeting, the Company Board may withdraw, qualify, amend or modify the Company
Recommendation (a " _Company Subsequent Determination_ ") after the fifth
Business Day following Buyers receipt of a notice (the " _Notice of Superior
Proposal_ ") from the Company advising Buyer that the Company Board has
decided that a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that it
received (that did not result from a breach of this _Section 6.5_)
constitutes a Superior Proposal if, but only if, (i) the Company Board has
reasonably determined in good faith, after consultation with and having
considered the advice of outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized

 



50  reputation, that it is required to take such actions to comply with its
fiduciary duties to the Companys shareholders under applicable law, (ii)
during the five (5) Business Day period after receipt of the Notice of
Superior Proposal by Buyer (the " _Notice Period_ "), the Company and the
Company Board shall have cooperated and negotiated in good faith with Buyer to
make such adjustments, modifications or amendments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement as would enable the Company to proceed with the
Company Recommendation without a Company Subsequent Determination; _provided_
, _however_ , that Buyer shall not have any obligation to propose any
adjustments, modifications or amendments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and (iii) at the end of the Notice Period, after taking into account
any such adjusted, modified or amended terms as may have been proposed
by Buyer since its receipt of such Notice of Superior Proposal, the Company
Board has again in good faith made the determination (A) in clause (i) of this
_Section 6.5(e)_ and (B) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes
a Superior Proposal. In the event of any material revisions to the Superior
Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a new Notice of Superior
Proposal to Buyer and again comply with the requirements of this _Section
6.5(e)_, except that the Notice Period shall be reduced to three (3) Business
Days.

(f) Notwithstanding any Company Subsequent Determination, this Agreement
shall be submitted to the Companys shareholders at the Company Meeting for
the purpose of voting on the approval of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger) and nothing contained herein shall
be deemed to relieve the Company of such obligation; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if the Company Board shall have made a Company Subsequent Determination,
then the Company Board may submit this Agreement to the Companys
shareholders without recommendation (although the resolutions adopting this
Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded), in which event the
Company Board may communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to
the Companys shareholders in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or an
appropriate amendment or supplement thereto. In addition to the foregoing, the
Company shall not submit to the vote of its shareholders any Acquisition
Proposal other than the Merger.

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.5_ shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from complying with the Companys obligations required under
Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any such disclosure relating to an Acquisition Proposal (other than a
"stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed a change in the Company
Recommendation unless the Company Board reaffirms the Company Recommendation
in such disclosure.

 

6.6 _Takeover Laws_. No party shall take any action that would cause the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be subject to requirements
imposed by any Takeover Laws, as applicable, and each party shall take all
necessary steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued
exemption of) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from, or if
necessary challenge the validity or applicability of, any applicable Takeover
Laws, as now or hereafter in effect, that purports to apply to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



51 6.7 _Shares Listed_. Prior to the Effective Time, to the extent required by
NASDAQ, Buyer shall file a notice of additional listing of shares with NASDAQ
with respect to the shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued to the holders
of the Company Common Stock in the Merger.

 

6.8 _Regulatory Applications; Filings; Consents_. Buyer and the Company and
their respective Subsidiaries shall cooperate and use their respective
reasonable best efforts (a) to promptly prepare all documentation, effect all
filings and obtain all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all
third parties and Governmental Authorities, including, without limitation,
the Regulatory Approvals and the Bank Merger Approvals, necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, without
limitation, the Merger and the Bank Merger), and (b) to comply with the terms
and conditions of such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Buyer be required to agree to
any prohibition, limitation, or other requirement which would prohibit or
materially limit the ownership or operation by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, of all or any material
portion of the business or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
Buyer or its Subsidiaries, or compel Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries to
dispose of or hold separate all or any material portion of the business or
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries (together, the " _Burdensome Conditions_ "). Provided that the
Company has cooperated as required above, Buyer agrees to file the requisite
applications to be filed by it with the FRB, the OCC and, if necessary, any
other Governmental Authority including Governmental Authorities of the states
in which Buyer, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries operate. Each of
Buyer and the Company shall have the right to review in advance, and to the
extent practicable each will consult with the other, in each case subject to
applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, with respect to, all
material written information submitted to any third party or any Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto agrees to act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each party hereto agrees that it
will consult with the other party hereto with respect to the obtaining of all
material permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties
and Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other
party reasonably apprised of the status of material matters relating to
completion of the transactions contemplated hereby.

6.9 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(a) Buyer agrees that all rights to indemnification and all limitations of
liability existing in favor of any director or officer of the Company or its
Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided in the Companys
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or in the similar governing documents
of the Companys Subsidiaries as in effect as of the date hereof with respect
to matters occurring on or prior to the Effective Time shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6)
years from the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to
indemnification in respect of any claim asserted or made within such period
shall continue until the final disposition of such claim.

 



52 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase an extended
reporting period endorsement under the Companys existing directors and
officers liability insurance coverage for the Companys directors and
officers in a form acceptable to the Company which shall provide such
directors and officers with coverage for six (6) years following the
Effective Time of not less than the existing coverage under, and have other
terms not materially less favorable to, the insured persons than the
directors and officers liability insurance coverage presently maintained by
the Company, so long as the aggregate cost is less than 200% of the annual
premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance (the " _Premium
Limit_ "). In the event that the Premium Limit is insufficient for such
coverage, the Company may enter into an agreement to spend up to that amount
to purchase such lesser coverage as may be obtained with such amount.

(c) In the event Buyer or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer shall
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.9_.

(d) The provisions of this  _Section 6.9_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and to grant third party rights to, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.

 

6.10 _Employees and Benefit Plans_.

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time as determined in the
reasonable discretion of Buyer, Buyer agrees to provide the employees of the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries who remain employed after the Effective
Time (collectively, the " _Company Employees_ ") with at least the types and
levels of employee benefits (including employee contribution levels)
comparable in the aggregate to those maintained by Buyer for similarly-
situated employees of Buyer. Buyer will treat, and cause its applicable
benefit plans to treat, the service of the Company Employees with the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries as service rendered to Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and for
other appropriate benefits including, but not limited to, applicability of
minimum waiting periods for participation (but not for benefit accrual) under
any defined benefit plan (including minimum pension amount) and not for
participation in any retiree health plan or executive supplemental retirement
plan of Buyer or any of Buyers ERISA Affiliates. Without limiting the
foregoing, but subject to the terms and conditions of Buyers health and
similar plans, Buyer shall not treat any employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as a "new" employee for purposes of any exclusions under any
health or similar plan of Buyer for a pre-existing medical condition to the
extent that any such exclusion did not apply under a health or similar plan of
the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
any deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket expenses paid under any of
the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries health plans shall be credited
towards deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket expenses under Buyers
health plans upon delivery to Buyer of appropriate documentation.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Buyer shall
have sole discretion with respect to the determination as to whether or when
to terminate, merge or continue any employee benefit plans and programs of the
Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that

 



53  Buyer shall continue to maintain such plans (other than stock-based or
incentive plans or defined benefit plans) until the employees of the Company
and its Subsidiaries are permitted to participate in Buyers plans in
accordance with _Section 6.10(a)_.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Buyer agrees to cause the Company and
its Subsidiaries to honor and continue to be obligated to perform, in
accordance with their terms (as in effect as of the Effective Time and as
amended to the extent set forth on _Schedule 5.1(d)_ and in this _Section
6.10)_, all contractual rights of current and former employees and directors
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries existing as of the date hereof under
the employment, severance, deferred compensation, change in control,
supplemental retirement plans and split-dollar agreements of the Company and
its Subsidiaries listed in _Schedule 6.10(c)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule. Without limiting the scope of the foregoing, Buyer agrees that
those individuals with employment and/or change of control agreements to
which the Company is a party that are set forth on _Schedule 6.10(c)_ shall
terminate employment immediately following the Effective Time and be entitled
to receive such severance payments as are determined in accordance with a
settlement agreement being entered into concurrently herewith and
substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_.

 

(d) If requested by Buyer, the Company shall terminate its 401(k) plan as of
the day prior to the Effective Time (but contingent upon the occurrence
thereof) and adopt all required compliance amendments pursuant to written
resolutions, the form and substance of which shall be reasonably satisfactory
to Buyer.

(e) Buyer agrees to honor the severance guidelines attached as _Schedule
6.10(e)_ in connection with the termination of employment of any Company
Employee, in such amounts, at such times and upon such conditions as set
forth on said Schedule.

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the parties shall allocate an
aggregate amount of $525,000 (the " _Employee Retention Amount_ ") among
certain employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as shall be determined
by mutual agreement by Buyers Chief Executive Officer and the Companys
Chief Executive Officer (it being understood and agreed that no amounts shall
be allocated to any employee with a severance or change in control agreement
with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries). Each portion of the Employee
Retention Amount that is so allocated will be paid in such amounts, at such
times and upon such conditions as shall be set forth in letter agreements with
each such Company Employee, in such form as mutually agreed upon by Buyer and

and holds other rights to acquire the number of shares of Common Stock,

used herein, the term " _Shares_ " means all shares of Common Stock, whether
such shares of Common Stock are held by the Shareholder on the date of this
Agreement or are subsequently acquired prior to the Expiration Date (as

Merger Agreement that the Shareholder execute and deliver this Agreement; and

 

WHEREAS, all capitalized terms used in this Agreement without definition

consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Shareholder and Buyer agree as
follows:

 

1\. _Agreement to Vote Shares_. The Shareholder agrees that, prior to the
Expiration Date, at any meeting of the shareholders of the Company, or any
adjournment or postponement thereof, or in connection with any written consent
of the shareholders of the Company, with respect to the Merger Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated thereby (including the Merger) or
any Acquisition Proposal, the Shareholder shall:



     | (a) | appear at such meeting or otherwise cause the Shares to be
counted as present thereat for purposes of calculating a quorum; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) |

vote (or cause to be voted), or deliver a written consent (or cause a consent
to be delivered) covering, all of the Shares that such Shareholder shall be
entitled to so vote (i) in favor of adoption and approval of the Merger

in a breach in any material respect of any covenant, representation or
warranty, or any other obligation or agreement of the Company contained in the
Merger Agreement or of the Shareholder contained in this Agreement, or that
would preclude fulfillment of a condition under the Merger Agreement to
the Companys and Buyers respective obligations to consummate the Merger;
and (iii) against any Acquisition Proposal, or any agreement or transaction
that is intended, or could reasonably be expected, to impede, interfere with,
delay, postpone, discourage or adversely affect the consummation of the
Merger or any of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. 
---|--- 

Any such vote shall be cast or consent shall be given in accordance with such
procedures relating thereto so as to ensure that it is duly counted for

Date_ " shall mean the earliest to occur of (a) the Effective Time, (b) such
date and time as the Merger Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Article
VIII thereof, or (c) upon mutual written agreement of the parties hereto to

party shall have any further obligations or liabilities under this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such termination or expiration shall not
relieve any party from liability for any willful breach of this Agreement
prior to the termination or expiration hereof.

3\. _Agreement to Retain Shares_. The Shareholder shall not, except as
contemplated by this Agreement or the Merger Agreement, directly or
indirectly, (a) sell, assign, transfer, or otherwise dispose of (including,

arrangement or understanding with respect to the sale, transfer, assignment
or other disposition of, any Shares, (c) deposit any Shares in a voting trust
or enter into a voting agreement or similar agreement with respect to any

Shareholder contained herein untrue or incorrect or have the effect of
preventing or disabling the Shareholder from performing the Shareholders
obligations under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Shareholder may make (x) transfers of Shares by will or by operation of law,
in which case this Agreement shall bind the transferee, (y) transfers of
Shares in connection with estate and charitable planning purposes, including

Agreement (the Shareholder agrees to promptly notify Buyer in writing of the
nature and amount of any Shares acquired after the date hereof, and such
Shares shall be subject to the foregoing representations and warranties); 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | the Shareholder understands that, at the Effective Time,

and except where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals,
authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or notifications, would not
prevent or delay the performance by the Shareholder of his obligations under
this Agreement in any material respect. 
---|---|--- 
 



3 5\. _Irrevocable Proxy_. Subject to the last sentence of this Section 5,
by execution of this Agreement, the Shareholder does hereby appoint Buyer
with full power of substitution to any Affiliate of Buyer, as the
Shareholders true and lawful attorney and irrevocable proxy, to the full
extent of the Shareholders rights with respect to the Shares, to vote, if
the Shareholder is unable to perform his obligations under this Agreement,
each of such Shares that the Shareholder shall be entitled to so vote with
respect to the matters set forth in Section 1 hereof at any meeting of the
shareholders of the Company, and at any adjournment or postponement thereof,
and in connection with any action of the shareholders of the Company taken by
written consent. The Shareholder intends this proxy to be irrevocable and
coupled with an interest hereafter until the Expiration Date and hereby
revokes any proxy previously granted by the Shareholder with respect to the
Shares. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, this
irrevocable proxy shall automatically terminate upon the Expiration Date of
this Agreement.

6\. _No Solicitation_. From and after the date hereof until the Expiration
Date, the Shareholder, in his capacity as a shareholder of the Company, shall
not, nor shall such Shareholder authorize any advisor or representative of,
such Shareholder or any of his Affiliates, other than the Company in
accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, to (and, to the extent
applicable to the Shareholder, such Shareholder shall use reasonable best
efforts to prevent any of his advisors or representatives or Affiliates, other
than the Company in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, to)
(a) initiate, solicit, induce or knowingly encourage, or take any action to
facilitate the making of, any inquiry, offer or proposal which constitutes, or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (b)
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition
Proposal, or furnish, or otherwise afford access, to any person (other than
Buyer) any information or data with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal, (c) enter into
any agreement, agreement in principle or letter of intent with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal, (d) solicit proxies or become a "participant" in a
"solicitation" (as such terms are defined in Regulation 14A under the Exchange
Act) with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (other than the Merger Agreement)
or otherwise encourage or assist any party in taking or planning any action
that would compete with, restrain or otherwise serve to interfere with or
inhibit the timely consummation of the Merger in accordance with the terms of
the Merger Agreement, (e) initiate a shareholders vote or action by consent
of the Companys shareholders with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, or (f)
except by reason of this Agreement, become a member of a "group" (as such term
is used in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) with respect to any voting
securities of the Company that takes any action in support of an Acquisition
Proposal.

7.  _Specific Enforcement_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement was not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof or was otherwise breached. It is accordingly
agreed that the parties shall be entitled to specific relief hereunder,
including, without limitation, an injunction or injunctions to prevent and
enjoin breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in any state or federal court
in any competent jurisdiction, in addition to any other remedy to which they
may be entitled at law or in equity. Any requirements for the securing or
posting of any bond with respect to any such remedy are hereby waived. 

 



4 8\. _No Waivers_. No waivers of any breach of this Agreement extended by Buyer
to the Shareholder shall be construed as a waiver of any rights or remedies
of Buyer with respect to any other shareholder of the Company who has executed
an agreement substantially in the form of this Agreement with respect to
Shares beneficially owned by such shareholder or with respect to any
subsequent breach of the Shareholder or any other such shareholder of the
Company. No waiver of any provisions hereof by either party shall be deemed a
waiver of any other provisions hereof by any such party, nor shall any such
waiver be deemed a continuing waiver of any provision hereof by such party.

9.  _Capacity as Shareholder_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the covenants and agreements set forth herein shall not prevent the
Shareholder (a) from exercising his duties and obligations as a director of
the Company or otherwise taking any action, subject to the applicable
provisions of the Merger Agreement, while acting in such capacity as a
director of the Company, or (b) if the Shareholder is serving as a trustee or
fiduciary of any ERISA plan or trust, from exercising his duties and
obligations as a trustee or fiduciary of such ERISA plan or trust. The
Shareholder is executing this Agreement solely in his capacity as a
shareholder of the Company.

 

10\. _Entire Agreement; Amendments_. This Agreement supersedes all prior
agreements, written or oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and contains the entire agreement among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended,
supplemented or modified, and no provisions hereof may be modified or
waived, except by an instrument in writing signed by each party hereto.

11\. _Further Assurances_. From time to time and without additional
consideration, the Shareholder shall execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, such additional transfers, assignments, endorsements,
proxies, consents and other instruments, and shall take such further actions,
as Buyer may reasonably request for the purpose of carrying out and
furthering the intent of this Agreement.

12\. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
determined to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule
of law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to

acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby
are fulfilled to the extent possible.

13\. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original but all of which

only and shall not affect the construction or interpretation of this
Agreement.

 



5 15\. _Public Disclosure_. The Shareholder shall not issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other public announcement (to the extent
not previously issued or made in accordance with the Merger Agreement) with
respect to this Agreement, the Merger Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, without the prior
consent of Buyer. The Shareholder hereby permits Buyer to publish and disclose
in any document and/or schedule filed by Buyer with the Securities and
Exchange Commission such Shareholders identity and ownership of Shares and
the nature of such Shareholders commitments and obligations pursuant to this
Agreement.

16.  _Assignment_. This Agreement may not be assigned by any party hereto
without the prior written consent of the other party hereto; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may assign its rights
and obligations under this Agreement to any Subsidiary wholly owned by it.
All of the covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement shall be
binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the respective parties and their
permitted successors, assigns, heirs, executors, administrators and other
legal representatives, as the case may be.

17\. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the
State of Delaware, without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of
laws thereof (except to the extent that mandatory provisions of the New York
Business Corporation Law are applicable). The parties hereto hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally consent to and submit to the jurisdiction of
the Delaware Court of Chancery, New Castle County, or if that court does not
have jurisdiction, a federal court sitting in the State of Delaware (the "
_Delaware Courts_ ") for any litigation arising out of or relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, waive any objection to the
laying of venue of any such litigation in the Delaware Courts and agree not

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

This Settlement Agreement (the " _Agreement_ ") is entered into as of October
7, 2012 by and among [ ] (the " _Executive_ "), NBT Bancorp Inc., a
Delaware corporation (" _Buyer_ "), Alliance Financial Corporation, a New
York corporation (" _Seller_ "), and Alliance Bank, N.A., a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Seller (" _Seller Bank_ ").

 

WITNESSETH:

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Buyer and Seller
are entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 7, 2012
(the " _Merger Agreement_ "), and all capitalized terms not defined herein
shall have the meaning set forth in the Merger Agreement; and

WHEREAS, Buyer, Seller, Seller Bank and the Executive desire to enter into
this Agreement, which shall supersede, except as set forth in _Section 4_
hereof, the Employment Agreement by and among Seller, Seller Bank and the
Executive dated January 26, 2010 (the " _Employment Agreement_ "), effective
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, and in lieu of any
rights and payments under the Employment Agreement, the Executive shall be
entitled to the rights and payments set forth herein (which for the avoidance
of doubt the parties agree shall be the rights and payments to which the
Executive is entitled in the event of a "Termination" in anticipation of, or
within 24 months after, a "Change in Control" (as such terms are defined in
the Employment Agreement) as contemplated by Section 4(a) of the Employment
Agreement).

 

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and other good and valuable
consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged,
the Executive, Buyer, Seller, and Seller Bank agree as follows:

1\. _Severance Amounts_.

 

1.1 _Employment Agreement Amount_. On the eighth day following the Closing
Date, provided the Executive has not revoked the releases contained and
referenced in _Section 2_ hereof and that the Executive remained employed
with the Seller and Seller Bank to an including the Closing Date, Buyer shall,
or shall cause an affiliate to, pay to the Executive in a lump-sum an amount
equal to the total of $[ ], in full satisfaction of the payment
obligations of Seller and Seller Bank under Section 4(a)(i) and (ii) of the
Employment Agreement, less applicable tax withholdings (the total of such
sum, the " _Employment Agreement Amount_ "), and subject to the limitations
set forth in Section 4(b) of the Employment Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the eighth day following the Closing Date is not a business
day, such payment shall be due on the next following business day. In
addition, Seller Bank shall transfer to the Executive the legal title to the
automobile owned by Seller Bank and used by the Executive immediately prior
to the Closing Date at no cost to the Executive (but subject to applicable
withholding taxes) with such transfer to be effective as of the Closing Date.

The parties hereby agree that the Employment Agreement Amount as determined in
the manner provided under this _Section 1.1_ is final and binding on all
parties and shall not be subject to further adjustment, and that
notwithstanding anything above to the  contrary, the Employment Agreement Amount shall not be paid until the
waiting period described in _Section 1.2_ below has passed if such waiting
period is required by applicable law. In consideration of the payment of the
Employment Agreement Amount and the other provisions of this Agreement, the
Executive, Buyer, Seller and Seller Bank hereby agree that effective
immediately following the Effective Time of the Merger, the Executive agrees
that the full payment of the Employment Agreement Amount, together with
satisfaction by Buyer of the other obligations set forth in this Agreement,
shall be in complete satisfaction of all rights to payments or benefits due
to Executive under the Employment Agreement or any other severance program.

1.2 _409A Compliance_. The Executive and Buyer acknowledge that the
Executives employment with Seller and/or Seller Bank will be terminated in
connection with the Merger, effective immediately upon the Effective Time of
the Merger, and that such termination will be a "separation from service"
(within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations
thereunder) as an employee of Seller and Seller Bank. Anything in this
Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if at the time of the
Executives "separation from service," Buyer determines that the Executive is
a "specified employee" within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the
Code, then to the extent the Employment Agreement Amount would be
considered deferred compensation otherwise subject to the 20 percent
additional tax imposed pursuant to Section 409A(a) of the Code as a result of
the application of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, such payment shall
not be payable until the date that is the earlier of (A) six months and one
day after the Executives separation from service, or (B) the Executives
death. The intent of the parties is that payments and benefits under this
Agreement either be exempt from or comply with Code Section 409A and the
regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder and, accordingly, to the
maximum extent permitted, this Agreement shall be interpreted to be in
compliance therewith. In no event whatsoever shall Buyer or its affiliates be
liable for any additional tax, interest or penalty that may be imposed on
Executive by Section 409A of the Code or damages for failing to comply with
Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall any payment under this Agreement
that constitutes "deferred compensation" for purposes of Section 409A of the
Code be subject to offset, counterclaim or recoupment by any other amount
payable to Executive unless otherwise permitted by Code Section 409A. Buyer,
Seller and Seller Bank make no representation or warranty and shall have no
liability to the Executive or any other person if any provisions of this
Agreement are determined to constitute deferred compensation subject to
Section 409A of the Code but do not satisfy an exemption from, or the
conditions of, such Section.

2\. _Releases_.

2.1 _Release Upon Execution_. In consideration of Buyers agreement to pay
(or to cause to be paid) to the Executive the Employment Agreement Amount and,
subject to the payment of the foregoing specified dollar amounts, all as

sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged by the Executive, the Executive,
for himself and for his heirs, successors and assigns, does hereby release

entities or assigns, and their respective current and former directors,

Section 4 hereof, (i) render services to charitable organizations, (ii) manage
his personal investments in compliance with any limits or policies of the
Corporation, and (iii) with the prior permission of the Chief Executive

the Corporation to serve as a member of such Board. Executive shall be elected
to the eligible class of directors that has the longest remaining term as of
the time of such election. Executive shall also be appointed to the Board of
Directors of NBT Bank, N.A. in accordance with the bylaws of such bank and
effective as promptly as practicable following the Commencement Date.
Executive will be compensated for his service on such Boards of Directors in
accordance with the applicable director compensation programs in effect from
time to time, which Executive acknowledges currently provide that employee
directors do not receive any board fees for service.

2\. _Termination of Prior Agreement; Term of Employment_.

(a) As of the Commencement Date, the Prior Agreement shall terminate and be of
no further force and effect except for Sections 2(h), 6 and 10-16 thereof or
as otherwise expressly set forth below; _provided_ , _however_ , that this
Agreement shall be null and void if the Commencement Date does not occur.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in consideration for Executives willingness
to enter into this Agreement and subject to the execution of a release of
claims in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ , within seven
(7) business days following the Commencement Date, the Corporation shall pay
to Executive in a lump sum an amount equal to one million nine hundred eleven
thousand six hundred thirty-one dollars ($1,911,631.00) representing the
aggregate amount which Executive would have been entitled to receive in the
event of a "Termination" of Executives Employment following a "Change of
Control" (as such terms are defined in the Prior Agreement) pursuant to
Section 4(a)(i) and (ii) of the Prior Agreement (such payment shall be
subject to the provisions of Section 4(b) of the Prior Agreement).

(b) The term of this Agreement (" _Term of Employment_ ") shall be the period
commencing on the Commencement Date and continuing until the Termination Date,
which shall mean the earliest to occur of:

 

(i) the first anniversary of the Commencement Date;

(ii) the death of Executive;

(iii) Executives inability to perform his duties hereunder, by reason of any
medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to
result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less
than twelve (12) months;

 

(iv) the discharge of Executive by the Corporation "for cause," which shall
mean one or more of the following:

 

(A) any willful or gross misconduct by Executive with respect to the business
and affairs of the Corporation or any subsidiary bank of the Corporation, or
with respect to any of its affiliates for which Executive is assigned material
responsibilities or duties;

 



2 (B) the conviction of Executive of a felony (after the earlier of
the expiration of any applicable appeal period without perfection of an
appeal by Executive or the denial of any appeal as to which no further appeal
or review is available to Executive) whether or not committed in the course of
his employment by the Corporation;

(C) Executives willful neglect, failure, or refusal to carry out his duties
hereunder in a reasonable manner (other than any such failure resulting from
disability or death or from termination by Executive for Good Reason, as
hereinafter defined) after a written demand for substantial performance is
delivered to Executive that specifically identifies the manner in which the
Corporation believes that Executive has not substantially performed his duties
and Executive has not resumed substantial performance of his duties on a
continuous basis within thirty (30) days of receiving such demand; or

(D) the breach by Executive of any representation or warranty in Section
5(a) hereof or of any agreement contained in Section 1, 4, or 5(b) hereof,
which breach is material and adverse to the Corporation or any of its
affiliates for which Executive is assigned material responsibilities or
duties;

 

(v) Executives resignation from his position as Executive Vice President,
Strategic Support of the Corporation other than for "Good Reason," as
hereinafter defined;

(vi) the termination of Executives employment by the Corporation "without
cause," which shall be for any reason other than those set forth in
subsections (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of this Section 2(a), at any time,

Executive of duties that are materially inconsistent with those of an
Executive Vice President position other than for "Cause," or a material
decrease in the amount or level of Executives salary or benefits from the
amount or level established in Section 3 hereof. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if there exists (without regard to this sentence) an event or
condition that constitutes Good Reason, the Corporation shall have thirty (30)
days from the date on which Executive gives the written notice thereof to
cure such event or condition (such notice to be given from Executive within
ninety (90) days from the date the event or condition first occurs) and, if
the Corporation does so, such event or condition shall not constitute Good
Reason hereunder. Further, an event or condition shall cease to constitute
Good Reason thirty (30) days after the end of the cure period.

 



3 A Termination Date shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any
provision of this Agreement providing for the payment of any amounts or
benefits upon or following a termination of employment unless such termination
is also a "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") and, for purposes
of any such provision of this Agreement, any references to a "termination,"
"termination of employment" or like terms shall mean a "separation
from service."

(c) In the event that the Term of Employment shall be terminated for any
reason other than that set forth in Section 2(a)(vi) or 2(a)(vii) hereof,
Executive shall, in consideration for Executives covenant not to compete and
other post-termination obligations, be entitled to receive, upon the
occurrence of any such event:

 

(i) any salary payable pursuant to Section 3(a)(i) hereof which shall have
accrued as of the Termination Date; and

 

(ii) such rights as Executive shall have accrued as of the Termination Date
under the terms of any plans or arrangements in which he participates
pursuant to Section 3(b) hereof, any right to reimbursement for expenses
accrued as of the Termination Date payable pursuant to Section 3(j) hereof,
the right to receive legal title to his automobile under Section 3(g) hereof,
and the right to receive the cash equivalent of paid annual leave accrued as
of the Termination Date pursuant to Section 3(f) hereof.

(d) In the event that the Term of Employment shall be terminated for the
reason set forth in Section 2(a)(vi) or 2(a)(vii) hereof, Executive shall be
entitled to receive the following:

 

(i) any salary payable pursuant to Section 3(a)(i) hereof which shall have
accrued as of the Termination Date, and, promptly after the execution and
effective date of a release of claims and separation agreement in
substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ , for the period
commencing on the date immediately following the Termination Date and ending
upon and including the first anniversary of the Commencement Date, salary
payable at the rate established pursuant to Section 3(a)(i) hereof, on a
monthly basis; and

(ii) such rights as Executive may have accrued as of the Termination Date
under the terms of any plans or arrangements in which he participates pursuant
to Section 3(b) hereof, any right to reimbursement for expenses accrued as of
the Termination Date payable pursuant to Section 3(j) hereof, the right to
receive legal title to his automobile under Section 3(g) hereof, and the right
to receive the cash equivalent of paid annual leave accrued as of the
Termination Date pursuant to Section 3(f) hereof.

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, the Corporation
may terminate or suspend the employment of Executive hereunder, as if such
termination were for Cause, to the extent required by any applicable federal
or state statute related to banking, deposit insurance or bank or savings
institution holding companies or by regulations or orders issued by the Office
of the Controller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
or any other state or federal banking regulatory agency having jurisdiction
over the Corporation or any subsidiary bank of the Corporation, and no
payment shall be required to be made to or for the benefit of Executive under
this Agreement to the extent such payment is prohibited by applicable law,
regulation or order issued by a banking agency or a court of competent
jurisdiction; _provided_ that it shall be the Corporations burden to prove
that any such action was so required.

 



4 (f) Notwithstanding any other payment schedule provided herein to the contrary
for amounts payable and/or benefits owed pursuant to Section 2(d) hereof, if
Executive is deemed on the Termination Date a "specified employee" within the
meaning of that term under Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B), then each of the
following shall apply:

(i) With regard to any payment that is considered deferred compensation under
Code Section 409A payable on account of a "separation from service," such
payment shall be made on the date which is the earlier of (A) the expiration
of the six (6)-month period measured from the date of Executives "separation
from service", and (B) the date of Executives death (the " _Delay Period_ ")
to the extent required under Code Section 409A. Upon the expiration of the
Delay Period, all payments delayed pursuant to this Section (whether they
would have otherwise been payable in a single sum or in installments in the
absence of such delay) shall be paid to Executive in a lump sum, and all
remaining payments due under this Agreement shall be paid or provided in
accordance with the normal payment dates specified for them herein; and

(ii) To the extent that any benefits to be provided during the Delay Period
is considered deferred compensation under Code Section 409A provided on
account of a "separation from service," and such benefits are not otherwise
exempt from Code Section 409A, Executive shall pay the cost of such benefits
during the Delay Period, and the Corporation shall reimburse Executive, to
the extent that such costs would otherwise have been paid by the Corporation
or to the extent that such benefits would otherwise have been provided by the
Corporation at no cost to Executive, the Corporations share of the cost of
such benefits upon expiration of the Delay Period, and any remaining benefits
shall be reimbursed or provided by the Corporation in accordance with the
procedures specified herein.

 

(g) If any portion of the amounts payable to, or the value to be received by,
Executive under this Agreement constitutes an "excess parachute payment"
within the meaning of Code Sections 280G and 4999, then such amounts payable
to or to be received by Executive pursuant to this Agreement shall be reduced
to the extent necessary to eliminate the application of Code Sections 280G
and 4999.

(h) To the extent that severance payments or benefits pursuant to this
Agreement are conditioned upon the execution and delivery by Executive of a
release of claims, Executive shall forfeit all rights to such payments and
benefits unless such release is signed and delivered (and no longer subject to
revocation, if applicable) within sixty (60) days following the date of
Executives Termination Date. If the foregoing release is executed and
delivered and no longer subject to revocation as provided in the preceding
sentence, payments or benefits shall commence upon the first
scheduled payment date immediately after the date the release is executed and
no longer subject to revocation (the " _Release Effective Date_ "). The first
such cash payment shall include payment of all amounts that otherwise would
have been due prior to the Release Effective Date under the terms of this
Agreement applied as though such payments commenced immediately upon
Executives Termination Date, and any payments made thereafter shall continue
as provided herein. The delayed benefits shall in any event expire at the
time such benefits would have expired had such benefits commenced immediately
following Executives Termination Date.

 



5 (i) For purposes of Code Section 409A, Executives right to receive
any installment payment pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as a
right to receive a series of separate and distinct payments.

3\. _Compensation_. For the services to be performed by Executive for the
Corporation and its affiliates under this Agreement, Executive shall be
compensated in the following manner:

 

(a) _Salary_. During the Term of Employment:

(i) The Corporation shall pay Executive a salary, which, on an annualized
basis, shall be at the rate of three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000)
commencing on the Commencement Date. Salary shall be payable in accordance
with the normal payroll practices of the Corporation with respect to executive
personnel as presently in effect or as they may be modified by the Corporation
from time to time.

 

(ii) Executive shall be eligible to receive a performance bonus for calendar
year 2013, which such bonus shall be based upon the target amount and the
performance targets set forth on the attached _Schedule I_ ; _provided_ that
the minimum amount of such bonus for calendar year 2013 shall be $180,000. The
Compensation Committee of the Corporations Board of Directors shall
determine whether the performance targets have been achieved and the actual
amount of such bonus payable to Executive, which determination shall be final

Corporation on December 31, 2013. Such bonus shall be paid in January 2014 in
accordance with the Corporations customary practices.

 

(b) _Employee Benefit Plans or Arrangements_. During the Term of Employment,
Executive shall be entitled to participate in all employee benefit plans of
the Corporation, as presently in effect as of the Commencement Date or as they
may be modified by the Corporation from time to time, under such terms as may
be applicable to officers of Executives rank employed by the Corporation or
its affiliates and subject to the eligibility requirements set forth therein,
including, without limitation, plans providing retirement benefits, medical
insurance, disability insurance, and accidental death or dismemberment
insurance (but excluding any life insurance or any defined benefit plans);
_provided_ that there be no duplication of such benefits as are provided under
any other provision of this Agreement or the SERP or the Split Dollar

the terms and conditions of the Corporations health and welfare plans, the
Corporation shall not treat Executive as a "new" employee for purposes of any
exclusions under any such plan of the Corporation for a pre-existing medical
condition to the extent that any such exclusion did not apply under a health
or similar plan of Seller and its subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Commencement Date, and any deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket expenses
paid by

 



6  Executive under any of Sellers or any of its subsidiaries health plans

Date. In accordance with the terms of the SERP, Executive will continue to
accrue a benefit under the SERP during the Term of Employment. The parties
agree to amend the SERP to provide that "Final Average Compensation" for

month period ending on the Commencement Date.

 

(d) _Split Dollar Agreement_. Reference is made to the Split Dollar Agreement,
dated January 27, 2009, by and between Executive and the Seller Bank (the "
_Split Dollar Agreement_ "), which the parties agree will remain in full force
and effect following the Commencement Date. The parties agree to amend the
Split Dollar Agreement to provide that Executives employment with the

Dollar Agreement and shall not trigger a "Termination of Employment" as
defined therein.

 

(e) _Equity Awards_. Executive will be entitled to receive a restricted stock
unit award of 5,000 shares of the Corporations common stock under the
Corporations Omnibus Incentive Plan, with a vesting schedule that takes into
account his expected term of employment. Such award shall be made to Executive
no later than December 31, 2013 in accordance with the Corporations
customary practices, but subject to Executives continued employment with the
Corporation as of the date of grant.

(f) _Vacation and Sick Leave_. During the Term of Employment, Executive shall
be entitled to paid annual vacation periods and sick leave in accordance with
the policies of the Corporation applicable to officers of Executives rank
employed by the Corporation or its affiliates and as in effect as of the
Commencement Date or as may be modified by the Corporation from time to time
and as may be applicable to officers of Executives rank employed by the
Corporation or its affiliates.

(g) _Automobile_. During the Term of Employment, Executive shall be entitled
to the use of the automobile owned by Seller and used by Executive immediately
prior to the Commencement Date. Executive shall be responsible for all
expenses of ownership and use of any such automobile (other than insurance and
costs for any major repairs to such automobile, which will be paid by the
Corporation through the Termination Date), subject to reimbursement of
expenses for business use in accordance with Section 3(j). Upon the
Termination Date, the Corporation shall transfer to Executive the legal title
to such Seller-owned automobile at no cost (but subject to any applicable
withholding taxes).

(h) _Club Dues_. During the Term of Employment, Executive shall be reimbursed
for dues and assessments incurred in relation to Executives memberships at
Onondaga Golf and Country Club and the Century Club of Syracuse. Executive
shall be responsible for any income taxes associated with the personal use of
such club memberships.

 



7 (i) _Withholding_. All compensation to be paid to Executive hereunder shall be
subject to applicable federal, state, and local taxes and all and other
required withholdings. Executive hereby acknowledges and agrees that he is
responsible for all taxes in connection with any benefits, fringe benefits, or
perquisites provided under this Agreement and he is not entitled to any tax
"gross up" payments.

(j) _Expenses_. During the Term of Employment, Executive shall be reimbursed
for reasonable travel and other expenses incurred or paid by Executive in
connection with the performance of his services under this Agreement, upon
presentation of expense statements or vouchers or such other supporting
information as may from time to time be requested by the Corporation, in
accordance with such policies of the Corporation as are in effect as of the
Commencement Date and as may be modified by the Corporation from time to
time, under such terms as may be applicable to officers of Executives rank
employed by the Corporation or its affiliates. All expenses or other
reimbursements under this Agreement shall be made on or prior to the last day
of the taxable year following the taxable year in which such expenses were
incurred by Executive ( _provided_ that if any such reimbursements constitute
taxable income to Executive, such reimbursements shall be paid no later than
March 15th of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
expenses to be reimbursed were incurred), and no such reimbursement or
expenses eligible for reimbursement in any taxable year shall in any way
affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year.

4\. _Confidential Business Information; Non-Competition_.

 

(a) Executive acknowledges that certain business methods, creative techniques,
and technical data of the Corporation and its affiliates and the like are
deemed by the Corporation to be and are in fact confidential business
information of the Corporation, its subsidiary banks or any of their
affiliates or are entrusted to third parties. Such confidential information
includes but is not limited to procedures, methods, sales relationships
developed while in the service of the Corporation or its affiliates, knowledge
of customers and their requirements, marketing plans, marketing information,
studies, forecasts, and surveys, competitive analyses, mailing and marketing
lists, new business proposals, lists of vendors, consultants, and other
persons who render service or provide material to the Corporation or its
subsidiary banks or their affiliates, and compositions, ideas, plans, and
methods belonging to or related to the affairs of the Corporation or its
subsidiary banks or their affiliates (collectively, " _Confidential
Information_ "). In this regard, the Corporation asserts proprietary
rights in all of its Confidential Information and that of its affiliates,
except for such information as is clearly in the public domain.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, information that would be generally known or
available to persons skilled in Executives fields shall be considered to be
"clearly in the public domain" for the purposes of the preceding sentence.
Executive acknowledges that in connection with his employment with the
Corporation, Executive has had or may have access to such Confidential
Information, and he agrees that he will not disclose or divulge to any third
party, except as may be required by his duties hereunder, by law, regulation,
or order of a court or government authority, or as directed by
the Corporation, nor shall he use to the detriment of the Corporation or its
affiliates or use in any business or on behalf of any business competitive
with or substantially similar to any business of the Corporation or its
subsidiary banks or their affiliates,

 



8  any Confidential Information obtained during the course of his employment by
the Corporation. In the event that disclosure is required by law, regulation,
or order of a court or government authority, Executive agrees that as soon as
practical and in any event no later than thirty (30) days after receiving
notice that Executive is required to make such disclosure, Executive will
provide notice to the Corporation of such requirement by law, regulation,
order of a court or government authority. This Section 4(a) shall not be
construed as restricting Executive from disclosing such information to the
employees of the Corporation or its subsidiary banks or their affiliates. On
or before the Termination Date, Executive shall promptly deliver to the
Corporation any and all Confidential Information in his possession, whether
tangible, electronic or intangible in form.

 

(b) Executive acknowledges that in the course of employment with the
Corporation (including Seller and Seller Bank prior to the Merger), Executive
has had access to and gained knowledge of the trade secrets and other
Confidential Information of the Corporation, its subsidiary banks, or their
affiliates; has had substantial relationships with the customers of the
Corporation, its subsidiary banks, or their affiliates; and has performed
services of special, unique, and extraordinary value to the Corporation, its
subsidiary banks, or their affiliates. Therefore, Executive agrees that
notwithstanding the termination of his employment pursuant to this Agreement
for any reason, from the Commencement Date until the second anniversary of the
date of termination of Executives service relationship with the Corporation
or any of its subsidiaries (whether as an officer, employee, consultant or
director) (the " _Termination from Service_ "), Executive shall not, directly
or indirectly, on behalf of himself or any other person or entity, without the
written consent of the Corporation:

 

(i) become an officer, employee, consultant, director, or trustee of any
savings bank, savings and loan association, savings and loan holding company,
bank or bank holding company, where such position entails providing services
to such company in any city, town, or county in which the Corporation or its
subsidiary banks or their affiliates has an office, determined as of the
date of Termination from Service, where Executives position or service for
such business is competitive with or otherwise similar to any of Executives
positions or services for the Corporation or its subsidiary banks;

 

(ii) induce or solicit any customer, supplier, or agent of the Corporation,
its subsidiary banks, or their affiliates about whom Executive has gained
Confidential Information or with whom Executive, by virtue of his employment
with the Corporation, has established a relationship or had frequent contact,
to terminate or curtail an existing business or commercial relationship with
the Corporation, its subsidiary banks, or their affiliates;

(iii) induce or solicit any customer or supplier of the Corporation, its
subsidiary banks, or their affiliates about whom Executive has gained
Confidential Information or with whom Executive, by virtue of his employment
with the Corporation, has established a relationship or had frequent contact,
to provide or purchase goods or services similar to the goods or services
provided by it to or purchased by it from the Corporation, its subsidiary
banks, or their affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , that the provisions of
this clause (iii) only apply to those persons or entities who are customers
or suppliers of the Corporation, its subsidiary banks, or

 



9  their affiliates as of the date of Termination from Service or who were
customers of the Corporation, its subsidiary banks, or their affiliates during
the one-year period prior to the date of Termination from Service; or

(iv) solicit, induce, recruit, offer employment to, hire, or take any other
action intended, or that a reasonable person acting in like circumstances
would expect, to have the effect of causing any officer or employee of the
Corporation, its subsidiary banks, or their affiliates, to terminate his or
her employment.

 

(c) Executive acknowledges and agrees that irreparable injury will result to
the Corporation in the event of a breach of any of the provisions of this
Section 4 (the " _Designated Provisions_ ") and that the Corporation will have
no adequate remedy at law with respect thereto. Accordingly, in the event of a
material breach of any Designated Provision, and in addition to any other
legal or equitable remedy the Corporation may have, the Corporation shall be
entitled to the entry of a preliminary and permanent injunction (including,
without limitation, specific performance) by a court of
competent jurisdiction in Chenango County, New York, or elsewhere, to
restrain the violation or breach thereof by Executive, and Executive submits
to the jurisdiction of such court in any such action.

 

(d) It is the desire and intent of the parties that the provisions of this
Section 4 shall be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the laws
and public policies applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is
sought. Accordingly, if any particular provision of this Section 4 shall be
adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be deemed
amended to delete therefrom the portion thus adjudicated to be invalid or
unenforceable, such deletion to apply only with respect to the operation of
such provision in the particular jurisdiction in which such adjudication is
made. In addition, should any court determine that the provisions of this
Section 4 shall be unenforceable with respect to scope, duration, or
geographic area, such court shall be empowered to substitute, to the extent
enforceable, provisions similar hereto or other provisions so as to provide
to the Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the
benefits intended by this Section 4\.

5\. _Representations and Warranties_.

(a) Executive represents and warrants to the Corporation that his execution,
delivery, and performance of this Agreement will not result in or constitute a
breach of or conflict with any term, covenant, condition, or provision of any
commitment, contract, or other agreement or instrument, including, without
limitation, any other employment agreement, to which Executive is or has been
a party.

(b) Executive shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Corporation for,
from, and against any and all losses, claims, suits, damages, expenses, or
liabilities, including court costs and counsel fees, which the Corporation has
incurred or to which the Corporation may become subject, insofar as such
losses, claims, suits, damages, expenses, liabilities, costs, or fees arise
out of or are based upon any failure of any representation or warranty of
Executive in Section 5(a) hereof to be true and correct when made.

payment obligations under Section 2(a) of this Agreement. Any previous
agreements or understandings

 



11  between the parties hereto or between Executive and the Corporation or any
of its affiliates regarding the subject matter hereof, including without
limitation the terms and conditions of employment, compensation, benefits,
retirement, competition following employment, and the like, are merged into
and superseded by this Agreement, except for the SERP and the Split Dollar
Agreement. Neither this Agreement nor any provisions hereof can be modified,
changed, discharged, or terminated except by an instrument in writing signed
by the party against whom any waiver, change, discharge, or termination is
sought.

 

10\. _Illegality; Severability_.

(a) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement
is not intended and shall not be construed to require any payment to Executive
which would violate any federal or state statute or regulation, including
without limitation the "golden parachute payment regulations" of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation codified to Part 359 of title 12, Code of
Federal Regulations.

 

(b) If any provision or provisions of this Agreement shall be held to be
invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: 

(i) the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions of
this Agreement (including, without limitation, each portion of any section of
this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal, or
unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; and

 

(ii) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Agreement
(including, without limitation, each portion of any section of this Agreement
containing any such provisions held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable)
shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the
provision held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable.

 

11\. _409A Compliance_. The intent of the parties is that payments and
benefits under this Agreement either be exempt from or comply with Code
Section 409A and the regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder and,
accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, this Agreement shall be
interpreted to be in compliance therewith. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall any payment under this
Agreement that constitutes "deferred compensation" for purposes of Code
Section 409A be subject to offset, counterclaim or recoupment by any other
amount payable to Executive unless otherwise permitted by Code Section 409A.

12\. _Arbitration_. Subject to the right of each party to seek specific
performance (which right shall not be subject to arbitration), including
without limitation an action pursuant to Section 4(c), if a dispute arises out
of or is in any way related to this Agreement, or the asserted breach
thereof, such dispute shall be referred to arbitration before the American
Arbitration Association (" _AAA_ ") pursuant to the AAAs Employment
Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures (the " _Arbitration Rules_ "). A
dispute subject to the provisions of this section will exist if either party
notifies the other party in writing that a dispute subject to arbitration
exists and states, with reasonable specificity, the issue subject to
arbitration (the " _Arbitration Notice_ ").

 



12  The parties agree that, after the issuance of the Arbitration Notice, the
parties will try in good faith between the date of the issuance of the
Arbitration Notice and the date the dispute is set for arbitration to resolve
the dispute by mediation in accordance with the Arbitration Rules. If the
dispute is not resolved by the date set for arbitration, then any controversy
or claim arising out of this Agreement or the asserted breach hereof shall be
resolved by binding arbitration and judgment upon any award rendered by
arbitrator(s) may be entered in a court having jurisdiction. The arbitrator
shall have the same power to compel the attendance of witnesses and to order
the production of documents or other materials and to enforce discovery as
could be exercised by a United States District Court judge sitting in Chenango
County, New York. In the event of any arbitration, each party shall have a
reasonable right to conduct discovery to the same extent permitted by the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, provided that discovery shall be concluded
within ninety (90) days after the date the matter is set for arbitration. The
arbitrator or arbitrators shall have the power to award reasonable attorneys
fees to the prevailing party. Any provisions in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, this section shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act
and the parties have entered into this Agreement pursuant to such Act.

13\. _Costs of Litigation_. In the event litigation is commenced to enforce
any of the provisions hereof, or to obtain declaratory relief in connection
with any of the provisions hereof, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
recover reasonable attorneys fees. In the event this Agreement is asserted in
any litigation as a defense to any liability, claim, demand, action, cause of
action, or right asserted in such litigation, the party prevailing on the
issue of that defense shall be entitled to recovery of reasonable attorneys
fees.

 

14\. _Affiliation_. A company will be deemed to be "affiliated" with the
Corporation or its subsidiary banks according to the definition of
"Affiliate" set forth in Rule 12b-2 of the General Rules and Regulations under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

15\. _Headings_. The section and subsection headings herein have been inserted
for convenience of reference only and shall in no way modify or restrict any
of the terms or provisions hereof. 

16\. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to constitute an original.
