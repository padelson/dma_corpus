AGREEMENT

  



  

The Parties therefore agree as follows:

  

Article I 
 DEFINITIONS and INTERPRETATIONS

  



  

1.1 _ Certain Definitions_. For all purposes of this
Agreement, the following capitalized terms have the following respective
meanings:

  



  

  

   

 



    



  

(a) "Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement" means a customary
confidentiality agreement containing substantive terms no less restrictive in

Agreement), it being understood that such confidentiality agreement need not
contain any "standstill" or similar provisions or otherwise prohibit the
making of any Acquisition Proposal. If the substantive provisions of such
confidentiality agreement (other than the absence of a "standstill" or
similar provision) are less restrictive in any material respect to the
counterparty than the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, then such
confidentiality agreement will be deemed to be an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement if the Company concurrently amends the
Confidentiality Agreement so as to make the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement as restrictive to the counterparty as the
provisions of such confidentiality agreement.

(ii) any direct or indirect purchase (including by way of a merger,

such transaction.

  



  

(d) "Affiliate" means, with respect to any Person, any other

Person of any matter whatsoever, including (i) any violation of Law or
breach of contract; or (ii) that such information is material or is required
to be referred to or disclosed under this Agreement. Disclosure of any
information or document in the Company Disclosure Letter is not a statement or
admission that it is material or required to be disclosed in the Company
Disclosure Letter. Nothing in the Company Disclosure Letter constitutes an
admission against the Company's interest or represents the Company's legal
position or legal rights on the matter so disclosed. No reference in this
Agreement to dollar amount thresholds will be deemed to be evidence of a

inclusion of any specific item in the Company Disclosure Letter is not
intended to imply that such items are or are not material or are within or
outside of the ordinary course of business. In each case, no Party may use
the fact of the setting of such amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any
such item in the Company Disclosure Letter in any dispute or controversy
between the Parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described
in this Agreement is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement or
whether any obligation, item or matter included in the Company Disclosure
Letter is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement or is within or
outside of the ordinary course of business.

  



  

(v) _No Reliance by Others on Representations._ The representations

Parties and are for the sole benefit of the Parties. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties in
accordance with Section 9.4 without notice or liability to any other Person.
In some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may
represent an allocation among the Parties of risks associated with particular
matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the Parties. Consequently,
Persons other than the Parties may not rely on the representations and
warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of facts or circumstances as
of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

information have been physically or electronically delivered to the relevant

will become the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended in accordance with the applicable provisions of the

2.7 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

  



  

(a) _Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of any of the following securities, the following will occur:

  



  

(i) each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of
Merger Sub that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
will be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share
of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, and each certificate
representing ownership of such shares of common stock of Merger Sub will
thereafter represent ownership of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation;

  



  

(ii) each share of Company Common Stock that is (A) held by
the Company as treasury stock; (B) owned by Parent or Merger Sub; or (C)
owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or Merger
Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "Owned
Company Shares") will be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion
thereof or consideration paid therefor; and

  



  

(iii) each share of Company Common Stock that is issued and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) will be cancelled and
extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an
amount equal to $33.00, without interest thereon (the "Per Share Price"), in

be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
similar change with respect to the Company Common Stock occurring on or after
the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(c) _Statutory Rights of Appraisal_.

  



  

(i) _Dissenting Company Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, all shares of Company Common Stock that
are issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and
held by Company Stockholders who have (A) neither voted in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement nor consented thereto in writing and (B)
properly and validly exercised their statutory rights of appraisal in respect
of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL (the "Dissenting Company Shares") will not be converted into, or
represent the right to receive, the Per Share Price pursuant to this Section
2.7. Such Company Stockholders will be entitled to receive payment of the
appraised value of such Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting Company
Shares held by Company Stockholders who have failed to perfect or who have
effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting
Company Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL will be deemed to have
been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective
Time, the right to receive the Per Share Price, without interest thereon,
upon surrender of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares that formerly
evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in
Section 2.9.

  



  

   

-23- 

 



    



  

(ii) _Notification of Parent of Demands for Appraisal_. The Company

the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company in respect of Dissenting
Company Shares; and (B) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
Legal Proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal pursuant to the DGCL
in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. The Company may not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands
for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demands for payment in
respect of Dissenting Company Shares. For purposes of this Section
2.7(c)(ii),  "participate" means that Parent will be kept apprised of
proposed strategy and other significant decisions with respect to demands for
appraisal pursuant to the DGCL in respect of Dissenting Company Shares (to the
extent that the attorney-client privilege between the Company and its counsel
is not undermined or otherwise affected) and may offer comments or suggestions
with respect to such demands, but Parent will not be afforded any decision-
making power or other authority over such demands except for the payment,
settlement or compromise consent set forth above.

  



  

2.8 _Equity Awards_.

  



  

(a) _Company Stock-Based Awards_.

  



  

(i) _Vested Stock-Based Awards_. At the Effective Time, each
Company Stock-Based Award outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, to the extent then vested in accordance with its terms as in
effect on the date of this Agreement (or that otherwise becomes vested in
connection with or as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in accordance with its terms as in effect on the date of this
Agreement) (each, a "Vested Stock-Based Award"), will, without any action on
the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be
cancelled and converted into and will become a right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the
amount of the Per Share Price (less the purchase price per share, if any, of
such Company Stock-Based Award) by (ii) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock then subject to the then-vested portion of such Company Stock-
Based Award (the "Company Stock-Based Award Consideration").

  



  

   

-24- 

 



    



  

(ii) _Unvested Stock-Based Awards_. At the Effective Time, each
Company Stock-Based Award outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, that is not a Vested Stock-Based Award (an "Unvested Stock-
Based Award"), will, without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company or the holder thereof, be continued and will thereafter confer on
the holder of such Company Stock-Based Award the right to receive an amount,
without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the amount
of the Per Share Price (less the purchase price per share, if any, of such
Company Stock-Based Award) by (ii) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock then subject to the Unvested Stock-Based Award (the "Converted
Stock-Based Award"), which amount will be paid either in cash or in stock of
the Surviving Corporation or a parent corporation thereof, at Parent's
election, and will be payable on the same vesting schedule, and subject to the
same terms and conditions, as the Unvested Stock-Based Award to which it
relates. For the avoidance of doubt, any Unvested Stock-Based Award that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and that had been
subject to performance-based vesting with respect to a performance period
that ended prior to the Effective Time will be continued as described in the
preceding sentence based on the portion of the Unvested Stock-Based Award
actually earned based on performance (other than any Unvested Stock-Based
Award subject to performance-based vesting with respect to a performance
period that would still be in progress as of the Effective Time but for any
change in control-related provisions that would end such performance period
prior to the Effective Time, which Unvested Stock-Based Awards will be
deemed earned in accordance with their terms as in effect on the date
hereof). The payments described in this Section 2.8(a)(ii) will be subject to
withholding for all required Taxes, except that if Parent elects to make
payment of any portion of the Converted Stock-Based Award in stock of the
Surviving Corporation or a parent corporation thereof, then at the election of
the holder of the Converted Stock-Based Award, Parent will satisfy the
minimum statutory amount of any such Taxes required to be withheld
with respect to such portion of the Converted Stock-Based Award by
withholding a number of otherwise deliverable shares having a value equal to
such amount.

  



  

(b) _Company Options_. At the Effective Time, each Company Option
outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
whether or not then vested in accordance with its terms, will, without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof,
accelerate vesting in full and be cancelled and converted into and will become
a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the amount of the Per
Share Price less the exercise price per share of such Company Option, by (ii)
the total number of shares of Company Common Stock then issuable upon
exercise in full of such Company Option (the "Option
Consideration"). Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the
contrary in this Agreement or any other Contract, with respect to any
Company Options for which the exercise price per share of such Company
Options is equal to or greater than the Per Share Price, such Company Options
will be cancelled without any cash payment being made in respect thereof.

  



  

(c) _Payment Procedures_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will
deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Company, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, the aggregate (i) Company Stock-Based Award
Consideration owed to all holders of Company Stock-Based Awards; and (ii)
Option Consideration owed to all holders of Company Options. Not later than
the next regularly scheduled payroll date that is at least two Business Days
following the Closing Date, the applicable holders of Company Stock-Based
Awards and Company Options will receive a payment from the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, through its payroll system or payroll provider, of all
amounts required to be paid to such holders in respect of Company Stock-Based
Awards or Company Options that are cancelled and converted pursuant to
Section 2.8(a)(i) or Section 2.8(b), as applicable. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any payment owed to a holder of Company Stock-Based Awards or
Company Options pursuant to Section 2.8(a) or Section 2.8(b), as applicable,
(A) cannot be made through the Company's or the Surviving Corporation's
payroll system or payroll provider, then the Surviving Corporation will issue
a check for such payment to such holder, which check will be sent to such
holder promptly following the Closing Date, or (B) constitutes deferred
compensation under Code Section 409A, then the timing of such payment will be
made in a manner that is intended to comply with Code Section 409A so as not
to result in adverse tax consequences thereunder for such holder.

  



  

   

-25- 

 



    



  

(d) _Necessary Further Actions_. The Company will take all action
necessary to effect the cancellation, or cancellation and continuation, as
applicable, of Company Stock-Based Awards and Company Options as of the
Effective Time and to give effect to this Section 2.8 (including the
satisfaction of the requirements of Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated under the
Exchange Act) and to cause all Company Stock-Based Awards and Company Options
and all Company Stock Plans and other rights thereunder to terminate as of
the Effective Time. The Company agrees that the awards contemplated by Section
2.8(a)(ii) meet the requirements of a continued award under Section 13(c) of
its 2017 Equity Incentive Plan and are permitted by its 2000 Equity Incentive
Plan.

  



  

(e) _Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. As soon as
practicable following the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective
Time, the Company will take all action that may be necessary to, effective
upon the consummation of the Merger, (A) cause any offering period or
purchase period under the ESPP that otherwise would be in progress as of the
Effective Time to be terminated no later than one Business Day prior to the
date on which the Effective Time occurs; (B) make any adjustments that may be
necessary or advisable to reflect the shortened offering period or purchase
period, but otherwise treat such shortened offering period or purchase period
as a fully effective and completed offering period or purchase period for all
purposes pursuant to the ESPP; (C) cause the exercise (as of no later than
one Business Day prior to the date on which the Effective Time occurs) of
each outstanding purchase right pursuant to the ESPP; (D) provide that no
further offering period or purchase period will commence pursuant to the ESPP
upon or after the date of this Agreement; and (E) provide that no participant
may increase his or her rate of payroll deductions under the ESPP on or after
the date of this Agreement. On such exercise date, the Company will apply the
funds credited as of such date pursuant to the ESPP within each participant's
account to the purchase of whole shares of Company Common Stock in accordance
with the terms of the ESPP and, promptly thereafter, will refund any remaining
amounts credited to each such account to the applicable participant.
Immediately prior to and effective as of the Effective Time (but subject
to the consummation of the Merger), the Company will terminate the ESPP.

  



  

2.9 _Exchange of Certificates_.

  



  

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Closing, Parent will (i) select a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the
payment agent for the Merger (the "Payment Agent"); and (ii) enter into a
payment agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Company, with such Payment Agent.

  



  

   

-26- 

 



    



  

(b) _Exchange Fund_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will
deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds, for payment to the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.7, an amount of cash equal to the
aggregate consideration to which such holders of Company Common Stock become
entitled pursuant to Section 2.7. Until disbursed in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, such cash will be invested by the
Payment Agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in (i)
obligations of or fully guaranteed by the United States or any agency or
instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United
States with a maturity of no more than 30 days; (ii) commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively; or (iii) certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $1,000,000,000 (based on the most recent financial
statements of such bank that are then publicly available) (such cash and any
proceeds thereon, the "Exchange Fund"). To the extent that (A) there are any
losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund; (B) the Exchange
Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Payment Agent
to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.7; or (C) all or
any portion of the Exchange Fund is unavailable for Parent (or the Payment
Agent on behalf of Parent) to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by
Section 2.7 for any reason, then Parent will, or will cause the Surviving
Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the amount of cash in the
Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times fully
available for distribution and maintained at a level sufficient for the
Payment Agent to make the payments contemplated by Section 2.7. Any interest
or other income from investment of the Exchange Fund will be payable to Parent
or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs.

  



  

(c) _Exchange and Payment Procedures_.

  



  

(i) _Certificated Shares_. Promptly following the Effective Time
(and in any event within one Business Day), Parent and the
Surviving Corporation will cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of
record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of a certificate that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company
Shares) (the "Certificates") whose shares of Company Common Stock were
converted into the right to receive the consideration payable in respect
thereof pursuant to Section 2.7, (A) a letter of transmittal in customary
form (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
to the Payment Agent); and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Certificates in exchange for the consideration payable in respect
thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. Upon surrender to the Payment Agent of a
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of a Certificate as provided in
Section 2.11) for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as may be
reasonably required by the Payment Agent in accordance with the terms of such
materials and instructions, the holder of such Certificate will be
entitled to receive in exchange for the number of shares represented by such
Certificate (and Parent will cause the Payment Agent to pay and deliver in
exchange therefor as promptly as practicable) an amount in cash equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (1) the aggregate number of shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such Certificate by (2) the Per Share Price (less
any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof). The Certificate
so surrendered will be cancelled. The Payment Agent will accept Certificates
upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent
may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of any
holder of the Certificates on the amount payable upon the surrender of such
Certificates pursuant to this Section 2.9(c)(i). Until so surrendered, the
Certificates will be deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only
the right to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to
Section 2.7.

  



  

   

-27- 

 



    



  

(ii) _Uncertificated Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, any holder of shares of Company Common Stock held
in book-entry form (the "Uncertificated Shares") will not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Payment
Agent to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to
Section 2.7. In lieu thereof, each holder of record (as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time) of an Uncertificated Share that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented an outstanding share of Company Common Stock
(other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company Shares) whose shares
of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the
consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7 will, upon
receipt of an "agent's message" in customary form (it being understood that
the holders of Uncertificated Shares will be deemed to have surrendered such
Uncertificated Shares upon receipt of an "agent's message" or such other
evidence, if any, as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) at the
Effective Time, be entitled to receive (and Parent will cause the Payment
Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable) an amount in cash equal
to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such holder's transferred Uncertificated
Shares by (B) the Per Share Price (less any applicable withholding Taxes
payable in respect thereof). The Uncertificated Shares so surrendered will be
cancelled. The Payment Agent will accept transferred Uncertificated Shares
upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent
may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of any
holder of the Uncertificated Shares on the amount payable upon the surrender
of such Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this Section 2.9(c)(ii). Until so
surrendered, Uncertificated Shares will be deemed from and after the Effective
Time to evidence only the right to receive the consideration payable in
respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7(a).

  



  

(d) _DTC Payment_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Company will cooperate to establish procedures with the Payment Agent and DTC
with the objective that (i) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m.,
Eastern time, on the Closing Date, then the Payment Agent will transmit to
DTC or its nominees on the Closing Date an amount in cash, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock (other than
Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) held of record by DTC or
such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Per Share
Price (such amount, the "DTC Payment"); and (ii) if the Closing occurs after
11:30 a.m., Eastern time, on the Closing Date, then the Payment Agent will
transmit the DTC Payment to DTC or its nominees on the first Business Day
after the Closing Date.

  



  

   

-28- 

 



    



  

(e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If a transfer of ownership of shares
of Company Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books or
ledger of the Company, or if the consideration payable is to be paid in a name
other than that in which the Certificates surrendered or transferred in
exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company, then the consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.7 may be paid
to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered or transferred is registered in the stock transfer books or
ledger of the Company only if such Certificate is properly endorsed and
otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting
such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) any
transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Price to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate, or established
to the satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) that such
transfer Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable. Payment of the
consideration payable with respect to Uncertificated Shares will only be made
to the Person in whose name such Uncertificated Shares are registered.

  



  

(f) _Escheat_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any other Party will be liable to a Company Stockholder for any
amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares have not been surrendered immediately prior to the date
on which any cash in respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority,
then any such cash in respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share
will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of
Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously
entitled thereto.

  



  

(g) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates
or Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one year after the Effective Time
will be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of shares of Company
Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Merger who have not theretofore surrendered or transferred their Certificates
or Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of Company Common Stock for
exchange pursuant to this Section 2.9 will thereafter look for payment of the
Per Share Price payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), solely as general
creditors thereof, for any claim to the Per Share Price to which such holders
may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.7.

  



  

2.10 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From and
after the Effective Time, (a) all shares of Company Common Stock will no
longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and cease to exist;
and (b) each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares previously
representing any shares of Company Common Stock will cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the consideration payable
therefor in accordance with Section 2.7 (or in the case of Dissenting Company
Shares, the rights pursuant to Section 2.7(c)). The consideration paid in
accordance with the terms of this Article II upon conversion of any shares of
Company Common Stock will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. From and after
the Effective Time, there will be no further registration of transfers on the
records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that
were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other
than transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary settlement
procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they will (subject to compliance with
the exchange procedures of Section 2.9(c)) be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Article II.

  



  

   

-29- 

 



    



  

2.11 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent will
issue in exchange therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the holder thereof, the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant
to Section 2.7. Parent or the Payment Agent may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the payment of such Per Share Price, require the
owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in
such amount as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect
to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  



  

2.12 _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent, the
Company and the Surviving Corporation, or any Subsidiary of Parent, the
Company or the Surviving Corporation, will be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts
as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom pursuant to any
applicable Laws related to Taxes. To the extent that such amounts are (a) so
deducted or withheld and (b) to be timely paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Authority, such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction
and withholding was made.

  



  

2.13 _Future Dividends or Distributions_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with
a record date on or after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered Certificates or Uncertificated Shares.

  



  

2.14 _Necessary Further Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective
Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right,
title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, then the directors and officers of
the Company and Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will
take all such lawful and necessary action.

 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

  



  

With respect to any Section of this Article III, except (a) as disclosed in
the reports, statements and other documents filed by the Company with the SEC
or furnished by the Company to the SEC, in each case pursuant to the Exchange
Act, on or after January 1, 2019 (the "Lookback Date") and prior to the date
of this Agreement (other than any disclosures contained or referenced therein
under the captions "Risk Factors," "Forward-Looking Statements,"
"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" and any other
disclosures contained or referenced therein of information, factors or risks
that are predictive, cautionary or forward-looking in nature) (the "SEC
Reports") (it being (i) understood that any matter disclosed in any SEC
Report will be deemed to be disclosed in a section of the Company
Disclosure Letter only to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on the
face of such disclosure in such SEC Report that it is applicable to such
section of the Company Disclosure Letter; and (ii) acknowledged that nothing
disclosed in the SEC Reports will be deemed to modify or qualify the

-30- 

 



    



  

3.1 _Organization; Good Standing_. The Company (a) is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing pursuant to
the DGCL; and (b) has the requisite corporate power and authority to conduct
its business as it is presently being conducted and to own, lease, license or
operate its properties and assets. The Company is duly qualified to do
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of
its properties and assets owned or leased or the nature of its activities make
such qualification necessary (to the extent that the concept of "good
standing" is applicable in the case of any jurisdiction outside the United
States), except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing
would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made
available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of the Charter and the
Bylaws, each as amended to date. The Company is not in violation of the
Charter or the Bylaws.

  



  

3.2 _Corporate Power; Enforceability_. The Company has the
requisite corporate power and authority to (a) execute and deliver this
Agreement; (b) perform its covenants and obligations under this Agreement;
and (c) subject to receiving the Requisite Stockholder Approval, consummate
the Merger. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the
performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations under this
Agreement, and the consummation of the Merger have each been duly authorized
by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and no
additional corporate actions on the part of the Company are necessary to
authorize (i) the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company;
(ii) the performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations
under this Agreement; or (iii) subject to the receipt of the Requisite
Stockholder Approval, the consummation of the Merger. This Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability (A) may
be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and other similar Laws affecting or relating to creditors' rights
generally; and (B) is subject to general principles of equity.

  



  

3.3 _Company Board Approval; Fairness Opinion; Anti-Takeover Laws_.

  



  

(a) _Company Board Approval_. The Company Board has (i) determined
that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and
declared it advisable, to enter into this Agreement and consummate the Merger
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;
(ii) approved the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and other
obligations in this Agreement, and the consummation of the Merger upon the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement; (iii) directed that adoption
of this Agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of the stockholders of
the Company; and (iv) resolved to recommend that the Company Stockholders vote
in favor of adoption of this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL
(collectively, the "Company Board Recommendation"), which Company Board
Recommendation has not been withdrawn, rescinded or modified in any way as of
the date of this Agreement.

  



  

   

-31- 

 



    



  

(b) _Fairness Opinion_. The Company Board received the oral opinion
(opinion to be confirmed in writing) of the Company Financial Advisor to the
effect that, as of the date of such opinion and based upon and subject to the
various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and
qualifications and limitations set forth therein, the Per Share Price to be
received by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than holders
of Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) pursuant to this
Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such holders (it being
understood and agreed that such opinion is for the benefit of the Company
Board and may not be relied upon by Parent or Merger Sub). The opinion of the
Company Financial Advisor has not been withdrawn, revoked or modified as of
the date of this Agreement. The Company has been authorized by the Company
Financial Advisor to permit the inclusion of such opinion in its entirety and
a discussion of the Company Financial Advisor's analysis in preparing such
opinion in the Proxy Statement, subject to the Company Financial Advisor's
satisfaction with such disclosure.

  



  

(c) _Anti-Takeover Laws_. Assuming that the representations of
Parent and Merger Sub set forth in Section 4.6 are true and correct, the
Company Board has taken all necessary actions so that the restrictions on
business combinations set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL and any other
similar applicable "anti-takeover" Law will not be applicable to the Merger.

  



  

3.4 _Requisite Stockholder Approval_. The affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
entitled to vote to adopt this Agreement (the  "Requisite Stockholder
Approval") is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of Company
Capital Stock that is necessary pursuant to applicable Law, the Charter or
the Bylaws to consummate the Merger.

  



  

3.5 _Non-Contravention_. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and
obligations under this Agreement, and the consummation of the Merger do not
(a) violate or conflict with any provision of the Charter or the Bylaws or the
equivalent organizational or governing documents of any "significant
subsidiary" of the Company (as defined in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X
promulgated by the SEC); (b) violate, conflict with, result in the breach of,
constitute a default (or an event that, with notice or lapse of time or both,
would become a default) pursuant to, result in the termination of, accelerate
the performance required by, or result in a right of termination or
acceleration pursuant to any Material Contract; (c) assuming compliance with
the matters referred to in Section 3.6 and, in the case of the consummation of
the Merger, subject to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, violate
or conflict with any Law applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or by which any of their respective properties or assets are bound; or (d)
result in the creation of any lien (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of
the properties or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except in
the case of each of clauses (b), (c) and (d) for such violations, conflicts,
breaches, defaults, terminations, accelerations or liens that would not have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

3.6 _Requisite Governmental Approvals_. No Consent, authorization
of, filing or registration with, or notification to any Governmental Authority
is required on the part of the Company in connection with the (a) execution
and delivery of this Agreement by the Company; (b) performance by the Company
of its covenants and obligations pursuant to this Agreement; or (c)
consummation of the Merger, except (i) the filing of the Certificate of
Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and such filings
with Governmental Authorities to satisfy the applicable Laws of states in
which the Company and its Subsidiaries are qualified to do business; (ii) such
filings and approvals as may be required by any federal or state securities
Laws, including compliance with any applicable requirements of the Exchange
Act; (iii) compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act and any
applicable foreign Antitrust Laws; and (iv) such other Consents the failure
of which to obtain would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

consists of (i) 1,000,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock; and (ii)

outstanding Company Stock-Based Awards and Company Options. No Company Option

in, the Company (the items in clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v),
collectively with the Company Capital Stock, the  "Company Securities"); (vi)

(d)   _No Other Rights_. The Company is not a party to any

Letter contains a true, correct and complete list of the name and
jurisdiction of organization of each Subsidiary of the Company. Each
Subsidiary of the Company (i) is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing pursuant to the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization (to the

jurisdiction outside the United States); and (ii) has the requisite corporate
power and authority to carry on its respective business as it is presently
being conducted and to own, lease or operate its respective properties and
assets, except where the failure to be in good standing would not have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Each Subsidiary of the Company is duly
qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction
where the character of its properties owned or leased or the nature of its
activities make such qualification necessary (to the extent that the concept
of "good standing" is applicable in the case of any jurisdiction outside the
United States), except where the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has
made available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of the
certificates of incorporation, bylaws and other similar
organizational documents of each "significant subsidiary" (as defined in Rule
1-02(w) of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC) of the Company, each as
amended to date. No Subsidiary of the Company is in violation of its charter,
bylaws or other similar organizational documents, except for such violations
that would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b)   _Capital Stock of Subsidiaries_. All of the outstanding
capital stock of, or other equity or voting interest in, each Subsidiary of
the Company (i) has been duly authorized, validly issued and is fully paid and
nonassessable; and (ii) except for director's qualifying or similar shares,
is owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company, free and clear of all
liens (other than Permitted Liens) and any other restriction (including any
restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital
stock or other equity or voting interest) that would prevent such Subsidiary
from conducting its business as of the Effective Time in substantially the
same manner that such business is conducted on the date of this Agreement.

  



  

(c)   _No Other Interests in Subsidiaries_. There are no
outstanding (i) securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of
capital stock of, or other equity or voting interest in, any Subsidiary of the
Company; (ii) options, warrants or other rights or arrangements obligating
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to acquire or redeem from any
Subsidiary of the Company, or that obligate any Subsidiary of the Company to
issue, any capital stock of, or other equity or voting interest in, or any
securities convertible into or exchangeable for, shares of capital stock of,
or other equity or voting interest in, any Subsidiary of the Company; or
(iii) obligations of any Subsidiary of the Company to grant, extend or enter
into any subscription, warrant, right, convertible or exchangeable security,
or other similar Contract relating to any capital stock of, or other
equity or voting interest (including any voting debt) in, such Subsidiary to
any Person other than the Company or one of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

3.9 _Company SEC Reports_. Since October 26, 2017, the Company has
filed with or furnished to the SEC all forms, reports and documents that have
been required to be filed by it pursuant to applicable Laws prior to the date
of this Agreement (the "Company SEC Reports"). Each Company SEC
Report complied as to form, as of its filing date, or, if amended or
superseded by a subsequent filing made prior to the date of this Agreement,
as of the date of the last such amendment or superseding filing prior to the
date of this Agreement, in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
each as in effect on the date that such Company SEC Report was filed. True,
correct and complete copies of all Company SEC Reports are publicly
available in the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval database
of the SEC. As of its filing date (or, if amended or superseded by a filing
prior to the date of this Agreement, on the date of such amended or superseded
filing), each Company SEC Report did not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. No Subsidiary of the Company is required to
file any forms, reports or documents with the SEC.

3.10 _Company Financial Statements; Internal Controls; Indebtedness_.

disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all
(i) material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or furnishes pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC; and (ii) such material information is accumulated
and communicated to the Company's management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The
Company's management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the
Company's internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2018, and such assessment concluded that such system was
effective. The Company's independent registered public accounting firm has
issued (and not subsequently withdrawn or qualified) an attestation report
concluding that the Company maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2018. Since December 31, 2018,
and through the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of the Company, no
events have occurred such that management would not be able to complete its
assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over
financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, and
conclude, after such assessment, that such system was effective. Since the
Lookback Date, the principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of the Company have each made all certifications required
by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Neither the Company nor its principal executive
officer or principal financial officer has received notice from any
Governmental Authority challenging or questioning the accuracy, completeness,
form or manner of filing of such certifications.

  



  

(c)   _Internal Controls_. The Company has established and
maintains a system of internal accounting controls that are effective in all
material respects in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP, including policies and procedures that (i) require the
maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures of the Company and its
Subsidiaries are being made only in accordance with appropriate
authorizations of the Company's management and the Company Board; and (iii)
provide assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, the
Company's independent registered public accounting firm has identified or
been made aware of (A) any significant deficiency or material weakness (each
as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) in the system of internal
control over financial reporting utilized by the Company and its Subsidiaries
that has not been subsequently remediated; or (B) any fraud that has not been
subsequently remediated that involves the Company's management or other
employees who have a role in the preparation of financial statements or the
internal control over financial reporting utilized by the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

such Intellectual Property to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries and have
agreed to maintain the confidentiality of such Intellectual Property. The
Company and its Subsidiaries have not been a member or promoter of, or

a third party of any source code included in the Company Software (including
any release from escrow of any such source code). The Company or one of its
Subsidiaries has in its possession the source code and related documentation
for the Company Software. To the Knowledge of the Company, since the Lookback

Subsidiaries, the Company or the applicable Subsidiary is in compliance with
all applicable agreements with respect thereto, except for any such non-
compliance that would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

direction has at any time since the Lookback Date, suffered any

in any third-party access to, or acquisition of, any personally identifiable
information stored on such systems.

and (ii) paid, or have reserved in accordance with GAAP for the payment of,
all Taxes that are required to be paid. All income and other material Tax
Returns filed by the Company and each of its Subsidiaries were true and
correct in all material respects. The most recent financial statements

GAAP for all material Taxes accrued but not then payable by the Company and
its Subsidiaries through the date of such financial statements. Since the
date of the Audited Company Balance Sheet, the Company and its Subsidiaries

of state, local or foreign Tax Law) by reason of a change in (or improper use
of a) method of accounting on or prior to the Closing Date; (ii) a "closing
agreement" described in Code Section 7121 (or any corresponding or similar
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law) executed on or before the

Employee Plan has been established, maintained and administered in compliance
in all material respects with its terms and conditions and with the

amounts set forth therein for the purpose of funding a portion of the
aggregate value of the Merger (the "Equity Financing"); and (ii) executed
commitment letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement, among Merger Sub

Financing Letters, the Fee Letters and the terms of the Financing have not

arrangers, bookrunners, lenders or similar parties); and (iii) the respective
commitments contained in the Financing Letters have not been withdrawn,
terminated, repudiated or rescinded in any respect by Parent or Merger Sub
or, to the knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub, any other party thereto, and
no such withdrawal, termination, repudiation or rescission is contemplated by
Parent or Merger Sub or, to the Knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub, any other
party thereto. There are no other Contracts, agreements, side letters or
arrangements to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party that could limit or
impair the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the
Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Letters and any
Fee Letters.

  



  

(c)   _Sufficiency of Financing_. The aggregate amounts
committed pursuant to the Financing Letters, along with the cash on hand at
the Company at Closing, are sufficient (after netting out applicable fees,

(d)   _Validity; No Contrary Expectation_. As of the date of
this Agreement, the Financing Letters and the Fee Letters (each in the forms
delivered by Parent to the Company) are in full force and effect and
constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent, Merger Sub
and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto (including, with
respect to the Equity Commitment Letter, Guarantor), as applicable,
enforceable against Parent, Merger Sub and, to the knowledge of Parent, the
other parties thereto, as applicable, in accordance with their terms, except,
in each case, as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or similar Laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by
general principles of equity. Other than as expressly set forth in the
Financing Letters and the Fee Letters, there are no conditions precedent
related to the funding of the full proceeds of the Financing (including any
"flex" provisions) pursuant to any agreement relating to the Financing to
which Guarantor, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates is
a party. As of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor, to
the knowledge of Parent, any counterparty to the Financing Letters has

representations and warranties in Article III, the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 and the completion of the

circumstance exists that (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
would, or would reasonably be expected to, (i) constitute or result in a
breach or default on the part of any Person under any of the Financing Letters
or the Fee Letters; (ii) constitute or result in a failure to satisfy any of
the terms or conditions set forth in any of the Financing Letters or the Fee
Letters; (iii) make any of the assumptions or any of the statements set forth
in the Financing Letters inaccurate in any material respect; or (iv)
otherwise result in any portion of the Financing not being available. As of
the date of this Agreement, assuming the accuracy in all material respects of
the representations and warranties in Article III, the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 and the completion of the
Marketing Period, Parent has no reason to believe (both before and after
giving effect to any "flex" provisions in the Debt Commitment Letters or the
Fee Letters) that (A) it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term
or condition of the Financing to be satisfied by it, whether or not such
term or condition is contained in the Financing Letters or the Fee Letters;
or (B) the full amounts committed pursuant to the Financing Letters will not
be available as of the Closing if the terms or conditions contained in the
Financing Letters to be satisfied by it are satisfied. As of the date of this
Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub have fully paid, or caused to be fully paid,
all commitment or other fees that are due and payable on or prior to the date
of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of the Financing Letters and the Fee
Letters.

  



  

(e)   _No Exclusive Arrangements_. As of the date of this
Agreement, none of Guarantor, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates has entered into any Contract, arrangement or understanding (i)
awarding any agent, broker, investment banker or financial advisor any
financial advisory role on an exclusive basis in connection with the Merger;
or (ii) prohibiting or seeking to prohibit any bank, investment bank or other
potential provider of debt financing from providing or seeking to
provide debt financing or financial advisory services to any Person in

Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger.

into, or committed or agreed to enter into, any formal or informal
arrangements or other understandings (whether or not binding) with any
stockholder, director, officer, employee or other Affiliate of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (a) relating to (i) this Agreement or the Merger; or

nature than the Per Share Price in respect of such holder's shares of Company
Common Stock; (ii) holder of Company Common Stock has agreed to approve this
Agreement or vote against any Superior Proposal; or (iii) Person other than
Guarantor has agreed to provide, directly or indirectly, an equity investment
to Parent, Merger Sub or the Company to finance any portion of the Merger.

  



  

4.12   _Interests in Competitors_. As of the date of this Agreement,
none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates owns any
interest in any Person that derives a substantial portion of its revenues
from products, services or lines of business within the Company's principal
products, services or lines of business.

an individual to a position on the Company Board; or (iv) any involvement

Subject to Section 5.3(c), on the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company will
(A) cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with, and

"Alternative Acquisition Agreement"); or (vi) authorize or commit to do any
of the foregoing. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company will not be

(c) _Conduct Following the No-Shop Period Start Date_.
Notwithstanding anything to contrary in this Section 5.3, from the No-Shop
Period Start Date until the Company's receipt of the Requisite Stockholder

directly or indirectly through one or more of their Representatives (including
the Company Financial Advisor), following the execution of an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement, (i) participate or engage in discussions or
negotiations with; (ii) furnish any non-public information relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to; (iii) afford access to the business,

Excluded Party or its Representatives or (B) any Person or its
Representatives that has made, renewed or delivered to the Company a written
Acquisition Proposal after the No-Shop Period Start Date that was not
solicited in breach of Section 5.3(b), but only if the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) has determined in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that (1) such Acquisition
Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to
lead to a Superior Proposal and (2) the failure to take the actions
contemplated by this Section 5.3(c) would result in a breach of its fiduciary
duties pursuant to applicable Law. In connection with the foregoing, the
Company will promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours) make available to
Parent any non-public information concerning the Company and its
Subsidiaries that is provided to any such Excluded Party or its
Representatives or such Person or its Representatives that was not
previously made available to Parent. For the avoidance of doubt,
notwithstanding the occurrence of the No-Shop Period Start Date, the
Company may continue to engage in the activities described in Section 5.3(a)
with respect to any Excluded Party, including with respect to any amended
proposal or offer submitted by an Excluded Party following the No-Shop Period
Start Date, and the restrictions in Section 5.3(b) will not apply with

Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent; (B) adopt, approve, endorse,

action or make or fail to make any recommendation or public statement in
connection with a tender or exchange offer, other than a recommendation
against such offer or a "stop, look and listen" communication by the Company
Board (or a committee thereof) to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any substantially similar
communication) (it being understood that the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) may refrain from issuing a recommendation against such
tender or exchange offer until 5:30 p.m., Eastern time, on the 10th Business
Day after the commencement of a tender or exchange offer in connection with
such Acquisition Proposal without such action being considered a violation of
this Section 5.3); or (E) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation
in the Proxy Statement (any action described in clauses (A) through (E), a
"Company Board Recommendation Change"), it being understood that none of (1)
the determination in itself by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) that
an Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a
Superior Proposal or (2) the delivery in itself by the Company to Parent of
any notice contemplated by Section 5.3(e) will constitute a Company Board
Recommendation Change or violate this Section 5.3; or

(ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to

Acquisition Agreement_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder
Approval:

  



  

(i) other than in connection with a written Acquisition Proposal
that constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in
response to an Intervening Event if the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would
result in a breach of its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law if and
only if:

  



  

(1) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at
least five Business Days in advance to the effect that the Company Board (or
a committee thereof) has (A) so determined; and (B) resolved to effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 5.3(e)(i), which
notice will describe the Intervening Event in reasonable detail; and

  



  

(2) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change,
the Company and its Representatives, until 5:00 p.m. at the end of such five
Business Day period, have (A) negotiated with Parent and its Representatives
in good faith (to the extent that Parent requests to negotiate) to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the Company
Board (or a committee thereof) no longer determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the
failure to make a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to such
Intervening Event would result in a breach of its fiduciary duties pursuant
to applicable Law; and (B) permitted Parent and its Representatives to make a
presentation to the Company Board regarding this Agreement and any
adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent that Parent requests to make
such a presentation); or

  



  

(ii) if the Company has received a written Acquisition Proposal
that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has concluded in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a
Superior Proposal, then the Company Board may (A) effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change with respect to such Superior Proposal; or (B) authorize
the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h) to enter
into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal, in each case if and only if:

  



  

   

 | -61-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(1) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside
legal counsel) that the failure to do so would result in a breach of its
fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law;

  



  

(2) the Company and each of its Representatives has complied in
all material respects with its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.3 with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal;

  



  

(3) (i) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at
least five Business Days in advance (the "Notice Period") to the effect that
the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has (A) received a written
Acquisition Proposal that has not been withdrawn; (B) concluded in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel)
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; and (C)
resolved to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change or to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.3(e)(ii) absent any revision to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, which notice will describe the basis for
such Company Board Recommendation Change or termination, including
the identity of the Person or Group making such Acquisition Proposal, the
price and other material terms of such Acquisition Proposal and include
copies of all relevant documents relating to such Acquisition Proposal and
(ii) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change or
termination, the Company and its Representatives, until 5:00 p.m. on the last
day of the Notice Period, have (1) negotiated with Parent and its
Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to
negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a
Superior Proposal; and (2) permitted Parent and its Representatives to make a
presentation to the Company Board regarding this Agreement and any
adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent that Parent requests to make
such a presentation), it being understood that (a) in the event of any
material revision, amendment, update or supplement to such Acquisition
Proposal, the Company will be required to deliver a new written notice to
Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section 5.3(e)(ii)(3)
with respect to such new written notice (with the "Notice Period" in respect
of such new written notice being four Business Days); and (b) at the end of
the Notice Period, the Company Board (or a committee thereof) must have in
good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) reaffirmed its determination that such Acquisition Proposal is a
Superior Proposal; and

  



  

(4) in the event of any termination of this Agreement in order to
cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal,
the Company will have validly terminated this Agreement in accordance with
Section 8.1(h), including paying the Company Termination Fee in accordance
with Section 8.3(b)(iii).

  



  

(f) _Notice to Parent_. On and after the No-Shop Period Start Date,
the Company will promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours from the
receipt thereof) notify Parent in writing if any Acquisition Proposal, or
inquiry from any Person or Group related to making a potential Acquisition
Proposal, is, to the Knowledge of the Company (which, for this purpose, will
be deemed to include each Specified Person and will not be deemed to be only

requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated
or continued with, the Company or any of its Representatives. Such notice
must include (A) the identity of the Person or Group making such proposal,
inquiry, request or offer; and (B) a summary of the material terms and
conditions of such proposal, inquiry, request or offer and, if in writing, a
copy thereof and of all documents or agreements including such proposal.

basis, of the status and terms of any such offers or proposals (including any
updates or amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or
negotiations.

(g) _Permitted Disclosures_. So long as the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) expressly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation
in such disclosure (other than in a customary "stop, look and listen"
communication to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9 promulgated
under the Exchange Act):

  



  

(i) nothing in this Agreement will prohibit the Company or the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) from (A) taking and disclosing to the
Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the

receipt of an Acquisition Proposal; (B) identifies the Person or Group making
such Acquisition Proposal; (C) provides the material terms of such Acquisition
Proposal; or (D) describes the operation of this Agreement with respect
thereto will not, in any case, be deemed to be (1) a withholding,

Company Board (or a committee thereof) to withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify
or modify, the Company Board Recommendation; (2) an adoption, approval or
recommendation with respect to such Acquisition Proposal; or (3) a Company

action taken by a Specified Person that, if taken by the Company, would
constitute a material breach of this Section 5.3 will be deemed to
constitute a material breach by the Company of this Section 5.3.

acknowledge and agree that the restrictions set forth in this Agreement are

promptly as practicable of the receipt of any comments, whether written or
oral, from the SEC and of any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements
to the Proxy Statement, any Other Required Company Filing or any Other
Required Parent Filing, or for additional information, and will supply each
other with copies of all correspondence between it or any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, with respect
to such filings. The Parties will use their respective reasonable best
efforts to resolve all SEC comments, if any, with respect to the Proxy
Statement as promptly as practicable after the receipt thereof.

  



  

(d) _No Amendments to Proxy Statement_. Except in connection with a

(e) _Other Required Company Filings_. If the Company determines
that it is required to file any document other than the Proxy Statement with

the rules of the SEC. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub may file any Other
Required Parent Filing with the SEC without first providing the Company and
its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, and
Parent will give good faith consideration to all reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested by the Company or its counsel.

(g) _Accuracy; Supplied Information_.

  



  

(i) _By the Company_. On the date of filing, the date of mailing

that the Proxy Statement or such Other Required Company Filing is filed with
the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any

all action necessary in accordance with applicable Law, the Charter and the
Bylaws to establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and

(b) _Adjournment of Company Stockholder Meeting_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company will be permitted to
postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting if (i) there are holders
of insufficient shares of the Company Common Stock present or represented by
proxy at the Company Stockholder Meeting to constitute a quorum at the Company
Stockholder Meeting (it being understood that the Company may not postpone or
adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting more than two times pursuant to this
clause (i) without Parent's prior written consent); or (ii) the Company is
required to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting by applicable
Law, order or a request from the SEC. Without the prior written consent of
Parent, the Company Stockholder Meeting will not be postponed or adjourned by

event will the record date of the Company Stockholder Meeting be changed
without Parent's prior written consent, unless required by applicable Law.

the Company Stockholder Meeting even if the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) has effected a Company Board Recommendation Change.

  



  

6.5 _Financing_.

  



  

(a) _No Amendments to Financing Letters_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, other than amendments or modifications to add
additional arrangers, bookrunners, lenders or similar parties, each of Parent
and Merger Sub (without the prior written consent of the Company or as
contemplated by the "flex" provisions included in the Fee Letters) will not
permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any
provision or remedy pursuant to, the Financing Letters if such
amendment, modification or waiver would reasonably be expected to (i) reduce
the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (unless the Equity Financing is
increased by an equivalent amount); (ii) impose new or additional conditions
or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of
the Financing or any other terms to the Financing in a manner that, in each
case, would reasonably be expected to (A) delay or prevent the Closing Date;
or (B) make the timely funding of the Financing on the Closing Date, or the
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing on the Closing Date,
less likely to occur in any respect; or (iii) adversely impact the ability of
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable, to enforce its rights
against the other parties to the Financing Letters or the definitive
agreements with respect thereto. Any reference in this Agreement to (1) the
"Financing" will include the financing contemplated by the Financing
Letters as amended or modified in compliance with this Section 6.5; and (2)
"Equity Commitment Letter," "Debt Commitment Letters," "Fee Letters" or
"Financing Letters" will include such documents as amended or modified in
compliance with this Section 6.5. Parent will not release or consent to the
termination of any Commitments under the Debt Commitment Letters, except for
replacements of the Debt Commitment Letters (x) with alternative
financing commitments pursuant to Section 6.5(d) and (y) that do not violate
the first sentence of this Section 6.5(a).

  



  

   

 | -69-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) _Taking of Necessary Actions_.

  

  



  

(i) _Equity Commitment Letter_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to
take (or cause to be taken) all actions and do (or cause to be done) all
things necessary, proper and advisable to obtain the Equity Financing on the
terms and conditions described in the Equity Commitment Letter, including by
using its reasonable best efforts to (A) maintain in effect the Equity
Commitment Letter in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions
thereof; (B) comply with its obligations under the Equity Commitment Letter;
(C) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to funding that are applicable
to Parent and Merger Sub in the Equity Commitment Letter that are within its
control; (D) consummate the Equity Financing at or prior to the Closing,
including causing the Guarantor to fund the Equity Financing at the
Closing; (E) comply with its obligations pursuant to the Equity Commitment
Letter; and (F) enforce its rights pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letters.

  



  

(ii) _Debt Commitment Letters_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub will use and
will cause their respective officers, employees, advisors and other
Representatives to use their reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in
effect the Debt Commitment Letters in accordance with the terms (including any
"flex" provisions) and subject to the conditions thereof; (ii) negotiate,
execute and deliver definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters on the terms and conditions
(including any "flex" provisions) contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters
or the Fee Letters; (iii) accept (and comply with) to the fullest extent all
"flex" provisions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters or the Fee
Letters and the Debt Financing to the extent that such "flex" provisions are
exercised in accordance with the terms thereof; (iv) satisfy on a timely basis
all conditions to funding that are applicable to and within the control of
Parent and Merger Sub in the Debt Commitment Letters and such definitive
agreements related thereto; (v) upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth
in the Debt Commitment Letters, consummate the Debt Financing at the Closing,
including causing the Financing Sources to fund the Debt Financing at the
Closing so long as all of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section
7.2 (other than those to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at the Closing) have been
satisfied or waived; and (vi) enforce its rights pursuant to the Debt
Commitment Letters. Parent and Merger Sub will fully pay, or cause to be fully
paid, all commitment or other fees arising pursuant to the Debt Commitment
Letters as and when they become due in accordance with the terms of the Debt
Commitment Letters.

  



  

(c) _Information_. Parent will, upon request of the Company, inform
the Company in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange
the Financing, it being understood that nothing in this sentence will require
Parent to disclose any information that is subject to the attorney-client or
work product privilege or the disclosure of which would result in the breach
of any of Parent's confidentiality obligations set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letters (as in effect on the date of this Agreement). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub must give the
Company prompt notice (A) of any breach (or threatened breach) or default (or
any event or circumstance that, with or without notice or lapse of time, or
both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or default) by
any party to the Financing Letters or definitive agreements related to the
Financing; (B) of the receipt by Parent or Merger Sub of any oral or written
notice or communication from any Financing Source with respect to any actual
or potential breach (or threatened breach), default, termination or
repudiation by any party to the Financing Letters or any definitive
agreements related to the Financing of any provisions of the Financing Letters
or such definitive agreements. Parent will promptly provide any information
reasonably requested by the Company relating to any of the circumstances
referred to in the previous sentence after the date that the Company delivers
a written request therefor to Parent.

  



  

   

 | -70-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

  

  



  

(d) _Alternate Debt Financing_. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing provisions, if any portion of the Debt Financing
becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any "flex"
provisions) contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters, then Parent will use
its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event, (i) alternative financing from
alternative sources on terms and conditions not materially less favorable in
the aggregate to Parent and Merger Sub (as determined by Parent in good
faith) than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letters and the Fee
Letters and in an amount at least equal to the Debt Financing or such
unavailable portion thereof, as the case may be (unless the amount of the
Equity Financing has been increased by a corresponding amount) (the "Alternate
Debt Financing"); and (ii) one or more new financing commitment letters with
respect to such Alternate Debt Financing (the "New Debt Commitment Letters"),
which New Debt Commitment Letters will replace the existing Debt Commitment
Letters in whole or in part. Parent will promptly provide a copy of any New
Debt Commitment Letters (and any fee letter in connection therewith,
which may be delivered with the fee amounts, "flex" terms and other
commercially sensitive information redacted in a customary manner so long as
no redaction covers terms that would adversely affect the amount,
conditionality, availability or termination of the Alternate Debt Financing)
to the Company. In the event that any New Debt Commitment Letters are
obtained, (A) any reference in this Agreement to the "Financing Letters,"
"Fee Letters" or the "Debt Commitment Letters" will be deemed to include the
Debt Commitment Letters and Fee Letters, as applicable, to the extent not
superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter at the time in question and any
New Debt Commitment Letters or Fee Letters, as applicable, to the extent
then in effect; and (B) any reference in this Agreement to the "Financing" or
the "Debt Financing" will mean the debt financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters and the Fee Letters as modified pursuant to the foregoing.

  



  

(e) _Enforcement_. Parent and Merger Sub will seek to enforce,
including by bringing a Legal Proceeding for specific performance, the Equity
Commitment Letter if the Company seeks and is granted a decree of specific
performance of the obligation to consummate the Merger after all conditions
to the granting thereof set forth in Section 9.10(b) have been satisfied.
Except as provided in the preceding sentence, neither Parent nor Merger Sub
will be under any obligation, and nothing in this Agreement (including this
Section 6.5(e)) will otherwise require Parent or Merger Sub, to (i) bring any
enforcement action against any source of Equity Financing to enforce its
rights pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter; or (ii) seek the Equity
Financing from any source other than a counterparty to, or in any amount in
excess of that contemplated by, the Equity Commitment Letter.

its and their respective officers, employees, advisors and other

derived from the Company's historical books and records, assisting
Parent with providing information reasonably required in connection with the
preparation of pro forma financial information and pro forma financial

that the Company will not be required to provide any information or
assistance relating to (A) the proposed aggregate amount of debt and equity
financing, together with assumed interest rates, dividends (if any) and fees
and expenses relating to the incurrence of such debt or equity financing; (B)
any post-Closing or pro forma cost savings, synergies, capitalization,
ownership or other pro forma adjustments desired to be incorporated into any
information used in connection with the Debt Financing; or (C) any financial

regarding the business, operations and financial projections thereof) as may
be reasonably requested by Parent to assist in the preparation of a customary
confidential information memorandum or other customary information documents
used in financings of the type contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, will not include (or be deemed to require
the Company to prepare) any (1) pro forma financial statements or

Financing, including any "description of notes"; (3) risk factors relating to

delivery, in which case the Company will be deemed to have complied with this
Section 6.6(a)(v) and the Marketing Period will be deemed to have commenced
as of such date unless Parent in good faith reasonably believes that
the Company has not completed delivery of the Required Financing Information
and, within three Business Days after the delivery of such notice by the
Company, delivers a written notice to the Company to that effect, stating in
good faith the specific items of Required Financing Information the Company

deemed to have been delivered and the Marketing Period to have commenced when
such specific items have been delivered by the Company;

  

  



  

(vi) cooperating with Parent to obtain customary and reasonable
corporate and facilities consents, landlord waivers, non-invasive
environmental assessments, surveys and title insurance as reasonably
requested by Parent in order to comply with the reasonable requirements of
the Financing Sources;

  



  

(vii) delivering notices of prepayment within the time periods
required by the Credit Agreement and obtaining customary payoff letters, lien
terminations and instruments of discharge to be delivered at the Closing, and
giving any other necessary notices, to allow for the payoff, discharge and

Agreement;

  



  

(viii) providing authorization letters to the Financing Sources
authorizing the distribution of information to prospective lenders or
investors and containing a representation to the Financing Sources that the

public information about the Company or its Subsidiaries or securities (except
that the Company will not be required to pay any cost or expenses relating to
rating agency engagement letters);

  



  

   

 | -73-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

  

(ix) taking all corporate and other actions, subject to the
occurrence of the Closing, reasonably requested by Parent to permit the
consummation of the Debt Financing (including, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, distributing the proceeds of the Debt
Financing, if any, obtained by any of the Subsidiaries of the Company to the
Surviving Corporation); and

  



  

(x) promptly furnishing Parent and the Financing Sources at least

applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations.

  



  

(b) _Obligations of the Company_. Nothing in this Section 6.6 or
any other provision of this Agreement will require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to (i) waive or amend any terms of this Agreement or any other
Contract, provide any additional security or guaranties or agree to pay any
fees or reimburse any expenses prior to the Effective Time for which it has
not received prior reimbursement by or on behalf of Parent; (ii) enter into
any definitive agreement prior to the Effective Time; (iii) give any
indemnities in connection with the Debt Financing that are effective prior to
the Effective Time; or (iv) take any action that, in the good faith
determination of the Company, (a) would unreasonably interfere with the
conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or (b) create a
risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries. In addition, (A) no action, liability or obligation of
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives pursuant to any certificate, agreement, arrangement, document
or instrument relating to the Debt Financing (other than customary
representation letters and authorization letters (including with respect to
the presence or absence of material non-public information about the Company
and its Subsidiaries and the accuracy of the information contained in the
disclosure and marketing materials related to the Company and its
Subsidiaries)) will be effective until the Effective Time; (B) neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to take any action
pursuant to any certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or instrument
(other than customary representation letters and authorization letters
(including with respect to the presence or absence of material non-public
information about the Company and its Subsidiaries and the accuracy of the
information contained in the disclosure and marketing materials related to the
Company and its Subsidiaries)) that is not contingent on the occurrence of
the Closing or that must be effective prior to the Effective Time; and (C) any
bank information memoranda required in relation to the Debt Financing will
contain disclosure reflecting the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries as the obligor. Nothing in this Section 6.6 will require (1) any
Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to deliver any
certificate or opinion or take any other action under this Section 6.6 that
could reasonably be expected to result in personal liability to such
Representative; (2) the Company Board (as constituted prior to the Effective
Time) to approve the Financing or Contracts related thereto; (3) the Company
and its Subsidiaries to take any action that would conflict with or violate
its organizational documents, any applicable Laws or result in a violation of
breach of, or default under, any agreement to which the Company or any of it
is Subsidiaries is a party; and (4) the Company and its Subsidiaries to
provide any information (a) the disclosure of which is prohibited or
restricted under applicable Law or any agreement binding on the Company or
its Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement or any agreement binding on
the Company or its Subsidiaries that is entered into after the date of this
Agreement that is not entered into for the purpose of evading the obligations
in this Section 6.6; or (b) where access to such information would (i) give
rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege, work
product doctrine or other privilege applicable to such information; or (ii)
violate or cause a default pursuant to, or give a third Person the right
terminate or accelerate the rights pursuant to, any Contract to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound (it being
understood that in the event that the Company and its Subsidiaries do
not provide any information in reliance on the exclusions in the foregoing
clauses (a) or (b)(i), the Company or such Subsidiary will use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide notice to Parent promptly upon obtaining
knowledge that such information is being withheld and the Company or such
Subsidiary will use reasonable best efforts to communicate, to the extent
permitted, the applicable information or other matter in a way that would not
violate any applicable Law or agreement or result in the waiver of any such
privilege). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
condition set forth in Section 7.2(b), as it applies to the Company's
obligations under Section 6.6(a), will be deemed to be satisfied if the
Company's breach, if any, of its obligations under Section 6.6(a) did not
cause the failure of the Debt Financing to be obtained.

  



  

   

 | -74-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

  



  

(c) _Use of Logos_. The Company consents to the use of its and its
Subsidiaries' logos in connection with the Financing so long as such logos
are used (i) solely in a manner that is not intended to and would not
reasonably be expected to harm or disparage the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; (ii) solely in connection with a description of the Company,
its business and products or the Merger; and (iii) in a manner
consistent with the other terms and conditions that the Company reasonably
imposes.

  



  

(d) _Confidentiality_. All non-public or other confidential
information provided by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives pursuant to this Agreement will be kept
confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except that
Parent and Merger Sub will be permitted to disclose such information to any
Financing Sources or prospective financing sources and other financial
institutions and investors that are or may become parties to or participants
in the Financing and to any underwriters, initial purchasers or placement
agents in connection with the Financing (and, in each case, to their
respective counsel and auditors) so long as such Persons (i) agree to be
bound by the Confidentiality Agreement as if parties thereto; or (ii) are
subject to other customary confidentiality undertakings.

  



  

(e) _Reimbursement_. Promptly upon request by the Company, Parent
will reimburse the Company for any documented and reasonable out-of-pocket
costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by the Company or its
Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries contemplated by this Section 6.6.

  



  

   

 | -75-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(f) _Indemnification_. The Company, its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives will be indemnified and held harmless by Parent
from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs,
expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys' fees), interest,
awards, judgments, penalties and amounts paid in settlement suffered or
incurred by them, except, in each case, to the extent arising from the
willful misconduct, gross negligence, intentional fraud or intentional
misrepresentation of the Company, its Subsidiaries, or their respective
Representatives, in connection with their cooperation in arranging the Debt
Financing pursuant to this Agreement or the provision of information utilized
in connection therewith. Parent's obligations pursuant to Section 6.6(e)
and this Section 6.6(f) are referred to collectively as the "Reimbursement
Obligations."

  



  

  

(g) _No Exclusive Arrangements_. In no event will Guarantor,
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates (which for
this purpose will be deemed to include each direct investor in Parent or
Merger Sub) enter into any Contract (i) awarding any agent, broker,
investment banker or financial advisor any financial advisory role on an
exclusive basis; or (ii) prohibiting or seeking to prohibit any bank,
investment bank or other potential provider of debt or equity financing from
providing or seeking to provide debt or equity financing or financial
advisory services to any Person, in each case in connection with a
transaction relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or in
connection with the Merger.

  



  

(h) _No Financing Condition_. Parent and Merger Sub each
acknowledge and agree that obtaining the Financing is not a condition to
the Closing. Subject to Section 9.10(b)(ii), if the Financing has not been
obtained, Parent and Merger Sub will each continue to be obligated, subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII, to
consummate the Merger.

  



  

6.7 _Anti-Takeover Laws_. Neither Parent nor the Company will (and
each will cause their respective Representatives not to) take any action that
would cause any "takeover" Law to become applicable to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and each of Parent, the Company
and the Company Board will (a) take all actions within their power to ensure
that no "anti-takeover" Law is or becomes applicable to the Merger; and (b)
if any "anti-takeover" Law is or becomes applicable to the Merger, take all
action within their power to ensure that the Merger may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to eliminate or minimize the effect of such Law on the Merger.

  



  

   

 | -76-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

6.8 _Access_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company will, and
will cause its Subsidiaries to, afford Parent and its Representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable advance
notice, to the properties, books and records and personnel of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, except that the Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit
access to any documents or information to the extent that (a) any applicable
Law requires the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such
documents or information; (b) access to such documents or information would
give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege, work
product doctrine or other privilege applicable to such documents or
information; (c) access to a Contract to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound would violate or cause a default
pursuant to, or give a third Person the right terminate or accelerate the
rights pursuant to, such Contract; (d) access would result in the disclosure
of any Trade Secrets of third Persons; or (e) such documents or information
are reasonably pertinent to any adverse Legal Proceeding between the Company
and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent and its Affiliates, on the
other hand (it being understood that if the Company and its Subsidiaries do
not provide any information in reliance on the exclusions in the foregoing
clauses (a) or (b), then the Company or such Subsidiary will use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide notice to Parent promptly upon obtaining
knowledge that such information is being withheld and the Company or such
Subsidiary will use reasonable best efforts to communicate, to the extent
permitted, the applicable information or other matter in a way that would not
prohibit any applicable law or agreement or result in the waiver of any such
privilege). Nothing in this Section 6.8 will be construed to require the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives to
prepare any reports, analyses, appraisals, opinions or other information. Any
investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this Section
6.8 will be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with
the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or create a
risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the Company or its
Subsidiaries. Any access to the properties of the Company and its
Subsidiaries will be subject to the Company's reasonable security measures and
insurance requirements and will not include the right to perform any
"invasive" testing or soil, air or groundwater sampling, including any Phase
I or Phase II environmental assessments. The terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement will apply to any information obtained by Parent or
any of its Representatives in connection with any investigation conducted
pursuant to the access contemplated by this Section 6.8. All requests for
access pursuant to this Section 6.8 must be directed to the Company's
General Counsel or another person designated in writing by the Company.

  

  

  



  

6.9 _Section 16(b) Exemption_. The Company will take all actions
reasonably necessary to cause the Merger, and any dispositions of equity
securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in connection
with the Merger by each individual who is a director or executive officer of
the Company to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

  



  

6.10 _Directors ' and Officers' Exculpation, Indemnification and
Insurance_.

  



  

(a) _Indemnified Persons_. The Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill, in all respects, the obligations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to any indemnification
agreements entered into (and copies of which have been made available to
Parent prior to the date of this Agreement) prior to the Effective Time
between the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of
their respective current or former directors, officers or employees (and any
person who becomes a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time), on the other hand
(collectively, the "Indemnified Persons"). In addition, during the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and
Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the
certificates of incorporation, bylaws and other similar organizational
documents of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain
provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement
of expenses that are at least as favorable as the
indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set forth
in the Charter, the Bylaws and the other similar organizational documents of
the Subsidiaries of the Company, as applicable, as of the date of this
Agreement. During such six-year period, such provisions may not be repealed,
amended or otherwise modified in any manner except as required by applicable
Law.

(b) _Indemnification Obligation_. Without limiting the generality
of Section 6.10(a), during the period commencing at the Effective Time
and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to)
indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law
or pursuant to any indemnification agreements with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in effect as of the Effective Time, each Indemnified Person from
and against any costs, fees and expenses (including attorneys' fees and
investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in connection with
any Legal Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, to the extent that such Legal Proceeding arises, directly or
indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or indirectly, to (i) any action or
omission, or alleged action or omission, in such Indemnified Person's capacity
as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or other Affiliates (to the extent that such action or
omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to or at the
Effective Time); and (ii) the Merger, as well as any actions taken by the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub with respect to the Merger (including any
disposition of assets of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
that is alleged to have rendered the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries insolvent). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time prior
to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person
delivers to Parent a written notice asserting a claim for indemnification
pursuant to this Section 6.10(b), then the claim asserted in such notice will
survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such claim is fully
and finally resolved. In connection with any such Legal Proceeding of the
type contemplated by this Section 6.10(b), (A) the Surviving Corporation
will have the right to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time
(it being understood that, by electing to control the defense thereof, the
Surviving Corporation will be deemed to have waived any right to object to the
Indemnified Person's entitlement to indemnification under this Section 6.10
with respect thereto); (B) each Indemnified Person will be entitled to
retain his or her own counsel (the fees and expenses of which will be paid by
the Surviving Corporation), whether or not the Surviving Corporation elects
to control the defense of any such Legal Proceeding; (C) upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Person to repay any amount if
it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Person is not entitled
to indemnification, the Surviving Corporation will advance all fees and
expenses (including fees and expenses of any counsel) as incurred by an
Indemnified Person in the defense of such Legal Proceeding, whether or not the
Surviving Corporation elects to control the defense of any such Legal
Proceeding; and (D) no Indemnified Person will be liable for any settlement of
such Legal Proceeding effected without his or her prior written consent
(unless such settlement relates only to monetary damages for which the
Surviving Corporation is entirely responsible). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Affiliates will settle or otherwise compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, or otherwise seek the
termination of, any Legal Proceeding for which indemnification may be sought
by an Indemnified Person pursuant to this Agreement unless such settlement,
compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all
Indemnified Persons from all liability arising out of such Legal Proceeding.
Any determination required to be made with respect to whether the conduct of
any Indemnified Person complies or complied with any applicable standard will
be made by independent legal counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation
(which counsel will be reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Person), the
fees and expenses of which will be paid by the Surviving Corporation.

    



  

   

 | -78-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

   



  

  

  

(c) _D andO Insurance_. During the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to) maintain in effect the DandO Insurance in respect of acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time on terms (including with
respect to coverage, conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are
equivalent to those of the DandO Insurance. In satisfying its obligations
pursuant to this Section 6.10(c), the Surviving Corporation will not be
obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 300 percent of the amount paid
by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year (such 300 percent
amount, the "Maximum Annual Premium"). If the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, then the Surviving
Corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's
current directors' and officers' liability insurance carrier. Prior to the
Effective Time, and in lieu of maintaining the DandO Insurance pursuant to this
Section 6.10(c), the Company may (or, if the Parent requests, the Company
will) purchase a prepaid "tail" policy (the "Tail Policy") with respect to
the DandO Insurance from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Company's current directors' and officers' liability insurance
carrier so long as the annual cost for the Tail Policy does not exceed the
Maximum Annual Premium. If the Company purchases the Tail Policy prior to the
Effective Time, then the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause
the Surviving Corporation to) maintain the Tail Policy in full force
and effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder for so long as
the Tail Policy is in full force and effect.

  



  

(d) _Successors and Assigns_. Proper provisions will be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective successors or assigns will assume all of the
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section
6.10 if Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns either (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person.

  



  

(e) _No Impairment; Third Person Beneficiary Rights_. The
obligations set forth in this Section 6.10 may not be terminated, amended or
otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person
(or any other person (and his or her heirs and representatives) who is a
beneficiary pursuant to the DandO Insurance or the Tail Policy) without the
prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Person or other person.
Each of the Indemnified Persons or other persons (and his or her heirs
and representatives) who are beneficiaries pursuant to the DandO Insurance or
the Tail Policy are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this Section
6.10, with full rights of enforcement. The rights of the Indemnified Persons
(and other persons (and his or her heirs and representatives) who are
beneficiaries pursuant to the DandO Insurance or the Tail Policy) pursuant to
this Section 6.10 will be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights that such persons may have pursuant to (i) the Charter and
Bylaws; (ii) the similar organizational documents of the Subsidiaries of the
Company; (iii) any and all indemnification agreements entered into with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or (iv) applicable Law.

  



  

   

 | -79-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(f) _Joint and Several Obligations_. The obligations of the
Surviving Corporation, Parent and their respective Subsidiaries pursuant
to this Section 6.10 are joint and several.

  



  

(g) _Other Claims_. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or
will be construed to, release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and
officers' insurance claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy or
indemnification agreement that is or has been in existence with respect to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 6.10 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims pursuant to such policies or agreements.

  



  

6.11 _Employee Matters_.

  



  

(a) _Existing Arrangements_. From and after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to) honor all of the Company Benefit Plans in accordance with
their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing will prohibit the Surviving
Corporation from amending or terminating any such Company Benefit Plans in
accordance with their terms or if otherwise required pursuant to applicable
Law.

  



  

(b) _Employment; Benefits_. The Surviving Corporation or one of
its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation or
one of its Subsidiaries to) continue the employment of all employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time by taking such actions,
if any, as are required by applicable Law, provided that the Company provides
all information necessary to take such actions prior to the Effective Time.
For a period of one year following the Effective Time (or until an earlier
termination of employment), the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) (i) maintain for the benefit of Continuing Employees the
broad-based Company Benefit Plans and any other broad-based employee benefit
plans or other compensation and severance arrangements (other than any long-
term incentive, equity-based, change in control, retention or similar
compensation or benefits ("Excluded Benefits")) of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Company Plans") on terms and
conditions that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those in effect
at the Company or its Subsidiaries (other than Excluded Benefits) on the date
of this Agreement and (ii) provide base cash compensation and cash incentive
opportunities (other than Excluded Benefits) to each Continuing Employee
that, taken as a whole, are no less favorable in the aggregate than the
compensation and benefits (other than Excluded Benefits) provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time ("Comparable
Plans"); or (iii) provide some combination of Company Plans and Comparable
Plans such that each Continuing Employee receives such compensation and
benefits (other than Excluded Benefits) that, taken as a whole, are no less
favorable in the aggregate than such compensation and benefits (other than
Excluded Benefits) provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time. In each case, base compensation and target cash incentive
compensation opportunity (other than Excluded Benefits) will not be decreased
for a period of one year following the Effective Time for any Continuing
Employee employed during that period. For a period of one year following the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation to) provide to Continuing Employees severance benefits
that are no less favorable than those provided by the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement as set forth on Section 6.11(b)
of the Company Disclosure Letter.

  



  

   

 | -80-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) _New Plans_. At or after the Effective Time, Parent will, or
will cause the Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of Parent to,
cause to be granted to the Continuing Employees credit for all service with
the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and with Parent,
the Surviving Corporation, and any of their Subsidiaries on or after the
Effective Time, for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and
entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant (including for
purposes of vacation accrual and severance pay entitlement but not for
purposes of any Excluded Benefits), except that such service need not be
credited to the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage or
benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
(i) each Continuing Employee will be immediately eligible to participate,
without any waiting period, in any and all employee benefit plans sponsored
by Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company Plans) (such
plans, the "New Plans") to the extent that coverage pursuant to any New Plan
replaces coverage pursuant to a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participates immediately before the Effective Time (such
plans, the "Old Plans"); (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision, disability or other welfare benefits
to any Continuing Employee, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving
Corporation or any Subsidiaries of Parent to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause all waiting periods, pre-existing conditions or limitations,
physical examination requirements, evidence of insurability requirements and
actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan to be waived for
such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents to the same extent
they were waived under corresponding Old Plans, and Parent will, or will
cause the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiaries of Parent to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by
such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion
of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date that such Continuing
Employee's participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be given
full credit pursuant to such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, co-payments, coinsurance, offset and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan; and (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts
to credit the accounts of such Continuing Employees pursuant to any New Plan
that is a flexible spending plan with any unused balance in the account of
such Continuing Employee. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by
a Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
credited to such Continuing Employee following the Effective Time.

  



  

(d) _No Third Person Beneficiary Rights_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, neither this Section
6.11 nor any provisions of this Agreement relating to Company Benefit Plans
will be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or
preclude the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Continuing
Employee or any other person for any reason; (ii) subject to the limitations
and requirements specifically set forth in this Section 6.11, require Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to maintain
or continue any Company Benefit Plan or prevent the amendment, modification,
suspension or termination or any employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement sponsored by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Affiliates after the Effective Time; (iii) create any third party beneficiary
rights in any Continuing Employee or other Service Provider or any other
Person; or (iv) be treated as an amendment of, or undertaking to amend, any
Company Benefit Plan.

6.12 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent will take all action
necessary to cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their
respective obligations pursuant to this Agreement and to consummate the
Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub will be jointly and severally liable for the
failure by either of them to perform and discharge any of their respective
covenants, agreements and obligations pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

6.13 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

  



  

(a) _Notification by the Company_. During the Pre-Closing Period,
the Company will give prompt notice to Parent upon becoming aware that
any representation or warranty made by it in this Agreement has become untrue
or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any failure by the Company to
comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement,
in each case if and only to the extent that such untruth, inaccuracy, or
failure would reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions to the
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger set forth in
Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b) to fail to be satisfied at the Closing. No
such notification will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement or the conditions to the
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger or the remedies
available to the Parties under this Agreement. The terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement apply to any information provided to Parent
pursuant to this Section 6.13(a).

  



  

(b) _Notification by Parent_. During the Pre-Closing Period,
Parent will give prompt notice to the Company upon becoming aware that any
representation or warranty made by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement has
become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any failure by
Parent or Merger Sub to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
pursuant to this Agreement, in each case if and only to the extent that such
untruth, inaccuracy or failure would reasonably be expected to cause any of
the conditions to the obligations of the Company to consummate the Merger set
forth in Section 7.3(a) or Section 7.3(b) to fail to be satisfied at the
Closing. No such notification will affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement
or the conditions to the obligations of the Company to consummate the Merger
or the remedies available to the Parties under this Agreement. The terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement apply to any information provided
to the Company pursuant to this Section 6.13(b).

6.14 _Public Statements and Disclosure_. The initial press releases
concerning this Agreement and the Merger of the Company, on the one hand, and
Parent, on the other hand, will each be reasonably acceptable to the other
Party. Thereafter, prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1, the Company (other than with respect to the portion of any
communication relating to a Company Board Recommendation Change), on the one
hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, will use their
respective reasonable best efforts to consult with the other Parties before
(a) participating in any media interviews; (b) engaging in any meetings or
calls with analysts, institutional investors or other similar Persons; (c)
providing any statements that are public or are reasonably likely to become
public, in each case to the extent relating to this Agreement or the Merger;
or (d) making, issuing or providing any statement or communication
principally directed to employees, suppliers, customers, partners or vendors
of the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than ordinary course communications
consistent with past practice), in each case to the extent relating to this
Agreement or the Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the
contrary in the Confidentiality Agreement, (i) the Company will not be
obligated to engage in such consultation with respect to communications that
are (A) required by applicable Law; or (B) solely to the extent related to a
Superior Proposal or Company Board Recommendation Change; and (ii) Parent or

contemplated by the prior sentence will only be delivered to counsel to
Parent and may be delivered by email. The Company will (a) give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement or prosecution of any
Transaction Litigation; (b) consult with Parent with respect to the defense,
settlement and prosecution of any Transaction Litigation; and (c) consider in
good faith Parent's advice with respect to any Transaction Litigation. The
Company may not compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding, or
agree to compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding, any
Transaction Litigation unless Parent has consented thereto in writing (which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). For
purposes of this Section 6.15, "participate" means that Parent will be kept
apprised of proposed strategy and other significant decisions with respect to
the Transaction Litigation by the Company (to the extent that the attorney-
client privilege between the Company and its counsel is not undermined or
otherwise affected), and Parent may offer comments or suggestions with
respect to such Transaction Litigation but will not be afforded any decision-
making power or other authority over such Transaction Litigation except for
the settlement or compromise consent set forth above.

  



  

6.16 _Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration_. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company will cooperate with Parent and use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or
cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its
part pursuant to applicable Law to cause (a) the delisting of the Company
Common Stock from Nasdaq as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time;
and (b) the deregistration of the Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after such delisting.

any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all

the Company or Merger Sub, then the proper officers and directors of each
Party will use their reasonable best efforts to take such action.

  



  

6.18 _Credit Agreement_. The Company will have delivered to Parent, by
no later than two Business Days prior to the Closing, a customary payoff
letter (the "Payoff Letter") in connection with the repayment of all

Company funds in an amount equal to the amount necessary for the Company to
repay and discharge in full all amounts outstanding under the terms of the

 | -88-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) _Effect of Termination_. Any proper and valid termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 will be effective immediately upon the
mutual written agreement of Parent and the Company or the delivery of written
notice by the terminating Party to the other Parties. Following the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, this Agreement will be
of no further force or effect without liability of any Party (or any direct
or indirect equity holder, controlling person, partner, member, manager,
stockholder, director, officer, employee, Affiliate, agent or other
representative of such Party) to the other Parties, as applicable, except,
and subject in all respects to this Section 8.2, that Section 6.6(e), Section

Agreement, the Financing Sources will have no liability to the Company, any of
its Affiliates or any of its or their direct or indirect equityholders
pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise relating to or arising out of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Debt Financing (including
for any willful and material breach), except that the foregoing will not
preclude any liability of the Financing Sources to the Company and its
Affiliates, in each case after the Closing Date, under any
definitive agreements relating to any Debt Financing or any liability of the
Financing Sources to Parent or Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates
under the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive agreements relating to the
Debt Financing. No valid termination of this Agreement will affect the rights
or obligations of any Party pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement, the
Guarantee or the Financing Letters, which rights, obligations and agreements
will survive the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with their
respective terms.

  



  

8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

  



  

(a) _General_. Except as set forth in this Section 8.3, all fees
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger will
be paid by the Party incurring such fees and expenses whether or not the
Merger is consummated. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation will be responsible for all fees and expenses of the Payment
Agent. Except as set forth in Section 2.9(e), Parent will pay or cause to be
paid all (i) transfer, stamp and documentary Taxes or fees; and (ii)

case arising out of or in connection with entering into this Agreement and

(b) _Company Payments_.

  



  

(i) _Future Transactions_. If (A) this Agreement is validly
terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(c), Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(e); (B)
at the time of such termination, the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1(b)
and Section 7.1(c) have been satisfied or are capable of being satisfied and
the conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a) and Section 7.3(b) would be
satisfied if the date of such termination was the Closing Date; (C) following
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c), Section 8.1(d) or Section
8.1(e), an Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced or publicly
disclosed and not withdrawn or otherwise abandoned; and (D) within one year
of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c), Section
8.1(d) or Section 8.1(e), as applicable, either an Acquisition Transaction is
consummated or the Company enters into a definitive agreement providing
for the consummation of an Acquisition Transaction, then the Company will,
concurrently with the consummation of such Acquisition Transaction, pay or
cause to be paid to Parent or its designee an amount equal to the Company
Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account designated in Schedule 8.3(b) (which Schedule may be updated by
Parent from time to time). For purposes of this Section 8.3(b)(i), all
references to "15 percent" in the definition of "Acquisition Transaction"
will be deemed to be references to "50 percent."

  



  

   

 | -89-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) _Company Board Recommendation Change_. If this Agreement is
validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(f), then the Company must, within
two Business Days following such termination, pay or cause to be paid to
Parent or its designee the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account designated in Schedule 8.3(b)
(which Schedule may be updated by Parent from time to time).

  



  

(iii) _Superior Proposal_. If this Agreement is validly
terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(h), then the Company must, concurrently
with such termination, pay or cause to be paid to Parent or its designee the
Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the account designated in Schedule 8.3(b) (which Schedule may be updated by
Parent from time to time).

  



  

(c) _Parent Payment_. If this Agreement is validly terminated
pursuant to Section 8.1(g) or Section 8.1(i), or by either Parent or the
Company pursuant to Section 8.1(c) and at such time the Company could have
terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(g) or Section 8.1(i), then
Parent must, within two Business Days following such termination, pay or
cause to be paid to the Company or its designee an amount equal to the Parent
Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account designated in Schedule 8.3(c) (which Schedule may be updated by the
Company from time to time).

  



  

(d) _Single Payment Only; Liquidated Damages_. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that in no event will the Company or Parent, as
applicable, be required to pay the Company Termination Fee or the Parent
Termination Fee, as applicable, on more than one occasion, whether or not the
Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, may be
payable pursuant to more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or
at different times and upon the occurrence of different events. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that (i) the agreements contained in this Section 8.3
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii)
the damages resulting from the termination of this Agreement under
circumstances where the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee
is payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation; and (iii)
without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement.
Therefore, the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as
applicable, if, as and when required to be paid pursuant to this Section 8.3
will not constitute a penalty but rather liquidated damages in a reasonable
amount that will compensate the Party receiving such amount in the
circumstances in which it is payable for the efforts and resources expended
and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
Merger.

(e) _Payments; Default_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the
Merger and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into
this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amount
due pursuant to Section 8.3(b) or Parent fails to promptly pay any amounts due
pursuant to Section 8.3(c) and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent, on
the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, commences a Legal Proceeding
that results in a judgment against the Company for the amount set forth in
Section 8.3(b) or any portion thereof or a judgment against Parent for the
amount set forth in Section 8.3(c) or any portion thereof, as
applicable, then the non-paying party will pay or cause to be paid to the
other party the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable and documented attorneys' fees) of the other party in
connection with such Legal Proceeding, together with interest on such amount
or portion thereof at an annual rate equal to the prime rate (as published in
_The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date that such payment or portion
thereof was required to be made) plus five percent through the date that such
payment or portion thereof was actually received, or a lesser rate that is the
maximum permitted by applicable Law. Any payment under this Section 8.3(e)
will be made by the non-paying Party to the other Party or its designee
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to account designated in
Schedule 8.3(b) or Schedule 8.3(c), as applicable.

  



  

(f) _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_.

  



  

(i) _For the Company_. If this Agreement is validly terminated
pursuant to Section 8.1 in the circumstances in which the Parent Termination
Fee is payable pursuant to Section 8.3(c), Parent's payment of the Parent
Termination Fee to the extent owed pursuant to Section 8.3(c) (including,
without duplication, the Company's right to enforce the Guarantee with
respect thereto and receive the Parent Termination Fee from Guarantor), any
amounts owed pursuant to Section 8.3(e) and the Reimbursement Obligations,
and the Company's right to specific performance pursuant to Section 9.10
(subject to the limitations set forth in Section 9.10), will be the sole and
exclusive remedies of the Company and any Company Related Party against (A)
Parent, Merger Sub or Guarantor; and (B) the former, current and future direct
or indirect holders of any equity, controlling persons, Representatives,
Financing Sources, Affiliates (other than Parent, Merger Sub or
Guarantor), members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders and
assignees of each of Parent, Merger Sub and Guarantor (the Persons in clauses
(A) and (B) collectively, the "Parent Related Parties") in respect of this
Agreement, the Financing Letters, the Guarantee (subject to the Company's
right to enforce the Guarantee) and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and by such agreements (including any breach by Guarantor), Parent
or Merger Sub, the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate
the Merger or any claims or actions under applicable Law arising out of any
such breach, termination or failure. Upon payment of the Parent Termination
Fee and the Reimbursement Obligations (to the extent due) to the Company,
none of the Parent Related Parties will have any further monetary liability
or obligation to the Company Related Parties relating to or arising out of
this Agreement, the Financing Letters, the Guarantee or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and by such agreements (except that (1) Parent
and Merger Sub (or their Affiliates) will remain obligated with respect to,
and the Company and its Subsidiaries may be entitled to remedies with respect
to, the Confidentiality Agreement, Section 8.2, Section 8.3(a) (with respect
to the expenses of Parent and Merger Sub) and Section 8.3(e); and (2)
Guarantor will remain obligated, and the Company and its Subsidiaries may be
entitled to remedies, with respect to the Guarantee (to the extent provided
therein)). The foregoing will not preclude any liability of the Financing
Sources to the Company (following the Closing Date), Parent or Merger Sub
under the Debt Commitment Letters or any definitive agreements relating to the
Debt Financing or limit the Company (following the Closing Date), Parent or
Merger Sub from seeking to recover any such damages or obtain
equitable relief from or with respect to any Financing Source pursuant to the
Debt Commitment Letters or any definitive agreements relating to the Debt
Financing. Other than Guarantor's obligations under the Guarantee and the
Equity Commitment Letter and other than the obligations of Parent and Merger
Sub to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement, in no event will any
Parent Related Party or any other Person other than Guarantor, Parent and
Merger Sub have any liability for monetary damages to the Company or any
other Person relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Merger.

the extent owed pursuant to Section 8.3(b) and any amounts owed pursuant to

Company and its Subsidiaries; and (B) the former, current and future holders
of any equity, controlling persons, Representatives, Affiliates, members,
managers, general or limited partners, stockholders and assignees of each of
the Company, its Subsidiaries and each of their respective Affiliates (the

respect of this Agreement and the Merger. Upon payment of the Company

Parent Related Party relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Merger (except that the Company and its Subsidiaries (or their Affiliates)
will remain obligated with respect to, and Parent and Merger Sub may be

pursuing specific performance in accordance with, but subject to the
limitations of, Section 9.10(b), under no circumstances will the Company,
directly or indirectly, be permitted or entitled to receive both specific
performance of the type contemplated by Section 9.10(b) and any monetary
damages.

provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended by the Parties at
any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company (pursuant to authorized action by the
Company Board (or a committee thereof)), except that if the Company has

the Financing Sources set forth in Section 8.3, Section 9.5, Section 9.8, the
last sentence of Section 9.10(b)(ii), Section 9.12(b), Section 9.13, Section

the Financing Sources that are party to the Debt Commitment Letters, except
that, in the case of any Financing Source that is not a party to the Debt
Commitment Letters, the consent of the Financing Source with which it is
affiliated that is a party to the Debt Commitment Letters will be binding on
such Financing Source that is not a party to the Debt Commitment Letters.

9.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time and from time to time prior
to the Effective Time, any Party may, to the extent legally allowed and
except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, as
applicable; (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
made to such Party in this Agreement; and (c) subject to the requirements of
applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for
the benefit of such Party contained in this Agreement. Any agreement by a
Party to any such extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed by such Party. Any delay in exercising any right
pursuant to this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right.

  



  

9.5 _Assignment_. No Party may assign either this Agreement or
any of its rights, interests, or obligations under this Agreement without the
prior written approval of the other Parties, except that Parent and Merger
Sub will have the right to assign all or any portion of their respective
rights and obligations pursuant to this Agreement (a) from and after the
Effective Time, in connection with a merger or consolidation involving Parent
or Merger Sub or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets
of Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation; (b) to any of their
respective Affiliates; or (c) to any Financing Source pursuant to the terms
of the Financing for purposes of creating a security interest in this
Agreement or otherwise assigning as collateral in respect of the Financing,
it being understood that, in each case, such assignment must not (i) affect
the obligations of the parties (including Financing Sources) pursuant to the
Financing Letters or Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantee; or (ii) impede or
delay the consummation of the Merger or otherwise materially impede the rights
of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Stock-Based Awards
and Company Options pursuant to this Agreement. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit
of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. No
assignment by any Party will relieve such Party of any of its obligations
under this Agreement.

  



  

9.6 _Confidentiality_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
acknowledge that Advent International Corporation and the Company have
previously executed the Confidentiality Agreement, which will continue in
full force and effect in accordance with its terms. Each of Parent,
Merger Sub and their respective Representatives will hold and treat all
documents and information concerning the Company and its
Subsidiaries furnished or made available to Parent, Merger Sub or their
respective Representatives in connection with the Merger in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement. By executing this Agreement, each of Parent and
Merger Sub agree to be bound by, and to cause their Representatives to be
bound by, the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement as if they
were the counterparty thereto.

  



  

9.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents and
instruments and other agreements among the Parties as contemplated by or
referred to in this Agreement, including the Confidentiality Agreement, the
Company Disclosure Letter, the Guarantee and the Financing Letters,
constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject
matter of this Agreement and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement will (a) not be superseded; (b)
survive any termination of this Agreement; and (c) continue in full force and
effect until the earlier to occur of the (i) Effective Time and (ii) date on
which the Confidentiality Agreement expires in accordance with its terms or is
validly terminated.

9.8 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as set forth in Section
6.10 and this Section 9.8, the Parties agree that their
respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth in this
Agreement are solely for the benefit of the other Parties in accordance with
and subject to the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement is not intended to,
and will not, confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies under this
Agreement, except (a) as set forth in or contemplated by Section 6.10; (b)
if the requirements to a grant of specific performance set forth in Section
9.10(b)(ii) are met but a court of competent jurisdiction has declined to
grant specific performance and has instead granted an award of damages, then
the Company may enforce such award and, subject to Section 8.3(g), seek
additional damages on behalf of the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock, Company Stock-Based Awards and Company Options (which Parent, Merger
Sub and Guarantor acknowledge and agree may include damages based on a
decrease in share value or lost premium); (c) if Parent or Merger Sub
wrongfully terminates or willfully breaches this Agreement, or if Guarantor
wrongfully terminates or willfully breaches the Guarantee, then following the
termination of this Agreement, the Company may, subject to Section 8.3(g),
seek damages and other relief (including equitable relief) on behalf of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Stock-Based Awards and
Company Options (which Parent, Merger Sub and Guarantor acknowledge and agree
may include damages based on a decrease in share value or lost premium); and
(d) from and after the Effective Time, the rights of the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock, Company Stock-Based Awards and Company Options to
receive the merger consideration set forth in Article II. The rights granted
pursuant to clause (b) and clause (c) of the second sentence of this Section
9.8 will only be enforceable on behalf of the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock, Company Stock-Based Awards and Company Options by the Company,
in its sole and absolute discretion, as agent for such holders, and it is
understood and agreed that any and all interests in such claims will attach to
such shares of the Company Common Stock, Company Stock-Based Awards or
Company Options and subsequently transfer therewith and, consequently, any
damages, settlements or other amounts recovered or received by the Company
with respect to such claims (net of expenses incurred by the Company
in connection therewith) may, in the Company's sole and absolute discretion,
be (A) distributed, in whole or in part, by the Company to such holders as of
any date determined by the Company; or (B) retained by the Company for the use
and benefit of the Company in any manner that the Company deems fit. The
provisions of Section 8.3, Section 9.3, Section 9.5, the last sentence of
Section 9.10(b)(ii), Section 9.12(b), Section 9.13, Section 9.16(b) and this
Section 9.8 will inure to the benefit of the Financing Sources and their
successors and assigns, each of whom are intended to be third-
party beneficiaries thereof (it being understood and agreed that Section 8.3,
Section 9.3, Section 9.5, the last sentence of Section 9.10(b)(ii), Section
9.12(b), Section 9.13, Section 9.16(b) and this Section 9.8 will be
enforceable by the Financing Sources and their respective successors and
assigns).

  



  

9.9 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this
Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of
such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to
replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid
and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

9.10 _Remedies_.

  



  

(a) _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, any and all remedies expressly conferred upon a Party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred by
this Agreement or by applicable Law on such Party, and the exercise by a
Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Transaction Document or
otherwise, although the Company may, subject in all respects to Section 8.2,
Section 8.3, this Section 9.10 and Section 9.16 (and, in each case, the
limitations set forth herein or therein), pursue both (i) a grant of specific
performance, and (ii) payment of monetary damages pursuant to Section 8.2(b)
or the Parent Termination Fee, if, as and when required pursuant to Section
8.3(c), under no circumstances will the Company, directly or indirectly, be
permitted or entitled to receive (A) both a grant of specific performance or
other equitable relief to cause the Equity Financing to be funded (whether
under this Agreement or the Equity Commitment Letter) and the occurrence of
the Closing, on the one hand, and (1) payment of any monetary damages
(including any monetary damages in lieu of specific performance)
whatsoever or (2) payment of any of the Parent Termination Fee and the
amounts, if any, as and when due, pursuant to Section 8.3(f)(i) or the
Reimbursement Obligations, on the other hand; or (B) both payment of any
monetary damages (including any monetary damages in lieu of specific
performance) whatsoever, on the one hand, and payment of any of the Parent
Termination Fee and the amounts, if any, as and when due, pursuant to Section
8.3(f)(i) or the Reimbursement Obligations, on the other hand.

  



  

(b) _Specific Performance_.

  



  

(i) _Irreparable Damage_. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform the
provisions of this Agreement (including any Party failing to take such
actions that are required of it by this Agreement in order to consummate the
Merger) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. Subject to Section 9.10(b)(ii), the Parties acknowledge and agree
that, subject to the penultimate sentence of Section 8.2(b), (A) the Parties
will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity, to an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms of this Agreement (including,
subject to Section 9.10(b)(ii), specific performance or other equitable
relief to cause Parent to perform any obligations required of it to enforce
its rights under the Equity Commitment Letter); (B) the provisions of Section
8.3 are not intended to and do not adequately compensate the Company, on the
one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, for the harm that would
result from a breach of this Agreement, and will not be construed to diminish
or otherwise impair in any respect any Party's right to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief; and (C) the right of
specific enforcement is an integral part of the Merger and without that
right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement.

  



  

   

 | -97-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) _Specific Performance in Respect of the Equity Financing_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any
Transaction Document, and subject in all respects to this Section
9.10(b)(ii), it is acknowledged and agreed that Parent has an
obligation under this Agreement to cause the Equity Financing to be funded
and to effect the Closing and consummate the Merger, including by exercising
its rights under the Equity Commitment Letter, and that such obligation of
Parent, and the right of the Company to specific performance in connection
with enforcing such obligation of Parent (whether under this Agreement or the
Equity Commitment Letter) will be subject to the requirements that (A) all of
the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 have been and
continue to be satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their
terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, each of which is capable of being
satisfied at the Closing); (B) the Debt Financing has been funded or will be
funded in accordance with the terms thereof at the Closing if the Equity
Financing is funded at the Closing; (C) Parent and Merger Sub have failed to
consummate the Merger on the date required pursuant to Section 2.3; and (D)
the Company has confirmed in a written notice to Parent that if specific
performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded,
then it would take such actions that are required of it by this Agreement to
cause the Closing to occur. In no event will the Company be entitled to
enforce or seek to enforce specifically Parent's obligation to cause the
Equity Financing to be funded or to complete the Merger if the Debt Financing
has not been funded in full (or is not reasonably expected to be funded in
full at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing). In
addition, it is acknowledged and agreed that the Company will be entitled to
specific performance to cause Parent and Merger Sub to comply with their
obligations under Section 6.5(b). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth herein, in no event shall the Company, any of its equityholders or
any of their respective Affiliates or their respective representatives be
entitled to, or permitted to seek, specific performance of any Financing
Sources, it being understood that the foregoing will not limit or affect any
rights or remedies that the Company and its Affiliates may have against any
Financing Source pursuant to the Debt Financing after the Closing.

  



  

(iii) _No Objections_. The Parties agree not to raise any
objections to (A) the granting of an injunction, specific performance
or other equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and
Merger Sub, on the other hand; and (B) the specific performance of the terms
and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches
of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements
of the Parties pursuant to this Agreement. Any Party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement will
not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such
injunction or enforcement, and each Party irrevocably waives any right that it
may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or
other security.

  



  

9.11 _Governing Law_ . This Agreement is governed by and
construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware.

Section 9.2 or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable Law,

serve legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable Law; (ii)

properties and assets in any Legal Proceeding to the exclusive general

by motion or other request for leave from any Chosen Court; (iv) agrees
that any Legal Proceeding arising in connection with this Agreement, the

Legal Proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead
or claim the same; and (vi) agrees that it will not bring any Legal
Proceeding relating to this Agreement, the Guarantee or the Merger in
any court other than the Chosen Courts. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company agrees that a final judgment in any Legal Proceeding in the Chosen
Courts will be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit
on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.

  



  

(b) _Jurisdiction for Debt Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of the Parties acknowledges
and irrevocably agrees, subject to Section 9.16(b), (i) that any Legal
Proceeding, whether at law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, involving the Financing Sources arising out of, or relating to, the
Merger, the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment Letters, or the performance
of services thereunder will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any
state or federal court sitting in the State of New York in the borough of
Manhattan and any appellate court thereof, and each Party submits for itself
and its property with respect to any such Legal Proceeding to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such court; (ii) not to bring or permit any of their
Affiliates to bring or support anyone else in bringing any such Legal
Proceeding in any other court; (iii) to waive and waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of, any such Legal Proceeding in any such court; and (iv) any
such Legal Proceeding will be governed, construed and enforced in accordance
with the Laws of the State of New York. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, (A) the interpretation of the definition of
Company Material Adverse Effect and whether or not a Company Material Adverse
Effect has occurred; (B) the determination of the accuracy of any Specified
Acquisition Agreement Representations (as defined in the Financing Letter) and
whether as a result of any inaccuracy thereof Parent, Merger Sub or their
respective Affiliates has the right to terminate its obligations under this
Agreement, or to decline to consummate the Merger; and (C) the determination
of whether the Merger has been consummated in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement will, in each case, be governed and construed in accordance
with the Laws of the State of Delaware.

9.13 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES
THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT THAT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING (WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT,
TORTIOUS CONDUCT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE MERGER, THE GUARANTEE, THE FINANCING
LETTERS OR THE FINANCING (INCLUDING ANY SUCH LEGAL PROCEEDING INVOLVING OR
AGAINST THE FINANCING SOURCES). EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT (a)
NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (b) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER; (c) IT MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY; AND (d) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,

9.13.

  



  

9.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement and any amendments to this
Agreement may be executed in one or more textually identical counterparts, all
of which will be considered one and the same agreement and will become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being understood that all
Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Any such counterpart, to the
extent delivered by fax or .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpg or similar attachment to
electronic mail (any such delivery, an "Electronic Delivery"), will be
treated in all manner and respects as an original executed counterpart and
will be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the
original signed version thereof delivered in person. No Party may raise the
use of an Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature, or the fact that any
signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through
the use of an Electronic Delivery, as a defense to the formation of a
contract, and each Party forever waives any such defense, except to the
extent such defense relates to lack of authenticity.

warranties, covenants and closing conditions in this Agreement will be
construed to be cumulative; (b) each representation, warranty, covenant and
closing condition in this Agreement will be given full, separate and
independent effect; and (c) nothing set forth in any provision in this
Agreement will (except to the extent expressly stated) in any way be deemed
to limit the scope, applicability or effect of any other provision of this

whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited
partnership or limited liability company veil or any other theory or doctrine,
including alter ego or otherwise) that may be based upon, in respect of,
arise under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or relate in any manner
to: (i) this Agreement, any of the Transaction Documents or the Merger

this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents (including any
representation or warranty made in connection with, or as an inducement to,
this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents); (iii) any breach or
violation of this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents; or (iv) any
failure of the Merger to be consummated, in each case, may be made only (A)

Agreement, expressly identified as parties to this Agreement, and in the case
of the Transaction Documents, Persons expressly identified as parties to such
Transaction Documents; and (B) in accordance with, and subject to the terms
and conditions of, this Agreement or such Transaction Documents, as

Transaction Documents to the contrary, each Party agrees, on behalf of itself
and its Related Parties, that no recourse under this Agreement or any of the
Transaction Documents or in connection with the Merger will be sought or had
against any other Person, including any Related Party, and no other Person,
including any Related Party, will have any liabilities or obligations
(whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity or otherwise, or granted
by statute or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the
corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company veil or any other
theory or doctrine, including alter ego or otherwise), for any claims, causes
of action, obligations or liabilities arising under, out of, in connection
with or related in any manner to the items in the clauses (i) through (iv), it
being acknowledged and agreed that no personal liability or losses whatsoever
will attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any of
the aforementioned, as such, arising under, out of, in connection with or
related in any manner to the items in the clauses (i) through (iv), in each
case, except for claims that the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable,
may assert (subject, with respect to the following clauses (2) and (3), in
all respects to the limitations set forth in Section 8.2(b), Section
8.3(f), Section 8.3(g), Section 8.3(h), Section 9.10(b) and this Section

Merger Sub solely in accordance with, and pursuant to the terms and
conditions of, this Agreement.

  



    

  

(b) _As to Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, no Financing Source will have any liability to
any of the Company's equityholders, any of the Company's Affiliates or, prior
to the Closing, the Company, for any obligations or liabilities of Parent or
Merger Sub or for any claim (whether at law or equity, in tort, contract or
otherwise) based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or in respect of any oral representations made
or alleged to be made in connection with this Agreement. In no event will any
of the Company, its equityholders or its Affiliates (i) make or support any
claims for breach of this Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary
damages in respect of this Agreement from, any Financing Source; or (ii) seek

connection with the Debt Financing or the Debt Commitment Letter or the
obligations of any Financing Source thereunder. For the avoidance of doubt,
this Section 9.16(b) does not limit or affect any rights or remedies that
Parent or Merger Sub or, after the Closing, the Company may have against any
Financing Sources pursuant to the Debt Financing Commitment.
