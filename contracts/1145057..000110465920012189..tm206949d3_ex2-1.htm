a portion of the aggregate value of the Merger (the &ldquo;<B>Equity Financing</B>&rdquo;); and (ii)&nbsp;executed commitment letter,
dated as of the date of this Agreement, among Merger Sub and the lenders party thereto (the &ldquo;<B>Debt Commitment Letters</B>&rdquo;
and, together with the Equity Commitment Letter, the &ldquo;<B>Financing Letters</B>&rdquo;) pursuant to which the lenders party
thereto have committed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to lend the amounts set forth therein for the purpose of funding
a portion of the aggregate value of the Merger (the &ldquo;<B>Debt Financing</B>&rdquo; and, together with the Equity Financing,
the &ldquo;<B>Financing</B>&rdquo;). Parent has also delivered to the Company a true, correct and complete copy of any fee letter
(which may be delivered with the fee amounts, &ldquo;flex&rdquo; terms and other commercially sensitive information redacted in
a customary manner so long as no redaction covers terms that would adversely affect the amount, conditionality, availability or
termination of the Debt Financing) in connection with the Debt Commitment Letters (collectively, &ldquo;<B>Fee Letters</B>&rdquo;).
The Equity Commitment Letter provides that (A)&nbsp;the Company is an express third party beneficiary thereof in connection with
the Company&rsquo;s exercise of its rights under Section&nbsp;9.10(b); and (B)&nbsp;subject in all respects to Section&nbsp;9.10(b),
Parent and Guarantor will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief in connection
with the exercise by Company of such third party beneficiary rights.</P>

in the forms delivered by Parent to the Company) are in full force and effect and constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations
of Parent, Merger Sub and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto (including, with respect to the Equity Commitment
Letter, Guarantor), as applicable, enforceable against Parent, Merger Sub and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto,
as applicable, in accordance with their terms, except, in each case, as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization
or similar Laws affecting creditors&rsquo; rights generally and by general principles of equity. Other than as expressly set forth
in the Financing Letters and the Fee Letters, there are no conditions precedent related to the funding of the full proceeds of
the Financing (including any &ldquo;flex&rdquo; provisions) pursuant to any agreement relating to the Financing to which Guarantor,
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates is a party. As of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor, to the
knowledge of Parent, any counterparty to the Financing Letters has committed any breach of any of its covenants or other obligations
set forth in, or is in default under, any of the Financing Letters. As of the date of this Agreement, assuming the accuracy in
all material respects of the representations and warranties in Article&nbsp;III, the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 and the completion of the Marketing Period, to the knowledge of Parent, no event has occurred or circumstance
exists that (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) would, or would reasonably be expected to, (i)&nbsp;constitute or
result in a breach or default on the part of any Person under any of the Financing Letters or the Fee Letters; (ii)&nbsp;constitute
or result in a failure to satisfy any of the terms or conditions set forth in any of the Financing Letters or the Fee Letters;
(iii)&nbsp;make any of the assumptions or any of the statements set forth in the Financing Letters inaccurate in any material respect;
or (iv)&nbsp;otherwise result in any portion of the Financing not being available. As of the date of this Agreement, assuming the
accuracy in all material respects of the representations and warranties in Article&nbsp;III, the satisfaction of the conditions
set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 and the completion of the Marketing Period, Parent has no reason to believe (both before
and after giving effect to any &ldquo;flex&rdquo; provisions in the Debt Commitment Letters or the Fee Letters) that (A)&nbsp;it
will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of the Financing to be satisfied by it, whether or not such term
or condition is contained in the Financing Letters or the Fee Letters; or (B)&nbsp;the full amounts committed pursuant to the Financing
Letters will not be available as of the Closing if the terms or conditions contained in the Financing Letters to be satisfied by
it are satisfied. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub have fully paid, or caused to be fully paid, all commitment
or other fees that are due and payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of the Financing Letters

control the defense of any such Legal Proceeding; and (D)&nbsp;no Indemnified Person will be liable for any settlement of such
Legal Proceeding effected without his or her prior written consent (unless such settlement relates only to monetary damages for
which the Surviving Corporation is entirely responsible). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates will settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to, or otherwise seek the termination of, any Legal Proceeding for which indemnification may
be sought by an Indemnified Person pursuant to this Agreement unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes
an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from all liability arising out of such Legal Proceeding. Any determination
required to be made with respect to whether the conduct of any Indemnified Person complies or complied with any applicable standard
will be made by independent legal counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation (which counsel will be reasonably acceptable to
such Indemnified Person), the fees and expenses of which will be paid by the Surviving Corporation.</FONT></P>

the Surviving Corporation will not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 300 percent of the amount paid by the Company
for coverage for its last full fiscal year (such 300 percent amount, the &ldquo;<B>Maximum Annual Premium</B>&rdquo;). If the
annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, then the Surviving Corporation will be obligated
to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company&rsquo;s current directors&rsquo; and officers&rsquo; liability insurance
carrier. Prior to the Effective Time, and in lieu of maintaining the D&amp;O Insurance pursuant to this Section&nbsp;6.10(c),
the Company may (or, if the Parent requests, the Company will) purchase a prepaid &ldquo;tail&rdquo; policy (the &ldquo;<B>Tail
Policy</B>&rdquo;) with respect to the D&amp;O Insurance from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Company&rsquo;s current directors&rsquo; and officers&rsquo; liability insurance carrier so long as the annual cost for the Tail
Policy does not exceed the Maximum Annual Premium. If the Company purchases the Tail Policy prior to the Effective Time, then
the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain the Tail Policy in full force and
effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder for so long as the Tail Policy is in full force and effect.</P>

of Termination</I>. Any proper and valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section&nbsp;8.1 will be effective immediately
upon the mutual written agreement of Parent and the Company or the delivery of written notice by the terminating Party to the
other Parties. Following the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section&nbsp;8.1, this Agreement will be of no further
force or effect without liability of any Party (or any direct or indirect equity holder, controlling person, partner, member,
manager, stockholder, director, officer, employee, Affiliate, agent or other representative of such Party) to the other Parties,

this Section&nbsp;8.2, Section&nbsp;8.3 and Article&nbsp;IX will each survive the termination of this Agreement, in each case
in accordance with their respective terms. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, but subject to Section&nbsp;8.3, Section&nbsp;9.10
and Section&nbsp;9.16, nothing in this Agreement will relieve any Party from any liability for fraud or any willful and material
breach of this Agreement prior to the termination of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of any termination
of this Agreement, the Financing Sources will have no liability to the Company, any of its Affiliates or any of its or their direct
or indirect equityholders pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise relating to or arising out of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or any Debt Financing (including for any willful and material breach), except that the foregoing will not preclude
any liability of the Financing Sources to the Company and its Affiliates, in each case after the Closing Date, under any definitive
agreements relating to any Debt Financing or any liability of the Financing Sources to Parent or Merger Sub or their respective
Affiliates under the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing. No valid termination
of this Agreement will affect the rights or obligations of any Party pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement, the Guarantee
or the Financing Letters, which rights, obligations and agreements will survive the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance
with their respective terms.</P>
