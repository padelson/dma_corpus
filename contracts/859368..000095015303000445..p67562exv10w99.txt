the Purchaser would, but for this Section 9.2(b), be liable exceeds on a
cumulative basis an amount equal to $159,000, and then only to the extent of
any such excess; provided, that the Purchaser shall not have any liability
under Section 9.2(a) for any individual item where the Loss relating to such
item is less than $10,000; provided, further, however that the Purchaser\'s
aggregate liability under Section 9.2(a) shall in no event exceed the Cap.
All amounts paid to Seller Indemnified Person pursuant to this Section 9.2
and all amounts paid to Licensor Indemnified Persons (as such term is defined
in the Amended and Restated License Agreement) pursuant to Section 10.2 of
the Amended and Restated License Agreement shall be aggregated for purposes
of determining the satisfaction of the Cap. The Purchaser shall have no
liability under Section 9.2(a) to the extent a Seller Indemnified Person has
been paid pursuant to the Supply Agreement or the Amended and Restated
License Agreement for an indemnification claim involving the identical
substantive issue.     24   9.3. NOTICE OF CLAIMS. If there occurs an
event which any of the Persons to be indemnified under this Article IX
asserts is indemnifiable pursuant to Section 9.1 or 9.2 (the "INDEMNIFIED
PARTY"), the Party or Parties seeking indemnification shall so notify the
Party from whom indemnification is sought (the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY") promptly
in writing describing such Loss, the amount or estimated amount thereof, if
known or reasonably capable of estimation, and the method of computation of
such Loss, all with reasonable particularity and containing a reference to
the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such Loss shall have
occurred. If any Action at law or in equity is instituted by or against a
Third Party with respect to which the Indemnified Party intends to claim any
liability as a Loss under this Section 9.3, the Indemnified Party shall
promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of such Action and tender to the
Indemnifying Party the defense of such Action. A failure by the Indemnified
Party to give notice and to tender the defense of the Action in a timely
manner pursuant to this Section 9.3 shall not limit the obligation of the
Indemnifying Party under this Article IX, except to the extent such
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced thereby.   9.4. CONTROL OF
CLAIMS. The Indemnifying Party under this Article IX shall have the right,
but not the obligation, to conduct and control, through counsel of its
choosing, any Action for which indemnification is sought pursuant to this
Article IX ("INDEMNIFIABLE CLAIM"), and if the Indemnifying Party elects to
assume the defense thereof, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the
Party or Parties seeking indemnification hereunder for any legal expenses of
other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Party or
Parties in connection with the defense thereof; provided that if
the Indemnified Party has been advised in writing by outside counsel that
there is a potential conflict between the interests of the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party, the reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses of
one separate counsel for the Indemnified Party shall be paid by the
Indemnifying Party and such separate counsel shall be selected by the
Indemnified Party in its sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
reasonable legal fees and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified
Party in its sole discretion in connection with an Indemnifiable Claim as to
which the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense or is not entitled
to assume the defense shall be considered Losses for purposes of this Article
IX. The Indemnifying Party may compromise or settle such Action, provided
that the Indemnifying Party shall give the Indemnified Party advance notice
of any proposed compromise or settlement, provided, further that the
Indemnifying Party shall not compromise or settle any Indemnifiable Claim
without the prior written approval of the Indemnified Party, such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless all relief provided is
paid or satisfied in full by the Indemnifying Party. No Indemnified Party may
compromise or settle any Indemnifiable Claim without the prior written
approval of the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to
control or conduct the defense or prosecution of an Indemnifiable Claim, the
Indemnifying Party nevertheless shall have the right to participate in the
defense or prosecution of any Indemnifiable Claim and, at its own expense, to
employ counsel of its own choosing for such purpose. The Parties hereto shall
cooperate with each other and their respective counsel in the defense,
negotiation or settlement of any Indemnifiable Claim.   9.5. SURVIVAL. The
representations and warranties of the Parties contained in this Agreement
shall survive until the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date
and the covenants to be performed following the Closing Date shall survive
until the date that is six (6) months after the end of the applicable period
for performance thereof.     25   9.6. INDEMNIFICATION CALCULATIONS. The
amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this Article
IX shall be computed net of any insurance proceeds received by the
Indemnified Party in connection with such Losses. If an Indemnified Party
receives insurance proceeds in connection with Losses for which it has
received indemnification, such Party shall refund to the Indemnifying Party
the amount of such insurance proceeds when received, up to the amount of
indemnification received. An Indemnified Party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to pursue insurance claims with respect to any Losses. The
Parties agree that any indemnification payments made pursuant to this
Agreement shall be treated for tax purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.   9.7. LEGISLATION ETC.
The Seller shall not have any liability under Section 9.8 to the extent that
any Losses relating thereto for which the Seller would, but for this Section
9.7, be liable (i) occur as a result of the passing of any legislation not in
force at the date hereof or which has retroactive effect or (ii) are
recoverable under an insurance policy or would have been recoverable had the
insurance protection level which existed as of the Closing Date been
continued and would not have arisen but for an act, omission or transaction
carried out by the Purchaser or persons deriving title for the Purchaser or
Newco after the Closing Date.   9.8. TAX INDEMNIFICATION. (a) The Seller
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless (on an after tax basis and net of
any directly related tax credit or deduction that the Purchaser Indemnified
Persons actually obtain) the Purchaser Indemnified Persons from, and without
any duplication, any (1) Tax of Newco described in clause (i) of the
definition of Taxes related to the Pre-Closing Tax Period, (2) Tax described
in clause (ii) and (iii) of the definition of Tax, provided, that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 9.8(a)(1) or (a)(2),
the Seller in no event shall be obligated to indemnify, defend or hold
harmless any Purchaser Indemnified Party for any Taxes of Newco for any tax
period to the extent such Taxes arise solely from or as a result of any
action taken by Newco (or by any Purchaser Indemnified Person or Affiliate
with respect to Newco) post-Closing including, without limitation,
any elections or changes in the legal structure of Newco, (3) Tax of Newco
resulting from the breach of the provision of Sections 3.8 or 5.13(a), (4)
Taxes attributable to the first three-months as of and after the Closing Date
during which Newco Employees are employed by Newco, including any Taxes
resulting from the Consulting Agreement, in each case other than as a result
of, or arising out of the failure of the Purchaser and its Affiliates to
comply with the requirements set forth in Schedule 9.8, but only to the
extent such Taxes exceed the funds held by Newco on the Closing Date with
respect to such matters, and (5) Losses arising out of or incident to the
imposition, assessment or assertion of any Tax described in (1)-(4).   (b)
The Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless (on an after tax
basis and net of any directly related tax credit or deduction that the Seller
Indemnified Persons actually obtain) the Seller from any Taxes (1) imposed on
Newco solely as a result of any action by the Purchaser or its Affiliates (or
by Newco after the Closing), including but not limited to Taxes resulting
from such action (i) occurring on the Closing Date after the Closing that is
not in the ordinary course of business, (ii) occurring after the Closing Date
or (iii) occurring during a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (2) resulting from the
breach of Section 5.13(d), or (3) imposed on Newco with respect to
any taxable period or portion thereof that begins after the Closing
Date;     26  except to the extent that such Taxes above are subject to
indemnification by the Seller pursuant to Section 9.8(a)(1)-(5) above.  
(c) The Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless (on an after tax
basis and net of any directly related tax credit or deduction that the Seller
actually obtains) the Seller from any Taxes not subject to indemnification
pursuant to paragraph (a), including but not limited to Taxes (1) resulting
from any transaction (i) occurring on the Closing Date after the Closing that
is not in the ordinary course of business, (ii) occurring after the Closing
Date or (iii) occurring during a Pre-Closing Tax Period as a result of any
action by the Purchaser or by the Seller at the direction of the Purchaser
(including, without limitation, any Taxes resulting from, arising out of or
due to any action or election taken by the Seller at the request or direction
of the Purchaser) or (2) imposed on Newco with respect to any taxable period
or portion thereof that begins after the Closing Date.   (d) For purposes of
this Section, in the case of Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and
are payable for a Tax period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing
Date, the portion of such Tax related to the portion of such Tax period
ending on and including the Closing Date shall (1) in the case of any Taxes
other than gross receipts, sales or use Taxes and Taxes based upon or related
to income, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the
Tax period ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator of
which is the number of days in the entire Tax period, and (2) in the case of
any Tax based upon or related to income and any gross receipts, sales or use
Tax, be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant Tax
period ended on and included the Closing Date. All determinations necessary
to give effect to the allocation set forth in the foregoing clause (2) shall
be made in a manner consistent with prior practice of Newco.   9.9.
