_AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of July 23,
2019, is made and entered into by and among Wesbanco, Inc., a West Virginia
corporation ("Buyer"), Wesbanco Bank, Inc., a West Virginia banking
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer ("Buyer Sub"), Old Line
Bancshares, Inc., a Maryland corporation ("Seller"), and Old Line Bank, a
trust company with commercial banking powers chartered under the laws of the
State of Maryland and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Seller ("Seller Sub").
Buyer and Seller are sometimes hereinafter collectively referred to as the
"Constituent Corporations." References herein to a "party" (with respect to
being a party to this Agreement) mean either (i) Seller and Seller Sub,
on the one hand, or (ii) Buyer and Buyer Sub, on the other hand.

W I T N E S S E T H:

 

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Seller, Seller Sub, Buyer and Buyer Sub
have each determined that it is in the best interests of their respective
corporations and shareholders for Buyer to acquire Seller pursuant to a merger
of Seller with and into Buyer (the "Merger") and, immediately after the
Merger, a merger of Seller Sub with and into Buyer Sub (the "Bank Merger"),
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; and

 

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Seller, Seller Sub, Buyer and Buyer Sub
have each approved this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; and

WHEREAS, as a result of the Merger, in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, Seller will cease to have a separate corporate existence and the
stockholders of Seller will receive from Buyer in exchange for each share of
common stock, $0.01 par value, of Seller (individually a "Seller Share" and
collectively "Seller Shares"), 0.7844 of a share of common stock, $2.0833 par
value per share, of Buyer (individually, a "Buyer Share" and collectively, the
"Buyer Shares"), as may be adjusted as provided herein, all as determined in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement; and

WHEREAS, as a condition to the willingness of Buyer to enter into this
Agreement, all of the executive officers and directors of Seller, in their
capacity as stockholders (the "Voting Agreement Stockholders"), have each
entered into separate Voting Agreements, dated as of the date hereof, with
Buyer (each a "Voting Agreement"), a form of which is attached to this
Agreement as _Exhibit A_ , pursuant to which each Voting Agreement Stockholder
has agreed, among other things, to vote such Voting Agreement Stockholders
Seller Shares in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
the Voting Agreement; and 

WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger and 

 



1

    

 the Bank Merger contemplated by this Agreement each qualify as a
"reorganization" under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and that this Agreement is
intended to be and is adopted as a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of
the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder; and

 

WHEREAS, Seller has previously provided to Buyer a schedule disclosing
additional information about Seller (the "Seller Disclosure Schedule"), and
Buyer has previously provided to Seller a schedule disclosing additional
information about Buyer (the "Buyer Disclosure Schedule"); and

 

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and the Bank Merger and also to
prescribe certain conditions to the Merger and the Bank Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and conditions hereinafter
set forth, the parties, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as
follows:

ARTICLE TWO

CONVERSION OF SHARES AND OPTIONS; SURRENDER OF CERTIFICATES

2.01. _Conversion of Seller Shares_

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Buyer, Buyer Sub, Seller, Seller Sub or the holder of any of the
following securities:



     | (a) |

Subject to the other provisions of this Article Two, each Seller Share issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Seller
Shares held directly or indirectly by Buyer or any Subsidiaries (as defined
below) of Buyer or Seller (except for Trust Account Shares and DPC Shares, as
such terms are defined in Section 2.01(b) hereof)) shall, by virtue of this
Agreement and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
converted into and exchangeable for the right to receive, subject to the
provisions set forth in this Agreement, 0.7844 (the "Exchange Ratio") of a
Buyer Share. The 0.7844 of a Buyer Share to be issued in exchange for each
Seller Share pursuant to this Section 2.01 is sometimes referred to herein as
the "Merger Consideration." 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) |

At the Effective Time, all Seller Shares that are owned directly or indirectly
by Buyer or Seller or any of their respective Subsidiaries (other than Seller
Shares (x) held directly or indirectly in trust accounts, managed accounts and
the like or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity for the benefit
of third parties (any such shares, and Buyer Shares that are similarly held,
whether held directly or indirectly by Buyer or Seller, as the case may be,
being referred to herein as "Trust Account Shares") or  

---|---|--- 
 



5

         |

 (y) held by Buyer or Seller or any of their respective Subsidiaries,
directly or indirectly, in respect of a debt previously contracted (any such
Seller Shares, and Buyer Shares that are similarly held, being referred to
herein as "DPC Shares")) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no
Buyer Shares, cash or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor. At the Effective Time, all Buyer Shares that are owned by Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries (other than Trust Account Shares and DPC Shares) shall
become treasury stock of Buyer without any consideration therefor. 

---|--- 
 

2.02. _Seller Equity Awards_

 



     | (a) |

(i) At the Effective Time, each option granted by Seller to purchase Seller
Shares under Sellers stock compensation and stock based incentive plans (the
"Seller Stock Plans"), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a "Seller Stock
Option") shall without any further action on the part of any holder thereof,
be assumed and converted into an option to purchase from Buyer, on the same
terms and conditions as were applicable under such Seller Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, a number of Buyer Shares (rounded
down to the nearest whole share) determined by multiplying (x) the number of
Seller Shares subject to such Seller Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time by (y) the Exchange Ratio, at a per share exercise price
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient obtained by
dividing (i) the per share exercise price for each Seller Share subject to
such Seller Stock Option by (ii) the Exchange Ratio (each, as so adjusted, a
"Converted Seller Option"). All rounding described in this Section 2.02(a)
shall be done on an aggregate basis such that a single rounding of shares and
exercise price shall be applied to each Converted Seller Option. 

---|---|--- 

(ii) The Converted Seller Options shall have the same vesting schedule as the
Seller Stock Options and otherwise shall have the same terms and conditions
as such Seller Stock Options; provided, that Buyer shall convert the Seller
Stock Options into Converted Seller Options in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code and, in the case of Seller Stock
Options that are intended to qualify as incentive stock options within the
meaning of Section 422 of the Code, consistent with the requirements of
Section 424 of the Code, as applicable. After such assumption and conversion,
the Converted Seller Options shall be subject to all of the terms and
conditions of the plan and grant agreements under which the Seller Stock
Options were originally issued (including any applicable change in control or
other accelerated vesting provisions, and this transaction shall constitute a
change in control for all relevant provisions).

 



6

    

(iii) At the Effective Time, Buyer shall reserve for future issuance a number
of Buyer Shares at least equal to the number of Buyer Shares that will be
subject to the Converted Seller Options. As promptly as reasonably practicable
following the Effective Time, Buyer shall file a post-effective amendment to
the Registration Statement or an effective registration statement on Form S-8
(or other applicable form) with respect to the Buyer Shares subject to the
Converted Seller Options, shall distribute a prospectus relating to such Form
S-8, if applicable, and Buyer shall use reasonable commercial efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as such
Converted Seller Options remain outstanding.



     | (b) |

Immediately prior to the Effective Time (but contingent upon the Closing),
each award in respect of a Seller Share subject to vesting or other lapse
restriction granted under a Seller Stock Plan, other than Seller Stock
Options, that is unvested and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (a "Seller Restricted Stock Award") shall fully vest and shall be
cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in respect of each Seller Share underlying such Seller
Restricted Stock Award, less applicable tax withholdings.  

---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

Immediately prior to the Effective Time (but contingent upon the Closing),
each performance-based equity in respect of Seller Shares granted under a
Seller Stock Plan, other than Seller Stock Options, that is unvested and
outstanding at such time (a "Seller Performance Award" and, together with the
Seller Stock Options and Seller Restricted Stock Awards, the "Seller Equity
Awards") shall fully vest (with any performance-based vesting condition
applicable to such Seller Performance Award deemed satisfied at target) and
shall be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in respect of each Seller Share underlying such Seller
Performance Award, less applicable tax withholdings. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) |

At or prior to the Effective Time, Seller, the Seller Board (as defined in
Section 5.03(b)) and the compensation committee of such board, as applicable,
shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions (including obtaining any
Seller or Seller Sub employee consents) that may be necessary to effectuate
the provisions of paragraphs (a)-(c) of this Section 2.02 and to ensure that
following the Effective Time, there are no obligations with respect to Seller
Equity Awards other than as set forth in this Section 2.02. 

---|---|--- 
 

2.03. _Exchange and Payment Procedures_

 



     | (a) |

_Exchange Agent_. Buyer shall designate Computershare Investor Services, LLC
or such other entity as shall reasonably be selected by Buyer to act as 

---|---|--- 
 



7

         |

 agent (the "Exchange Agent") for purposes of conducting the exchange and
payment procedures as described in this Section 2.03. Seller shall provide to
the Exchange Agent all information reasonably requested by Buyer to be
provided to the Exchange Agent in order for it to perform as specified herein. 

---|--- 



     | (b) |

_Deposit with Exchange Agent; Exchange Fund_. At least one business day prior
to the Effective Time, Buyer shall provide to the Exchange Agent the number
of Buyer Shares representing the aggregate Merger Consideration, together with
aggregate cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section
2.03(f) hereto, all of which shall be held by the Exchange Agent in trust for
the holders of Seller Shares (collectively, the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange
Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership with
respect to the Buyer Shares held by it from time to time hereunder, except
that it shall receive and hold for the benefit of the recipients of the Buyer
Shares until distributed thereto pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement
any dividends or other distributions paid or distributed with respect to such
Buyer Shares for the account of the persons entitled thereto. The Exchange
Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than as set forth in this
paragraph. The Exchange Agent shall invest cash in the Exchange Fund, as
directed by Buyer, on a daily basis; _provided_ , _however_ , that all such
investments shall be in (i) obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United
States of America, (ii) commercial paper obligations receiving the
highest rating from either Moodys Investors Services, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, or (iii) certificates of deposit of commercial banks (not
including any Subsidiary (as defined in Section 3.01(c)) or affiliate of
Buyer) with capital exceeding $1.0 billion. All interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to Buyer. 

---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

_Surrender of Seller Certificates_. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, and in no event more than seven business days thereafter,
Buyer shall send or cause to be sent to each former holder of record of Seller
Shares transmittal materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates theretofore
representing the Seller Shares shall pass only upon proper delivery of such
certificates to the Exchange Agent). Each holder of an outstanding certificate
or certificates that prior to the Effective Time represented Seller Shares
("Seller Certificate"), who surrenders such Seller Certificate to the Exchange
Agent shall, upon acceptance thereof by the Exchange Agent, be entitled to
receive (i) the Merger Consideration for each Seller Share represented by the
Seller Certificate surrendered, (ii) any cash in lieu of fractional shares
into which the Seller Shares represented by the Seller Certificate have been
converted, (iii) any other dividend or distribution with a record date after
the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to Buyer Shares issuable in
the Merger, and (iv) subject to compliance with 

---|---|--- 
 



8

         |

 Section 7.08, any dividend or distribution with respect to Seller Shares
with a record date prior to the Effective Time, in each case without interest.
The Exchange Agent shall accept such Seller Certificate upon compliance with
such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to
effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange
practices and shall as promptly as practicable issue the certificates
representing Buyer Shares in accordance with this Agreement. Each Seller
Certificate that is not surrendered to the Exchange Agent in accordance with
the procedures provided for herein shall, except as otherwise herein provided,
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender (a) the Merger Consideration for each Seller Share
represented by such Seller Certificate, (b) any cash in lieu of fractional
shares into which the Seller Shares represented by such Seller Certificate
have been converted, (c) any other dividend or distribution with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to Buyer Shares
issuable in the Merger, and (d) subject to compliance with Section 7.08, any
dividend or distribution with respect to Seller Shares with a record date
prior to the Effective Time, in each case without interest. No dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time with respect
to Buyer Shares shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Seller
Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Seller Certificate
in accordance with this Section 2.03(c). After the surrender of a Seller
Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.03(c), the record holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions,
without any interest thereon, that theretofore had become payable
with respect to Buyer Shares represented by such Seller Certificates. After
the Effective Time, there shall be no further transfer on the records of
Seller of a Seller Certificate representing Seller Shares and, if any such
Seller Certificate is presented to Seller for transfer, it shall be canceled
against delivery of the Merger Consideration for each Seller Share represented
by such Seller Certificate provided in Article Two. 

---|--- 
 



     | (d) |

_Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates._ If there shall be delivered to the
Exchange Agent by any person who is unable to produce any Seller Certificate
for Seller Shares for surrender to the Exchange Agent in accordance with this
Section 2.03: 

---|---|--- 



     | (i) |

evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such
Seller Certificate has been lost, wrongfully taken, or destroyed; 

---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

such security or indemnity as reasonably may be requested by the Surviving
Corporation to save it harmless (which may include the requirement to obtain
a third party bond or surety); and 

---|---|--- 
 



9

         | (iii) |

evidence, to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation, that
such person was the owner of the Seller Shares theretofore represented by
each such Seller Certificate claimed by him to be lost, wrongfully taken or
destroyed and that he is the person who would be entitled to present such
Seller Certificate for exchange pursuant to this Agreement; 

---|---|--- 

then the Exchange Agent, in the absence of actual notice to it that any Seller
Shares theretofore represented by any such Seller Certificate have been
acquired by a bona fide purchaser, shall deliver to such person (A) the Merger
Consideration for each Seller Share represented by the lost, stolen or
destroyed Seller Certificate, (B) any cash in lieu of fractional shares into
which the Seller Shares represented by the Seller Certificate have been
converted, (C) any other dividend or distribution with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to Buyer Shares issuable in the
Merger, and (D) subject to compliance with Section 7.08, any dividend or
distribution with respect to Seller Shares with a record date prior to the
Effective Time, in each case without interest, that such person would have
been entitled to receive upon surrender of each such lost, wrongfully taken or
destroyed Seller Certificate.



     | (e) |

_No Further Ownership Rights in Seller Shares_. All cash in lieu of fractional
Buyer Shares and Buyer Shares issued upon conversion of Seller Shares in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Seller Shares; subject, however,
to the Surviving Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or make any
other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may
have been declared or made by Seller (but only in compliance with the terms of
this Agreement) on such Seller Shares prior to the Effective Time and which
remain unpaid at the Effective Time, subject to compliance with Section 7.08. 

---|---|--- 



     | (f) |

_No Fractional Buyer Shares_. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) |

No certificates or scrip representing fractional Buyer Shares shall be issued
upon the surrender for exchange of Seller Certificates evidencing Seller
Shares, and such fractional Buyer Share interests will not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any rights of a shareholder of the Surviving
Corporation. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) |

Each holder of Seller Shares who would otherwise be entitled to receive a
fractional Buyer Share shall instead receive from the Exchange Agent an
amount of cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(a) the fractional Buyer Share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when
expressed in decimal form) interest to which such holder (after taking into
account all 

---|---|--- 
 



10

         |

 Seller Shares held at the Effective Time by such holder) would otherwise be
entitled by (b) the Average Closing Price (as defined in Section 11.01(d)(v)). 

---|--- 
 



     | (g) |

_Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund delivered to
the Exchange Agent by Buyer pursuant to Section 2.03(b) that remains
undistributed to the stockholders of Seller for six months after the Effective
Time may be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon Buyers demand, and
any stockholders of Seller who have not theretofore complied with this
Article Two shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for
payment of the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional Buyer
Share interest and any dividends or distributions with respect to Buyer
Shares issuable in the Merger, in each case without interest. 

---|---|--- 



     | (h) |

_No Liability_. None of Buyer, Seller, the Exchange Agent or the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any former holder of Seller Shares for any
payment of the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional Buyer
Share interest or any dividends or distributions with respect to Buyer Shares
issuable in the Merger delivered to a public official as and if required by
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

---|---|--- 



     | (i) |

_Withholding Rights_. Buyer or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any cash consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Seller Certificates such amounts as Buyer or the
Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Code, or any other provision of domestic or foreign
(whether national, federal, state, provincial, local or otherwise) tax law. To
the extent that amounts are properly withheld and paid over to the appropriate
taxing authority by Buyer or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the Seller Certificates in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent. 

---|---|--- 



     | (j) __ |

_Waiver_. __ The Surviving Corporation may from time to time, in the case of
one or more persons, waive one or more of the rights provided to it in this
Article Two to withhold certain payments, deliveries and distributions; and no
such waiver shall constitute a waiver of its rights thereafter to withhold any
such payment, delivery or distribution in the case of any person. 

---|---|--- 

__2.04. _ No Dissenters Rights _

Anything contained in this Agreement or elsewhere to the contrary
notwithstanding, no outstanding Seller Shares, Seller Equity Awards or other
shares of Sellers

 



11

    

 capital stock shall have any dissenters or appraisal rights under the MGCL
or otherwise.

 

 __2.05. _ Anti-Dilution Provisions _

 

In the event that, subsequent to the date of this Agreement but prior to the
Effective Time, the outstanding Buyer Shares are increased, decreased,
changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or
securities (or Buyer establishes a record date for effecting any such change
to the outstanding Buyer Shares) as a result of a
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock
split, reverse stock split or other similar changes in Buyers capitalization,
excluding an acquisition by Buyer involving an exchange of Buyer Shares not
resulting in a recapitalization of Buyer, appropriate and proportionate
adjustment shall be made to the Merger Consideration. Nothing contained herein
shall be deemed to permit any action that may be proscribed by this Agreement.

 

 __2.06. _ Conversion of Seller Sub Capital Stock _

 

Immediately after the Effective Time, each issued and outstanding share, and
each share held in the treasury, of capital stock of Seller Sub shall, by
virtue of the Bank Merger and without any action on the part of Buyer, Buyer
Sub, Seller, Seller Sub or the holder thereof, be canceled without any
conversion or issuance of any shares of capital stock of Buyer or Buyer Sub
with respect thereto. No shares of Buyer or Buyer Sub shall be issued or
exchanged and no consideration shall be given for shares of Seller Sub, and
each then-issued and outstanding share, and each share then held in the
treasury, of capital stock of Buyer Sub shall, by virtue of the Bank Merger
and without any action on the part of Buyer, Buyer Sub, Seller, Seller Sub or
the holder thereof, continue as one share of capital stock of the Surviving
Bank Corporation having the same designations, preferences, limitations, and
rights as such share of capital stock of Buyer Sub immediately prior to the
Bank Merger.

_SEC Filings; Sarbanes Oxley_. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) |

Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries have filed all reports, registration
statements, proxy statements and information statements required to be filed
by Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries subsequent to December 31, 2015
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended 

---|---|--- 
 



18

         |

 (the "Securities Act"), or under Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 and 15(d) of the
Exchange Act with the SEC (together with all information incorporated therein
by reference, the "Seller SEC Documents"), except for any reports,
registration statements, proxy statements or information statements that the
failure to file would not have a material adverse effect on Seller. All such
filings, at the time of filing, complied in all material respects as to form
and included all exhibits required to be filed under the applicable rules of
the SEC. None of such documents, as subsequently supplemented or amended prior
to the date hereof, when filed, contained any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  

---|--- 



     | (ii) |

The records, systems, controls, data and information of Seller and the Seller
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Seller or the Seller Subsidiaries or their accountants, attorneys, or
transfer agents (including all means of access thereto and therefrom), except
for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Seller. Seller (A)
has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) to ensure that information relating
to Seller, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, that it is required to
disclose in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
made known to the Sellers management, including its chief executive officer
and the chief financial officer, by others within those entities, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and (B)
Sellers chief executive officer and/or chief financial officer
have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation of Sellers internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the
Exchange Act) prior to the date hereof, to Sellers outside auditors and the
audit committee of the Seller Board (1) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of Sellers internal control
over financial reporting that are reasonably expected to adversely affect
Sellers ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information, and (2) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Sellers
internal control over financial reporting. Each of the principal executive
officer and the principal financial officer of Seller (or each former
principal executive officer and 

---|---|--- 
 



19

         |

 each former principal financial officer of Seller, as applicable) has made
all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 under the Exchange Act and
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (including the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act") with respect
to the applicable Seller SEC Documents, and the statements contained in
such certifications are true and accurate in all material respects. Neither
Seller nor any of the Seller Subsidiaries has outstanding (nor has arranged or
modified since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) any "extensions of
credit" (within the meaning of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) to
directors or executive officers (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange
Act) of Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries. Seller is otherwise in
compliance with all applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, except
for any non-compliance that would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on Seller. As of
the date hereof, Seller does not have any reason to believe that Sellers
principal executive officer and principal financial officer will not be able
to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to Rule 13a-14
promulgated under the Exchange Act when next due. 

---|--- 



     | (iii) |

Since December 31, 2015, (A) through the date hereof, neither Seller nor any
of the Seller Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained
knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether
written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods of Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries or their
respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim that Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries
has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (B) no
attorney representing Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries, whether or not
employed by Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of
a material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or
similar violation by Seller or any of its officers, directors, employees or
agents to the Seller Board or any committee thereof or to any director or
officer of Seller. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (iv) |

During the periods covered by the Seller Financial Statements with respect to
periods ended prior to the date of this Agreement, the independent registered
public accounting firm engaged to express its opinion with respect to the
financial statements included in the Seller SEC Documents is, and has been
throughout the periods covered thereby "independent" within the meaning of
Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X. Dixon Hughes Goodman LLP has not resigned or  

---|---|--- 
 



20

         |

 been dismissed as a result of or in connection with any disagreement with
Seller on a matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement
disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.  

---|--- 



     | (v) |

Since the date of Sellers last definitive proxy statement for its annual
meeting of its stockholders and except as disclosed in the Seller SEC
Documents filed and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement
(the "Seller Filed SEC Documents") (including the financial statements
included therein) or Section 3.01(g) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, no
event has occurred that would be required to be reported by the Seller
pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (h) |

_Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except as set forth in the Seller Filed
SEC Documents (including the financial statements included therein) or in
Section 3.01(h) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule and except as arising
hereunder, Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries have no liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or
otherwise), other than liabilities and obligations that, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on Seller. Except as set forth in the Seller Filed SEC Documents or
otherwise disclosed in Section 3.01(h) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, all
debts, liabilities, guarantees and obligations of Seller and the Seller
Subsidiaries incurred since the Seller Balance Sheet Date have been incurred
in the ordinary course of business and are usual and normal in amount, both
individually and in the aggregate. 

---|---|--- 



     | (i) |

_Absence of Changes_. Except (i) as set forth in the Seller Filed SEC
Documents, (ii) as set forth in Section 3.01(i) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, (iii) provided for or contemplated by this Agreement, or (iv) in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, since the Seller
Balance Sheet Date, there has not been any material adverse change in the
business, operations, assets or financial condition of Seller and the Seller
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, and, to the knowledge of Seller, no fact or
condition exists that Seller believes will cause such a material adverse
change in the future. 

---|---|--- 



     | (j) |

_Loan Documentation_. The documentation ("Loan Documentation") governing or
relating to the material loan and credit-related assets ("Loan Assets")
included in the loan portfolio of the Seller Subsidiaries is legally
sufficient for the purposes intended thereby and creates enforceable rights of
the Seller Subsidiaries in accordance in all material respects with the terms
of such Loan Documentation, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance and other similar laws
relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors rights 

---|---|--- 
 



21

         |

 generally, by general equitable principles (regardless of whether
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and by an
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, except for such
insufficiencies as have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on Seller. Except as set forth in Section 3.01(j) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule, no debtor under any of the Loan Documentation
has asserted as of the date hereof any claim or defense with respect to the
subject matter thereof, which claim or defense, if determined adversely to
Seller, would have a material adverse effect on Seller. All loans and
extensions of credit that have been made by the Seller Subsidiaries comply in
all material respects with applicable regulatory limitations and procedures. 

---|--- 



     | (k) |

_Loans; Nonperforming and Classified Assets_. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) |

To Sellers knowledge, except as would not reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on Seller, each loan agreement, note or borrowing
arrangement, including, without limitation, portions of outstanding lines of
credit, loan commitments and loan guaranties (collectively, "Loans"), on
Sellers or any Seller Subsidiarys books and records, was made and has been
serviced in accordance with Sellers lending standards in the ordinary course
of business; is evidenced by appropriate and sufficient documentation; to the
extent secured, has been secured by valid liens and security interests that
have been perfected; and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation
of the obligor named therein, enforceable in accordance with its terms,
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
fraudulent conveyance and other similar laws relating to or affecting the
enforcement of creditors rights generally, and by general equitable
principles (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in
a proceeding in equity or at law). Seller has previously made available to
Buyer complete and correct copies of its and the Seller Subsidiaries lending
policies. The deposit and loan agreements of Seller and each Seller Subsidiary
were in compliance in all material respects with all applicable laws, rules
and regulations at the time of the account opening, origination, or purchase,
as applicable, and to the knowledge of Seller and Seller Sub, are in such
compliance as of the date hereof, provided, however, that, with respect to
changes in any applicable laws, rules and regulations that became effective
after account opening, origination, or purchase, as applicable, such
representation as to compliance as of the date hereof is applicable solely to
the extent that such changes in laws, rules and regulations retroactively
apply to such agreements. The allowance for loan losses reflected in the
Seller SEC Documents and financial  

---|---|--- 
 



22

         |

 statements filed therewith, has been and will be established in compliance
with the requirements of all law and regulatory requirements applicable to
Seller and Seller Sub and GAAP. The allowance for loan losses reflected in
such documents and financial statements, in the opinion of management, was or
will be adequate as of their respective dates. 

---|--- 



     | (ii) |

Section 3.01(k) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule discloses as of March 31,
2019 with respect to Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries: (A) any Loan under
the terms of which the obligor is 60 or more days delinquent in payment of
principal or interest, or to the knowledge of Seller, in default of any other
provision thereof; (B) each Loan that has been classified as "troubled debt
restructuring," "other loans specially maintained," "classified,"
"criticized," "substandard," "doubtful," "credit risk assets," "watch list
assets," "loss" or "special mention" (or words of similar import) by Seller, a
Seller Subsidiary, or a Governmental Authority (the "Classified Loans"); (C) a
listing of the real estate owned, acquired by foreclosure or by deed in-lieu
thereof, including the book value thereof; and (D) each Loan with any
director, executive officer or 5% or greater stockholder of Seller, or to
the knowledge of Seller, any person controlling, controlled by or under
common control with any of the foregoing. All Loans that are classified as
"Insider Transactions" under Regulation O of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System ("Federal Reserve") have been made by Seller or any of
the Seller Subsidiaries in an arms-length manner made on substantially the
same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at
the time for comparable transactions with other persons and do not involve
more than normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features. 

---|---|--- 



     | (iii) |

No borrower or obligor under any Loan by Seller Sub has requested, and Seller
Sub has not allowed, any relief pursuant to the Soldiers and Sailors Civil
Relief Act of 1940. 

---|---|--- 



     | (l) |

_Reports and Records_. Since January 1, 2014, Seller and the Seller
Subsidiaries have filed all reports and maintained all records required to be
filed or maintained by them under the rules and regulations of the Federal
Reserve, the Maryland Commissioner, the FDIC and the Federal Home Loan Bank of
Atlanta (the "FHLB"), except for such reports and records the failure to file
or maintain would not have a material adverse effect on Seller. All such
documents and reports were complete and accurate in all material respects and
complied in all material respects with applicable requirements of law and
rules and regulations in effect at the time such documents and reports were
filed and contained in all material 

---|---|--- 
 



23

         |

 respects the information required to be stated therein, except for such
documents and records the failure to be complete and accurate or to comply
with such laws, rules and regulations or contain such information has not and
would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Seller.
There is no material unresolved violation, criticism or exception by any
Governmental Authority or Regulatory Authority with respect to any report or
letter relating to any examinations of Seller or any of the Seller
Subsidiaries.

     | (m) |

_Taxes_. Except as set forth in Section 3.01(m) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries have timely filed (including all
applicable extensions) all returns, statements, reports and forms (including
elections, declarations, disclosures, schedules, estimates and information
returns) (collectively, the "Tax Returns") with respect to all federal,
state, local and foreign income, gross income, gross receipts, gains, premium,
sales, use, _ad valorem_ , transfer, franchise, profits, withholding, payroll,
employment, excise, severance, stamp, occupancy, license, lease,
environmental, customs, duties, property, windfall profits and other taxes
required to be paid, held, or collected (including any interest, penalties or
additions to tax with respect thereto, individually, a "Tax" and,
collectively, "Taxes") required to be filed with the appropriate tax authority
through the date of this Agreement, or requests for extensions to file such
Tax Returns have been timely filed, granted, and have not expired, except to
the extent that such failures to file or to have extensions granted that
remain in effect, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on Seller. Such Tax Returns, as
amended, are true, correct and complete in all material respects, except to
the extent that the failure of such Tax Returns to be true, correct, and
complete, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to have a material adverse effect on Seller. Seller and the Seller
Subsidiaries have paid and discharged all Taxes shown as due on such Tax
Returns, other than such Taxes that are adequately reserved as shown on the
Seller Financial Statements or have arisen in the ordinary course of business
since the Seller Balance Sheet Date, except where any such failure to pay or
establish adequate reserves, in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on Seller. Except as set forth in
Section 3.01(m) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, neither the Internal
Revenue Service (the "IRS") nor any other taxing agency or authority, domestic
or foreign, has asserted, is now asserting or, to the knowledge of Seller, is
threatening to assert, against Seller or any Seller Subsidiary any deficiency
for Taxes or claim for additional Taxes that have not been settled, closed, or
reached a final determination, or that have not been adequately reserved for
in the Seller Financial Statements, except for deficiencies or additional
Taxes that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to have a material adverse effect on Seller. There are no unexpired waivers  

---|---|--- 
 



24

         |

 by Seller or any Seller Subsidiary of any statute of limitations with
respect to Taxes. The accruals and reserves for Taxes reflected in the Seller
Financial Statements are adequate in all material respects for the periods
covered. Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries have withheld or collected and
paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authorities or are properly holding
for such payment all Taxes required by law to be withheld or collected,
except for such failures to withhold or collect as would not reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on Seller. There are no liens for
Taxes upon the assets of Seller or any Seller Subsidiary, other than liens for
current Taxes not yet due and payable and liens that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on Seller. Neither Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary has agreed to make, or is
required to make, any adjustment under Section 481(a) of the Code. Except as
set forth in the Seller Filed SEC Documents or Section 3.01(m) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, neither Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary is a party to
any agreement, contract, arrangement or plan that has resulted, or could
result, individually or in the aggregate, in the payment of "excess parachute
payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. Except as set forth
in Section 3.01(m) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, neither Seller nor any
Seller Subsidiary has ever been a member of an affiliated group within the
meaning of Section 1504 of the Code, other than an affiliated group of which
Seller is or was the common buyer corporation. No Tax is required to be
withheld pursuant to Section 1445 of the Code as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

     | (n) |

_Property and Title_. Section 3.01(n) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule lists
and describes all real property, and any leasehold interest in real property,
owned, leased, or operated by Seller or the Seller Subsidiaries and used in
the business of Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Seller
Real Properties"). The Seller Real Properties constitute all of the material
real property and interests in real property used in the businesses of Seller
and the Seller Subsidiaries. Copies of all leases of Seller Real Properties to
which Seller or any Seller Subsidiary is a party have been provided or made
available to Buyer. The leasehold interests subject to such leases have not
been assigned or subleased. All Seller Real Properties that are owned by
Seller or any Seller Subsidiary are free and clear of all mortgages, liens,
security interests, defects, encumbrances, easements, restrictions,
reservations, conditions, covenants, agreements, encroachments, rights of way
and zoning laws, except: (i) those set forth in the Seller
Financial Statements or Section 3.01(n) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule;
(ii) easements, restrictions, reservations, conditions, covenants, rights of
way, zoning laws and other defects and irregularities in title and
encumbrances that do not materially impair the use thereof for the purposes
for which they are held; (iii) liens securing payments or taxes not yet due
and payable or that are being contested in good faith; and (iv)  

---|---|--- 
 



25

         |

 other defects in title, easements, restrictive covenants and similar
encumbrances that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Seller.
Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries have a valid and enforceable leasehold
interest in or own, and are in rightful possession of, and have good title to,
all of the other material assets used by Seller or any Seller Subsidiary in
the conduct of their respective businesses (except for such assets that are
leased by Seller or any Seller Subsidiary), free and clear of any charge,
mortgage, pledge, security interest, hypothecation, restriction, claim,
option, lien, encumbrance or interest of any persons whatsoever except for
(i) those described in the Seller Financial Statements or Section 3.01(n) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule, (ii) liens securing payments or taxes not yet
due and payable or that are being contested in good faith, and (iii) defects
in title, easements, restrictive covenants and similar encumbrances that,
individually or in the aggregate, do not materially impair the use thereof for
the purposes for which they are held or that have not and would not
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Seller. The assets
of Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are adequate to
continue to conduct the businesses of Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries as
such businesses are presently being conducted. To Sellers knowledge, there
are no applicable laws, conditions of record, or other impediments that
materially interfere with the intended use by Seller or the Seller
Subsidiaries of any of the Seller Real Properties, provided any such intended
future use is substantially similar to its current use. 

---|--- 



     | (o) |

_Legal Proceedings_. Except as set forth in the Seller Filed SEC Documents or
Section 3.01(o) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, there are no actions,
suits, proceedings, claims or investigations pending or, to the knowledge of
Seller and Seller Sub, threatened, in any court, before any Governmental
Authority or in any arbitration proceeding against Seller or any Seller
Subsidiary that, if adversely determined against Seller or any Seller
Subsidiary, could have a material adverse effect on Seller or Seller Sub. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (p) |

_Regulatory Matters._ Except as disclosed (to the extent permitted by
applicable law) in Section 3.01(p) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, none of
Seller, the Seller Subsidiaries or their respective properties is a party to
or subject to any order, judgment, decree, agreement, memorandum of
understanding or similar arrangement with, or a commitment letter or similar
submission to, or extraordinary supervisory letter from, any court or federal
or state governmental agency or authority, including any such agency or
authority charged with the supervision or regulation of financial
institutions (or their holding companies) or issuers of securities or engaged
in the insurance of deposits (including, without limitation, the Federal
Reserve, the Maryland Commissioner, the FDIC, the FHLB, the SEC and The Nasdaq
Stock Market LLC (the "Nasdaq")) or the supervision or 

---|---|--- 
 



26

         |

 regulation of Seller or the Seller Subsidiaries (collectively, the
"Regulatory Authorities") that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or
would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Seller.
Neither Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary has been advised by any Regulatory
Authority that such Regulatory Authority is contemplating issuing or
requesting (or are considering the appropriateness of issuing or requesting),
nor, to the knowledge of Seller, is there any basis for any Regulatory
Authorities to issue or request, any such order, judgment, decree, agreement,
memorandum of understanding, commitment letter, supervisory letter or
similar submission that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on Seller. Seller Sub is "well-
capitalized" (as that term is defined in 12 C.F.R. 325.103(b)(1)).

     | (q) |

Schedule and subject to the required approval of the Merger by the Required
Seller Vote and approval of this Agreement and the issuance of the Buyer
Shares under this Agreement by the Required Buyer Vote, the receipt of the
required approvals, waivers, or consents of Regulatory Authorities and

required notice thereto, the expiration of applicable regulatory waiting
periods and the required filings under federal and state securities laws, the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and compliance with any of the terms or
provisions hereof by Seller and Seller Sub do not and will not (i) conflict
with, or result in a violation of, or result in the breach of or a default (or
which with notice or lapse of time would result in a default) under, or
require any consent, waiver, approval, or similar action pursuant to,
any provision of: (A) any federal, state or local law, regulation, ordinance,
order, rule or administrative ruling of any administrative agency or
commission or other federal, state or local governmental authority or
instrumentality (each, a "Governmental Authority") applicable to Seller or
Seller Sub or any of their respective properties; (B) the articles of
incorporation or bylaws of Seller or Seller Sub; (C) any material agreement,
indenture or instrument to which Seller or Seller Sub is a party or by which
it or its properties or assets may be bound; or (D) any order, judgment, writ,
injunction or decree of any court, arbitration panel or any Governmental
Authority applicable to Seller or Seller Sub, other than, in the case of
clauses (A), (C) and (D), any such conflicts, violations, breaches or defaults
that, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a material adverse
effect on Seller; (ii) result in the termination of, or acceleration of, the
performance required by, or result in a right of termination or acceleration
or the creation of any security interest, mortgage, option, claim, lien,
charge or encumbrance upon or interest in any property of Seller or any
of the Seller Subsidiaries, except where such termination, acceleration, or 

---|---|--- 
 



27

         |

 creation, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a material
adverse effect on Seller; or (iii) violate the terms or conditions of, or
result in the cancellation, modification, revocation or suspension of, any
material license, approval, certificate, permit or authorization held by
Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries, other than such violations,
cancellations, modifications, revocations or suspensions that, individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on Seller. 

---|--- 



     | (r) |

_Brokers, Finders and Others_. Except for the fees paid or payable to Keefe,
Bruyette and Woods, Inc., Sellers financial advisor ("Sellers Financial
Advisor"), there are no fees or commissions of any sort whatsoever payable by
Seller or Seller Sub to, or, to the knowledge of Seller, claimed by, any
broker, finder, intermediary, or any other similar person in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, except for ordinary
and customary legal and accounting fees. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (s) |

_Employment Agreements_. Except as disclosed in Section 3.01(s) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, neither Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary is a party to
any employment, change in control, severance or consulting agreement not
terminable at will by Seller or such Seller Subsidiary. Neither Seller nor any
Seller Subsidiary is a party to, bound by or negotiating any collective
bargaining agreement, nor are any of their respective employees represented by
any labor union or similar organization. Seller and each Seller Subsidiary are
in compliance with all applicable laws respecting employment and employment
practices, terms and conditions of employment and wages and hours, other than
any noncompliance that, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a
material adverse effect on Seller, and neither Seller nor any Seller
Subsidiary has engaged in any unfair labor practice that would have a
material adverse effect on Seller. 

---|---|--- 



     | (t) |

_Employee Benefit Plans_. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) |

Section 3.01(t)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and
accurate list of all material bonus, incentive, deferred compensation,
pension (including, without limitation, Seller Pension Plans, as defined
below), retirement, profit-sharing, thrift, savings, employee stock ownership,
stock bonus, stock purchase, restricted stock, stock option (including,
without limitation, the Seller Stock Plans), severance, welfare (including,
without limitation, "welfare plans" within the meaning of Section 3(1) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")),
fringe benefit plans, employment, change in control, retention or severance
agreements, consulting agreements or arrangements and all similar practices,
policies and  

---|---|--- 
 



28

         |

 arrangements maintained or contributed to (currently or within the last six
years) by (A) Seller or any Seller Subsidiary and with respect to which one of
the following applies (1) in which any employee or former employee (the
"Seller Employees"), consultant or former consultant (the __ "Seller
Consultants"), officer or former officer (the "Seller Officers"), or director
or former director (the "Seller Directors") of Seller or any Seller
Subsidiary participates or (2) to which any such Seller Employees, Seller
Consultants, Seller Officers or Seller Directors are parties or (B) any
Seller ERISA Affiliate (as defined below) (collectively, the "Seller
Compensation and Benefit Plans"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term
"Seller Compensation and Benefit Plans" shall not include plans, funds,
programs, policies, practices or procedures that are maintained or funded
either (A) by Seller Employees, Seller Consultants, Seller Officers or Seller
Directors for their own benefit or for the benefit of their employees, such
as individual retirement arrangements or plans described in Section 401(a) of
the Code benefiting (or intended to benefit) themselves or persons who are not
Seller Employees or (B) by persons or entities who are not Seller ERISA
Affiliates (as defined below). Neither Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary has
any commitment to create any additional Seller Compensation and Benefit Plan
or to modify or change any existing Seller Compensation and Benefit Plan,
except to the extent required by law and as otherwise contemplated by
Sections 6.02 and 7.02 of this Agreement. 

---|--- 



     | (ii) |

Except in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on Seller, each Seller Compensation and Benefit Plan has been
operated and administered in accordance with its terms and with applicable
law, including, but not limited to, ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the
Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (the "Age Discrimination in
Employment Act"), or any regulations or rules promulgated thereunder, and all
filings, disclosures and notices required by ERISA, the Code, the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and any other
applicable law have been timely made. Each Seller Compensation and Benefit
Plan that is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section
3(2) of ERISA (a "Seller Pension Plan") and which is intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter
(including a determination that the related trust under such
Seller Compensation and Benefit Plan is exempt from tax under Section 501(a)
of the Code) from the IRS, or is in the form of a prototype or volume
submitter plan that is the subject of a favorable opinion letter from the IRS
upon which Seller is entitled to rely, and Seller is not 

---|---|--- 
 



29

         |

 aware of any circumstances that would reasonably be expected to result in
revocation of any such favorable determination letter or opinion letter. Each
Seller Compensation and Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" (within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) has
been operated in material compliance with Section 409A of the Code, IRS
Notice 2005-1, Treasury Regulations issued under Section 409A of the Code,
and any subsequent guidance relating thereto, and no additional tax under
Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code has been or is reasonably expected to be
incurred by a participant in any such Seller Compensation and Benefit Plan.
There is no material pending or, to the knowledge of Seller, threatened, legal
action, suit or claim relating to the Seller Compensation and Benefit Plans
other than routine claims for benefits thereunder. Neither Seller nor any
Seller Subsidiary has engaged in a transaction, or omitted to take any action,
with respect to any Seller Compensation and Benefit Plan that would reasonably
be expected to subject Seller or any Seller Subsidiary to a tax or penalty
imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA, assuming
for purposes of Section 4975 of the Code that the taxable period of any
such transaction expired as of the date hereof. 

---|--- 



     | (iii) |

No liability (other than for payment of premiums to the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation (the "PBGC") that have been made or will be made on a
timely basis) under Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred
by Seller or any Seller Subsidiary with respect to any ongoing, frozen or
terminated "single-employer plan," within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15)
of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by any of them, or any single-
employer plan of any entity (a "Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan") that is
considered one employer with Seller under Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA or
Section 414(b), (c) or (m) of the Code (a "Seller ERISA Affiliate"). During
the past six years, none of Seller, any Seller Subsidiary nor any
Seller ERISA Affiliate has contributed, or has been obligated to contribute,
to a multi-employer plan under Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA (as defined in
ERISA Sections 3(37)(A) and 4001(a)(3)). No notice of a "reportable event,"
within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA, for which the 30-day reporting
requirement has not been waived, has been required to be filed for any Seller
Compensation and Benefit Plan or by any Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan within
the 12-month period ending on the date hereof, and no such notice will be
required to be filed as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate any Seller
Pension Plan or Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan and, to Sellers knowledge, no
condition exists that presents a 

---|---|--- 
 



30

         |

 material risk that such proceedings will be instituted. There is no pending
investigation or enforcement action by the PBGC, the Department of Labor
("DOL"), the IRS or any other Governmental Authority with respect to any
Seller Compensation and Benefit Plan and, to Sellers knowledge, no such
investigation or action is threatened or anticipated. Under each Seller
Pension Plan and Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan, as of the date of the most
recent actuarial valuation performed prior to the date of this Agreement, the
actuarially determined present value of all "benefit liabilities," within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as determined on the basis of the
actuarial assumptions contained in such actuarial valuation of such Seller
Pension Plan or Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan), did not exceed the then current
value of the assets of such Seller Pension Plan or Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan
and since such date there has been neither an adverse change in the financial
condition of such Seller Pension Plan or Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan nor any
amendment or other change to such Seller Pension Plan or Seller ERISA
Affiliate Plan that would increase the amount of benefits thereunder that
reasonably could be expected to change such result and that, individually or
in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on Seller. 

---|--- 
 



     | (iv) |

All contributions required to be made under the terms of any Seller
Compensation and Benefit Plan or Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan or any employee
benefit arrangements under any collective bargaining agreement to which Seller
or any Seller Subsidiary is a party have been timely made or have been
reflected on the Seller Financial Statements. Neither any Seller Pension Plan
nor any Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan has an "accumulated funding deficiency"
(whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or
Section 302 of ERISA, and all required payments to the PBGC with respect to
each Seller Pension Plan and each Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan have been made
on or before their due dates. None of Seller, any Seller Subsidiary nor any
Seller ERISA Affiliate (A) has provided, or would reasonably be expected
to be required to provide, security to any Seller Pension Plan or to any
Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code, and
(B) has taken any action, or omitted to take any action, that has resulted, or
would reasonably be expected to result, in the imposition of a lien under
Section 412(n) of the Code or pursuant to ERISA that, individually or in the
aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on Seller. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (v) |

Except as disclosed in Section 3.01(t)(v) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
neither Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary has any obligations to provide
retiree health benefits or life insurance or 

---|---|--- 
 



31

         |

 other retiree death benefits under any Seller Compensation and Benefit Plan,
other than benefits mandated by Section 4980B of the Code or those derived
from a Seller Pension Plan.  

---|--- 



     | (vi) |

Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries do not maintain any foreign Seller
Compensation and Benefit Plans.  

---|---|--- 



     | (vii) |

With respect to each material Seller Compensation and Benefit Plan, if
applicable, Seller has provided or made available to Buyer true and complete
copies of the existing: (A) Seller Compensation and Benefit Plan documents and
amendments thereto; (B) trust instruments and insurance contracts; (C) most
recent actuarial report and financial statement; (D) most recent summary plan
description; (E) forms filed with the PBGC within the past year (other than
for premium payments); (F) most recent determination letter issued by the IRS;
and (G) any Form 5310, Form 5310A, Form 5300 or Form 5330 filed within the
past year with the IRS. 

---|---|--- 



     | (viii) |

Except as disclosed in Section 3.01(t)(viii) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
would not, directly or indirectly (including, without limitation, as a result
of any termination of employment prior to or following the Effective Time),
reasonably be expected to (A) entitle any Seller Employee, Seller Consultant
or Seller Director to any payment from Seller or any Seller Affiliate
(including severance pay or similar compensation, other than severance pay or
compensation as otherwise provided under Section 6.02(a)) or any increase in
compensation, (B) result in the vesting or acceleration of any benefits under
any Seller Compensation and Benefit Plan, or (C) result in any material
increase in benefits payable under any Seller Compensation and Benefit Plan. 

---|---|--- 



     | (ix) |

Except as disclosed in Section 3.01(t)(ix) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
neither Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary maintains any compensation plans,
programs or arrangements, the payments under which would not reasonably be
expected to be deductible as a result of the limitations under Section 162(m)
of the Code and the regulations issued thereunder, including all payments to
be made to James W. Cornelsen in connection with the Merger. 

---|---|--- 



     | (u) |

_Compliance with Laws_. Except as set forth on Section 3.01(u) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, or except with respect to Environmental Laws (as defined

Authorities that are required in order to permit it to own or lease its
properties and to conduct its business as presently conducted, including
licensing of mortgage lenders and originators, except where the failure to
obtain any of the foregoing or to make any such filing, application or
registration has not had or would not have a material adverse effect on
Seller; all such permits, licenses, certificates of authority, orders and
approvals are in full force and effect and to Sellers knowledge, no
suspension or cancellation of any of them has been threatened in writing,
except where such failure to have such permits, licenses, certificates of
authority, orders and approvals in full force and effect, individually or in
the aggregate, has not had or would not reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on Seller; 

---|---|--- 



     | (iii) |

has received no written notification or communication from any Governmental
Authority since January 1, 2017, (A) asserting that Seller or any Seller
Subsidiary is not in compliance with any of the statutes, regulations or
ordinances that such Governmental Authority enforces, except for failures to
be in compliance that, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Seller,
or (B) threatening to revoke any license, franchise, permit or governmental
authorization, which revocations, individually or in the aggregate, would
have a material adverse effect on Seller, that has not been resolved to the
satisfaction of the Governmental Authority that sent such notification or
communication. There is no event that has occurred that, to the knowledge
of Seller, would reasonably be expected to result in the revocation of any
such license, franchise, permit or governmental authorization and that would
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on  

---|---|--- 
 



33

         |

 Seller; and 

---|--- 



     | (iv) |

with respect to Seller only, has been and is in compliance with the applicable

Section 3.01(v) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule lists all of the material
insurance policies, binders or bonds maintained by Seller or any Seller

since December 31, 2016. Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries are insured with
reputable insurers against such risks and in such amounts as the management of
Seller reasonably has determined to be prudent in accordance with industry
practices. All such insurance policies are in full force and effect, Seller
and the Seller Subsidiaries are not in material default thereunder and all

had and would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
Seller. 

---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

The savings accounts and deposits of Seller Sub are insured up to applicable
limits by the FDIC in accordance with the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, and
Seller Sub has appropriately accrued and paid all premiums and assessments and

by Buyer or any of the Buyer Subsidiaries subsequent to December 31, 2015
under the Securities Act or under Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 and 15(d) of the
Exchange Act with the SEC (together with all information incorporated therein
by reference, the "Buyer SEC Documents"), except for any reports, registration
statements, proxy statements or information statements that the failure to
file would not have a material adverse effect on Buyer. All such filings, at
the time of filing, complied in all material respects as to form and included
all exhibits required to be filed under the applicable rules of the SEC. None
of such documents, when filed, contained any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) |

The records, systems, controls, data and information of Buyer and the Buyer
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Buyer or the Buyer Subsidiaries or their accountants, attorneys or
transfer agents (including all means of access thereto and therefrom), except
for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Buyer. Buyer (A)
has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) to ensure that information relating
to Buyer, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, that it is required to
disclose in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
made known to the Buyers management, including its chief executive officer
and the chief financial officer, by others within those entities, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and (B)
Buyers chief executive officer and/or chief financial officer
have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation of Buyers internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the
Exchange Act) prior to the  

---|---|--- 
 



46

         |

 date hereof, to Buyers outside auditors and the audit committee of Buyers
Board of Directors (1) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
the design or operation of Buyers internal control over financial reporting
that are reasonably expected to adversely affect Buyers ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information, and (2) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in Buyers internal control over financial reporting. Each
of the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of
Buyer (or each former principal executive officer and each former principal
financial officer of Buyer, as applicable) has made all certifications
required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and
906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to the applicable Seller SEC
Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications are true and
accurate in all material respects. Neither Buyer nor any of the Buyer
Subsidiaries has outstanding (nor has arranged or modified since the
enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) any "extensions of credit" (within the
meaning of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) to directors or executive
officers (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) of Buyer or any of
the Buyer Subsidiaries. Buyer is otherwise in compliance with all applicable
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, except for any non-compliance that would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
material adverse effect on Buyer. As of the date hereof, Buyer does not have
any reason to believe that Buyers principal executive officer and principal
financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations
required pursuant to Rules 13a-14 and 15d-14 promulgated under the Exchange
Act when next due. 

---|--- 



     | (iii) |

Since December 31, 2015, (A) through the date hereof, neither Buyer nor any of
the Buyer Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of
any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or
oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods of Buyer or any of the Buyer Subsidiaries or their
respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim that Buyer or any of the Buyer Subsidiaries has
engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (B) no attorney
representing Buyer or any of the Buyer Subsidiaries, whether or not employed
by Buyer or any of the Buyer Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material
violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by
Buyer or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of
Directors of Buyer or any committee thereof

Documents filed and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement
(the "Buyer Filed SEC Documents") (including the financial statements included
therein) or in Section 4.01(l) of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule and except as
arising hereunder, Buyer and its Subsidiaries (individually "Buyer
Subsidiary" or collectively "Buyer Subsidiaries") have no liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or
otherwise), other than liabilities and obligations that, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on Buyer. Except as set forth in the Buyer Filed SEC Documents or
otherwise disclosed in Section 4.01(l) of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, all

business, operations, assets or financial condition of Buyer and the Buyer
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, and, to the knowledge of Buyer, no fact or
condition exists that Buyer believes will cause such a material adverse
change in the future. 

---|---|--- 



     | (n) |

_Loan Documentation_. The Loan Documentation and Loan Assets included in the
loan portfolio of the Buyer Subsidiaries is legally sufficient for the
purposes intended thereby and creates enforceable rights of the Buyer
Subsidiaries in accordance in all material respects with the terms of such
Loan Documentation, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance and other similar laws
relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally, by
general equitable principles (regardless of whether enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and by an implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealing, except for such insufficiencies as have not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse  

---|---|--- 
 



50

         |

 effect on Buyer. Except as set forth in Section 4.01(n) of the Buyer
Disclosure Schedule, no debtor under any of the Loan Documentation has
asserted as of the date hereof any claim or defense with respect to the
subject matter thereof, which claim or defense, if determined adversely to
Buyer, would have a material adverse effect on Buyer. All loans and extensions
of credit that have been made by the Buyer Subsidiaries comply in all
material respects with applicable regulatory limitations and procedures. 

---|--- 



     | (o) |

_Loans; Nonperforming and Classified Assets_. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) |

To Buyers knowledge, except as would not reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on Buyer, each Loan on Buyers or any Buyer
Subsidiarys books and records, was made and has been serviced in accordance
with Buyers lending standards in the ordinary course of business; is
evidenced by appropriate and sufficient documentation; to the extent secured,
has been secured by valid liens and security interests that have been
perfected; and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the
obligor named therein, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent
conveyance and other similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of
creditors rights generally, and by general equitable principles (regardless
of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
Buyer has previously made available to Seller complete and correct copies of
its and the Buyer Subsidiaries lending policies. The deposit and loan
agreements of Buyer and each Buyer Subsidiary were in compliance in all
material respects with all applicable laws, rules and regulations at the time
of the account opening, origination, or purchase, as applicable, and to the
knowledge of Buyer and Buyer Subsidiaries, are in such compliance as of the
date hereof. The allowance for loan losses reflected in the Buyer SEC
Documents and financial statements filed therewith, has been and will be
established in compliance with the requirements of all law and
regulatory requirements applicable to Buyer and Buyer Sub and GAAP. The
allowance for loan losses reflected in such documents and financial
statements, in the opinion of management, was or will be adequate as of their
respective dates. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) |

Section 4.01(o) of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule discloses as of March 31,
2019 with respect to Buyer and the Buyer Subsidiaries: (A) any Loan in the
amount of $2,000,000 or more ("Buyer Loans") under the terms of which the
obligor is 60 or more days delinquent in payment of principal or interest, or
to the knowledge  

---|---|--- 
 



51

         |

 of Buyer, in default of any other provision thereof; (B) each Loan on Buyer
or any Buyer Subsidiarys books and records in the amount of $2,000,000 or
more that that has been classified as "troubled debt restructuring," "other
loans specially maintained," "classified," "criticized," "substandard,"
"doubtful," "credit risk assets," "watch list assets," "loss" or "special
mention" (or words of similar import) by Buyer, a Buyer Subsidiary, or a
Governmental Authority ("Buyer Classified Loans"); (C) a listing of the real
estate owned, acquired by foreclosure or by deed in-lieu thereof, including
the book value thereof; and (D) each Buyer Loan with any director, executive
officer or 5% or greater shareholder of Buyer, or to the knowledge of Buyer,
any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with any of the
foregoing. All Insider Transactions have been made by Buyer or any of the
Buyer Subsidiaries in an arms-length manner made on substantially the same
terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the
time for comparable transactions with other persons and do not involve more
than normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features. 

---|--- 
 



     | (p) |

_Reports and Records_. Since January 1, 2014, Buyer and the Buyer Subsidiaries
have filed all reports and maintained all records required to be filed or
maintained by them under the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve, the
FDIC and the West Virginia Division of Financial Institutions ("WVDFI"),
except for such reports and records the failure to file or maintain would not
have a material adverse effect on Buyer. All such documents and reports were
complete and accurate in all material respects and complied in all material
respects with applicable requirements of law and rules and regulations in
effect at the time such documents and reports were filed and contained in all
material respects the information required to be stated therein, except for
such documents and records the failure to be complete and accurate or to
comply with such laws, rules and regulations or contain such information has
not and would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
Buyer. There is no material unresolved violation, criticism or exception by
any Governmental Authority or Regulatory Authority with respect to any report
or letter relating to any examinations of Buyer or any of the Buyer
Subsidiaries. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (q) |

_Taxes_. Except as set forth in Section 4.01(q) of the Buyer Disclosure
Schedule, Buyer and the Buyer Subsidiaries have timely filed all Tax Returns
with respect to all Taxes required to be filed with the appropriate tax
authority through the date of this Agreement, or requests for extensions to
file such Tax Returns have been timely filed, granted, and have not expired,
except to the extent that such failures to file or to have extensions granted
that remain in effect individually or in the aggregate 

---|---|--- 
 



52

         |

 would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Buyer.
Such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete in all material respects,
except to the extent that the failure of such Tax Returns to be true,
correct, and complete, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on Buyer. Buyer and the Buyer
Subsidiaries have paid and discharged all Taxes shown as due on such Tax
Returns, other than such Taxes that are adequately reserved as shown on the
Buyer Financial Statements or have arisen in the ordinary course of business
since the Buyer Balance Sheet Date, except where any such failure to pay or
establish adequate reserves, in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on Buyer. Except as set forth in
Section 4.01(q) of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, neither the IRS nor any
other taxing agency or authority, domestic or foreign, has asserted, is now
asserting or, to the knowledge of Buyer, is threatening to assert, against
Buyer or any Buyer Subsidiary any deficiency for Taxes or claim for additional
Taxes that have not been settled, closed, or reached a final determination,
or that have not been adequately reserved for in the Seller Financial
Statements, except for deficiencies or additional Taxes that, individually or
in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on Buyer. There are no unexpired waivers by Buyer or any Buyer
Subsidiary of any statute of limitations with respect to Taxes. The accruals
and reserves for Taxes reflected in the Buyer Financial Statements are
adequate in all material respects for the periods covered. Buyer and the
Buyer Subsidiaries have withheld or collected and paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Authorities or are properly holding for such payment all Taxes
required by law to be withheld or collected, except for such failures to
withhold or collect as would not reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on Buyer. There are no liens for Taxes upon the assets of Buyer
or any Buyer Subsidiary, other than liens for current Taxes not yet due and
payable and liens that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on Buyer. Neither Buyer nor any
Buyer Subsidiary has agreed to make, or is required to make, any adjustment
under Section 481(a) of the Code. Except as set forth in the Buyer SEC
Documents or in Section 4.01(q) of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, neither
Buyer nor any Buyer Subsidiary is a party to any agreement, contract,
arrangement or plan that has resulted, or could result, individually or in
the aggregate, in the payment of "excess parachute payments" within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code. Neither Buyer nor any Buyer Subsidiary
has ever been a member of an affiliated group within the meaning of Section
1504 of the Code, other than an affiliated group of which Buyer is or was the
common buyer corporation. No Tax is required to be withheld pursuant to
Section 1445 of the Code as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Section 4.01(r) of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, there are no actions,
suits, proceedings, claims or investigations pending or, to the knowledge of
Buyer and the Buyer Subsidiaries, threatened in any court, before any
Governmental Authority or in any arbitration proceeding against Buyer or any
Buyer Subsidiary that, if adversely determined against Buyer or any Buyer
Subsidiary, could have a material adverse effect on Buyer or Buyer Sub. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (s) |

_Regulatory Matters._ Except as set forth in Section 4.01(s) of the Buyer
Disclosure Schedule (to the extent permitted by applicable law), none of
Buyer, the Buyer Subsidiaries or their respective properties is a party to or
subject to any order, judgment, decree, agreement, memorandum of understanding
or similar arrangement with, or a commitment letter or similar submission to,
or extraordinary supervisory letter from, any Regulatory Authorities that,
individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on Buyer. Neither Buyer nor any Buyer
Subsidiary has been advised by any Regulatory Authority that such Regulatory
Authority is contemplating issuing or requesting (or is considering the
appropriateness of issuing or requesting) nor, to the knowledge of Buyer,
is there any basis for any Regulatory Authorities to issue or request, any
such order, judgment, decree, agreement, memorandum of understanding,
commitment letter, supervisory letter or similar submission that, individually
or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on Buyer. Buyer and Buyer Sub are, and at the time of the Merger will
be, "well capitalized" as such term is defined in Regulation Y.

(currently or within the last six years) by (A) Buyer or any Buyer Subsidiary
and in which any employee or former employee (the "Buyer Employees"),
consultant or former consultant (the __ "Buyer Consultants"), officer or
former officer (the "Buyer Officers"), or director or former director (the
"Buyer Directors") of Buyer or any Buyer 

---|---|--- 
 



54

         |

 Subsidiary participates or to which any such Buyer Employees, Buyer
Consultants, Buyer Officers or Buyer Directors are parties or (B) any Buyer
ERISA Affiliate (as defined below) (collectively, the "Buyer Compensation and
Benefit Plans"). Neither Buyer nor any Buyer Subsidiary has any commitment to
create any additional Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plan or to modify or
change any existing Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plan, except to the extent
required by law and as otherwise contemplated by Sections 6.02 and 7.02 of
this Agreement. 

---|--- 



     | (ii) |

Except in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on Buyer, each Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plan has been
operated and administered in accordance with its terms and with applicable
law, including, but not limited to, ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the
Age Discrimination in Employment Act, or any regulations or rules promulgated
thereunder, and all filings, disclosures and notices required by ERISA, the
Code, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act and any other applicable law have been timely made. Each Buyer
Compensation and Benefit Plan that is an "employee pension benefit plan"
within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a "Buyer Pension Plan") and which
is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a
favorable determination letter (including a determination that the related
trust under such Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plan is exempt from tax under
Section 501(a) of the Code) from the IRS and Buyer is not aware of any
circumstances that would reasonably be expected to result in revocation of any
such favorable determination letter. Each Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plan
that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (within the meaning of
Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) has been operated in material compliance with
Section 409A of the Code, IRS Notice 2005-1, Treasury Regulations issued under
Section 409A of the Code, and any subsequent guidance relating thereto, and
no additional tax under Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code has been or is
reasonably expected to be incurred by a participant in any such Buyer
Compensation and Benefit Plan. There is no material pending or, to the
knowledge of Buyer, threatened, legal action, suit or claim relating to the
Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plans other than routine claims for benefits
thereunder. Neither Buyer nor any Buyer Subsidiary has engaged in a
transaction, or omitted to take any action, with respect to any Buyer
Compensation and Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to subject
Buyer or any Buyer Subsidiary to a tax or penalty imposed by either Section
4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA, assuming for purposes of Section
4975 of 

---|---|--- 
 



55

         |

 the Code that the taxable period of any such transaction expired as of the
date hereof. 

---|--- 



     | (iii) |

No liability (other than for payment of premiums to the PBGC that have been
made or will be made on a timely basis) under Title IV of ERISA has been or
is expected to be incurred by Buyer or any Buyer Subsidiary with respect to
any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan," within the meaning
of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by any of
them, or any single-employer plan of any entity (a "Buyer ERISA Affiliate
Plan") that is considered one employer with Buyer under Section 4001(a)(14) of
ERISA or Section 414(b), (c) or (m) of the Code (a "Buyer ERISA Affiliate").
None of Buyer, any Buyer Subsidiary nor any Buyer ERISA Affiliate has
contributed, or has been obligated to contribute, to a multi-employer plan
under Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA (as defined in ERISA Sections 3(37)(A)
and 4001(a)(3)) at any time since September 26, 1980. No notice of a
"reportable event," within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA, for which
the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived, has been required to be
filed for any Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plan or by any Buyer ERISA
Affiliate Plan within the 12-month period ending on the date hereof, and no
such notice will be required to be filed as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The PBGC has not instituted proceedings to
terminate any Buyer Pension Plan or Buyer ERISA Affiliate Plan and, to Buyers
knowledge, no condition exists that presents a material risk that such
proceedings will be instituted. There is no pending investigation
or enforcement action by the PBGC, the DOL, the IRS or any other Governmental
Authority with respect to any Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plan and to
Buyers knowledge, no investigation or action is threatened or anticipated.
Except as disclosed in Section 4.01(t)(iii) of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule,
under each Buyer Pension Plan and Buyer ERISA Affiliate Plan, as of the date
of the most recent actuarial valuation performed prior to the date of this
Agreement, the actuarially determined present value of all "benefit
liabilities," within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as
determined on the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in such
actuarial valuation of such Buyer Pension Plan or Buyer ERISA Affiliate
Plan), did not exceed the then current value of the assets of such Buyer
Pension Plan or Buyer ERISA Affiliate Plan and since such date there has been
neither an adverse change in the financial condition of such Buyer
Pension Plan or Buyer ERISA Affiliate Plan nor any amendment or other change
to such Buyer Pension Plan or Buyer ERISA Affiliate Plan that would increase
the amount of benefits thereunder that reasonably could be expected to  

---|---|--- 
 



56

         |

 change such result and that, individually or in the aggregate, would have a
material adverse effect on Buyer. 

---|--- 
 



     | (iv) |

All contributions required to be made under the terms of any Buyer
Compensation and Benefit Plan or Buyer ERISA Affiliate Plan or any employee
benefit arrangements under any collective bargaining agreement to which Buyer
or any Buyer Subsidiary is a party have been timely made or have been
reflected on the Buyer Financial Statements. Neither any Buyer Pension Plan
nor any Buyer ERISA Affiliate Plan has an "accumulated funding deficiency"
(whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or
Section 302 of ERISA, and all required payments to the PBGC with respect to
each Buyer Pension Plan and each Buyer ERISA Affiliate Plan have been made on
or before their due dates. None of Buyer, any Buyer Subsidiary nor any Buyer
ERISA Affiliate (A) has provided, or would reasonably be expected to
be required to provide, security to any Buyer Pension Plan or to any Buyer
ERISA Affiliate Plan pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code, and (B) has
taken any action, or omitted to take any action, that has resulted, or would
reasonably be expected to result, in the imposition of a lien under Section
412(n) of the Code or pursuant to ERISA that, individually or in the
aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on Buyer. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (v) |

Except as disclosed in Section 4.01(t)(v) of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule,
neither Buyer nor any Buyer Subsidiary has any obligations to provide retiree
health benefits or life insurance or other retiree death benefits under any
Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plan, other than benefits mandated by Section
4980B of the Code. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (vi) |

Buyer and the Buyer Subsidiaries do not maintain any foreign Buyer
Compensation and Benefit Plans.  

---|---|---

copies of the existing: (A) Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plan documents and

recent actuarial report and financial statement; (D) most recent summary plan
description; (E) forms filed with the PBGC within the past year (other than

 Schedule, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement would not, directly or indirectly (including, without limitation, as
a result of any termination of employment prior to or following the Effective
Time), reasonably be expected to (A) entitle any Buyer Employee, Buyer
Consultant or Buyer Director to any payment from Buyer or any Buyer Affiliate
(including severance pay or similar compensation) or any increase in
compensation, (B) result in the vesting or acceleration of any benefits under
any Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plan or (C) result in any material increase
in benefits payable under any Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plan.

obtain any of the foregoing or to make any such filing, application or
registration has not had or would not have a material adverse effect on Buyer;
all such permits, licenses, certificates of authority, orders and approvals
are in full force and effect and to Buyers knowledge, no suspension or
cancellation of any of them has been threatened in writing, except where such
failure to have such permits, licenses, certificates of authority, orders and
approvals in full force and effect, individually or in the aggregate, has not
had or would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on

         |

 Buyer or any Buyer Subsidiary is not in compliance with any of the statutes,
regulations or ordinances that such Governmental Authority enforces, except
for failures to be in compliance that, individually or in the aggregate, has
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on Buyer, or (B) threatening to revoke any license, franchise, permit or
governmental authorization, which revocations, individually or in the
aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on Buyer, that has not been

accountants, auditors, other advisors and representatives and records and,
during such period, Seller shall, and shall cause the Seller Subsidiaries to,
make available to Buyer on a prompt basis (i) a copy of each report, schedule,
form, statement and other document filed or received by it during such period
pursuant to the requirements of domestic or foreign (whether national,
federal, state, provincial, local or otherwise) laws and (ii) all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Buyer may
reasonably request (including the financial and tax work papers of
Dixon Hughes Goodman LLP); _provided, however,_ that Buyer and its officers,
employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, and other advisors and
representatives shall conduct such investigation and discussions hereunder in
a confidential manner and otherwise in a manner so as to not unreasonably
interfere with Sellers business operations and customer and employee
relationships. Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries shall not be required to
provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure
would result in the loss of the attorney-client privilege of Seller or the
Seller Subsidiaries or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment,
decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of
this Agreement.

5.02. _Notification_

 

Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, Seller shall promptly
notify Buyer in writing if Seller becomes aware of any fact or condition that
(a) causes or constitutes a breach in any material respect of any of Sellers
or Seller Subs representations and warranties or (b) would (except as
expressly contemplated by this Agreement) cause or constitute a breach in any
material respect of any such representation or warranty had such
representation or warranty been made as of the time of occurrence or discovery
of such fact or condition. Should any such fact or condition require any
change in the Seller Disclosure Schedule, Seller shall promptly deliver to
Buyer a supplement to the Seller Disclosure Schedule specifying such change
("Updated Seller Disclosure Schedule"); _provided, however_ , that
the disclosure of such change in the Updated Seller Disclosure Schedule shall
not be deemed to constitute a cure of any breach of any representation or
warranty made pursuant to this Agreement unless consented to in writing by
Buyer. During the same period, Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of (i) the
occurrence of any breach in any material respect of any of Sellers or Seller
Subs covenants contained in this Agreement, (ii) the occurrence of any event
that may make the satisfaction of the conditions in this Agreement impossible
or unlikely in any material respect or (iii) the occurrence of any event that
is reasonably likely, individually or taken with all other facts, events or
circumstances known to Seller, to result in a material adverse effect with
respect to Seller.

5.03. _No Solicitation_

(a) Seller shall not and shall cause Seller Sub and the respective
officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, financial advisors,
attorneys, accountants, consultants,

 



71

    

 affiliates and other agents of Seller and Seller Sub (collectively, the
"Seller Representatives") not to, directly or indirectly: (i) initiate,
solicit, induce or knowingly encourage, or take any action to facilitate the
making of, any inquiry, offer or proposal that constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal (as defined below);
(ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition
Proposal or furnish, or otherwise afford access, to any person (other than
Buyer) any information or data with respect to Seller or the Seller
Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal; (iii) release
any person from, waive any provisions of, or fail to enforce any
confidentiality agreement or standstill agreement to which Seller is a party;
(iv) enter into any agreement, agreement in principle or letter of intent
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or approve or resolve to approve any
Acquisition Proposal or any agreement, agreement in principle or letter of
intent relating to an Acquisition Proposal; or (v) take any action to render
the provisions of any Takeover Laws inapplicable to any person (other than
Buyer or the Buyer Subsidiaries) or group in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal. Any violation of the foregoing restrictions by any of the Seller
Representatives, whether or not such Seller Representative is so authorized
and whether or not such Seller Representative is purporting to act on behalf
of Seller or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by
Seller. Seller and Seller Sub shall, and shall cause each of the Seller
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing
discussions, conversations, negotiations and other communications with any
person conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing.

 

For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any inquiry,
offer or proposal (other than an inquiry, offer or proposal from Buyer),
whether or not in writing, contemplating, relating to, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, an Acquisition Transaction. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Acquisition Transaction" shall mean (A) any transaction or series
of transactions involving any merger, consolidation, recapitalization, share
exchange, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving Seller or
Seller Sub; (B) any transaction pursuant to which any third party or group
acquires or would acquire (whether through sale, lease or other disposition),
directly or indirectly, any assets of Seller or the Seller Subsidiaries
representing, in the aggregate, 20% or more of the assets of Seller and the
Seller Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis; (C) any issuance, sale or other
disposition (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange or any
similar transaction) of securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase
or securities convertible into, such securities) representing 20% or more of
the votes attached to the outstanding securities of Seller or the Seller Sub;
(D) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in
any third party or group beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of
equity securities of Seller or the Seller Sub; or (E) any transaction which is
similar in form, substance or purpose to any of the foregoing transactions, or
any combination of the foregoing.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.03(a), prior to the
approval of the Merger by the Sellers stockholders by the Required Seller
Vote, Seller may respond to an inquiry and take any of the actions described
in clause (ii) of Section 5.03(a) if, but only if, (i) Seller has received a
bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a
breach of this Section 5.03; (ii) the Seller Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with and having considered the advice of its outside
legal counsel, that failure to take such actions would be reasonably likely
to result in Sellers Directors not acting in accordance with their

 



72

    

 fiduciary obligations under applicable Maryland law; (iii) Seller provides
Buyer with at least two business days notice prior to furnishing any
nonpublic information to, or entering into discussions with, such entity; and
(iv) prior to furnishing or affording access to any information or data with
respect to Seller or the Seller Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to an
Acquisition Proposal, Seller receives from such person a confidentiality
agreement with terms no less favorable to Seller than those contained in the
confidentiality agreement between Seller and Buyer. Seller shall promptly
provide to Buyer any non-public information regarding Seller or the Seller
Subsidiaries provided to any other person or entity that was not previously
provided to Buyer, such additional information to be provided no later than
the date of provision of such information to such other person or entity.

(c) Seller shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify
Buyer in writing if any proposals or offers are received by, any information
is requested from, or any negotiations or discussions are sought to be
initiated or continued with, Seller or the Seller Representatives, in each
case in connection with any Acquisition Proposal, and such notice shall
indicate the name of the person or entity initiating such discussions or
negotiations or making such proposal, offer or information request and the
material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (and, in the case of
written materials relating to such proposal, offer, information request,
negotiations or discussion, such notice shall include copies of such materials
(including e-mails or other electronic communications) unless (i) such
materials constitute confidential information of the party making such offer
or proposal under an effective confidentiality agreement, (ii) disclosure of
such materials jeopardizes the attorney-client privilege or (iii) disclosure
of such materials contravenes any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or
decree). Seller shall keep Buyer informed, on a current basis, of the status
and terms of any such proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or
discussions (including any amendments or modifications to such proposal, offer
or request).

 

(d) Neither the Seller Board nor any committee thereof shall (i)
withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify, or propose to withdraw, withhold,
qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Buyer in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger and the Bank
Merger), the Seller Board Recommendation (as defined in Section 7.06(f)), or
make any statement, filing or release, in connection with the Seller Meeting
(as defined in Section 7.06(e)) or otherwise, inconsistent with the Seller
Board Recommendation (it being understood that taking a neutral position or
no position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal shall be considered an
adverse modification of the Seller Board Recommendation); (ii) approve or
recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal; or
(iii) enter into (or cause Seller or the Seller Subsidiaries to enter into)
any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other
agreement (A) related to any Acquisition Transaction or (B) requiring Seller
to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger, the Bank Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Seller or its
Board of Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the
Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that such
rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant
to such rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.

 



73

    

(f) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.03(d), prior to the
date of the Seller Meeting (as defined in Section 7.06(e)), the Seller Board
may approve or recommend to the stockholders of Seller a Superior Proposal (as
defined below) and withdraw, qualify or modify the Seller Board
Recommendation in connection therewith (a "Seller Subsequent Determination")
after the third business day following Buyers receipt of a notice (the
"Notice of Superior Proposal") from Seller advising Buyer that the Seller
Board has decided that a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal
that it received (that did not result from a breach of this Section 5.03)
constitutes a Superior Proposal (it being understood that Seller shall be
required to deliver a new Notice of Superior Proposal in respect of any
revised Superior Proposal from such third party or its affiliates that Seller
proposes to accept) if, but only if, (i) the Seller Board has
reasonably determined in good faith, after consultation with and having
considered the advice of outside legal counsel, that failure to take such
actions would be reasonably likely to result in Sellers Directors not acting
in accordance with their fiduciary obligations under applicable Maryland law,
(ii) during the three business-day period after receipt of the Notice of
Superior Proposal by Buyer, Seller and the Seller Board shall have
cooperated and negotiated in good faith with Buyer and give due consideration
to such adjustments, modifications or amendments to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement as may be proposed by Buyer in making a determination
whether Seller will proceed with the Seller Board Recommendation without a
Seller Subsequent Determination; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Buyer
nor Seller shall have any obligation to propose any adjustments, modifications
or amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and (iii) at the
end of such three business-day period, after taking into account any such
adjusted, modified or amended terms as may have been proposed by Buyer since
its receipt of such Notice of Superior Proposal, the Seller Board has again
in good faith made the determination (A) in clause (i) of this Section 5.03(f)
and (B) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the changing, qualifying or modifying of the
Seller Board Recommendation or the making of a Seller Subsequent Determination
by the Seller Board shall not change the approval of the Seller Board for
purposes of causing any Takeover Laws to be inapplicable to this Agreement
and the Voting Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, including the Merger and the Bank Merger.

 

For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" shall mean any
unsolicited, bona fide written proposal (on its most recently amended or
modified terms, if amended or modified) made by a third party to enter into an
Acquisition Transaction on terms that the Seller Board determines in its good
faith judgment, after consultation with and having considered the advice of
outside legal counsel and Sellers Financial Advisor (i) would, if
consummated, result in the acquisition of all, but not less than all, of the
issued and outstanding Seller Shares or all, or substantially all, of the
assets of Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis; (ii)
would result in a transaction that (A) involves consideration to the holders
of the Seller Shares that is more favorable, from a financial point of view,
than the consideration to be paid to Sellers stockholders pursuant to this
Agreement, considering, among other things, the nature of the consideration
being offered and any material regulatory approvals or other risks associated
with the timing of the proposed transaction beyond or in addition to those
specifically contemplated hereby, and which proposal is not conditioned upon
obtaining additional financing and (B) is, in light of the other terms of such
proposal, more favorable to Sellers stockholders than the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (iii) is reasonably

 



74

    

 likely to be completed on the terms proposed, in each case taking into
account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal.

 

5.04. _Delivery of Information_

 

Seller shall furnish to Buyer promptly after such documents are available: (a)
all reports, proxy statements or other communications by Seller to its
stockholders generally; and (b) all press releases relating to any
transactions.

 

5.05. _ Takeover Laws_

 

Seller shall take all necessary steps to (a) exempt (or cause the continued
exemption of) this Agreement, the Voting Agreements, the Merger and the Bank
Merger from the requirements of any Takeover Law applicable to it and
comparable provisions in the articles of incorporation or bylaws of Seller or
Seller Sub, and (b) assist in any challenge by Buyer to the validity, or
applicability to the Merger or the Bank Merger, of any Takeover Law.

 

5.06. _No Control_

 

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Buyer, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the operations of Seller or the Seller
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of
Seller and Buyer shall exercise, consistent with the terms of this Agreement,
complete control and supervision over its and its subsidiaries respective
operations.

5.07. _Exchange Listing_

 

Seller shall take all necessary actions, and Buyer shall provide reasonable
cooperation in connection with same, in order to effect the delisting of the
Seller Shares from the Nasdaq Capital Market and the termination of Sellers
registration under the Exchange Act effective contemporaneously with the
Effective Time.

 

5.08. _Section 16_

 

Prior to the Effective Time, Seller Board (or an appropriate committee
thereof) shall approve in accordance with the procedures set forth in Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act and the Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher
and Flom LLP SEC No-Action Letter (January 12, 1999) any disposition of equity
securities of Seller (including derivative securities) resulting from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each officer and director of
Seller who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act.

 

5.09. _Seller Classified Loans_

 

(a) Seller shall promptly (i) after the end of each quarter after the date
hereof, 

 



75

    

 (ii) at other times after reasonably requested by Buyer and (iii) upon
Closing, provide Buyer with a complete and accurate list, including the
amount, of all Loans of Seller and its Subsidiaries subject to each type of
classification of the Classified Loans.

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Seller shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to enter into contracts for the sale of the Classified
Loans identified in Section 5.09 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, which
Classified Loans have been selected by Buyer and Seller for disposition, on
terms reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and Seller; _provided_ , _however,_
that nothing herein shall require any such sale prior to the Effective Time if
Seller reasonably determines any such sale to be contrary to the best
interests of Seller or safe and sound banking practice; _provided, further_ ,
that nothing in this Section 5.09 shall give Buyer a controlling influence
over the management or policies of Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries
prior to the Effective Time. Buyer shall indemnify the Seller and the Seller
Subsidiaries for any losses, fees, expenses and charges incurred by Seller in
connection therewith if the Merger is not consummated in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement.

 

5.10. _401(k) Plan Matters; Other Benefit Plan Matters_

 

(a) _401(k) Plan Matters_. Buyer in its sole discretion may elect
to (i) have Seller terminate the Seller Subs 401(k) Plan (the "Seller 401(k)
Plan") immediately prior to the Effective Time and contingent upon the
occurrence of the Closing by resolutions adopted by the boards of
directors of Seller and/or Seller Sub, on terms acceptable to Buyer, or (ii)
merge the Seller 401(k) Plan with and into the Buyers Employee Stock
Ownership and 401(k) plan (the "Buyer 401(k) Plan") after the Effective Time.
In no event shall the Seller 401(k) Plan be merged with and into the Buyer
401(k) Plan, unless Buyer determines in its reasonable judgment that (A) the
Seller 401(k) Plan is a qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code, both
as to the form of the Seller 401(k) Plan and as to its operation, and (B)
there are no facts in existence that would be reasonably likely to adversely
affect the qualified status of the Seller 401(k) Plan.

 

If Buyer determines in its sole discretion not to merge the Seller 401(k) Plan
into the Buyer 401(k) Plan and that the Seller 401(k) Plan should be
terminated immediately prior to the Effective Time, Seller agrees to take all
action necessary to have the Seller 401(k) Plan terminated immediately prior
to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that Buyer has delivered to Seller
written notice of Buyers determination to terminate the Seller 401(k) Plan at
least 30 days prior to the Closing Date; and _provided_ , _further_ , that
Buyer agrees that prior to such termination, Seller is permitted to amend the
Seller 401(k) Plan, to the extent permitted under applicable law, rules,
regulations, guidance, and interpretations thereof, to allow the rollover in
kind of any outstanding plan loans held in participant accounts. If Buyer
determines that the Seller 401(k) Plan should be so terminated, the accounts
of all participants and beneficiaries in the Seller 401(k) Plan as of such
termination shall become fully vested upon termination of the Seller 401(k)
Plan. As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, the account
balances in the Seller 401(k) Plan shall be either distributed to participants
and beneficiaries or rolled over to an eligible tax-qualified retirement plan
or individual retirement account as a participant or beneficiary may direct
in accordance with plan terms. Buyer agrees to permit Continuing

 



76

    

 Employees to rollover their account balances in the Seller 401(k) Plan to
the Buyer 401(k) Plan, including the in-kind rollover of plan loans, which
Buyer agrees in such event to administer according to their terms. Prior to
taking any such action, Seller and Seller Sub shall provide Buyer with a copy
of such resolutions or consent in connection with such Seller 401(k) Plan
termination, and shall consider any comments provided by Buyer in good faith.
Buyer shall indemnify Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries for any losses, fees,
expenses and charges incurred by Seller in connection with the termination of
the Seller 401(k) Plan if the Merger is not consummated in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement.

(b) _Other Benefit Plans_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time and
subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time, Seller and Seller Sub shall,
at the request of Buyer, freeze or terminate each other Seller Compensation
and Benefit Plan as requested by Buyer subject to and in accordance with
applicable law.

ARTICLE SIX

 

FURTHER COVENANTS OF BUYER

Subsidiary (i) who are not offered the opportunity to continue as employees
of Buyer or an appropriate Buyer Subsidiary following the Effective Time, (ii)
whose position is eliminated or who is not offered comparable employment with
Buyer or a Buyer Subsidiary, or (iii) who are terminated without Cause within

and nature to be agreed upon by Seller and Buyer prior to the Effective Time
and with a cost of up to $2,500 for each such employee of Seller or a Seller

be deemed to be a contract of employment or be construed to give said
employees any rights other than as employees at 

---|---|--- 
 



77

         |

 will under applicable law. From and after the Effective Time, the employees
of Seller and any Seller Subsidiary who remain employees of Buyer or any Buyer
Subsidiary after the Effective Time (including employees who are parties to
employment or change in control agreements) ("Continuing Employees") shall be
provided with employee benefits that are substantially similar to employee
benefits provided to other comparable employees under the Buyer Compensation
and Benefit Plans (excluding for this purpose any equity-based incentive
plans). Each Continuing Employee shall be credited with years of service with
Seller or Seller Sub for purposes of eligibility, vesting, entitlements to
benefits and levels of benefits (but not for benefit accrual purposes under
any defined benefit plan or agreement) in the employee benefit plans of Buyer,
and shall retain the vacation accrual earned under Sellers vacation policy
as of the Effective Time so that such Continuing Employee shall receive under
Buyers vacation policy a vacation benefit no less than what such Continuing
Employee had earned under Sellers vacation policy as of the Effective Time; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that any future accrual of benefits shall be in
accordance with Buyers vacation policy, subject to carryover limitations
applicable to such future accruals. In addition, Continuing Employees who
become eligible to participate in a Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plan
following the Effective Time (i) shall receive full credit under such plans
for any deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such
employees and their respective dependents under the applicable Seller
Compensation and Benefit Plan during the portion of the applicable plan year
prior to such participation, and (ii) shall not be subject to any exclusion
or penalty for pre-existing conditions that were covered under Seller
Compensation and Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time, or to
any waiting period relating to such coverage. For purposes of clarification,
and not by way of limitation, all Continuing Employees shall commence
participation in Buyer 401(k) Plan as of the Effective Time, but such
Continuing Employees shall not be eligible to participate in Buyers Defined
Benefit Pension Plan, participation in which has been frozen since July 31,
2007. The foregoing covenants shall survive the Merger, and Buyer shall,
before the Effective Time, adopt resolutions that amend its tax-qualified
retirement plans to the extent necessary to provide for the service credits
applicable to Continuing Employees referenced herein.

best interests of Buyer or Buyer Sub; (b) the continuing inattention to,
neglect of, or inability to perform, the duties to be performed by such
employee; or (c) the deliberate and intentional engaging by such employee in
gross misconduct that is materially and demonstrably injurious to Buyer or
Buyer Sub.

Welborn and such other agreements as may be required to address certain
compensation matters in connection with the Merger, all to be effective at and
conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) |

As of the Effective Time and except as specifically provided elsewhere in this
Agreement, Buyer shall succeed Seller as sponsor and administrator of the
Seller Compensation and Benefit Plans and shall take such action as necessary
to effectuate such changes. Subject to Sections 6.02(a) and except as
specifically provided elsewhere in this Agreement, Buyer may terminate, merge
or amend any Seller Compensation and Benefit Plan or may cease contributions
to any Seller Compensation and Benefit Plan to the extent permitted by
applicable law; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer will provide any benefits
to which Seller Employees or their respective spouses, former spouses or other
qualifying beneficiaries may be entitled by reason of qualifying events
occurring prior to, on or after the Effective Time by virtue of any provisions
of any employee welfare benefit plan or group insurance contract or any laws,
statutes or regulations requiring any continuation of benefit coverage upon
the happening of certain events, such as the termination of employment or
change in beneficiary or dependent status, including, without limitation,
such requirements under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of
1985, as amended, from and after the Effective Time through the remaining
legally-required period of coverage.  

---|---|--- 



     | (d) |

(i) Buyer shall provide a retention pool in the aggregate amount set
forth in Section 6.02(d)(i) of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule (the "Retention
Pool") for the purposes of retaining the services of employees of the Seller
and the Seller Subsidiaries ("Retention Employees") who are key employees.
The Chief Executive Officer of the Seller shall determine, subject to approval
by the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Buyer, the Retention
Employees eligible to receive retention awards from the Retention Pool (each,
a "Retention Bonus") and any criteria for payment of the Retention Bonus, and
shall determine the final allocation of payments from the Retention Pool. Any
Retention Bonus shall be intended to retain the services of the recipient
through, and shall be payable (unless such recipients employment is
terminated (A) by Buyer or Buyer Sub for Cause or (B) by such recipient
without Good Reason, as the case may be, at such time) at, the end of the
month following the conversion of the data processing and information
technology systems of Seller (the "Data Conversion").

79

    

For purposes of this Section 6.02(d), "Good Reason" means either of the
following events or conduct preceding a termination of employment initiated by
an employee: (a) a change in the location of the principal office of the
employee that results in the employees commuting distance being at least 50
miles greater than the employees commuting distance on the date of this
Agreement; or (b) a reduction in the employees base salary of greater than
10%.

 

(ii) Buyer or Buyer Sub shall enter into agreements with the Seller
Employees identified in Section 6.02(d)(ii) of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule
pursuant to which agreements Buyer will agree to grant restricted Buyer Shares
which will cliff-vest on the second anniversary of the grant date if such
Seller Employee remains employed by Buyer or Buyer Sub at that time (the
"Retention Restricted Stock Agreements"), subject to the terms of the
individual Retention Restricted Stock Agreements. Grants under the Retention
Restricted Stock Agreements shall be made and become effective only upon the
applicable Seller Employees becoming employees of the Buyer or Buyer Sub at or
after the Effective Time. No grants under the Retention Restricted Stock
Agreements will be made or become effective before the Effective Time and
Buyer will have no obligation to make such grants if this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 11.01.



     | (e) |

Any employee of Seller or a Seller Subsidiary who has or is party to any
employment agreement, severance agreement, change in control agreement, or
any other agreement that provides for any payment that would be triggered by
the Merger or the Bank Merger shall not receive the severance compensation as
provided for in Section 6.02(a)(A) but will receive the payment provided for
in such agreement upon the occurrence of a triggering event under such
agreement. Any employee of Seller or a Seller Subsidiary who waives and
relinquishes his or her right to any payments under any such agreement will
be eligible for severance compensation as provided in Section 6.02(a)(A). 

---|---|--- 
 

6.03. _Exchange Listing_

 

Buyer shall file a "Listing of Additional Shares Notification Form" with the
Nasdaq for the Buyer Shares to be issued to the former holders of Seller
Shares in the Merger at the time prescribed by applicable rules and

addition, Buyer will use its reasonable best efforts to maintain its listing
on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.

 

6.04. _Notification_

 

Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, Buyer shall
promptly 

 



80

    

 notify Seller in writing if Buyer becomes aware of any fact or condition
that (i) causes or constitutes a breach in any material respect of any of
Buyers or Buyer Subs representations and warranties or (ii) would (except
as expressly contemplated by this Agreement) cause or constitute a breach in
any material respect of any such representation or warranty had such
representation or warranty been made as of the time of occurrence or
discovery of such fact or condition. Should any such fact or condition require
any change in the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, Buyer shall promptly deliver to
Seller a supplement to the Buyer Disclosure Schedule specifying such change
("Updated Buyer Disclosure Schedule"); _provided, however_ , that the
disclosure of such change in the Updated Buyer Disclosure Schedule shall not
be deemed to constitute a cure of any breach of any representation
or warranty made pursuant to this Agreement unless consented to in writing by
Seller. During the same period, Buyer shall promptly notify Seller of (i) the
occurrence of any breach in any material respect of any of Buyers or Buyer
Subs covenants contained in this Agreement, (ii) the occurrence of any event
that may make the satisfaction of the conditions in this Agreement impossible

circumstances known to Buyer, to result in a material adverse effect with
respect to Buyer.

Buyer shall take all necessary steps to (a) exempt (or cause the continued
exemption of) this Agreement, the Merger and the Bank Merger from the

validity, or applicability to the Merger or the Bank Merger, of any Takeover
Law.

From and after the Effective Time, each of Buyer and the Surviving Corporation
shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and
officer of Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in
such capacity) (each an "Indemnified Party") against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities and amounts paid in settlement incurred after the
Effective Time (collectively, "Costs") incurred in connection with any
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, whether arising out
of matters existing or occurring before or after the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at, or after the Effective Time, based in whole
or in part, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to the fact
that such person is or was a director or officer of Seller or any Seller
Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of Seller or a Seller
Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee, trustee, or other agent of any
other organization or in any capacity with respect to any Seller Compensation
and Benefit Plan, including, without limitation,  

---|---|--- 
 



81

         |

 any matters arising in connection with or related to the negotiation,
execution, and performance of this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall also
advance expenses (including, for the avoidance of doubt, reasonable attorneys
fees) as incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection therewith (provided
that any Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification), to the same extent to
which such Indemnified Party would be entitled to be indemnified as of the
date of this Agreement by Seller and/or a Seller Subsidiary pursuant to
applicable law as effect on the date of this Agreement, the Sellers articles
of incorporation and bylaws or the governing or organizational documents of
any applicable Seller Subsidiary. 

---|--- 



     | (b) |

Upon, and for a period of six years after, the Effective Time the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance maintained by Seller and the
Seller Subsidiaries (provided that the Surviving Corporation may substitute
therefor policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the
same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less
advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims arising from actions,
omissions, facts, events, matters, or circumstances that occurred at or
before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be obligated to expend an amount that exceeds 150% of
the current premium attributable to the current policies of directors
and officers liability insurance maintained by Seller and the Seller
Subsidiaries (the "Premium Cap"), and if such premiums for such insurance
would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then the Surviving Corporation shall
cause to be maintained policies of insurance that, in the Surviving
Corporations good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available
at an amount equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, Seller, in
consultation with, but only upon the consent of, Buyer, may obtain at or
prior to the Effective Time a six-year "tail" policy under Sellers and Seller
Subsidiaries existing directors and officers insurance policy providing
equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if and to the
extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that does not exceed the
Premium Cap. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) |

If Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing
or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties and assets to any
person or (iii) transfers, by means of a distribution, sale, assignment or
other transaction, all of the equity securities of the Surviving Corporation
or all or substantially all of its assets, to any person 

---|---|--- 
 



82

         |

 or entity, then, and in each such case, Buyer shall cause proper provision
to be made so that the successor and assign of Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation assumes the obligations set forth in this Section 6.06 and in
such event all references to the Surviving Corporation in this Section shall
be deemed a reference to such successor and assign. 

---|--- 
 



     | (d) |

Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section 6.06(a),
upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
described above, shall promptly notify Buyer thereof; provided that the
failure so to notify shall not affect the obligations of Buyer under Section
6.06(a) unless and only to the extent that Buyer is actually and materially
prejudiced as a result of such failure. 

---|---|--- 



     | (e) |

The provisions of this Section 6.06 shall survive consummation of the Merger
and are intended to be for the benefit of, and to grant third party rights
to, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs
and representatives.

person earlier resigns or is removed for cause in accordance with Buyers or
Buyer Subs articles of incorporation and bylaws, as applicable. The Seller
Appointees shall be James W. Cornelsen and Gregory S. Proctor, Jr., _provided_
, _however_ , that if, prior to the Effective Time, either of the Seller
Appointees shall become ineligible to serve on the Board of Directors of Buyer

not to, take any action that would have, individually or in the aggregate, a

be reasonably expected to, (i) prevent or impede the Merger or the Bank
Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code; or (ii) knowingly take any action that is intended or is
reasonably expected to result in (x) any of its representations and
warranties set forth in this Agreement being or becoming untrue in any
material respect at any time prior to the Effective Time, (y) any of the
conditions to the Merger set forth in Article Eight not being satisfied,
or (z) a material violation of any provision of this Agreement, except, in

fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein not false or misleading, promptly inform the other party thereof and
to take the necessary steps to correct the Registration Statement and the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

with this Agreement in connection with the Merger, and shall include such
recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Buyer shall use
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Required Buyer Vote (including, at
Buyers sole discretion, by retaining an outside proxy solicitation firm at

permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Authorities and Regulatory Authorities, including, as applicable,
without limitation, those required to be filed with the Federal Reserve, the
FDIC, the WVDFI and the Maryland Commissioner, as well as pre-merger
notification forms required by the merger notification or control laws and
regulations of any applicable jurisdiction, as agreed to by the parties, in
any event that are necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Each of Buyer and Seller shall have the right to review in
advance, and to the extent practicable, each will consult with the other, in
each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information,
with respect to, and shall be provided in advance so as to reasonably exercise
its right to review and correct any substantive material inaccuracies
regarding the reviewing party in advance, all material written information

Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act

cause their respective Subsidiaries to, reasonably assist each other to
facilitate the integration, from and after the Closing, of Seller and the
Seller Subsidiaries with the businesses of Buyer and the Buyer Subsidiaries,
without taking action that would, in effect, give Buyer a controlling
influence over the management or policies of Seller or any of the Seller
Subsidiaries, or otherwise violate applicable laws. From the date of this
Agreement through the Closing Date and consistent with the performance of
their day-to-day operations, the continuous operation of Seller and the Seller
Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business and applicable law, rule,
regulation, or interpretation thereof, Seller shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the employees and officers of Seller and the
Seller Subsidiaries to reasonably cooperate with Buyer and Buyer Sub in
performing tasks reasonably required in connection with such integration.

Without limiting the generality of the immediately preceding paragraph, Buyer
agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts to promptly commence
preparations for implementation of the Data Conversion with the goal of
effecting the Data Conversion within a reasonable period after the Effective
Time. Seller agrees to cooperate with Buyer in preparing for the Data
Conversion within the timeframe set forth above, including providing
reasonable access to data, information systems, and personnel having expertise
with Sellers and the Seller Subsidiaries information and data systems; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall not be required to terminate any
third-party service provider arrangements prior to the Effective Time. In the
event that Seller takes, at the request of Buyer, any action relative to third
parties to facilitate the Data Conversion that results in the imposition of
any termination fees or other charges or expenses, Buyer shall indemnify
Seller for all such fees, charges and expenses, and  

---|---|--- 
 



90

         |

 the costs of reversing the Data Conversion process, if the Merger is not
consummated for any reason, other than the breach of this Agreement by Seller
or Seller Sub or the termination of this Agreement by Buyer pursuant to
Section 11.01(c)(iii).

Buyer, Buyer Sub, Seller and Seller Sub acknowledge that the agreements
contained in this Section 11.02 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, Buyer and
Buyer Sub would not enter into this Agreement. The Termination Fee amounts
payable by Seller pursuant to this Section 11.02 constitute liquidated
damages and not a penalty and shall be the sole monetary remedy of Buyer
except in circumstances where no Termination Fee is payable. Accordingly, if
Seller fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 11.02
and, in order to obtain such payment, Buyer commences a suit which results in
a judgment against Seller for the amount set forth in this Section 11.02,
Seller shall pay to Buyer its fees, costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amount of the Termination Fee at a rate per annum equal to

VOTING AGREEMENT

 

VOTING AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of July 23, 2019, by and
between Wesbanco, Inc., a West Virginia corporation (" _Buyer_ "), and the
undersigned holder (the " _Shareholder_ ") of shares of common stock, $0.01
par value ( the " _Seller Shares_ "), of Old Line Bancshares, Inc., a Maryland
corporation (" _Seller_ ").

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Buyer, Wesbanco
Bank, Inc., Seller and Old Line Bank have entered into an Agreement and Plan
of Merger (as such agreement may be subsequently amended or modified, the "
_Merger Agreement_ "), providing for, among other things, the merger of Seller
with and into Buyer (the " _Merger_ ");

WHEREAS, as of the date of this Agreement, the Shareholder beneficially owns
the number of Seller Shares, and holds other rights to acquire the number of
Seller Shares, indicated on _Schedule 1_ attached hereto;

WHEREAS, as used herein, the term " _Shares_ " means all Seller Shares held
by the Shareholder on the date of this Agreement and all Seller Shares that
the Shareholder purchases, acquires the right to vote or acquires beneficial
ownership of (as defined in Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act, but excluding
Seller Shares held by the Shareholder in a fiduciary capacity) prior to the
Expiration Date (as defined in Section 2 below), whether by the exercise of
any stock options or otherwise;

WHEREAS, it is a condition to the willingness of Buyer to enter into the
Merger Agreement that the Shareholder execute and deliver this Agreement; and

WHEREAS, all capitalized terms used in this Agreement without definition
herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals, the mutual
covenants and agreements contained herein, and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Shareholder and Buyer agree as
follows:

1. _Agreement to Vote Shares_. The Shareholder agrees that, prior to the Expiration Date (as defined in Section 2 hereof), at any meeting of the shareholders of Seller, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, or in connection with any written consent of the shareholders of Seller, with respect to the Merger, the Merger Agreement or any Acquisition Proposal, the Shareholder shall: 



     | (a) |

appear at such meeting or otherwise cause the Shares to be counted as present
thereat for purposes of calculating a quorum; and 

---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

vote (or cause to be voted), or execute and deliver a written consent (or
cause a written consent to be executed and delivered) covering, all of the
Shares that such Shareholder shall be entitled to so vote (i) in favor of
approval of the Merger and 

---|---|--- 
        |

 the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and any action
that could reasonably be expected to facilitate the Merger; (ii) against any
action, proposal, transaction or agreement that could reasonably be expected
to result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty, or any
other obligation or agreement, of Seller contained in the Merger Agreement or
of the Shareholder contained in this Agreement, or that could reasonably be
expected to impede, interfere with, delay, discourage, adversely affect,
inhibit or preclude the timely consummation of the Merger or the fulfillment
of a condition under the Merger Agreement to Sellers and Buyers respective
obligations to consummate the Merger or change in any manner the voting rights
of any class of shares of Seller (including any amendments to Sellers
articles of incorporation or bylaws); and (iii) against any Acquisition
Proposal, or any agreement or transaction that is intended, or could
reasonably be expected, to impede, interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage
or adversely affect the consummation of the Merger or any of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. 

---|--- 

Any such vote shall be cast or consent shall be given in accordance with such
procedures relating thereto so as to ensure that it is duly counted for
purposes of determining that a quorum is present and for purposes of recording
the results of such vote or consent.

 

2. _Expiration Date_. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Expiration Date_ " shall mean the earliest to occur of (i) the Effective Time, (ii) the date the Merger Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article Eleven thereof, or (iii) written notice by Buyer to Shareholder of the termination of this Agreement. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, no party shall have any further obligations or liabilities under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that such termination or expiration shall not relieve any party from liability for any willful breach of this Agreement prior to the termination or expiration hereof. 

3. _Agreement to Retain Shares; No Voting Trusts_. 

(a) Until the receipt of the requisite approval of the shareholders
of Seller, the Shareholder shall not, except as contemplated by this
Agreement or the Merger Agreement, directly or indirectly, sell, assign,
transfer, offer, exchange, pledge or otherwise dispose of or encumber
(including, without limitation, by the creation of a Lien (as defined in
Section 4(c) below) (each, a " _Transfer_ "), or enter into any contract,
option, commitment or other arrangement or understanding with respect to, or
consent to, any Transfer of, any Shares beneficially owned by the Shareholder
or the Shareholders voting or economic interest therein. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Shareholder may make Transfers (a) by will or by operation of
law, in which case this Agreement shall bind the transferee, (b) in
connection with estate and charitable planning purposes, including Transfers
to relatives, trusts and charitable organizations, subject to the transferees
agreement in writing, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer,
to be bound by the terms of, and perform the obligations of the Shareholder
under, this Agreement, (c) to another shareholder of Seller who previously
entered into a Voting Agreement with Buyer and (d) with Buyers prior written
consent, such consent to be granted or withheld in Buyers sole discretion.

 



\- 2 -

    

(b) The Shareholder agrees that the Shareholder shall not, and shall
not permit any entity under the Shareholders control to, deposit any of the
Shares in a voting trust, grant any proxies with respect to the Shares or
subject any of the Shares to any arrangement with respect to the voting of
the Shares other than agreements entered into with the Buyer.

4. _Representations and Warranties of Shareholder_. Shareholder hereby represents and warrants to Buyer as follows: 



     | (a) |

the Shareholder has the complete and unrestricted power and the unqualified
right to enter into, execute, deliver and perform his or her obligations
under this Agreement, and no consent, approval, authorization or filing on the
part of the Shareholder is required in connection therewith; 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) |

this Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the
Shareholder and, assuming this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding
agreement of Buyer, is a valid and legally binding agreement of the
Shareholder, enforceable against the Shareholder in accordance with its terms
(except as enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and
similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors
rights or by general equity principles); 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) |

the Shareholder beneficially owns the number of Shares indicated on _Schedule
1_ (the " _Original Shares_ "), free and clear of any liens, claims, charges
or other encumbrances or restrictions of any kind whatsoever (" _Liens_ "); 

---|---|--- 



     | (d) |

except pursuant to this Agreement, the Shareholder has sole, and otherwise
unrestricted, voting and investment power with respect to the Original
Shares, and there are no options, warrants or other rights, agreements,
arrangements or commitments of any character to which the Shareholder is a
party relating to the pledge, disposition or voting of any of the Original
Shares and there are no voting trusts or voting agreements with respect to the
Original Shares; 

---|---|--- 



     | (e) |

the Shareholder does not beneficially own any Seller Shares other than (i) the
Original Shares and (ii) any options, warrants or other rights to acquire any
additional shares of Seller Shares or any security exercisable for or
convertible into shares of Seller Shares indicated on _Schedule 1_ ; 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (f) |

the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Shareholder does not, and
the performance by the Shareholder of his or her obligations hereunder and
the consummation by the Shareholder of the transactions contemplated hereby
will not, violate or conflict with, or constitute a breach of or default (with
or without notice or lapse of time or both) under, any agreement, instrument,
contract or other obligation or any order, arbitration award, judgment or
decree to which the Shareholder is a party or by which the Shareholder is
bound, or any statute, rule  

---|---|--- 
 



\- 3 -

         |

 or regulation to which the Shareholder or the Shareholders property or
assets is subject. 

---|--- 
 

5. _No Solicitation_. From and after the date hereof until the Expiration Date, the Shareholder, solely in his or her capacity as a shareholder of Seller, shall not, nor shall such Shareholder authorize any partner, officer, director, advisor or representative of, such Shareholder or any of his or her affiliates to (and, to the extent applicable to the Shareholder, such Shareholder shall use reasonable best efforts to prohibit any of his or her representatives or affiliates to), (a) initiate, solicit, induce or knowingly encourage, or take any action to facilitate the making of, any inquiry, offer or proposal which constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (b) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal, or furnish, or otherwise afford access, to any person (other than Buyer) any information or data with respect to Seller or any Seller Subsidiary or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal, (c) enter into any agreement, agreement in principle or letter of intent with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, (d) solicit proxies or become a "participant" in a "solicitation" (as such terms are defined in Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act) with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (other than the Merger Agreement) or otherwise encourage or assist any party in taking or planning any action that would compete with, restrain or otherwise serve to interfere with or inhibit the timely consummation of the Merger in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, (e) initiate a shareholders vote or action by consent of Sellers shareholders with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, or (f) except by reason of this Agreement, become a member of a "group" (as such term is used in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) with respect to any voting securities of Seller that takes any action in support of an Acquisition Proposal. 

 

6. _Specific Enforcement_. The Shareholder has signed this Agreement intending to be legally bound thereby. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement was not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and the Shareholder expressly agrees that this Agreement shall be specifically enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with its terms against the Shareholder, in addition to any other remedy that Buyer may have at law or in equity. All of the covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the respective parties and their permitted successors, assigns, heirs, executors, administrators and other legal representatives, as the case may be, but, except as otherwise specifically provided herein, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations of the Shareholder hereunder may be assigned without the prior written consent of Buyer. 

 

7. _No Waivers_. No waivers of any breach of this Agreement extended by Buyer to the Shareholder shall be construed as a waiver of any rights or remedies of Buyer with respect to any other shareholder of Seller who has executed an agreement substantially in the form of this Agreement with respect to Shares beneficially owned by such shareholder or with respect to any subsequent breach by the Shareholder or any other such shareholder of Seller. No waiver of any provisions hereof by either party shall be deemed a waiver of any other provisions hereof by any such party, nor shall any such waiver be deemed a continuing waiver of any provision hereof by such party. 

 



\- 4 -

    

8. _No Ownership Interest_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to vest in Buyer any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of ownership of or with respect to any of the Shares. All rights, ownership and economic benefits of and relating to the Shares shall remain vested in and belong to the Shareholder, and Buyer shall have no authority to direct the Shareholder in the voting or disposition of any of the Shares, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. 

 

9. _Capacity as Shareholder_. The Shareholder is signing this Agreement solely in the Shareholders capacity as a shareholder of Seller, and not in the Shareholders capacity as a director, officer or employee of Seller or any Seller Subsidiary or in the Shareholders capacity as a trustee or fiduciary of any employee benefit plan or trust. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing herein shall in any way (a) restrict a director and/or officer of Seller in the exercise of his or her fiduciary duties, consistent with the terms of the Merger Agreement, as a director and/or officer of Seller or in his or her capacity as a trustee or fiduciary of any employee benefit plan or trust, or (b) prevent or be construed to create any obligation on the part of any director and/or officer of Seller or any trustee or fiduciary of any employee benefit plan or trust from taking any action or omitting to take any action in such capacity. 

 

10. _Entire Agreement; Amendments_. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or modified, and no provisions hereof may be modified or waived, except by an instrument in writing signed by each party hereto. 

11. _Further Assurances_. From time to time and without additional consideration, the Shareholder shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, such additional transfers, assignments, endorsements, proxies, consents and other instruments, and shall take such further actions, as Buyer may reasonably request for the purpose of carrying out and furthering the purpose and intent of this Agreement. 

 

12. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the greatest extent possible. 

 

13. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 

14. _Public Disclosure_. The Shareholder shall not issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement (to the extent not previously issued or made in 

 



\- 5 -

    

 accordance with the Merger Agreement) with respect to this Agreement, the
Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
without the prior consent of Buyer. The Shareholder hereby permits Buyer to
publish and disclose in any document and/or schedule filed by Buyer with the
SEC and in any press release or other disclosure document the Shareholders
identity and ownership of Shares and the nature of the Shareholders
commitments and obligations pursuant to this Agreement.

15. _Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial_. 

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the internal laws of the State of West Virginia, without giving effect to the
principles of conflicts of laws thereof that would cause the application of
the laws of any other jurisdiction.

 

(b) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

16. _No Agreement Until Executed_. Irrespective of negotiations among the parties or the exchanging of drafts of this Agreement, this Agreement shall not constitute or be deemed to evidence a contract, agreement, arrangement or understanding between the parties hereto unless and until (a) the Board of Directors of Seller has approved, for purposes of any applicable anti-takeover laws and regulations and any applicable provision of Sellers articles of incorporation or bylaws, the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement, (b) the Merger Agreement is executed by all parties thereto, and (c) this Agreement is executed by all parties hereto.
