agree to sell to the Purchaser, all of the Sellers' right, title and interest in
and to the Properties for the Purchase Price, subject to and in accordance with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

inspect the Properties and the Improvements (including, without limitation, all
roofs, electric, mechanical and structural elements, and HVAC systems therein),
to perform due diligence, soil analysis and environmental investigations, to
examine the books of account and records of the Sellers with respect to the
Properties, including, without limitation, all leases and agreements affecting
the Properties, and make copies thereof, at such reasonable times as the
Purchaser or its representatives may request by notice to the Sellers (which
notice may be oral). To



                                      -6-
<PAGE>
the extent that, in connection with such investigations, the Purchaser, its
agents, representatives or contractors, damages or disturbs any of the Real
Property, the Improvements or FF&E located thereon, the Purchaser shall, at its
expense, return the same to substantially the same condition which existed
immediately prior to such damage or disturbance. Neither the Purchaser nor any
of its agents, representatives or contractors shall have any right whatsoever to
alter the condition of any Property, or portion thereof, without the prior
written consent of the Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned. The Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Sellers from and against any and all expense, loss or damage which
the Sellers may incur as a result of any act or omission of the Purchaser or its
representatives, agents or contractors in connection with such examinations and
inspections, other than to the extent that any expense, loss or damage arises
from any negligence or misconduct of the Sellers. The provisions of this Section
2.2 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the Closing.

        2.3 DEFECTIVE PROPERTIES. (a) In the event that (i) the Purchaser
reasonably determines that a Property has structural, environmental or other
structural defects or conditions such that (x) expenditures equal to or greater
than three percent (3%) of the Allocable Purchase Price of such Property are
required in order to bring such Property into a reasonably satisfactory
condition in accordance with prevailing standards, as the case may be, for like
hotels, or (y) the calculation with respect to such Property of net operating
income varies by three percent (3%) or more of that set forth in the financial
data provided by the Candlewood Parties to the Purchaser prior to the date
hereof (any such Property being hereinafter referred to as a "Defective
Property"), and (ii) the Purchaser gives written notice thereof to the
Candlewood Parties no later than the expiration of the Review Period (time being
of the essence with respect to the giving of such notice), identifying the
Defective Property or Defective Properties and the specific defects with respect
thereto, the Candlewood Parties shall, subject to paragraph (c) below, be
required to permit the Purchaser to acquire all of the Properties other than
such Defective Property or Defective Properties.

        (b) If, prior to the Closing, (i) any Property suffers a casualty or
condemnation which would cause such Property or Properties to become a Defective
Property, (ii) such Property is not, prior to the Closing, restored to a
condition substantially



                                      -7-
<PAGE>


the same as the condition thereof immediately prior to such casualty or
condemnation, and (iii) the Purchaser provides written notice of same to the
Candlewood Parties no later than the Closing Date, time being of the essence,
the Candlewood Parties shall, subject to paragraph (c) below, be required to
permit the Purchaser to acquire all of the Properties other than such Defective
Property or Properties. Promptly upon learning of the same, the Candlewood
Parties covenant and agree to provide the Purchaser with prompt written notice
of any casualty or condemnation affecting any Property.

        (c) If the Purchaser timely identifies any Defective Property and the
Purchaser and the Candlewood Parties shall, acting reasonably and in good faith
be unable or unwilling to agree that (x) the Candlewood Parties shall, at their
sole cost, remedy the applicable defect prior to the Closing (in which event the
Candlewood Parties shall have the right to adjourn the Closing Date for up to
ninety (90) days for such purpose), (y) the Purchaser shall, notwithstanding
such defect, acquire the Defective Property subject to a reduction in the
Allocable Purchase Price of the Defective Property sufficient to compensate the
Purchaser for such defect (in which event the Seller shall retain all available
insurance or condemnation proceeds) or (z) on the substitution of another
property owned by the Candlewood Parties for such Defective Property, this
Agreement shall, at the Purchaser's option, terminate with respect to such
Defective Property and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocable
Purchase Price of such Defective Property.

        2.4 TITLE MATTERS. Prior to the execution of this Agreement, the
Candlewood Parties have ordered from the Title Company and directed the Title
Company promptly to deliver to the Purchaser a preliminary title commitment, for
an ALTA extended owner's policy of title insurance with respect to each of the
Properties, together with complete and legible copies of all instruments and
documents referred to as exceptions to title (collectively, the "Title
Commitments").

        Prior to the expiration of the Review Period, the Purchaser shall give
the Candlewood Parties notice of any title exceptions (other than Permitted
Encumbrances) which adversely affect any Property in any material respect and as
to which the Purchaser reasonably objects. If, for any reason, the Candlewood
Parties are unable or unwilling to take such actions as may be required to cause
such exceptions to be removed from the Title



                                      -8-
<PAGE>


Commitments, the Candlewood Parties shall give the Purchaser notice thereof; it
being understood and agreed that the failure of the Candlewood Parties to give
such notice within ten (10) Business Days after the Purchaser's notice of
objection shall be deemed an election by the Candlewood Parties not to remedy
such matters. If the Candlewood Parties shall be unable or unwilling to remove
any title defects to which the Purchaser has reasonably objected, the Purchaser
may elect (i) to terminate this Agreement with respect to the affected Property,
in which event, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocable Purchase
Price of the affected Properties and this Agreement shall be of no further force
and effect with respect to the affected Properties or (ii) to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, notwithstanding such title defect, without any
abatement or reduction in the Purchase Price on account thereof. The Purchaser
shall make any such election by written notice to the Candlewood Parties given
on or prior to the fifth Business Day after the Candlewood Parties' notice of
their unwillingness or inability to cure such defect. Failure of the Purchaser
to give such notice shall be deemed an election by the Purchaser to proceed in
accordance with clause (ii) above and such exception shall be deemed a Permitted
Encumbrance.

        2.5 SURVEY MATTERS. Prior to the execution of this Agreement, the
Candlewood Parties have arranged for the preparation of an ALTA survey with
respect to each of the Properties (the "Surveys") by a licensed surveyor in the
jurisdiction in which each such Property is located, which (i) contains an

reason, the Candlewood Parties are unwilling or unable to take such actions as

effect with respect to the affected Properties or (ii) to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, notwithstanding such defect, without any
abatement or reduction in the Purchase Price on account thereof. The Purchaser
shall make any such election by written notice to the Candlewood Parties given
on or prior to the fifth Business Day after the Candlewood Parties' notice of
their inability to cure such defect and time shall be of the essence with
respect to the giving of such notice. Failure of the Purchaser to give such
notice shall be deemed an election by the Purchaser to proceed in accordance

occurring on or about any Property or any portion thereof at any time or times
after the Closing.

        (b) Whenever it is provided in this Agreement that an obligation of the
Candlewood Parties will be assumed by the Purchaser on or after the Closing, the
Purchaser shall be deemed to have also agreed to indemnify and hold harmless the
Candlewood Parties and their respective successors and assigns from and against
all claims, losses, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including,
without limitation, reasonable attorneys' and accountants' fees and expenses)
arising from any failure of the Purchaser to perform the obligation so assumed
on or after the Closing.

        (c) Whenever either party shall learn through the filing of a claim or
the commencement of a proceeding or otherwise of the existence of any liability
for which the other party is or may be responsible under this Agreement, the
party learning of such liability shall notify the other party promptly and
furnish such copies of documents (and make originals thereof available) and such
other information as such party may have that may be used or useful in the
defense of such claims and shall afford said other party full opportunity to
defend the same in the name of such party and shall generally cooperate with
said other party in the defense of any such claim.

        (d) The provisions of this Section 11.1 shall survive the Closing and
the termination of this Agreement.

        11.2 BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS. Each of the parties hereto represents to the
other parties that it dealt with no broker, finder or like agent in connection

                                      -23-

successors and assigns from and against any loss, liability or expense,
including, reasonable attorneys' fees, arising out of any claim or claims for
commissions or other compensation for bringing about this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby made by any broker, finder or like agent other
than such loss, liability or expense arising from the Purchaser's breach of its
representation made in this Section 11.2. The provisions of this Section 11.2
shall survive the Closing and any termination of this Agreement.

        11.3 PUBLICITY. The parties agree that no party shall, with respect to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, contact or conduct
negotiations with public officials, make any public pronouncements, issue press
releases or otherwise furnish information regarding this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated to any third party without the consent of the other
parties, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned, except as required by law or unless such action is taken based on
advice of counsel given in good faith. No party, or its employees shall trade in
the securities of any parent or affiliate of the Sellers or of the Purchaser
until a public announcement of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
has been made. No party shall record this Agreement or any notice thereof,

counsel given in good faith.

                                      -25-
<PAGE>

or warranty contained herein, in any one instance, shall not operate as or be
deemed to be or construed as a further or continuing waiver of any other breach
of such term, condition, covenant, representation or warranty or any other term,
condition, covenant, representation or warranty, nor shall any failure at any
time or times to enforce or require performance of any provision hereof operate
as a waiver of or affect in any manner such party's right at a later time to

This Agreement may not be amended, nor shall any waiver, change, modification,
consent or discharge be effected, except by an instrument in writing executed by
or on behalf of the party against whom enforcement of any amendment, waiver,

        11.6 ASSIGNMENT; SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. This Agreement and all rights
and obligations hereunder shall not be assignable by any party without the
written consent of the other parties, except that (x) Purchaser may assign this
Agreement to any entity wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by the Purchaser
(provided, however, that, in the event this Agreement shall be assigned to any
entity wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by the Purchaser, Hospitality
Properties Trust shall remain liable for the obligation of the "Purchaser"
hereunder) and (y) after the Closing, the Sellers may assign its surviving
rights, if any, under this Agreement to the Tenant. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective legal representatives, successors and permitted assigns. This
Agreement is not intended and shall not be construed to create any rights in or
to be enforceable in any part by any other persons.

        11.7 SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held or
deemed to be, or shall in fact be, invalid, inoperative or unenforceable as
applied to any particular case in any jurisdiction or jurisdictions, or in all
jurisdictions or in all cases, because of the conflict of any provision with any
constitution or statute or rule of public policy or for any other reason, such
circumstance shall not have the effect of rendering the provision or provisions
in question invalid, inoperative or unenforceable in any other jurisdiction or
in any other case or circumstance or of rendering any other provision or
provisions herein contained invalid, inoperative or unenforceable to the extent
that such other provisions are not themselves actually in conflict with such
constitution, statute or rule of public policy, but this Agreement shall be
reformed



                                      -26-
<PAGE>

and construed in any such jurisdiction or case as if such invalid, inoperative
or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein and such provision
reformed so that it would be valid, operative and enforceable to the maximum
extent permitted in such jurisdiction or in such case.

        11.8 COUNTERPARTS, ETC. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement
constitutes the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and shall supersede and take the place of any other
instruments purporting to be an agreement of the parties hereto relating to the
subject matter hereof.

        11.9 GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be interpreted, construed,
applied and enforced in accordance with the laws of The Commonwealth of
Massachusetts applicable to contracts between residents of Massachusetts which
are to be performed entirely within Massachusetts, regardless of (i) where this
Agreement is executed or delivered; or (ii) where any payment or other
performance required by this Agreement is made or required to be made; or (iii)
where any breach of any provision of this Agreement occurs, or any cause of
action otherwise accrues; or (iv) where any action or other proceeding is
instituted or pending; or (v) the nationality, citizenship, domicile, principal
place of business, or jurisdiction of organization or domestication of any
party; or (vi) whether the laws of the forum jurisdiction otherwise would apply
the laws of a jurisdiction other than The Commonwealth of Massachusetts; or
(vii) any combination of the foregoing.

        To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, any action to
enforce, arising out of, or relating in any way to, any of the provisions of
this Agreement may be brought and prosecuted in such court or courts located in
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts as is provided by law; and the parties consent
to the jurisdiction of said court or courts located in The Commonwealth of
Massachusetts and to service of process by registered mail, return receipt
requested, or by any other manner provided by law.

        11.10 PERFORMANCE ON BUSINESS DAYS. In the event the date on which
performance or payment of any obligation of a party required hereunder is other
than a Business Day, the time



                                      -27-
<PAGE>
for payment or performance shall automatically be extended to the first Business
Day following such date.

        11.11 ATTORNEYS' FEES. If any lawsuit or arbitration or other legal
proceeding arises in connection with the interpretation or enforcement of this
Agreement, the prevailing party therein shall be entitled to receive from the
other party the prevailing party's costs and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' fees incurred in connection therewith, in preparation therefor and on
appeal therefrom, which amounts shall be included in any judgment therein.

        11.12 SECTION AND OTHER HEADINGS. The headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not in any way affect the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

        11.13 NONLIABILITY OF TRUSTEES. THE DECLARATION OF TRUST ESTABLISHING
THE PURCHASER, A COPY OF WHICH, TOGETHER WITH ALL AMENDMENTS THERETO (THE
"DECLARATION"), IS DULY FILED WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF ASSESSMENTS AND TAXATION OF
THE STATE OF MARYLAND, PROVIDES THAT THE NAME "HOSPITALITY PROPERTIES TRUST"
REFERS TO THE TRUSTEES UNDER THE DECLARATION COLLECTIVELY AS TRUSTEES, BUT NOT
INDIVIDUALLY OR PERSONALLY, AND THAT NO TRUSTEE, OFFICER, SHAREHOLDER, EMPLOYEE
OR AGENT OF THE PURCHASER SHALL BE HELD TO ANY PERSONAL LIABILITY, JOINTLY OR
SEVERALLY, FOR ANY OBLIGATION OF, OR CLAIM AGAINST, THE PURCHASER. ALL PERSONS
DEALING WITH THE PURCHASER, IN ANY WAY, SHALL LOOK ONLY TO THE ASSETS OF THE
PURCHASER FOR THE PAYMENT OF ANY SUM OR THE PERFORMANCE OF ANY OBLIGATION.
