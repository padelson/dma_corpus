PURCHASE AGREEMENT dated as of February 28, 2011 (this "Agreement"), by and
among POLYONE CORPORATION, an Ohio corporation ("PolyOne"), 1997 CHLORALKALI
VENTURE, LLC, an Alabama limited liability company (the "Seller"), OLIN
CORPORATION, a Virginia corporation ("Olin"), and OLIN SUNBELT II, INC., a
Delaware corporation (the "Purchaser"). Capitalized terms shall have the
respective meanings ascribed to them in Section 6.04.

  

  

WHEREAS, on August 23, 1996, 1997 Chloralkali Venture Inc. (the predecessor of
the Seller), a wholly owned subsidiary of PolyOne, and Olin SunBelt, Inc., a
wholly owned subsidiary of Olin ("Olin SunBelt"), entered into the Partnership
Agreement (the "Partnership Agreement") to form a general partnership pursuant
to the Delaware Uniform Partnership Act (now the Delaware Revised Uniform
Partnership Act) (the "Uniform Partnership Act") operating under the name of
Sunbelt Chlor Alkali Partnership (the "Partnership");

  

  

WHEREAS, the Seller and Olin SunBelt each own a 50% interest in the
Partnership;

  

  

WHEREAS, PolyOne desires to cause the Seller, its wholly owned subsidiary, to
sell its 50% interest in the Partnership (the "Partnership Interests") to the
Purchaser, and Olin desires to cause the Purchaser, its wholly owned
subsidiary, to purchase the Partnership Interests, each upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, agreements and
undertakings contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto,
each intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

  

  

  

ARTICLE I

  

  

  

Purchase and Sale of the Partnership Interests

  

  

SECTION 1.01. Purchase and Sale of the Partnership Interests. On the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Seller shall sell,
transfer and deliver to the Purchaser, free and clear of all Liens (other than
Liens created by the Purchaser or its Affiliates and restrictions on transfers
imposed by applicable Law), and the Purchaser shall purchase, acquire and
accept from the Seller, the Partnership Interests for an aggregate purchase
price equal to the Purchase Price, payable as set forth below.

  

  

SECTION 1.02. Closing Date. The closing of the purchase and sale of the
Partnership Interests (the "Closing", and such purchase and sale, the
"Acquisition") shall take place at the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP,
825 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10019, immediately following the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the parties hereto. The date on
which the Closing occurs is referred to as the "Closing Date". The Closing
shall be deemed to be effective as of the close of business on the Closing
Date.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

SECTION 1.03. Transactions To Be Effected at the Closing. At the Closing:

  

  

(a) the Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser a fully executed assignment
agreement, substantially in the form attached as Exhibit A hereto,
effectuating the transfer of the Partnership Interests from the Seller to the
Purchaser. From and after the Closing, (i) the Purchaser shall be a "Partner"
under the Partnership Agreement and (ii) the Seller shall cease to be a
"Partner" under the Partnership Agreement and shall no longer have any rights
or obligations under the Partnership Agreement, the Operating Agreement or the
Partnership Guaranties.

  

  

(b) Olin, or its designee, shall deliver to PolyOne, or its designee, payment
by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to one or more bank accounts
designated in writing by PolyOne, in an aggregate amount in cash equal to the
Purchase Price.

  

  

(c) PolyOne shall cause to be delivered to Olin duly signed resignations of
the individuals set forth on Schedule A hereto from the Management Committee
of the Partnership or as officers of the Partnership, effective immediately
after the Closing, and shall take such other action as is necessary to
accomplish such resignations.

  

  

(d) Promptly following the Closing, PolyOne shall deliver to Olin all original
books and records of the Partnership currently in the possession of PolyOne,
the Seller or any of their respective officers, directors or employees.

  

  

SECTION 1.04. Earn-out Payments. (a) In addition to the Purchase Price, at
such times as provided in Section 1.04(d), Olin, or its designee, shall pay to
PolyOne, or its designee, the Earn-out Payment for each Calculation Period, if
any, determined in accordance with this Section 1.04. For each Calculation
Period, the "Earn-out Payment" shall be an amount equal to one-half of the
excess, if any, of (i) Distributable Cash for such Calculation Period, minus
(ii) the Threshold Distributable Cash for such Calculation Period. The Earn-
out Payment shall be calculated without regard to the timing of the Closing
Date or the amount of the Closing Date Distribution. If Distributable Cash for
a particular Calculation Period does not exceed the applicable Threshold
Distributable Cash, no Earn-out Payment shall be due for such Calculation
Period. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Olin shall
be entitled to withhold from each Earn-out Payment otherwise payable to
PolyOne under this Agreement such amounts as are required to be withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under any applicable Tax withholding
requirements of the Code or under any provision of state, local, foreign or
other Tax law.

  

  

(b) On or prior to the 60th day after the last day of each Calculation Period
(each such date, an "Earn-out Calculation Delivery Date"), Olin shall prepare
and deliver to PolyOne a written statement (each, an "Earn-out Calculation
Statement"), setting forth in reasonable detail its determination of
Distributable Cash for the applicable Calculation Period and its calculation
of the resulting Earn-out Payment.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) During the 60-day period following the delivery of each Earn-out
Calculation Statement by Olin, PolyOne and its advisors (including its
accountants) shall be given reasonable access to the financial information of
the Partnership and Olin's McIntosh facility (including financial information
with respect to transfers or sales of membrane caustic and chlorine from such
facility), to the extent relating to or affecting the activities of the
Partnership and to the calculation of the applicable Earn-out Calculation
Statement. The Earn-out Calculation Statement shall become final and binding
upon the parties on the 60th day following delivery thereof, unless (i)
PolyOne delivers to Olin prior to such date a Notice of Disagreement with
respect to such Earn-out Calculation Statement or (ii) Olin fails to
substantially comply during such 60-day period with the requirements set forth
in the preceding sentence, in which case, PolyOne's deadline for providing a
Notice of Disagreement shall be extended until the 10th day following Olin's
substantial compliance with such requirements to provide such information.
PolyOne may deliver only one Notice of Disagreement for each Calculation
Period. PolyOne shall not subsequently raise any disagreements with the
applicable Earn-out Calculation Statement other than the disagreements set
forth in such Notice of Disagreement nor adjust or change any disagreement set
forth in such Notice of Disagreement. Each Notice of Disagreement shall be
signed by PolyOne and shall (i) specify in reasonable detail the nature of any
disagreement so asserted, (ii) only include disagreements based on (x) non-
compliance with any of the requirements set forth on Schedule B-2, (y)
mathematical errors or (z) Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash or the Earn-out
Payment not being calculated in accordance with this Section 1.04, and (iii)
specify what PolyOne reasonably believes is the correct amount of Adjusted
EBITDA, Distributable Cash and the Earn-out Payment for such Calculation
Period, including a reasonably detailed description of the basis for its
belief and the adjustments applied in calculating such amounts. A Notice of
Disagreement shall not include any disagreement with any Adjusted EBITDA,
Distributable Cash or Earn-out Payment calculation that has previously become
final and binding upon the parties in accordance with this Section 1.04. If a
Notice of Disagreement is received by Olin within such 60-day period, then the
Earn-out Calculation Statement (as revised in accordance with this sentence)
shall become final and binding upon Olin and PolyOne on the earlier of (A) the
date Olin and PolyOne resolve in writing any differences they have with
respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement or (B) the date
any disputed matters are finally resolved in writing by the Accounting Firm.
During the 30-day period following the delivery of a Notice of Disagreement by
PolyOne, Olin and PolyOne shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing any
differences that they may have with respect to the matters specified in such
Notice of Disagreement. During such period, PolyOne and its advisors
(including its accountants) shall respond to reasonable requests or inquiries
made by Olin and its advisors (including its accountants) regarding the items
contained in the Notice of Disagreement. In the event PolyOne fails to
substantially comply during such 30-day period with the requirements set forth
in the preceding sentence, such 30-day period will be extended until the 10th
day following PolyOne's substantial compliance with such requirements to
respond to such requests or inquiries. At the end of such 30-day period, Olin
and PolyOne shall submit to the Accounting Firm for binding arbitration any
and all matters that remain in dispute and which were properly included in the
applicable Notice of Disagreement, in the form of written briefs prepared by
each party (of which there shall only be permitted the submission of one brief
by Olin and one brief by PolyOne, and neither party shall be permitted to
submit any reply briefs or other materials). Olin and PolyOne shall jointly
instruct the Accounting Firm that it (1) shall review only the matters that
were properly included in the applicable Notice of Disagreement and which
remain unresolved and (2) shall be permitted to ask both parties questions
about their briefs. Olin and PolyOne shall promptly respond to any questions
posed by the Accounting Firm with respect to their respective submissions, but
the Accounting Firm shall not otherwise be permitted to conduct any
independent discovery or fact-finding in connection with its review and
determination of such matters. The Accounting Firm shall make its
determination solely on the basis of (x) non-compliance with any of the
requirements set forth on Schedule B-2, (y) mathematical errors or (z)
Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash or the Earn-out Payment not being
calculated in accordance with the requirements of this Section 1.04 and (4)
shall render its written decision (including the reasons therefor) within 30
days from the submission to it of the matters that remain unresolved. The
determination of the Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on the
parties, and judgment may be entered upon the determination of such Accounting
Firm in any court having jurisdiction over the party against which such
determination is to be enforced. The fees, costs and expenses of the
Accounting Firm incurred pursuant to this Section shall be shared equally by
Olin and PolyOne. The fees, costs and expenses of Olin incurred in connection
with its preparation of the Earn-out Calculation Statement, its review of any
Notice of Disagreement, if any, and its preparation of its written brief
submitted to the Accounting Firm, if any, shall be borne solely by Olin, and
the fees, costs and expenses of PolyOne incurred in connection with its review
of the Earn-out Calculation Statement, its preparation of a Notice of
Disagreement, if any, and its preparation of its written brief submitted to
the Accounting Firm, if any, shall be borne solely by PolyOne.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

(d) Any Earn-out Payment that Olin is required to pay pursuant to Section
1.04(a) shall be paid in full no later than the fifth Business Day following
the date upon which the Earn-out Calculation Statement for the applicable
Calculation Period becomes final and binding upon the parties as provided in
Section 1.04(c) (including the final resolution of any dispute raised by
PolyOne in the Notice of Disagreement for the applicable Calculation Period).
Olin, or its designee, shall pay to PolyOne, or its designee, the applicable
Earn-out Payment by wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or
more bank accounts designated in writing by PolyOne (such account designation
to be made at least two Business Days prior to the payment date).

  

  

SECTION 1.05. Closing Date Distribution. (a) Olin shall cause the Partnership
to make a distribution in cash to each of Olin SunBelt and the Seller, or
their respective designees (each, a "Closing Date Distribution"), payable and
calculated in accordance with this Section 1.05. Each Closing Date
Distribution shall be an amount equal to one-half of the Closing Date
Distributable Cash. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Partnership shall be entitled to withhold from the Closing Date
Distribution otherwise payable to Olin or PolyOne under this Agreement such
amounts as are required to be withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under any applicable Tax withholding requirements of the Code or under
any provision of state, local, foreign or other Tax law.

  

  

(b) On or prior to the 30th day after the Closing, Olin shall prepare and
deliver to PolyOne a written statement (the "Closing Date Distribution
Statement"), setting forth in reasonable detail its calculation of the Closing
Date Distribution.

  

  

(c) During the 60-day period following the delivery of the Closing Date
Distribution Statement by Olin, PolyOne and its advisors (including its
accountants) shall be given reasonable access to the financial information of
the Partnership and Olin's McIntosh facility (including financial information
with respect to transfers or sales of membrane caustic and chlorine from such
facility), to the extent relating to or affecting the activities of the
Partnership and to the calculation of the Closing Date Distribution Statement.
The Closing Date Distribution Statement shall become final and binding upon
the parties on the 60th day following delivery thereof, unless (i) PolyOne
delivers to Olin prior to such date a Notice of Disagreement with respect to
such Closing Date Distribution Statement or (ii) Olin fails to substantially
comply during such 60-day period with the requirements set forth in the
preceding sentence, in which case, PolyOne's deadline for providing a Notice
of Disagreement shall be extended until the 10th day following Olin's
substantial compliance with such requirements to provide such information.
PolyOne may deliver only one Notice of Disagreement with respect to the
Closing Date Distribution Statement. PolyOne shall not subsequently raise any
disagreements with the Closing Date Distribution Statement other than the
disagreements set forth in such Notice of Disagreement nor adjust or change
any disagreement set forth in such Notice of Disagreement. The Notice of
Disagreement shall be signed by PolyOne and shall (i) specify in reasonable
detail the nature of any disagreement so asserted, (ii) only include
disagreements based on (y) mathematical errors or (z) Adjusted EBITDA, the
Closing Date Distributable Cash or the Closing Date Distribution not being
calculated in accordance with this Section 1.05, and (iii) specify what
PolyOne reasonably believes is the correct amount of the Closing Date
Distribution, including a reasonably detailed description of the basis for its
belief and the adjustments applied in calculating such amounts. If the Notice
of Disagreement is received by Olin within such 60-day period, then the
Closing Date Distribution Statement (as revised in accordance with this
sentence) shall become final and binding upon Olin and PolyOne on the earlier
of (A) the date Olin and PolyOne resolve in writing any differences they have
with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement or (B) the
date any disputed

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

  matters are finally resolved in writing by the Accounting Firm. During the
30-day period following the delivery of the Notice of Disagreement by PolyOne,
Olin and PolyOne shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing any
differences that they may have with respect to the matters specified in such
Notice of Disagreement. During such period, Olin and its advisors (including
its accountants) shall have reasonable access to the financial information of
PolyOne, solely to the extent relating to the activities of the Partnership
and to the preparation of the Notice of Disagreement. In the event PolyOne
fails to substantially comply during such 30-day period with the requirements
set forth in the preceding sentence, such 30-day period will be extended until
the 10th day following PolyOne's substantial compliance with such requirements
to respond to such requirements to provide such information. At the end of
such 30-day period, Olin and PolyOne shall submit to the Accounting Firm for
binding arbitration any and all matters that remain in dispute and which were
properly included in the Notice of Disagreement, in the form of written briefs
prepared by each party (of which there shall only be permitted the submission
of one brief by Olin and one brief by PolyOne, and neither party shall be
permitted to submit any reply briefs or other materials). Olin and PolyOne
shall jointly instruct the Accounting Firm that it (1) shall review only the
matters that were properly included in the Notice of Disagreement and which
remain unresolved and (2) shall be permitted to ask both parties questions
about their briefs. Olin and PolyOne shall promptly respond to any questions
posed by the Accounting Firm with respect to their respective submissions, but
the Accounting Firm shall not otherwise be permitted to conduct any
independent discovery or fact-finding in connection with its review and
determination of such matters. The Accounting Firm shall make its
determination solely on the basis of (y) mathematical errors or (z) Adjusted
EBITDA, the Closing Date Distributable Cash or the Closing Date Distribution
not being calculated in accordance with the requirements of this Section 1.05
and (4) shall render its written decision (including the reasons therefor)
within 30 days from the submission to it of the matters that remain
unresolved. The determination of the Accounting Firm shall be final and
binding on the parties, and judgment may be entered upon the determination of
such Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction over the party against
which such determination is to be enforced. The fees, costs and expenses of
the Accounting Firm incurred pursuant to this Section shall be shared equally
by Olin and PolyOne. The fees, costs and expenses of Olin incurred in
connection with its preparation of the Closing Date Distribution Statement,
its review of the Notice of Disagreement, if any, and its preparation of its
written brief submitted to the Accounting Firm, if any, shall be borne solely
by Olin, and the fees, costs and expenses of PolyOne incurred in connection
with its review of the Closing Date Distribution Statement, its preparation of
the Notice of Disagreement, if any, and its preparation of its written brief
submitted to the Accounting Firm, if any, shall be borne solely by PolyOne.

 

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  

(d) Olin shall cause the Closing Date Distributions that the Partnership is
required to pay pursuant to Section 1.05(a) to be paid in full no later than
the fifth Business Day following the date upon which the Closing Date
Distribution Statement becomes final and binding upon the parties as provided
in Section 1.05(c) (including any final resolution of any dispute raised by
PolyOne in the Notice of Disagreement). Olin shall cause the Partnership to
pay to PolyOne its Closing Date Distribution by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to one or more bank accounts designated in writing by PolyOne
(such account designation to be made at least two Business Days prior to the
payment date).

  

  

  

ARTICLE II

  

  

Representations and Warranties of PolyOne and the Seller

  

  

PolyOne and the Seller hereby, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to
Olin and the Purchaser as of the date hereof as follows:

  

  

SECTION 2.01. Organization, Standing and Power. Each of PolyOne and the Seller
is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is organized and has all requisite power and
authority and possesses all governmental franchises, licenses, permits,
authorizations and approvals necessary to enable it to own, lease or otherwise
hold its assets and properties and to carry on its business as currently
conducted, other than such franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations and
approvals the lack of which, individually or in the aggregate, would not and
would not reasonably be expected to materially impede or delay the
consummation of the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the parties' ability to perform their obligations hereunder.

  

  

SECTION 2.02. Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability. Each of
PolyOne and the Seller has full power and authority to execute this Agreement
and to consummate the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated
hereby. The execution and delivery by PolyOne and the Seller of this Agreement
and the consummation by PolyOne and the Seller of the Acquisition and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action. Each of PolyOne and the Seller has duly executed
and delivered this Agreement, and this Agreement constitutes its legal, valid
and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms,
subject, as to enforcement, to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium,
reorganization or similar Laws affecting creditors' rights generally and to
general equitable principles.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

SECTION 2.03. No Conflicts; Consents. The execution and delivery by PolyOne
and the Seller of this Agreement do not, and the consummation of the
Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated hereby and compliance by
PolyOne and the Seller with the terms hereof will not, conflict with, or
result in any breach or violation of or constitute a default (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to loss of a
material benefit under, or to increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed
rights or entitlements of any Person under, or result in the creation of any
Lien upon any of the properties or assets of PolyOne, the Seller or the
Partnership under, any provision of (a) the organizational and governance
documents of PolyOne, the Seller or the Partnership, (b) any contract, lease,
license, indenture, agreement, commitment or other legally binding arrangement
(a "Contract") to which PolyOne or the Seller is a party or by which any of
such Person's properties or assets is bound, (c) the Note Purchase Agreement
and any Note Transaction Document or (d) any judgment, order, writ, ruling,
injunction, binding agreement with a Governmental Entity, stipulation or
decree (a "Judgment") or statute, law (including common law), ordinance, rule
or regulation (a "Law") applicable to PolyOne or the Seller or any of such
Person's properties or assets, other than, in the case of clauses (b) through
(d) above, any such items that, individually or in the aggregate, would not
and would not reasonably be expected to materially impede or delay the
consummation of the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the parties' ability to perform their obligations hereunder.
No consent, approval, license, permit, order or authorization (a "Consent")
of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any Federal, state, local or
foreign government or any court of competent jurisdiction, administrative
agency or commission or other governmental authority or instrumentality,
domestic or foreign (a "Governmental Entity"), is required to be obtained or
made by or with respect to PolyOne or the Seller in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance by PolyOne and the Seller of this
Agreement or the consummation of the Acquisition or the other transactions
contemplated hereby, other than (i) compliance with and filings under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, (ii) compliance with and filings
or notices required by the rules and regulations of the New York Stock
Exchange and (iii) those the failure of which to be obtained or made,
individually or in the aggregate, would not and would not reasonably be
expected to materially impede or delay the consummation of the Acquisition and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the parties' ability
to perform their obligations hereunder.

  

  

SECTION 2.04. The Partnership Interests. As of immediately prior to the
Closing, (a) the Seller will have good and valid title to the Partnership
Interests, free and clear of all Liens (other than Liens created by the
Purchaser or its Affiliates and restrictions on transfers imposed by
applicable Law), and will be the record and beneficial owner thereof and will
have full and unrestricted ownership thereof (including any restriction on the
right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of the Partnership Interests); (b)
the Seller has not sold or otherwise transferred or encumbered or otherwise
restricted any or all of the Partnership Interests or any or all of the right,
title and interests thereto; and (c) the Partnership Interests constitute the
entirety of the Seller's interest in the Partnership. Assuming the Purchaser
has the requisite power and authority to be the lawful owner of the
Partnership Interests, upon delivery to the Purchaser of an executed
assignment agreement regarding the Partnership Interests, and upon PolyOne's
receipt of an amount of cash equal to the Purchase Price, good and valid title
to the applicable Partnership Interests will pass to the Purchaser, free and
clear of all Liens (other than Liens created by the Purchaser or its
Affiliates (excluding the Partnership) and restrictions on transfers imposed
by applicable Law), and the Purchaser will become the record and beneficial
owner thereof and will have full and unrestricted ownership thereof. The

connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and each other
agreement, document and instrument contemplated hereby and the consummation of
the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated hereby (including
fees, costs and expenses of legal counsel, financial advisors and other
representatives and consultants) shall be borne solely by the party incurring
such costs or expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all Transfer Taxes
payable in connection with the consummation of the Acquisition and the other
transactions contemplated hereby shall be shared equally by Olin and PolyOne.

  

  

SECTION 4.02. Tax Matters. (a) The parties hereto agree that for Federal
income tax purposes, (i) as a result of the sale of the Partnership Interests,
the Partnership will terminate pursuant to Section 708(b)(1)(B) of the Code as
of the Closing Date (it being understood that the Partnership will continue to
exist as a general partnership under the Uniform Partnership Act) and (ii) the
Partnership's taxable year will end on (and will include) the Closing Date.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

11  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) The parties hereto shall cause the Partnership to make, for the
Partnership's taxable year that includes the Closing Date, a valid election
pursuant to Section 754 of the Code and any comparable provision of state,
local or non-U.S. Tax law and shall not seek to revoke such election. The
parties hereto agree that any resulting adjustments to the basis of the

after the Closing Date, the parties shall cooperate in good faith and use
their reasonable best efforts to agree on the allocation of any adjustment to
the basis of the Partnership's assets among the Partnership's assets. If no
agreement is reached by the end of such 90-day period, Olin and PolyOne shall
submit to a mutually agreed upon independent third party to conduct a
valuation for purposes of allocation. The determination of the independent
third party shall be final and binding on the parties and the fees, costs and
expenses of the independent third party incurred pursuant to this Section
shall be shared equally by Olin and PolyOne.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Olin and
PolyOne or their respective Affiliates each shall be responsible for any Taxes
imposed on income properly reflected on its respective Schedule K-1 to Form
1065 for the Partnership (or any similar schedule or form under state, local
or non-U.S. Tax law) with respect of any Tax period (or portion thereof)
ending on or before the Closing Date.

  

  

(d) In the event that any Governmental Authority initiates any audit or other
proceeding of or with respect to the Partnership that may affect the amounts
of any Taxes referred to in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this Section, Olin shall
promptly notify PolyOne in writing of the initiation of such audit or
proceeding, and shall keep PolyOne fully informed regarding the progress of
such audit or proceeding.

  

  

SECTION 4.03. PolyOne Notes Guarantee. (a) Subject to Section 4.03(b) and (c),
Olin hereby agrees (i) to pay and perform on behalf of PolyOne all obligations
that PolyOne may become obligated to pay or perform under the PolyOne Notes
Guarantee, (ii) in the event Olin fails to timely pay and perform such
obligations, to reimburse PolyOne for all sums paid by PolyOne under the
PolyOne Notes Guarantee in respect of such obligations and (iii) to defend and
indemnify PolyOne from any and all claims, demands, obligations, liabilities,
costs and expenses arising under the PolyOne Notes Guarantee, in each case, to
the extent arising from a default or other breach under the Series G Notes.

  

  

(b) PolyOne shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use their reasonable
best efforts to obtain the consent of each Noteholder to the assignment to
Olin of the PolyOne Notes Guarantee and any rights or obligations thereunder
in accordance with Section 8.2 of the Note Purchase Agreement and Section 5.5
of the PolyOne Notes Guarantee; provided, however, that PolyOne shall not be
required to pay or commit to pay any amount to (or incur any obligation in
favor of) any Noteholder from whom such consent is requested or agree to any
modification to the terms of the Notes in order to obtain such consents. Olin
shall use reasonable best efforts to assist, and shall cause its Affiliates
(including the Partnership) to assist, PolyOne in obtaining such consents;
provided, however, that Olin shall not be required to pay or commit to pay any
amount to (or incur any obligation in favor of) any Noteholder from whom such
consent is requested or agree to any modification to the terms of the Notes in
order to obtain such consents.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

12  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) In the event PolyOne obtains the consent of each of the Noteholders to the
assignment of the PolyOne Notes Guarantee, as promptly as practicable after
such consent is obtained, PolyOne shall assign to Olin and Olin shall assume
any and all obligations under the PolyOne Notes Guarantee and, effective upon
such assignment and assumption, the indemnification provided in Section
4.03(a) shall be of no further force and effect, except with respect to a
breach or other default under the Series G Notes arising prior to such
assignment and assumption.

  

  

(d) From the date hereof through February 28, 2021, prior to Olin consummating
a Transaction, Olin shall notify PolyOne of the proposed Transaction and, if
PolyOne reasonably determines that after giving effect to the proposed
Transaction, Olin's creditworthiness will not be equal to or greater than its
creditworthiness immediately prior to the consummation of the proposed
Transaction, upon notice of such reasonable determination, Olin shall cause
the surviving Person, resulting parent entity or transferee in the Transaction
to expressly assume the obligations set forth in Sections 4.03 and 5.02.
"Transaction" means (i) any merger, consolidation, reorganization,
recapitalization or other transaction or series of related transactions, in
each case, pursuant to which a third party acquires or combines with Olin and,
after giving effect to such transaction, shareholders of Olin immediately
prior to such transaction cease to hold 50% or more of the total voting power
of Olin or the surviving Person in such merger or combination (if such
surviving Person is not Olin); (ii) the acquisition, directly or indirectly,
by a third party, in a single transaction or series of related transactions,
of all or substantially all of the assets or business of Olin or securities
representing 50% or more of the total voting power of Olin in the election of
directors; or (iii) the disposition, pursuant to a spin-off or other
securities offering, of (x) all or substantially all of the assets or business
of Olin (other than its Chlor Alkali business) or (y) Olin's Chlor Alkali
business.

  

  

SECTION 4.04. Post Closing Cooperation. (a) As and when requested by Olin or
PolyOne, the other party shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed
and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to
be taken, all such further or other actions as such requesting party may
reasonably deem necessary or desirable to confirm and assure the transfer of
the Partnership Interests and to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including, in the case of PolyOne, executing and delivering to
Olin or the Partnership such assignments, consents and other similar
instruments as Olin may reasonably request as necessary or desirable for such
purpose.

  

  

(b) Each of Olin and PolyOne shall reimburse the other party for reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by such other party in assisting
such first party pursuant to this Section. Neither Olin nor PolyOne shall be
required by this Section to take any action that would unreasonably interfere
with the conduct of its business, unreasonably disrupt its normal operations
or increase or broaden the scope of the representations, warranties,
covenants, rights or obligations hereunder.

  

  

(c) The parties hereto acknowledge that the financial statements of the
Partnership will not be audited by Olin after the Closing. PolyOne, at its
election, shall be entitled to audit any annual financial statements of the
Partnership for each fiscal year ending on December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013,
respectively, and PolyOne shall be entitled to conduct any such audit in the
same manner as an independent auditor would audit the financial statements of
a public company. If PolyOne elects to conduct any such audit, Olin and the
Purchaser shall, at PolyOne's request, afford PolyOne's auditors reasonable
access, upon reasonable notice during normal business hours, to the personnel,
properties, books and records of the Partnership solely to the extent
necessary to conduct such audit; provided that (i) such access shall not
unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of the Partnership and (ii) all
fees, costs and expenses incurred by the Partnership, its Affiliates and its
and their advisors in connection with such audit shall be borne solely by
PolyOne.

fiscal quarter ending on December 31, 2013), Olin shall deliver to PolyOne a
reasonably detailed quarterly statement of (a) the Partnership's pre-tax
profit or loss for the fiscal quarter just ended and (b) an estimate of the
Partnership's pre-tax profit or loss for the full fiscal year that includes
the fiscal quarter just ended. Through December 31, 2013, Olin shall provide
PolyOne monthly reports in form and substance consistent with past practice
with respect to the performance of the Partnership. PolyOne acknowledges and
agrees that (i) the statements and estimates to be provided pursuant to this
Section are for informational purposes only, (ii) none of Olin, the
Partnership nor any of their respective Affiliates shall have any liability in
respect thereof and (iii) such statements and estimates shall not impact or in
any way be deemed indicative of the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA,
Distributable Cash or Closing Date Distributable Cash for any period.

  

  

SECTION 4.06. Confidentiality. PolyOne shall keep confidential, and cause its
Affiliates and its and their officers, directors, employees and advisors to
keep confidential, all information relating to the Partnership and the
transactions contemplated hereby (including any information obtained by either
party pursuant to Section 1.04 or 1.05), except (a) as required by applicable
Law, administrative process or the rules and regulations of the New York Stock
Exchange or any other registered national exchange and (b) for information
that is available to the public as of the Closing Date or thereafter becomes
available to the public other than as a result of a breach of this Section.

(including the Partnership) and each of its and their respective successors
and assigns (each, a "Purchaser Releasing Party") release and absolutely
forever discharge PolyOne and its Subsidiaries, and each of their
equityholders, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, contractors,

and all claims, demands, damages, debts, liabilities, obligations, costs,
expenses (including attorneys' and accountants' fees and expenses), actions
and causes of action of any nature whatsoever, whether now known or unknown,
suspected or unsuspected, that any Purchaser Releasing Party now has, or at
any time previously had, or shall or may have in the future, as an equity
holder, director, officer, contractor, consultant, employee, agent, advisor of
the Partnership or otherwise, to the extent relating to, arising out of or
resulting from the Partnership, the Partnership Agreement, the Partnership
Guaranties, the Operating Agreement, the Chlorine Sales Agreement, the CSA
Letter Agreements or any right relating to any of the foregoing; provided that
(i) the Purchaser Released Matters shall not include any right of any
Purchaser Releasing Party contained in this Agreement and (ii) if Occidental
Petroleum Corporation or any of its Affiliates (or any successor or assign of
any of the foregoing with respect to the Chlorine Sales Agreement) becomes a
Seller Releasing Party, the foregoing release with respect to the Chlorine
Sales Agreement shall be void ab initio at such time. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Purchaser Released Matters shall not include any claims,
demands, damages, debts, liabilities, obligations, costs, expenses (including
attorneys' and accountants' fees and expenses), actions and causes of action
of any nature whatsoever, whether now known or unknown, suspected or
unsuspected, that any Purchaser Releasing Party has, previously had or may
have to the extent relating to, arising out of or resulting from the Excluded
Contract.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

14  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Each of PolyOne and the Seller, for itself and each of its Affiliates
(including the Partnership) and each of its and their respective successors
and assigns (each, a "Seller Releasing Party", and collectively with Purchaser
Releasing Party, the "Releasing Parties") release and absolutely forever
discharge Olin and its Subsidiaries, and each of their equityholders,
Affiliates (including the Partnership), directors, officers, employees,
contractors, consultants, agents and advisors (each, a "Seller Released
Party", and collectively with the Purchaser Released Parties, the "Released
Parties") from and against all Seller Released Matters. "Seller Released
Matters" means any and all claims, demands, damages, debts, liabilities,
obligations, costs, expenses (including attorneys' and accountants' fees and
expenses), actions and causes of action of any nature whatsoever, whether now
known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, that any Seller Releasing Party
now has, or at any time previously had, or shall or may have in the future, as
an equityholder, director, officer, contractor, consultant, employee, agent,
advisor of the Partnership or otherwise, to the extent relating to, arising
out of or resulting from the Partnership Interests, the Partnership, the
Partnership Agreement, the Partnership Guaranties, the Operating Agreement,
the Chlorine Sales Agreement, the CSA Letter Agreements or any right relating
to any of the foregoing; provided that the Seller Released Matters shall not
include any right of any Seller Releasing Party contained in this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller Released Matters shall not include
any claims, demands, damages, debts, liabilities, obligations, costs, expenses
(including attorneys' and accountants' fees and expenses), actions and causes
of action of any nature whatsoever, whether now known or unknown, suspected or
unsuspected, that any Seller Releasing Party has, previously had or may have
to the extent relating to, arising out of or resulting from the Excluded
Contract.

  

  

(c) It is the intention of the Releasing Parties in providing this release,
and in giving and receiving the consideration called for in this Agreement,
that this release shall be effective as a full and final accord and
satisfaction and general release of and from all Seller Released Matters and
Purchaser Released Matters (collectively, the "Released Matters"), as
applicable, and the final resolution by the applicable Releasing Parties and
Released Parties of all Released Matters. Notwithstanding any provision in
this Agreement to the contrary, this release will not be effective so as to
benefit a particular Released Party in connection with any matter or event
that would otherwise constitute a Released Matter, but involved fraud by or on
behalf of such Released Party. Each of the parties hereto hereby represents
that no Releasing Party has voluntarily or involuntarily assigned or
transferred or purported to assign or transfer to any Person any Released
Matter and that no Person (other than a Releasing Party) has any interest in
any Released Matter by Law or Contract by virtue of any action or inaction by
any Releasing Party. The invalidity or unenforceability of any part of this
Section shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of
this Section, which shall remain in full force and effect. Upon the invalidity
or unenforceability of any part of this Section, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Section so as to effect the original
intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable
manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this Section be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

15  

  

 

 

 

  

(d) Each of PolyOne and Olin hereby represents and warrants that it has the
authority to bind each of the other Seller Releasing Parties and Purchaser
Releasing Parties, as applicable.

the Circuit Court of Washington County, Alabama as case #CV2007-101 (including
any continuations, counterclaims, refilings or appeals thereof addressing the
same or similar subject matter) (collectively, the "OxyVinyls Suit"), then
upon receipt of such monetary award, the Partnership shall pay to PolyOne one-
half (½) the amount of such monetary award minus one half (½) the OxyVinyls

Qualifications; Payments to the Partnership. (a) Except as otherwise provided
in this Agreement, the parties acknowledge that their sole and exclusive
monetary remedy after the Closing with respect to any claims relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or any other document delivered in connection
herewith (other than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud,
wilful or intentional misrepresentation or concealment or wilful or
intentional failure to perform any covenant or other agreement) shall be
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article. Each
party hereby waives, from and after the Closing, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, any rights, claims and causes of action (other
than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud, wilful or intentional
misrepresentation or concealment or wilful or intentional failure to perform
any covenant or other agreement) for damages it may have against any other
party arising under this Agreement or any document delivered in connection
herewith, except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this
Article and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. For the avoidance
of doubt, this Section 5.05 shall not modify, impair or otherwise limit in any
way the rights, obligations or remedies of any of the parties hereto under any
Excluded Contract.

  

  

(b) Except as required by applicable Law, Olin and PolyOne agree to treat any
amounts payable pursuant to this Article as adjustments to the Purchase Price
for the Partnership Interests for all Tax purposes.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

17  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) Olin shall be deemed to incur 100% of all Losses suffered or incurred by
the Partnership that are indemnifiable under Section 5.01 and, in connection
therewith, Olin may, at its option, recover the full amount of such
indemnifiable Losses on behalf of the Partnership, and Olin shall have no
obligation to pay over, reimburse, indemnify or otherwise transfer to the
Partnership any amount so recovered by Olin.

  

  

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, Olin shall bear the burden of proof with
respect to any claim (whether as an affirmative defense, counterclaim or
otherwise) by Olin that the representations or warranties contained in Section
2.05 are inaccurate, incorrect or have been breached.

  

  

SECTION 5.06. Calculation of Losses. The amount of any Loss for which
indemnification is provided under this Article shall be net of any amounts
actually recovered by the indemnified party under insurance policies (other
than captive insurance and fronting carrier arrangements) with respect to such
Loss, as reduced by any increase to the insurance premiums payable resulting
from such recovery.

  

  

SECTION 5.07. Procedures. (a) Third Party Claims. (i) In order for a Person
(the "indemnified party") to be entitled to any indemnification provided for
under Section 5.01 or 5.02 in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim
made by any third Person against the indemnified party (a "Third Party
Claim"), such indemnified party must notify the party that will potentially be
obligated to provide indemnification hereunder (the "indemnifying party") in
writing of the Third Party Claim promptly following receipt by such
indemnified party of written notice of the Third Party Claim, stating in
reasonable detail the nature, basis and amount thereof (to the extent then
known), along with copies of the relevant notices and documents (including
court papers) received by the indemnified party evidencing such Third Party
Claim, and the basis for indemnification sought; provided, however, that
failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification
provided under this Agreement except to the extent the indemnifying party
shall have been actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such
failure. Thereafter, the indemnified party shall deliver to the indemnifying
party, promptly following the indemnified party's receipt thereof, copies of
all other notices and documents (including court papers) received by the
indemnified party relating to the Third Party Claim.

  

  

(ii) If a Third Party Claim is made against an indemnified party, the
indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof by written notice to the
indemnified party (which notice shall state without qualification that such
indemnifying party is liable under this Article with respect to such Third
Party Claim) within 30 days after the indemnifying party's receipt of the
notice of the Third Party Claim contemplated by paragraph (i) above with
counsel selected by the indemnifying party; provided that such counsel is not
reasonably objected to by the indemnified party; and provided further, that
notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying party shall not be entitled to
assume control of such defense and, instead, shall pay the legal fees, costs
and expenses of counsel retained by the indemnified party if (A) the claim for
indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any criminal
proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation, (B) the claim
seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the indemnified party that the
indemnified party reasonably determines, after consultation with its outside
counsel, cannot be separated from any related claim for money damages;
provided that if a claim seeking an injunction or equitable relief against the
indemnified party can be separated from a related claim for money damages, the
indemnifying party may only be entitled to assume control of the defense of
the claim for money damages, (C) after notice and a reasonable opportunity to
cure (not to exceed two Business Days), the indemnifying party failed or is
failing to reasonably prosecute or defend such claim or (D) in the indemnified
party's reasonable judgment, a conflict of interest between the indemnified
party and the indemnifying party exists with respect to the claim. If the
indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, (1) the
indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party for any legal
expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the
defense thereof and (2) the indemnified party shall have the right to
participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense,
separate from the counsel employed by the indemnifying party, it being
understood that the indemnifying party shall control such defense. Subject to
the limitations and conditions contained in this Article, the indemnifying
party shall be liable for the fees, costs and expenses of counsel employed by
the indemnified party for any period during which the indemnifying party has
not assumed the defense thereof (including in respect of Third Party Claims
the defense of which the indemnifying party was not entitled to assume or
continue in accordance with the second proviso of the first sentence of this
paragraph (ii)). If the indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Third
Party Claim, the indemnified party shall cooperate in the defense or
prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
the indemnifying party's request) the provision to the indemnifying party of
records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party
Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any materials provided
hereunder. Whether or not the indemnifying party has assumed the defense of a
Third Party Claim, no party shall admit any liability with respect thereto, or
settle, compromise or discharge such Third Party Claim without the other
applicable party's prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided that the indemnified
party shall agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of a Third Party
Claim that the indemnifying party may recommend and that by its terms
obligates the indemnifying party to pay the full amount of the liability in
connection with such Third Party Claim, which releases the indemnified party
completely in connection with such Third Party Claim and that would not
otherwise adversely affect the indemnified party.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

18  

  

 

 

 

  

(iii) The indemnification required by Section 5.01 or 5.02 shall be made by
periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation
or defense of the Third Party Claim, as and when bills are received or Losses
are incurred.

  

  

(iv) All claims under Section 5.01 or 5.02 other than Third Party Claims shall
be governed by paragraph (b) below.

  

  

(b) Direct Claims. If any indemnified party should have a claim against any
indemnifying party under Section 5.01 or 5.02 that does not involve a Third
Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected from such
indemnified party (any such claim, a "Direct Claim"), the indemnified party
shall deliver notice of such Direct Claim promptly following its discovery of
such matter, with such notice stating in reasonable detail the nature, basis
and amount thereof (to the extent then known), along with copies of the
relevant documents evidencing such matter, if any, and the basis for
indemnification sought; provided that the failure to give such notification
shall not affect the indemnification provided under this Agreement except to
the extent the indemnifying party shall have been actually and materially
prejudiced as a result of such failure. If the indemnifying party does not
notify the indemnified party within 30 calendar days following its receipt of
such notice that the indemnifying party disputes its liability to the
indemnified party under Section 5.01 or 5.02, as the case may be, such Direct
Claim specified in such notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the
indemnifying party under Section 5.01 or 5.02, as the case may be, and the
indemnifying party shall pay the amount of such liability to the indemnified
party on demand or, in the case of any notice in which the amount of the
Direct Claim (or any portion thereof) is estimated, on such later date when
the amount of such Direct Claim (or such portion thereof) becomes finally
determined. If the indemnifying party has timely disputed its liability with
respect to such Direct Claim as provided above, Olin and PolyOne shall proceed
in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved
through negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in an
appropriate court of competent jurisdiction.

SECTION 6.05. Interpretation. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an
Article or a Section, such reference shall be to an Article or a Section of
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, index of
defined terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. Any capitalized term used in any Schedule but not otherwise
defined therein shall have the meaning assigned to such term in this
Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation". The words "hereof", "hereto", "hereby", "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
The terms "or", "any" and "either" are not exclusive. The word "extent" in the
phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing
extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if". The word "will" shall be
construed to have the same meaning and effect as the word "shall". The words
"assets" and "properties" shall be deemed to have the same meaning, and to
refer to all assets and properties, whether real or personal, tangible or
intangible. Any references to the masculine, feminine or neuter gender shall
include such other genders, unless the context otherwise requires. The
definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well
as the plural forms of such terms. Any agreement, instrument or Law defined or
referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or Law as from time to
time amended, modified or supplemented, unless otherwise specifically
indicated. References to a Person are also to its successors and assigns and,
if such Person is an individual, upon such Person's death or incapacity, such
Person's executors, administrators, guardians and other legal representatives.
Unless otherwise specifically indicated, all references to "dollars" and "$"
will be deemed references to the lawful money of the United States. All
Schedules annexed hereto are hereby incorporated in and made a part of this
Agreement as if set forth in full herein.

  

  

SECTION 6.06. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and
shall become effective when one or more such counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties and delivered to the other party. Delivery of an executed

transmission shall be effective as delivery of an original counterpart hereof.

SECTION 6.07. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, along with the schedules and
exhibits hereto and thereto, contain the entire agreement and understanding
among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings relating to such subject
matter. None of the parties hereto shall be liable or bound to any other
Person in any manner by any representations, warranties or covenants relating
to such subject matter except as specifically set forth in this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 6.08. Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as either the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party or such party waives its rights under
this Section with respect thereto. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

  

  

SECTION 6.09. Governing Law. This Agreement and any claim, controversy or
dispute arising under or related in any way to this Agreement, the
relationship of the parties, the transactions leading to this Agreement or
contemplated hereby or the interpretation and enforcement of the rights and
duties of the parties hereunder or related in any way to the foregoing, shall
be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal, substantive laws
of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements entered into and to be
performed solely within such State without regard to the conflict of laws
principles of such State.

  

  

SECTION 6.10. Consent to Jurisdiction. (a) Each party irrevocably submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction of (a) the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
New York County and (b) the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, for the purposes of any Proceeding arising out of this
Agreement or any transaction contemplated by this Agreement. Each party agrees
that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, service of any
process, summons, notice or document by registered mail to such party's
address set forth above shall be effective service of process for any
Proceeding in New York with respect to any matters to which it has submitted
to jurisdiction in this Section. Each party irrevocably and unconditionally
waives any objection to the laying of venue of any Proceeding arising out of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in (i) the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County or (ii) the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and hereby
further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or
claim in any such court that any such Proceeding brought in any such court has
been brought in an inconvenient forum.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.10, any dispute
arising under Section 1.04 or 1.05 (including any dispute related to the
calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash, any Earn-out Payment,
Closing Date Distributable Cash or the Closing Date Distribution or compliance
with the methodologies set forth on Schedules B-1, B-2 or C, as the case may
be) shall be determined only in accordance with the arbitration procedures set
forth in Section 1.04 or 1.05, as the case may be.

SECTION 6.11. Waiver of Jury Trial. Each party hereto hereby waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial
by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of,
under or in connection with this Agreement or any transaction contemplated by
this Agreement. Each party hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent
or attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that
such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the
foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other party have been
induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual
waivers and certifications in this Section.

  

  

SECTION 6.12. Specific Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable damage
may occur and that the parties hereto may not have any adequate remedy at Law
if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that the parties hereto shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement in any court of the Supreme Court of the
State of New York sitting in New York County or in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any
thereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which any party hereto
is entitled at Law or in equity. Each party hereto hereby waives any
requirement for the securing of such remedy, including but not limited to the
posting of a bond.

  

  

SECTION 6.13. Mutual Drafting. The parties hereto have participated jointly in
the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the parties hereto and no presumption or burden of
proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party hereto by virtue of the
authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 6.14. Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement may not be amended except
by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. By
an instrument in writing, any party may waive compliance by any other party
hereto with any term or provision of this Agreement that such other party was
or is obligated to comply with or perform. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights.
