respect of each Share validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the
Offers or during any subsequent offering period contemplated by _Section
1.1(b)_ hereof shall be paid net to the holder thereof in cash, subject to
reduction only for any applicable federal back-up withholding or other Taxes

as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have
been paid. 

   

 (d) _Terms and Conditions of the Offers_. The obligation of Acquisition Sub to accept for payment and to pay for any Shares tendered (and the obligation of the Buyer to cause Acquisition Sub to accept for payment and to pay for any Shares tendered) in the Offers and not withdrawn shall be subject only to the conditions set forth in _Annex A_ hereto. The conditions to the Offers set forth in _Annex A_ hereto are for the sole benefit of the Buyer and Acquisition Sub and may be waived by the Buyer and Acquisition Sub, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, in their sole discretion, other than the Minimum Condition, which may be waived by the Buyer and Acquisition Sub only with the prior written consent of the Company.

  ##### 

  

    

warranty is made by the Buyer or the Acquisition Sub with respect to
information supplied by the Company or any of its stockholders for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents. The Company hereby
agrees that the information provided by or on behalf of the Company in
writing specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Schedule TO or the Offer Documents shall not contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Buyer and the
Acquisition Sub shall cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders
of Shares, as and to the extent required by applicable U.S. federal
securities laws. Each of the Buyer, the Acquisition Sub and the Company shall
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule TO or

TO as so amended and supplemented to be filed with the SEC and the Offer
Documents as so amended and supplemented to be disseminated to holders of

securities laws. The Company and its counsel shall be given
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Offer Documents and any
amendments thereto prior to the filing thereof with the SEC or dissemination
to the stockholders of the Company, and the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub
shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by
the Company and its counsel. The Buyer and the Acquisition Sub shall (i)
provide the Company and its counsel with a copy of any written comments or
telephonic notification of any oral comments the Buyer, the Acquisition Sub
or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Offer promptly after the receipt thereof, (ii) consult in good faith with the
Company and its counsel prior to responding to any such comments, and (iii)
provide the Company and its counsel with a copy of any written responses

Buyer or the Acquisition Sub or their counsel. 

   

 (g) _Top-Up Option_. 

   

 (i) Subject to _Section 1.1(g)(ii)_ and _Section 1.1(g)(iii)_ hereof, the Company grants to the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub an assignable and irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ ") to purchase from the Company the number of newly-issued shares of Company Common Stock equal to the lesser of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Buyer or the Acquisition Sub at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, constitutes more than 90% of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that would be outstanding immediately after the issuance of all shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Top-Up Option (determined on a "fully diluted basis" (which assumes conversion or exercise of all derivative securities regardless of the conversion or exercise price, the vesting schedule or other terms or conditions thereof)) and (ii) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock that the Company is authorized to issue under its certificate of incorporation but that are not issued and outstanding (and are not subscribed for or otherwise committed to be issued) at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option. 

  

 (ii) The Top-Up Option may be exercised by the Buyer or the Acquisition Sub, in whole or in part, at any time following the Acceptance Time, so long as the 

   ##### 

  

 

total number of shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by the
Acquisition Sub and the Buyer constitutes at least 80% of the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding. The aggregate purchase price payable for
the shares of Common Stock being purchased by the Buyer or the Acquisition
Sub pursuant to the Top-Up Option shall be determined by multiplying the
number of such shares by the Common Offer Price. Such purchase price may be
paid by the Buyer or the Acquisition Sub, at its election, either entirely in
cash or by paying in cash an amount equal to not less than the aggregate par
value of such shares and by executing and delivering to the Company a
promissory note on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Company. 

   

 (iii) In the event the Buyer or the Acquisition Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, the Buyer or the Acquisition Sub shall deliver to the Company a notice setting forth (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that the Buyer or the Acquisition Sub intends to purchase pursuant to the Top-Up Option, (ii) the manner in which the Buyer or the Acquisition Sub intends to pay the applicable exercise price and (iii) the place and time at which the closing of the purchase of such shares of Company Common Stock by the Buyer or the Acquisition Sub is to take place. At the closing of the purchase of such shares of Common Stock, the Buyer or the Acquisition Sub shall cause to be delivered to the Company the consideration required to be delivered in exchange for such shares, which consideration shall be paid (i) in cash, by wire transfer or cashiers check or (ii) by issuance by the Buyer or the Acquisition Sub, as applicable, to the Company of a promissory note on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Company, and the Company shall cause to be issued to the Buyer or the Acquisition Sub (as the case may be) a certificate representing such shares. The obligation of the Company to issue such shares will be subject to compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements.

   ##### 

  

  

 (iv) _Stockholder Lists_. In connection with the Offer and the Merger, the Company shall as soon as reasonably practicable furnish the Acquisition Sub or its designated agent with mailing labels, security position listings, any available non-objecting beneficial owner lists and any available listing or computer list containing the names and addresses of the record holders of the Shares as of the most recent practicable date, and shall furnish to the Acquisition Sub such information and assistance (including updated lists and information) as the Acquisition Sub may reasonably request for the purpose of communicating the Offers to the Companys stockholders. Subject to the requirements of applicable Laws and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Offers, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub shall, until consummation of the Offers, hold in confidence the information contained in any of such labels and lists, and shall use such information only in connection with the communication of the Offers to the Companys stockholders and the dissemination to the Companys stockholders of any proxy or information statement relating to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If this Agreement shall be terminated in accordance with _Article VIII_, the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub shall, upon request, deliver to the Company all copies of such information then in their possession or under their control. 

  

 (i) _Directors_. 

   

 (i) _Election of Buyer Designees_. From and after the time the Acquisition Sub accepts Shares tendered pursuant to the Offers (the " _Acceptance Time_ "), the Buyer shall be entitled to designate such number of members of the Company Board (the " _Buyer Designees_ "), rounded up to the nearest whole number, as will give the Buyer representation on the Company Board equal to the product of the total number of members of the Company Board (after giving effect to the directors elected pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the percentage that the voting power of the Shares beneficially owned by the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub at such time (including Shares so accepted for payment) bears to the total voting power of the Shares then outstanding; provided, that in no event shall Buyer have the right to designate any member of the Company Board unless and until Acquisition Sub has accepted for payment Shares tendered pursuant to the Offers representing a majority of the total outstanding voting power of the Company on a fully diluted basis (and therefore, at such time as the Buyer has the right to designate any Buyer Designees, the Buyer shall have the right to designate no less than a majority of the members of the Company Board). Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall take all actions necessary, including by increasing the size of the Company Board or securing the resignations of such number of the Companys incumbent directors, or both, to enable the Buyer Designees to be so elected or appointed to the Company Board and to cause the Buyer Designees to be so elected or appointed.

 (ii) _Continuing Directors_. The Buyer and the Acquisition Sub shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Company Board shall, at all times prior to the Effective Time, have at least two Continuing Directors (as defined below). Subject

Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act (" _Section 14(f)_") and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder (" _Rule 14f-1_") in order to fulfill its obligations
under _Section 1.1(i)(i)_ and _(ii)_ , and shall include as an appendix to
the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and its
directors and officers as is required under Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in
order to fulfill its obligations under _Section 1.1(i)(i)_ and _(ii)_. Buyer
shall provide to the Company in writing any information with respect to
itself and its nominees, directors, officers and Affiliates, required by
Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1. The provisions of this _Section 1.1(i)(ii)_ are
in addition to, and shall not limit, any right that Acquisition Sub, Buyer or
any of their respective Affiliates may have with respect to the election of
directors or otherwise under applicable Laws as a holder or beneficial owner
of shares of the Common Stock. If at any time prior to the Effective Time
there shall be in office only one Continuing Director for any reason, the
Company Board shall be entitled to appoint a person who is not an officer or
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries designated by the
remaining Continuing Director to fill such vacancy (and such person shall be
deemed to be a Continuing Director for all purposes of this Agreement), and if
at any time prior to the Effective Time no Continuing Directors then remain,
the other directors of the Company then in office shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to designate two persons to fill such
vacancies who are not officers or employees or affiliates of the Company, its
Subsidiaries, Buyer or Acquisition Sub or any of their respective affiliates
(and such persons shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for all purposes
of this Agreement). " _Continuing Director_ " shall mean (1) any member of
the Company Board, while such person is a member of the Company Board, who is
not an Affiliate, representative or designee of the Buyer or the Acquisition
Sub and who was a member of the Company Board prior to the date of the
Agreement, and (2) any successor of a Continuing Director while such
successor is a member of the Company Board, who is not an
Affiliate, representative or designee of the Buyer or the Acquisition Sub and
was recommended or elected to succeed such Continuing Director by a majority
of Continuing Directors. 

   

 (iii) _Required Approvals of Continuing Directors_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in the event that (x) Buyer Designees are elected or appointed to the Board of Directors pursuant to _Section 1.1(i)(i)_ and (y) for the period commencing when Buyer Designees are so elected or appointed and ending upon the Effective Time, there shall be any Continuing Directors, then the approval of a majority of such Continuing Directors (or the sole Continuing Director if there shall be only one (1) Continuing Director) shall be required in order to (i) amend or terminate this Agreement, or agree or consent to any amendment or termination of this Agreement, in any case on behalf of the Company, (ii) extend the time for performance of, or waive, any of the obligations or other acts of Buyer or Acquisition Sub under this Agreement, (iii) waive any of the Companys rights under this Agreement, (iv) amend, rescind, repeal or waive the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, or (v) make any other determination with respect to any action to be taken or not to be taken by or on behalf of the Company relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offers and the Merger.

All shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Buyer or the Acquisition Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares held on behalf of third parties) (" _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. Each share of Company Common Stock held by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Buyer (other than the Acquisition Sub) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares (or fractions thereof) of Surviving Corporation Stock that preserves the relative ownership interest represented by such share of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Merger. 

   

 (c) _Merger Consideration for Company Capital Stock_. Subject to _Section 2.2_, each share of Company Common Stock (other than shares to be cancelled or to be converted into Surviving Corporation Stock in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and Dissenting Shares (as defined in _Section 2.4(a)_ below)) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into the right to receive $5.40 in cash or such greater amount as may have been paid to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Common Offer (the " _Common Merger Consideration_ "). Each share of Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares) shall be 

    #####

with respect to each share of Preferred Stock shall mean the product of (1)
(A) the amount of accrued and unpaid dividends on such share of Preferred
Stock at the Acceptance Time, in the case of shares of Preferred Stock sold
pursuant to the Preferred Offer, or at the Effective Time, in the case of
shares of Preferred Stock converted in connection with the Merger, divided by

representing any such shares of Company Capital Stock shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger

The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the Buyer; provided, however, that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank which are then publicly available).

outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") (i) a
letter of transmittal in customary form and (ii) instructions for effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration
payable with respect thereto. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation
to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed and such other documents as may reasonably be requested
by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be paid promptly in
exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this 
_Article II_, and the Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the
surrender of such Certificate or Certificates. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Capital Stock which is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person (as
defined in this _Section 2.2(b))_ other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate is presented to
the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes
have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_,
each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_. As used in this
Agreement, " _Person_ " means any individual, corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, association, trust,
Governmental Authority, unincorporated organization or other entity. 

   

 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Capital Stock formerly represented by such Certificates, and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Capital Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_. 

   

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, as directed by the Buyer, upon demand, and any holder of Company Capital Stock who has not previously complied with this  _Section 2.2_ shall be entitled to receive only from the Buyer payment of its claim for Merger Consideration, without interest. 

   

 (e) _No Liability_. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, none of the Buyer, the Acquisition Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Capital Stock delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   

 (f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Buyer, the Acquisition Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Capital Stock, Company Stock Options or any rights under a Company Stock Plan such amounts 

    ##### 

  

    

as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation,
the Buyer or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts
(i) shall be remitted by the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent, as the case may be, to the applicable Governmental Authority and (ii)
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the holder of the shares of Company Capital Stock, Company Stock Options or
rights under a Company Stock Plan in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made. 

   

 (g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Capital Stock formerly represented thereby pursuant to this Agreement. 

   

 (h) _Expenses_. The Buyer or the Acquisition Sub shall bear and pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, incurred in connection with the payment for the shares of Company Capital Stock. 

   

 Section 2.3 _Warrants, Options and Company Stock Plans_. 

  

 (a) _Cash-Out of Warrants_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding warrant to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (" _Company Warrants_ "), in each case whether or not then exercisable, shall without any action on the part of the Company or the holder of such warrant, automatically be cancelled and exchanged for a cash payment provided by the Buyer, the Acquisition Sub or the Surviving Corporation (which shall be made promptly after the Effective Time) in an amount equal to (i) the excess, if any, of (x) the Merger Consideration per share of Company Common Stock over (y) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Warrant, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock for which such Company Warrant is exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time without interest and less any amounts required to be deducted and withheld under applicable Law.

 (c) _No Continuing Interest_. The parties agree that, following the Effective Time, no holder of a Company Stock Option or Company Warrant or any participant in any 

   ##### 

  

   

stock plan or other equity-related or equity-based plan of the Company or a
Subsidiary, including, without limitation, any plan or arrangement which
provides for Company Stock Options, restricted stock, restricted stock units,
phantom stock, stock appreciation rights or stock purchase rights (each, a "
_Company Stock Plan_ ") or other Company Employee Plan or employee benefit
arrangement of the Company or under any Employment Agreement shall have any
right thereunder to acquire any equity interest (including any "phantom"
stock or stock appreciation rights) in the Company, any Subsidiary of the
Company or the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (d) _Action by the Company_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will (i) make any amendments to the terms of any Company Stock Plan that are reasonably necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by _Section 2.3(b)_ and (ii) adopt such resolutions and take such other actions as may be reasonably required to effectuate the actions contemplated by this _Section 2.3_, without paying any consideration or incurring any debts or obligations on behalf of the Company or the Surviving Corporation.

 (b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure to perfect or otherwise), then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the date of loss of such status, such shares shall automatically be converted into and shall represent only the right to receive Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.1_, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificate formerly representing such shares. 

   

 (c) The Company shall give the Buyer: (i) prompt notice of any written demand for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL that relate to such demand; and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument.

 (c) The Company shall cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to, or that may reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal and promptly, following the date hereof, request that all confidential information with respect thereto furnished on behalf of the Company be returned or destroyed. 

   

 (d) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof may take, or resolve, agree or publicly propose to take, any of the following actions: (i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify in any manner adverse to the Buyer, the Recommendation, or fail to reaffirm the Recommendation within five (5) Business Days following a request by the Buyer (any of the foregoing, including if effected by amendment to the Schedule 14D-9, an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), (ii) recommend or approve an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) authorize or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal (each, an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ").

    ##### 

  

    

applicable Acquisition Proposal, including the identity of the party
making such Acquisition Proposal) (the " _Notice Period_ "), (B) the Company
shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (ii), and
any purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (ii) shall be void
and of no force or effect, unless, concurrently with such termination the
Company pays the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.3_, (C) the
Company shall not have breached this _Section 6.1_, and (D) prior to
effecting such Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, negotiate in good faith with the Buyer, if the Buyer is
still willing to do so, during the Notice Period (which Notice Period shall
recommence in the event of any modification to a material term of a Superior
Proposal) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that (1) the Company Board reaffirms the Recommendation or (2)
such Acquisition Proposal ceases to be a Superior Proposal, as applicable.
If, as of the date on which the written notice contemplated by clause (A) of
the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence is given by the Company to
Buyer, there are less than three (3) Business Days remaining prior to the
initial Expiration Date, then (without limiting any of the extension rights
or other rights that Buyer or Acquisition Sub may have pursuant to
this Agreement), Buyer shall extend the Offer to a date no earlier than the
date that is five (5) Business Days following the date of such notice. 

   

 (f) The Company shall notify the Buyer as promptly as practicable, and in any event within 24 hours, of its receipt, directly or indirectly, of (i) any inquiries, negotiations, proposals, requests for information, offers or expressions of interest with respect to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal (including a copy of such Acquisition Proposal and a summary of the material terms and conditions thereof, including price, and the identity of the Person or Persons involved), and (ii) any amendment to a previously disclosed Acquisition Proposal (including the terms of such amendment). 

   

 (g) Nothing in this _Section 6.1_ shall prohibit the Company from complying with Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with outside counsel, it is required to do so under applicable Law or the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall this _Section 6.1(g)_ affect the obligations of the Company specified in _Sections 6.1(a)_, _(c)_ ,  _(d)_ or _(e)_ ; and _provided_ , _further_ , that any disclosure required to comply with Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Company Board expressly publicly reaffirms the Recommendation, either in such communication or within two (2) Business Days after a request to do so from the Buyer. The Company shall, at soon as practicable but in any event prior to any such disclosure pursuant to this _Section 6.1(g)_, provide the Buyer with a copy of the text of any disclosure made or proposed to be made pursuant to this _Section 6.1(g)_. 

   

 (h) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means (i) any proposal or offer from any Person or group of Persons other than the Buyer or one of its Subsidiaries for a merger, reorganization, share exchange, joint venture, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation, or similar transaction involving the Company (or any Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of the Company the business of which constitutes twenty percent (20%) or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its 

    ##### 

  

    

Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), (ii) any proposal for the issuance by the
Company of over twenty percent (20%) of its equity securities or (iii) any
proposal or offer to acquire in any manner, directly or
indirectly, beneficial ownership (as such term is defined pursuant to Section
13(d) of the Exchange Act) of equity securities representing twenty percent
(20%) or more of the Companys voting power or assets representing twenty
percent (20%) or more of the consolidated total assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, in each case other than the Offers or the Merger. 

   

 (i) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of this _Section 6.1_ and (A) on terms that the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisors, to be more favorable to the holders of Shares from a financial point of view than the Offers and the Merger, taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by the Buyer in good faith to the Company in response to such proposal or otherwise) and (B) that the Company Board believes is reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that for purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal," the references to "twenty percent (20%)" in the definitions of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "fifty percent (50%)." 

   

 Section 6.2 _Access to Information_. During the Interim Period, the Company shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) (i) provide to the Buyer, the Acquisition Sub and their respective Representatives full and complete access, at reasonable times upon prior notice, to the officers, employees, consultants, affiliates, customers, suppliers, agents, properties, offices and other facilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries and to the books and records thereof and (ii) furnish promptly such information concerning the business, properties, contracts, assets, liabilities, personnel, customers, suppliers and other aspects of the Company and its Subsidiaries as the Buyer, the Acquisition Sub or any of their respective Representatives may reasonably request. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or disclose information where such access or disclosure would result in a loss or impairment of any attorney-client or attorney work product privilege or violate applicable Law or existing confidentiality obligations of the Company, in which case the parties hereto will use reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements. For avoidance of doubt, no investigation by the Buyer, the Acquisition Sub or any of their respective Representatives, whether prior to the execution of this Agreement or pursuant to this _Section 6.2_, shall affect any representation or warranty in this Agreement of any party hereto or any condition to the obligations of the parties hereto. All information obtained by the Buyer and its representatives pursuant to this _Section 6.2_ shall be treated as "Disclosure Material" for purposes of the Confidentiality Agreement. 

  

 Section 6.3 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. 

  

 (a) Subject to _Sections 6.3(b)_ and _6.3(c)_ hereof, each of the Company, the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective 

    ##### 

  

    

the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, including
(i) obtaining from any Governmental Authority or any other third party any

thereunder and (C) any other applicable Law; provided, however, that nothing

Company shall not) become subject to, or consent or agree to or otherwise take
any action with respect to, any requirement, condition, understanding,
agreement or order of a Governmental Authority to sell, to divest, to hold
separate or otherwise dispose of, or to conduct, restrict, operate, invest or
otherwise change assets or businesses of the Company, the Buyer, or any of
their subsidiaries. 

   

 (b) Until the Effective Time, each party shall promptly notify the other parties in writing of any pending or, to the knowledge of the first party, threatened action, proceeding or investigation by any Governmental Authority or any other Person (i) challenging or seeking material damages in connection with the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) seeking to restrain or prohibit the consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise limit the right of the Surviving Corporation to own or operate any material portion of the businesses, assets or properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

   

 (c) Each party shall consult and cooperate with each other in connection with their duties set forth in this _Section 6.3_.

 Section 6.4 _Public Disclosure_. The Company, the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to this Agreement, the Offers, the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated herein. Prior to the Closing, none of the Company, the Buyer or the Acquisition Sub shall issue any press release or otherwise make any public statement without the prior consent of the other parties hereto (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), except as may be required by applicable Law or any listing agreement with any national securities exchange to which the Company, the Buyer or the Acquisition Sub is a party and, in such case, shall use reasonable efforts to consult with all the parties hereto prior to such release or statement 

   ##### 

  

 

being issued. The parties shall agree on the text of a joint press release by

 Section 6.5 _Indemnification and Insurance_. 

  

 (a) The Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall jointly and severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or an officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL from and against all liabilities, costs, expenses and claims (including without limitation reasonable legal fees and disbursements, which shall be paid, reimbursed or advanced by the Surviving Corporation in a manner consistent with applicable provisions of the Companys certificate of incorporation as in effect on the date hereof) arising out of the actions taken in performance of their duties as directors or officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , the Buyers and Surviving Corporations obligations to the Indemnified Parties under this _Section 6.5(a)_ shall not be effective until consummation of the Merger; _provided_ ,  _further_ , neither the Buyer nor the Surviving Corporation shall have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is determined pursuant to a final non-appealable judgment rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction to be prohibited by applicable Law. 

   

 (b) The Surviving Corporation shall either: (i) maintain in effect, and the Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain, for six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, directors and officers liability insurance policies covering the persons who are currently covered in their capacities as such directors and officers by the Companys current directors and officers policies and on terms not materially less favorable than the existing insurance coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time so long as the premium for such coverage does not exceed an amount equal to 300% of the last annual premium paid immediately prior to the date hereof by the Company for such coverage (the " _Maximum Premium_ ") or (ii) purchase a six (6)-year extended reporting period endorsement with respect to the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance policies (a " _Reporting Tail Endorsement_ ") and maintain such endorsement in full force and effect for its full term. If the Companys existing insurance expires, is terminated or cancelled during such six-year period or exceeds the Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain, and Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain, as much directors and officers liability insurance as can be obtained for the remainder of such period for an annualized premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium, on terms and conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties than the Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company may, with the Buyers prior written consent, prior to the Effective Time, purchase a Reporting Tail Endorsement, provided that the Company does not pay more than six (6) times the Maximum Premium for such Reporting Tail Endorsement, in which case, the Surviving Corporation shall, and the Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain such Reporting Tail Endorsement in full force and effect for its full term, the Buyer shall be relieved from its obligations under the preceding two sentences of this _Section 6.5(b)_ prior to the date hereof by the Company. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (c) Except as may be limited by applicable Laws: (i) for six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the indemnification obligations set forth in the Companys certificate of incorporation and the Companys By-Laws, in each case as of the date of this Agreement, shall survive the Merger and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the individuals who on or at any time prior to the Effective Time were entitled to indemnification thereunder with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) the indemnification obligations of the Company, as set forth in other indemnification agreements to which it is a party and as disclosed in _Section 6.5_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified after the Effective Time except as permitted by the terms and provisions of those agreements. 

   

 (d) The Buyer shall pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by the persons referred to in this _Section 6.5_ in connection with the enforcement of their rights provided in this _Section 6.5_. 

   

 (e) The provisions of this _Section 6.5_ are intended to be in addition to the rights otherwise available to the current officers and directors of the Company by Law, charter, statute, bylaw or agreement, and shall operate for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and their representatives. 

   

 Section 6.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_. During the Interim Period, the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall give prompt notice to the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub, of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or failure to occur is reasonably likely to cause any representation or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, in each case at any time from and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, or (b) any material failure of the Buyer and Acquisition Sub or the Company, as the case may be, or of any officer, director, employee or agent thereof, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the above, the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.6_ will not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the conditions to such partys obligation to consummate the Merger. 

  

 Section 6.7 _Employee Benefits_. 

  

 (a) Following the Effective Time, and except for purposes of determining eligibility for retiree health and welfare benefits, the Buyer will give each employee of the Company or the Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries who shall have been employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time ("Continuing Employees") full credit for prior service with the Company or its Subsidiaries to the extent such service would be recognized if it had been performed as an employee of Buyer for purposes of (i) eligibility and vesting under any Buyer Employee Plans (as defined below), and (ii) unless covered under another arrangement with or of the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, determination of benefit levels under any Buyer Employee Plan or policy of general application relating to vacation or severance, in either case for which the Continuing Employees are otherwise prospectively eligible and in which the Continuing Employees are offered 

    ##### 

  

    

participation, but except where such credit would result in a duplication of
benefits. For the avoidance of doubt, no Continuing Employee shall be
retroactively eligible for any Buyer Employee Plan, including any such Buyer
Employee Plan that was frozen prior to the Effective Time. In addition, the
Buyer shall waive, or cause to be waived, any limitations on benefits
relating to pre-existing conditions to the same extent such limitations are
waived under any comparable medical and dental plan of the Buyer. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Buyer Employee Plan_ " means any
"employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA),
"employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), and
any other formal written plan or policy under which service with the Buyer is
relevant to eligibility, vesting and/or level of benefits, for the benefit
of, or relating to, the current employees of the Buyer or its Subsidiaries
and with respect to which eligibility has not been frozen. 

   

 (b) The Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to administer the I-trax, Inc. Transition Compensation Plan (the " _Retention Plan_ ") in accordance with its terms and satisfy its obligations under any retention and bonus agreements entered into pursuant to the Retention Plan (" _Bonus Agreements_ "), including, but not limited to, paying transaction bonuses and retention bonuses and accelerating certain severance obligations at the times provided for in such agreements, with the understanding that the aggregate amount of transaction bonuses and retention bonuses payable thereunder shall not exceed $1,480,000 and $810,000, respectively. The Retention Plan shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights of individuals who entered into Bonus Agreements at any time prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (c) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and the Company shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring, Buyer or the Surviving Corporation to continue any specific employee benefit plans or to continue the employment of any specific person. The provisions of this Section 6.7 are for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to (i) constitute an amendment to any of the compensation and benefits plans maintained for or provided to Continuing Employees prior to or following the Effective Time or (ii) confer upon or give to any person (including for the avoidance of doubt any current or former employees, directors, or independent contractors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or on or after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of its subsidiaries), other than the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies (with respect to the matters provided for in this Section 6.7) under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement. 

   

 (d) Buyer will in good faith develop a severance program to provide reasonable severance benefits to any Continuing Employee who has not entered into an agreement with the Company providing for severance benefits and whose employment is terminated by the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries during the first twelve (12) months following the Effective Time. Buyer will take into account length of service and any other factors deemed relevant in setting benefits payable under such severance program. The eligibility requirements and benefits payable under such severance program will be no less favorable than those prescribed under the terms and conditions of Buyers Salary Continuation Plan. 

    ##### 

  

     

 Section 6.8 _Takeover Statute_. If any Takeover Law shall become applicable to the Offers, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Company, the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub and their respective Boards of Directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such Takeover Law. 

  

 Section 6.9 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give the Buyer the opportunity to participate, subject to a customary joint defense agreement, in, but not control, the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company or its directors or officers relating to the Offer, the Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that no such settlement shall be agreed to without the Buyers consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. 

  

 Section 6.10 _Additional Transaction_. The Buyer will not complete the proposed acquisition of Whole Health Management (the " _Additional Transaction_ ") prior to the expiration or early termination of the waiting period or obtaining any clearance required under the HSR Act applicable to the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offers.

termination, the waiting period under the HSR Act applicable to the purchase

terminated, and (iii) the Buyer completes the Additional Transaction at any
time prior to the one-year anniversary of such termination. If required under

 (e) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(i)_, the Buyer shall reimburse the Company for all out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, consultants, financial advisors and investment bankers of the Company and its Affiliates) incurred by or on behalf of the Company in connection with this Agreement and all other matters related to the Offers and the Merger (together, the " _Company Expenses_ "); provided, however, that (i) such reimbursable fees and expenses shall not exceed $2,000,000 in the aggregate and (ii) any amounts paid pursuant to this _Section 8.3(e)_ shall be offset against any Reverse Termination Fee required to be paid pursuant to _Section 8.3(c)_.

In addition, if the Company shall fail to pay the Termination Fee and/or Buyer Expenses or the Buyer shall fail to pay the Reverse Termination Fee or Company Expenses, as the case may be, when due, the Company or the Buyer, as applicable, shall also pay to the Buyer or the Company, as applicable, all of the Buyers or the Companys, as applicable, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) in connection with efforts to collect such Termination Fee, Reverse

Termination Fee, Buyer Expenses and/or Company Expenses, as the case may be.
The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section 8.3_
and  _Section 9.11_are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not
enter into this Agreement and that neither the Termination Fee nor the
Reverse Termination Fee is a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate the Buyer and the Company, as
applicable, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

 Section 2. 

  

       | (a)  |   | The Corporation shall indemnify any person who
was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to my threatened,
pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of
the Corporation), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts
paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in
connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he ox she acted in good
faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed
to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal
action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct
was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment,
order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its
equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that such person did
not act in good faith and in a manner which he or she reasonably believed to
be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with
respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe
that his or her conduct was unlawful.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

   

       | (b)  |   | The Corporation shall indemnify any person who
was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened,
pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to
procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he or she is or
was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and
reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with the defense or
settlement of such action or suit if he or she acted in good faith and in a
manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the Corporation, except that no indemnification shall be made in
respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been
adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such
action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the
adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case,
such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses
which such Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (c)  |   | To the extent that a director, officer, employee or
agent of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in
defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in paragraphs (a) and
(b) of this Section 2, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein,
he or she shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees)
actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection therewith.  
      
    | (d)  |   | Any indemnification under paragraphs (a) and (b) of
this Section 2 (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation
only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that
indemnification of the director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the
circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct
set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 2\. Such determination
shall be made (i) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum
consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or
proceeding, (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable or, even if obtainable, a
quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in
a written opinion or (iii) by the stockholders.  
      
    | (e)  |   | Expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by a
director or officer in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the Corporation in
advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon
receipt of any undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to
repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not
entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation pursuant to this Section 2\.
Such expense (including attorneys fees) incurred by other employees and  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     |   |   | agents may be so paid upon such terms and conditions,
if any, as the Board of Directors deems appropriate.  
---|---|---|--- 
  
     | (f)  |   | The indemnification and advancement of expenses
provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Section 2 shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or
advancement of expenses may be entitled under any by-law, agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in an
official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such
office.  
      
    | (g)  |   | For purposes of this Section 2, any reference to
