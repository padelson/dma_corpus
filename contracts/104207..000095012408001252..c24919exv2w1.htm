<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;1. A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or
its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for
liability (i)&nbsp;for any breach of such director&#146;s duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its
stockholders, (ii)&nbsp;for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct
or a knowing violation of law, (iii)&nbsp;under Section&nbsp;174 of the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware or (iv)&nbsp;for any transaction from which such director derived an improper personal
benefit. If the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware is amended to authorize corporate
action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a
director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as so amended. Any repeal or modification of this
Section&nbsp;1 by the stockholders of the Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection
of a director of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification.
