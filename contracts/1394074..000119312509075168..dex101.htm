of the Working Capital Adjustment set forth on the Final Closing Statement is
greater than the total of the Initial Adjustment, Buyer shall pay by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account or accounts specified
by Seller such difference, together with interest at an annual rate equal to
the prime rate published in _The Wall Street Journal_ on such date plus two
percent (2%) calculated from, but not including, the Closing Date until, and
including, the date on which paid or (ii) if the total of the Working Capital
Adjustment set forth on the Final Closing Statement is less than the total of
the Initial Adjustment, Seller shall pay by wire transfer in immediately
available funds, to the account or accounts specified by Buyer such
difference, together with interest at an annual rate equal to the prime rate
published in _The Wall Street Journal_ on such date plus two percent (2%)
calculated from, but not including, the Closing Date until, and including, the
date on which paid.

2.5 _Proceedings_. Except as otherwise specifically provided for herein, all
proceedings that will be taken and all documents that will be executed and
delivered by the Parties on the Closing Date will be deemed to have been taken
and executed simultaneously, and no proceeding will be deemed taken nor any
document executed and delivered until all such proceedings have been taken,
and all such documents have been executed and delivered.

2.6 _Purchase Price Allocation_. The Parties acknowledge that the purchase
and sale of the Equity Interests pursuant to this Agreement will be treated as
a purchase and sale of the Assets for federal income tax purposes (and for
purposes of any applicable state taxes that follow the federal
treatment). Not later than 140 days after the Closing Date, but in any event
prior to December 31, 2009, Buyer shall determine in consultation with Seller
and deliver to Seller an allocation of the consideration paid (or treated as
paid) for the Assets among such assets in  



 

17  accordance with Section 1060 of the Code. Except with respect to any
payments of interest under _Section 2.4(f)_ and as otherwise as required by
Law, any payments from one Party to the other under this Agreement after the
Closing Date shall be treated as an adjustment to the consideration paid for
the Assets for federal income tax purposes, and Buyer shall revise the
allocation described previously as appropriate and deliver the revised
allocation to Seller. If the Parties cannot agree on either the initial
allocation or any adjusted allocation within 30 days of the provision of such
allocation, the Parties will resolve the dispute in accordance with _Section
2.4(e)_. The Parties agree to file all Tax Returns consistent with such
original or any revised allocation and not to take any position inconsistent
therewith, except as required by Law.

2.7 _Escrow; Liquidated Damages_.

(a) Buyer and Seller agree that the liquidated damages owing from Seller to
Buyer (i) for Sellers breach of _Section 5.9(b)(i)_ shall be $5,000,000, and
(ii) for breach of  _Section 5.9(c)_ shall be $5,000,000. Determination of
Sellers breach shall not be affected by whether such breach resulted from
reasons partially or totally outside of Sellers control, except to the extent
such breach was caused solely by Buyer.

(b) If Seller makes the filings required by _Section 5.9(c)(i)_ and 
_Section 5.9(c)(ii)_ (collectively, the " _FERC Filings_ ") on or before the
dates specified in such Sections, then Buyer shall, at Sellers written
request, unconditionally instruct the Escrow Agent to release to
Seller $2,500,000 of the balance in the Escrow Account as promptly as
possible, but in no event later than 3 Business Days after the date of the
filing contemplated by _Section 5.9(c)(ii)_. If Seller fails to file the FERC
Filings as required by  _Section 5.9(c)_ on or before the dates specified in
such Sections, (i) Buyer shall be entitled to instruct the Escrow Agent to
release $2,500,000 out of the Escrow Account to Buyer, and (ii) Seller shall
also pay to Buyer by wire of immediately available funds, within 3 Business
Days of Buyers written request therefor, the remaining $2,500,000 owing of
such liquidated damages.

(c) If Seller delivers to Buyer the items required under _Section 5.9(b)(i)_
(collectively, the " _Audited Financials_ ") on or before the date specified
in such Section, then Buyer shall, at Sellers written request,
unconditionally instruct the Escrow Agent to release to Seller $2,500,000 out
of the Escrow Account as promptly as possible, but in no event later than 3
Business Days after Buyers receipt of such Audited Financials. If Seller
fails to deliver the Audited Financials as required by _Section 5.9(b)(i)_ on
or before the date specified in such Section, (i) Buyer shall be entitled to
instruct the Escrow Agent to release $2,500,000 out of the Escrow Account to
Buyer, and (ii) Seller shall also pay to Buyer by wire of immediately
available funds, within 3 Business Days of Buyers written request therefor,
the remaining $2,500,000 owing of such liquidated damages.

(d) Payment to Buyer of the liquidated damages contemplated by this _Section
2.7_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for Sellers breach of _Section
5.9(b)(i)_ and _Section 5.9(c)_. The liquidated damages so paid will be
treated as a reduction in the purchase price and Seller will irrevocably
forfeit the right to any such amount payable and shall, if requested,
unconditionally consent in writing to the release of funds so owing to Buyer
from the Escrow Account. Buyer shall cause all of the Funds in excess of the
Escrow Deposit (each as defined in the Escrow Agreement) to be released to
Seller promptly upon termination of the Escrow Agreement in accordance with
its terms.



 

18 (e) The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that (i) the amounts described in
this  _Section 2.7_ shall constitute liquidated damages because the
potential injury to Buyer resulting from Sellers potential breach of _Section
5.9(b)(i)_ or _Section 5.9(c)_ is uncertain and difficult to quantify, (ii)
the amount of such liquidated damages is reasonable and considers (A) the
actual or anticipated harm that could be caused by Sellers potential breach
of _Section 5.9(b)(i)_ or _Section 5.9(c)_, (B) the difficulty of proving
the loss arising from any such potential breach, and (C) the difficulty of
finding another, adequate remedy at law, and (iii) such liquidated damages are
structured to function as damages resulting from Sellers potential breach of
_Section 5.9(b)(i)_ or _Section 5.9(c)_ and not as a penalty.

by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or
other similar Laws now or hereafter in effect relating to or affecting
creditors rights generally, including the effect of statutory and other Laws
regarding fraudulent conveyances and preferential transfers, and subject to

bond, encumbrance, license, contract, lease, franchise, permit, agreement, or
other instrument or obligation to which Buyer is a party or by which Buyer or

5.4 _HSR Act_.

(a) Each Party will, within 7 Business Days after the date hereof, file (or
cause its appropriate Affiliate to file) with the appropriate Governmental
Authorities the notification and report form required for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and any supplemental information requested in
connection therewith pursuant to the HSR Act, which filing will include a
request for early termination of any applicable waiting period. Each Party
will use all reasonable efforts to cooperate with one another in making the
filings and submissions referred to above and each Party will furnish, or
cause to be furnished, to the others any necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the others may request in connection with their preparation of
any filing or submission that is necessary or advisable under the HSR Act.
Such notification and report form and all such supplemental information filed
or submitted by such Party (or such Affiliate) will be in substantial
compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act. Each Party will use all
reasonable efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as the Federal Trade
Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or any other
Person may assert under relevant antitrust or competition Laws with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each Party will keep the
others reasonably informed, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, of the
status of any communications with, and inquiries or requests for additional
information from, any Governmental Authority in connection with the matters
contemplated by this Section, and will use all reasonable efforts to comply
(and, if applicable, cause the compliance by its appropriate Affiliates)
promptly with any such inquiry or request and to defend against any action of
any Governmental Authority or other Person that attempts to enjoin the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each Party will, and will cause
its Affiliates to, use all reasonable efforts to cause the expiration or
early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act. The costs of any
filing fees required in connection with any filing made under the HSR Act
shall be borne equally between Buyer and Seller.

(b) The Parties shall not take any action with the intention to or that could
reasonably be expected to hinder or delay the obtaining of clearance or any
necessary approval of any Governmental Authority under the HSR Act or the
expiration or early termination of any required waiting period thereunder.

other similar Taxes, levies, charges and fees, including all interest and
penalties thereon and additions thereto, whether disputed or not (" _Transfer
Taxes_ "), arising out of or in connection with or attributable to the
transactions effected pursuant to this Agreement. The Party required by Law  



 

38  to file all necessary Tax Returns relating to such Transfer Taxes shall
prepare and file such Tax Returns, and Buyer and Seller shall each, and shall

(i) bids received from others in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (or similar transactions) and information and analyses
(including financial analyses) relating to such bids; (ii) any information

or the Buyer Representatives as a result of, or in connection with any site
visits or inspections of the assets or properties of any Seller Indemnified
Party. THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS IN THIS _SECTION 5.8_ SHALL BE
ENFORCEABLE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY PERSON (INCLUDING THE PERSON FROM WHOM
INDEMNIFICATION IS SOUGHT) ALLEGES OR PROVES THE SOLE, CONCURRENT,

whatsoever to use the words "Atlas" or "Atlas Pipeline" or any trademarks
containing or comprising the foregoing, or any trademark confusingly similar
thereto or dilutive thereof (collectively, the " _Seller Marks_ "). From and
after the Closing, Buyer agrees that it will cause the NOARK Group to cease
using the Seller Marks in any manner, directly or indirectly, except for such
limited uses as cannot be promptly terminated ( _e.g._ , signage, e-mail

remove, strike over or otherwise obliterate and shall cause its Affiliates to
remove, strike over or otherwise obliterate all Buyer Marks from all assets

specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for any breach thereof
in addition to other remedies available at law or in equity. This covenant
shall survive indefinitely without limitation as to time.

(a) Seller shall deliver to Buyer promptly following Closing a copy of any or
all of the data room materials and other books and records relating to the

occur of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement under  _Section
8.1_, Seller, its Affiliates and the NOARK Group shall not, directly or
indirectly, through any officer, director, agent or employee of, or any
investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other
representative retained by, Seller, the NOARK Group or any of their
respective Affiliates (each a " _Seller Party_ ") (i) solicit, initiate, seek
or encourage (including by way of furnishing information or assistance) or
take other action to facilitate any inquiries or the submission of any
proposal which constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal from any person other than Buyer (a " _Third Party_ "),
or (ii) engage in any discussions or negotiations relating thereto or in
furtherance thereof or accept any Acquisition Proposal. Seller, any member of
the NOARK Group and their respective Affiliates shall notify Buyer if a
written Acquisition Proposal has been received. Seller, the NOARK Group and
their respective Affiliates agree not to release any Third Party from, or
waive any provision of, any confidentiality agreement relating to the sale of
the Business, or any member of the NOARK Group.

(b) Upon execution by Seller of this Agreement, Seller and its Affiliates will
terminate any solicitations, encouragement, activities, discussions and
negotiations with any Person other than Buyer conducted heretofore by Seller,

until the earlier of Closing or termination of this Agreement pursuant to 
_Section 8.1_.

5.17 _Employee Matters_.

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall provide Buyer with an updated list
of the Subject Employees within 5 Business Days of the date upon which any
change therein has occurred. On or before the Closing Date, Buyer or an
Affiliate of Buyer (such entity that makes employment offers being the "
_Buyer Employer_ ") shall offer employment, which shall be contingent
upon the occurrence of the Closing and the satisfaction of Buyer Employers
pre-hiring requirements, to each Subject Employee that Buyer Employer desires
to employ. Buyer shall inform Seller in writing of the identity of each
Subject Employee to whom Buyer Employer has made an offer of employment
(collectively, the " _Offered Employees_ "). Each offer of employment to an
Offered Employee shall be on terms and conditions determined by Buyer Employer
in its sole discretion that are consistent with the provisions of this
_Section 5.17_. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Continuing Employee_ "
means each individual who accepts an offer of employment from Buyer Employer
as provided in the preceding provisions of this paragraph and who actually
becomes employed by Buyer Employer in accordance with such offer. The " _Hire
Date_ " for each Continuing Employee shall be the Closing Date,  



 

45  except with respect to those individuals to whom employment offers are made
and (i) who are not Actively Employed as of the Closing Date, in which
case the Hire Date shall be the date upon which such individual is able to
and does commence active duty with Buyer Employer, or (ii) with respect to
whom Buyer and Seller have agreed will have a later Hire Date. " _Actively
Employed_ " shall mean that the individual is an employee of an Affiliate of
Seller on the day immediately prior to the Closing Date and on the Closing
Date such individual is performing his regular occupation for his employer
(either at such employers usual places of business or at some location to
which such employers business requires the employee to travel). It is
understood and agreed that any Continuing Employee who is not Actively
Employed as of the Closing Date shall not be eligible to participate in any
Buyer Employer Employee Plan at any time prior to the date said Continuing
Employee is in active duty with the Buyer Employer.

(b) Buyer Employers offer of employment to the Offered Employees shall (i) be
at an annual salary or hourly wage rate that is not less than the annual
salary or hourly wage rate that the Offered Employee was receiving
immediately prior to the date of this Agreement, in accordance with the
information contained in _Schedule 3.21(f)_ , and (ii) permit them, if they
become Continuing Employees, to be eligible to participate in Employee
Plans which are offered to similarly situated employees of Buyer Employer.
Buyer Employer shall also provide severance benefits to any Continuing
Employee who is terminated from employment by Buyer Employer without cause
within 2 years following Closing. Such severance benefits shall be provided
in exchange for a release of employment claims by such Continuing Employee and
shall provide for payment of severance in the amount equal to (i) one weeks
base pay for each year of service for a period up to 9 years service; plus
(ii) two weeks base pay for each year of service in excess of 9 years
service; plus (iii) one weeks base pay for each $10,000 of base salary, which
total severance amount shall not be less than 12 weeks base pay nor more
than 104 weeks base pay; and shall further provide for 6 months fully
subsidized medical and dental COBRA coverage to the extent such coverage is
elected by such Continuing Employee and shall also provide outplacement
assistance and up to $2500 of tuition reimbursement assistance, both in
accordance with Buyer Employers policies and procedures; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such severance benefits shall not be payable to any
Continuing Employee who has an employment or other agreement with Buyer,
Seller, a member of the NOARK Group or any of their respective Affiliates,
which provides for the payment of monies or other benefits upon termination of
employment;  _provided, further,_ that Buyer Employer shall be permitted to
document this requirement to provide severance benefits in a manner that
satisfies the requirements of Section 409A of the Code (including specifying
time of payment provisions or limitations on the amount and timing of the
provision of benefits to exempt any benefits required to be provided hereunder
from being subject to the requirements of Section 409A of the Code).
Additionally, Buyer shall waive (or cause to be waived) any pre-existing
condition limitation and eligibility waiting period under the group health
plans (other than for purposes of retiree medical and dental benefits)
provided by Buyer Employer to the Continuing Employees following Closing
to the extent such exclusions and limitations were not imposed with respect
to such Continuing Employee under the corresponding Seller Plans. From and
after the applicable Hire Date, for purposes of (1) eligibility and benefit
determination under the vacation and sick leave policies that are maintained
after  



 

46  such date by the Buyer Employer and (2) determining the years of service of
a Continuing Employee for purposes of calculating the severance benefit,
if any, to which such Continuing Employee may become entitled pursuant to the
preceding provisions of this _Section 5.17(b)_, Buyer shall cause the Buyer
Employer to recognize each Continuing Employees years of service with Seller
and its Affiliates based on such Continuing Employees date of hire as set
forth in _Schedule 3.21(f)_. As applied to the Continuing Employees, the
current Buyer Employers retirement savings plan (401(k)) will not impose a
waiting period for enrollment and will provide for 100% vesting with respect
to employer matching contributions.

(c) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, Seller and its Affiliates
shall provide Buyer and its Affiliates, as applicable, with reasonable access
to the Subject Employees and shall not take any action to discourage any
Offered Employee from accepting an offer of employment from Buyer Employer.

(d) On or before the second customary payroll of an Affiliate of Seller
occurring after each Continuing Employees Hire Date, Seller and Sellers
Affiliates (other than the NOARK Group), as applicable, shall pay the
Continuing Employee all amounts owed to the Continuing Employee for accrued
but unused paid-time-off (PTO) under the Seller Plans.

(e) Seller shall provide, or shall cause an Affiliate of Seller (other than
the NOARK Group) to provide, COBRA continuation coverage (within the meaning
of Section 4980B of the Code and the Treasury regulations thereunder) to all
individuals who are M and A qualified beneficiaries (within the meaning
assigned to such term under QandA-4 of Treasury regulation section 54.4980B-9)
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for the
duration of the period to which such individuals are entitled to such
coverage. Seller shall take any and all necessary actions to ensure that
Buyer, the NOARK Group and their respective Affiliates are not required to
provide such continuation coverage to any such individual at any time.

(f) Other than the Change of Control Agreements, Buyer and its Affiliates
shall not, and from and after the Closing Date, the NOARK Group shall not,
have any responsibility or liability with respect to the Seller Plans. This
_Section 5.17_ is not intended to confer upon any Subject Employee, Offered
Employee or Continuing Employee any rights or remedies hereunder. Nothing
in this Agreement shall require or be construed or interpreted as requiring
Buyer, Buyer Employer or any of their Affiliates to continue the employment of
any of the Continuing Employees following the Closing Date, or to prevent
Buyer, Buyer Employer or any of their Affiliates from changing the terms and
conditions of employment (including compensation and benefits) of any of the
Continuing Employees following the Closing Date. As of each Continuing
Employees Hire Date, such Continuing Employee will be an "employee at will,"
and, accordingly, as of such date, the employment of such Continuing Employee
may be terminated by Buyer Employer or its Affiliates without cause or prior
notice.



 

47 5.18 _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation_.

(a) Unless otherwise consented to in writing by Buyer, Seller agrees that
during the Restricted Period, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates will,
either directly or indirectly, on its own behalf or in the service or on
behalf of others, engage in any Competing Business, including: (i) act as an
agent, representative, consultant, manager, or operator of a
Competing Business, including provide managerial, supervisory,

percent (5%) of any class of securities issued by a Person, directly or
indirectly, engaged in any Competing Business which securities are publicly
traded; or (ii) acquiring any assets or business in which the portion thereof

attempt to solicit, divert or hire away to or for itself, an Affiliate of

employment of such Continuing Employee has been terminated by Buyer, or any of
its Affiliates after Closing, prior to commencement of employment discussions
between such Continuing Employee and Seller or any of its Affiliates,
_provided that_ the foregoing shall not prohibit _bona fide_ public non-
targeted solicitations for employees by Seller (whether posted on a public
site on the Internet or in a newspaper, magazine or other publication of
general circulation).

shall make reasonable attempts to have such policies in place as of the
Closing and shall  



 

48  keep such policies in place until the sixth anniversary date of the Closing;

warranties set forth in _Articles III_ and _IV_ of this Agreement shall
survive until twelve months following the Closing Date, at which time such
representations or warranties will terminate and no indemnification
obligations or any other action, claim or proceeding will be associated

Notwithstanding the survival periods set forth above, as to each claim for

that is validly made before expiration of such representation or warranty,
such claim and associated right to indemnification will not terminate before
final determination and satisfaction of such claim.

7.2 _Survival of Covenants and Agreements_. The covenants and agreements of
the Parties hereto in this Agreement and the documents to be executed in
connection with this Agreement shall survive the Closing indefinitely unless a
different survival period is indicated by their respective terms.

7.3 _Indemnification of Buyer Indemnified Parties_. __

(a) Following the Closing, Seller will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless
Buyer, the NOARK Group and their officers, members, partners, directors,
employees, Subsidiaries and Affiliates (the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ")
from any and all damages, loss, Liability, claim or expense (including
reasonable attorneys fees) (" _Damages_ ") arising, directly or indirectly
(i) from or in connection with any failure of any representation or warranty
made by Seller in this Agreement or any closing certificate delivered pursuant
to this Agreement to be true and correct as of the Closing (as if made  



 

51  anew at and as of the Closing, and (ii) the breach of any covenant or
agreement made or to be performed by Seller pursuant to this Agreement, 
_provided_ , _however_ , that with regard to breaches resulting from or in
connection with failure of any representation or warranty made by Seller in
this Agreement (x) Seller shall only be liable under this _Section
7.3(a)_ to the extent that the aggregate amount of Damages exceed 0.7% of the
Final Purchase Price (the " _Deductible Amount_ "), and then only to the
extent of such excess, and (y) in no event shall Sellers aggregate liability
to the Buyer Indemnified Parties under this _Section 7.3(a)_ exceed 20% of
the Final Purchase Price (the " _Cap Amount_ "). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (A) the Deductible Amount shall not apply to breaches of the
Seller Fundamental Representations or the representations and warranties
contained in _Section 3.8(a)_ (No Undisclosed Liabilities, No Adverse
Changes) with respect to indebtedness for borrowed money only, or _Section
3.14_ (Taxes) and (B) the Cap Amount shall not apply to breaches of the
Seller Fundamental Representations or the representations and warranties
contained in _Section 3.8(a)_ (No Undisclosed Liabilities, No Adverse
Changes) with respect to indebtedness for borrowed money only, or _Section
3.14_ (Taxes); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Sellers
liability to the Buyer Indemnified Parties for breach of any of the Seller
Fundamental Representations exceed the amount of the Final Purchase Price.

(b) Following the Closing, Seller will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless
the Buyer Indemnified Parties against any and all Damages arising, directly
or indirectly, from (i) NOARKs ownership of NES or otherwise arising from NES
or its business, operations, activities, assets or liabilities or (ii) any
member of the NOARK Group having been a member of an affiliated,
consolidated, combined or unitary group (other than the NOARK Group) for any
period prior to Closing, including pursuant to Treasury Regulations 1.1502-6
or any analogous or similar state, local or foreign law.

7.4 _Indemnification of Seller Indemnified Parties_. Following the Closing,
Buyer will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Seller and its partners,
officers, directors, employees, Subsidiaries and Affiliates (the " _Seller
Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and all Damages arising, directly
or indirectly, from or in connection with (i) any failure of any
representation or warranty made by Buyer in this Agreement or any closing
certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement to be true and correct as of
the Closing (as if made anew at and as of the Closing), and (ii) the breach
of any covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement.

7.5 _Procedures_. 

(a) If a Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party that is entitled
to seek indemnification under  _Section 7.3_ (an " _Indemnified Party_ ")
has a claim for indemnification under this _Article VII_ , other than a claim
for indemnification that involves a Third Party Claim, it shall give written
notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to Seller or Buyer, as applicable (in each
case, the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), which notice shall describe in reasonable
detail to the extent then known the nature of such claim and the factual basis
and circumstances surrounding the same and set forth an estimate of the
amount of Damages attributable to such claim. The Indemnifying Party shall,
within 30 days after its receipt of a Claim Notice, notify the Indemnified
Party in writing as to  



 

52  whether the Indemnifying Party admits or disputes the claim described in the
Claim Notice. If the Indemnifying Party gives written notice that it admits
the indemnification claim described in the Claim Notice, then the Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article VII_ , and subject to the limitations hereof, with respect to the
estimated amount of Damages stated in the Claim Notice. If the Indemnifying
Party notifies the Indemnified Party in writing that it disputes the claim for
indemnification, or that it admits the entitlement of the Indemnified Party to
indemnification under this  _Article VII_ with respect thereto but disputes
the amount of the Damages in connection therewith, then in either of such
cases the indemnification claim described in the Claim Notice shall be a
disputed indemnification claim that must be resolved by settlement between
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party or by proceedings commenced
in an appropriate court of competent jurisdiction by either the Indemnifying
Party or the Indemnified Party or by any other mutually agreeable method.

(b) If an Indemnified Party receives notice of the assertion or commencement
of any claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding made or brought by any
Person who or which is not a Party to this Agreement (a " _Third Party Claim_
") against such Indemnified Party with respect to which the Person against
whom or which such indemnification is being sought is obligated to provide
indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party will give the
Indemnifying Party prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later
than 10 Business Days after receipt of such written notice of such Third
Party Claim (the " _Third Party Claim Notice_ "). Such notice by the
Indemnified Party will describe the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail,
will include copies of all available material written evidence thereof, and
will indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Damages
that have been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. Within 15 days
after receipt of the Third Party Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party shall
notify the Indemnified Party in writing that Indemnifying Party either (i)
disputes the right of the Indemnified Party to indemnification under this
_Article VII_ with respect to the Third Party Claim or (ii) admits the right
of the Indemnified Party to indemnification under this _Article VII_ with
respect to Damages arising in connection with the Third Party Claim. The
failure of the Indemnifying Party to respond to the Indemnified Party within
such 15-day period after receipt of a Third Party Claim Notice shall be
deemed to constitute a response by the Indemnifying Party that it disputes the
right of such Indemnified Party to indemnification under this _Article VII_
with respect to that Third Party Claim.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party admits in writing that the Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification under this  _Article VII_ with respect to a
Third Party Claim, then in such event (i) the Indemnifying Party shall
diligently defend the Third Party Claim with counsel approved by the
Indemnified Party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) and (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into
any settlement of the Third Party Claim unless such settlement is approved in
writing by the Indemnified Party (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided, however,_ that
with respect to any claim related to Taxes, such claim shall be defended by
the Person who has legal liability for the claim subject to the control of the
Indemnifying Party and the approval rights of  



 

53  clause (ii). The costs and expenses of such defense shall be payable by the
Indemnifying Party. If, however, (i) the Indemnifying Party at any time fails
to so conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim or (ii) the Indemnified
Party, (A) determines in good faith that there is a reasonable probability
that a proceeding may adversely affect it other than as a result of
monetary damages for which it would be entitled to full indemnification under
this Agreement or (B) upon consultation with counsel has reasonably determined
in its good faith judgment that joint representation by counsel for the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party violates or would violate
applicable ethical and professional rules, then the Indemnified Party (upon
notice to the Indemnifying Party) may participate, together with counsel for
the Indemnifying Party, in the defense, compromise or settlement of such
Third Party Claims, and the reasonable costs and expenses of such
participation shall be payable by the Indemnifying Party.

(d) If the Indemnifying Party disputes in good faith the right of the
Indemnified Party to indemnification under this  _Article VII_ with respect
to the Third Party Claim described in a Third Party Claim Notice, then in such
event (i) the Indemnified Party may defend the Third Party Claim with counsel
of its choice; _provided, however_ , that the Indemnified Party (x) shall
diligently defend such Third Party Claim and (y) may not enter into a
settlement thereof without obtaining approval of the Indemnifying Party (which
approval shall not be unreasonable withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless
the Indemnified Party will not be seeking indemnification for any amounts paid
pursuant to such settlement thereof or for any other consequences (except to
the extent such settlement would not prejudice the rights of the Indemnifying
Party); and (ii) the amount of Damages incurred by the Indemnified Party in
connection with such Third Party Claim shall be a disputed indemnification
claim to be resolved by settlement between the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party or by proceedings commenced in an appropriate court of
competent jurisdiction by either the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified
Party or by any other mutually agreeable method.

(e) A failure to give timely notice or to include any specified information in
any notice as provided in  _Section 7.5(a)_ or _7.5(b)_ will not affect the
rights or obligations of any Party hereunder, except and only to the extent
that, as a result of such failure, any Party that was entitled to receive such
notice or information was deprived of its right to recover any payment under
its applicable insurance coverage or was otherwise prejudiced as a result of
such failure.

7.6 _Exclusive Remedy and Release._ Except as set forth in _Section 8.17_,
the indemnification and remedies set forth in this _Article VII_ shall, from
and after the Closing, constitute the sole and exclusive remedies of the
Parties with respect to any breach of representation or warranty or non-
performance, partial or total, of any covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement. EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS IDENTIFIED IN THE PREVIOUS SENTENCE,
EFFECTIVE UPON THE CLOSING, BUYER HEREBY WAIVES, RELEASES, ACQUITS AND FOREVER
DISCHARGES SELLER AND ITS AFFILIATES, AND ITS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS,
DIRECTORS, MANAGERS, MEMBERS, PARTNERS, STOCKHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES OR  



 

54  AGENTS, OR ANY OTHER PERSON ACTING ON BEHALF OF SELLER, OF AND FROM ANY AND
ALL CLAIMS, ACTIONS, CAUSES OF ACTION, DEMANDS, RIGHTS, DAMAGES,
COSTS, EXPENSES, LOSSES OR COMPENSATION WHATSOEVER, WHETHER DIRECT OR
INDIRECT, KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, FORESEEN OR UNFORESEEN, WHICH BUYER NOW HAS OR MAY
HAVE OR WHICH MAY ARISE AFTER THE CLOSING DATE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY,
INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY OF THE FOREGOING THAT IS FROM OR RELATING TO
THE POSSESSION, USE, HANDLING, MANAGEMENT, DISPOSAL, INVESTIGATION,
REMEDIATION, CLEANUP OR RELEASE OF ANY WASTES OR OTHER SUBSTANCES GOVERNED BY
ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS OR ANY ENVIRONMENTAL LAW APPLICABLE THERETO; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, THAT THE FOREGOING DOES NOT APPLY WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTIONS TAKEN
BY SELLER OR ITS AFFILIATES AFTER THE CLOSING DATE NOT OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR
UNDER ANY OF THE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS.

Agreement may be terminated at any time before the Closing as follows:

(a) by the mutual consent of Buyer and Seller as evidenced in writing signed
by each of Buyer and Seller;

(b) by Buyer, if there has been a material breach by Seller of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement that would
give rise to the failure of a condition to the obligations of Buyer at the
Closing and, if such breach is of a character that it is capable of being
cured, such breach has not been cured by Seller within 30 days after written
notice thereof from Buyer, provided that Buyer is not in material breach of
any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this
Agreement at such time;

(c) by Seller, if there has been a material breach by Buyer of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement that would

cured, such breach has not been cured by Buyer within 30 days after written
notice thereof from Seller, provided that Seller is not in material breach of

Agreement at such time;

(d) by either Buyer or Seller if any Governmental Authority having competent
jurisdiction has issued a final, non-appealable Order, decree, ruling or

transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or



 

55 (e) by either Buyer or Seller, if the transactions contemplated hereby have
not been consummated within 180 days after the date of this Agreement;

8.2 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated as provided in

any of the obligations or other acts of any other Party hereto or (b) waive

prior written consent of each other Party to this Agreement.



 

57 8.12 _Independent Covenants_. The covenants contained herein are independent

declared invalid or illegal, the other provisions hereof shall not be affected

8.13 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and the other documents delivered
pursuant hereto and the legal relations between the Parties shall be
governed and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of New York,
without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law.

8.14  _Jurisdiction; Venue_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of,
or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby may be brought in any state or federal
court of competent jurisdiction in New York, New York and each of the Parties
hereby consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate
appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection
which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such
suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or
proceeding which is brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient form. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be
served on any Party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each Party
agrees that service of process on such Party as provided in _Section 8.5_
will be deemed effective service of process on such Party.

8.15 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed an original

facsimile counterpart of this Agreement shall be sufficient to bind a Party

8.16 _Limitation of Liability_. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION OF THIS
AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT
BE LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY OR ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR OTHER INDIRECT DAMAGES OR ANY PUNITIVE OR
EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT
(INCLUDING ANY BREACH OR ALLEGED BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY,
COVENANT OR AGREEMENT IN THIS AGREEMENT), WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES ARE BASED ON
BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY,
INCLUDING DIMINUTION OF VALUE OR DAMAGES DETERMINED AS A MULTIPLE OF INCOME.

8.17 _Specific Enforcement_. The Parties acknowledge that, in view of the
uniqueness of the Business and the transactions contemplated hereby, Buyer
and Seller will not have an adequate remedy at Law for money damages in the
event that this Agreement has not been performed in accordance with its terms
by the other Parties, and therefore, the Parties agree that  



 

58  Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, shall be entitled to specific
enforcement of the terms hereof with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby (including without limitation to compel a Party to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in order to effect the Closing,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement) in the event of breach
by the other Party in addition to any other remedy to which the Parties may
be entitled, at Law or in equity, for such breach. In addition, the Parties
agree that any breach of any covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement by Seller may cause Buyer irreparable injury and damage. Seller,
therefore, expressly agrees that Buyer shall be entitled to seek injunctive
and/or other equitable relief to prevent an anticipatory or continuing breach
and to secure enforcement of any part of such covenants or agreements.
Nothing herein shall be construed as a waiver by Buyer or Seller of any right
they may now have or hereafter acquire to monetary damages from the other
Parties by reason of any injury to its property, or otherwise arising out of
any breach or any otherwise wrongful act or omission by such Parties.

8.18 _Further Assurances_. The Parties shall execute and deliver any and all
other instruments or documents and take such other and further action as may
be reasonably necessary or appropriate in order to give effect to the terms
and provisions of this Agreement.

(a) Seller Parent hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees all
obligations of Seller now or hereafter existing under this Agreement and the
Assignment, including _Article VII_ , and any and all expenses (including
reasonable counsel fees and expenses) incurred by Buyer in enforcing any
rights under this Agreement (collectively, the " _Seller Obligations_ ").
Buyer Parent hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees all obligations
of Buyer now or hereafter existing under this Agreement, including _Article
VII_ , and any and all expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and
expenses) incurred by Seller in enforcing any rights under this Agreement
(collectively, the " _Buyer Obligations_ ," and together with the Seller
Obligations, as applicable to each respective Party, the " _Obligations_ ").
For the purposes of this _Section 8.19_: (i) the term " _Guarantor_ "
shall refer to either Seller Parent or Buyer Parent, as applicable; (ii) the
term " _Obligor_ " shall refer to either Seller or Buyer, as applicable; and
(iii) the term " _Beneficiary_ " shall mean either Seller or Buyer, as
applicable, that is the intended beneficiary of the relevant parent guaranty.

(b) Guarantor guarantees that the Obligations will be performed strictly in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, regardless of any Law, regulation
or Order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such
terms or the rights of Obligor with respect thereto. The liability of
Guarantor under this _Section 8.19_ shall be absolute and unconditional
irrespective of (i) any lack of validity, enforceability or genuineness of any
provision of this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument relating
thereto, (ii) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any
other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver
of or any consent to departure from this Agreement, (iii) any release or
amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guaranty, for
all or any of the Obligations; or (iv) any other circumstance which might
otherwise constitute a defense available to or a discharge of Obligor or
Guarantor. 



 

59 (c) The guaranty set forth in this _Section 8.19_ shall continue to
be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment
of any of the Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by
Beneficiary upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of Obligor or
otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made. Guarantor hereby
waives promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance and any other notice with
respect to any of the Obligations and this guaranty. Guarantor hereby
irrevocably waives any claims or other rights that it may now or hereafter
acquire against Beneficiary that arise from the existence, payment,
performance or enforcement of Guarantors respective obligations under this
guaranty or this Agreement, including, without limitation, any right
of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification
and any right to participate in any claim or remedy of Beneficiary against
Obligor, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under
contract, statute or common law, including, without limitation, the right to
take or receive from the Obligor, directly or indirectly, in cash or other
property or by set-off or in any other manner, payment or security on account
of such claim, remedy or right. If any amount shall be paid to Guarantor in
violation of the preceding sentence at any time prior to the later of the cash
payment in full of the Obligations and all other amounts payable under this
guaranty and the termination date, such amount shall be held in trust for the
benefit of Beneficiary, shall forthwith be paid to Buyer to be credited and
applied to the Obligations and all other amounts payable under this guaranty,
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and this guaranty, or to be
held as collateral for any Obligations or other amounts payable under this
guaranty thereafter arising.

(d) The guaranty by Buyer Parent set forth in this _Section 8.19_ shall (i)
remain in full force and effect until the first anniversary of the Closing
Date or the termination of this Agreement, _provided, however,_ that if Buyer
Parent has been notified in writing of any claims with regard to Buyer
Obligations prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date, it shall
remain in full force and effect until discharge or payment in full of the
Obligations, (ii) be binding upon Buyer Parent and its respective successors
and assigns, and (iii) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
Beneficiary and its successors, transferees and assigns.

(e) The guaranty by Seller Parent set forth in this _Section 8.19_ shall (i)
remain in full force and effect until the third anniversary of the Closing
Date, _provided, however,_ that if Buyer Parent has been notified in writing
of any claims with regard to Seller Obligations prior to the third anniversary
of the Closing Date, it shall remain in full force and effect until discharge
or payment in full of such Seller Obligations and all other amounts payable
under this guaranty (if any), (ii) be binding upon Seller Parent and its
respective successors and assigns, and (iii) inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by Beneficiary and its successors, transferees and assigns

(g) Each Guarantor hereby makes the same representations set forth in
_Sections 3.1_ , _3.4,_ and _3.5_ , modified only to reflect that both
Guarantors are limited partnerships and are organized under the laws of the
State of Delaware. Except as provided in this  _Section 8.19_, the
Guarantors are not making any representations, warranties or covenants under
this Agreement.



 

60 (f) Beneficiary agrees that Guarantor shall have no obligation under this
Agreement except for the guaranty set forth in this _Section 8.19_.
