NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:

  

Article I 
  
 THE MERGER

  

1.1   _The Merger_.

  

(a)  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with the Minnesota Business Corporation Act (the " _MBCA_ ") and
the Washington Limited Liability Company Act (the " _WLLCA_ "), at the
Effective Time, Silicon shall merge with and into Merger Sub. Merger Sub
shall be the Surviving Company in the Merger, and shall continue its existence
as a limited liability company under the Laws of the State of Washington.
Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of
Silicon shall terminate.

  

(b)  Subject to the consent of Silicon, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed, Boron may at any time change the method
of effecting the combination of Silicon and Boron if and to the extent that
Boron deems such change to be desirable;  _provided_ that no such change
shall (i) alter or change the amount, kind or allocation of the Merger
Consideration provided for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the Tax
treatment of the holders of Holdings Common Interests or Holdings
Management Units (each, a " _Silicon Holder_ " and collectively, the "
_Silicon Holders_ ") as a result of receiving their portion of the Merger
Consideration or the Tax treatment of any of the parties pursuant to this
Agreement, (iii) materially impede or delay the receipt of any consents or
approvals of or complete any filings or registrations with any Regulatory
Agency or Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (iv) materially impede or delay
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

1.2   _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective as set
forth in the articles of merger to be filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Minnesota (the " _Minnesota Secretary_ ") and the Secretary of
State of the State of Washington (the " _Washington Secretary_ ") on the
Closing Date (collectively, the " _Articles of Merger_ "). The term "
_Effective Time_ " shall be the date and time when the Merger becomes
effective as designated in the Articles of Merger.

  

1.3   _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time,
the Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of
the MBCA and the WLLCA.

  

1.4   _Conversion of Silicon Common Stock_.

  

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Holdings, Silicon, Boron, Merger Sub or the holder of any of the
following securities:

  

(a)  All of the shares of Silicon Common Stock that are issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled
Shares) shall be converted into the

    

-6- 
--- 

 


--- 

    

right to receive, in the aggregate, (i) an amount of cash equal to the Cash
Consideration Amount and (ii) a number of shares of Boron Common Stock and
Boron Non-Voting Common Stock determined as set forth below in this Section
1.4(a) (the consideration referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) being
collectively referred to as the " _Merger Consideration_ "). The number of
shares of Boron Common Stock to be included in the Merger Consideration will
be 13.23 million shares minus the number of shares of Boron Common Stock
issuable on full conversion of the Boron Non-Voting Common Stock to be
included in the Merger Consideration. The number of shares of Boron Non-Voting
Common Stock to be included in the Merger Consideration will be the number of
shares (which shall in no event exceed 3,000,000 shares) necessary for
Holdings to have available to distribute in the Distribution (in lieu of an
equal number of shares of Boron Common Stock) to the Silicon Holders
specified in Section 1.4(a) of the Silicon Disclosure Schedule so that,
immediately following the Distribution, such Silicon Holders and their
Affiliates (disregarding for this purpose the proviso in the definition of
"Affiliates") would collectively own, in the aggregate, no more than 4.9% of
the outstanding Boron Common Stock (calculated in accordance with the
applicable regulations, interpretations and guidance of the Federal Reserve
Board). Holdings shall specify such number of shares of Boron Non-Voting
Common Stock in a notice delivered to Boron not less than three (3) Business
Days prior to the expected Closing.

  

(b)  At the Effective Time, all shares of Silicon Common Stock
that are owned, directly or indirectly, by Silicon or any of its wholly owned
Subsidiaries (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall be cancelled and shall cease
to exist and no Boron Common Stock or other consideration shall be delivered
in exchange therefor.

  

(c)  All of the shares of Silicon Common Stock converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall
cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and shall thereafter represent only
the right to receive, in the aggregate, the Merger Consideration which the
Silicon Common Stock have been converted into the right to receive pursuant
to this Section 1.4, without any interest thereon.

  

(d)  At or prior to the Effective Time, Silicon, the Board of
Directors of Silicon and its compensation committee, as applicable, shall
adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are reasonably necessary to
ensure that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, following the
Effective Time, no service provider of Silicon and its Subsidiaries shall have
any right to acquire any securities of Silicon, Boron or any Subsidiary
thereof or to receive any payment, right or benefit (other than any payment by
Holdings of a portion of the Merger Consideration) with respect to any award
previously granted in respect of securities of Silicon.

  

1.5   _Merger Sub Interests_. At and after the Effective Time,
each limited liability company interest of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain an issued and
outstanding limited liability company interest of Merger Sub as the surviving
company in the Merger and shall not be affected by the Merger.

  

1.6   _Limited Liability Company Agreement of Merger Sub_. The
limited liability company agreement of Merger Sub as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time

    

-7- 
--- 

 


--- 

    

shall be the limited liability company agreement of Merger Sub as the
surviving company of the Merger until amended in accordance with applicable
Law.

  

1.7   _Directors and Officers_.

  

(a)  At and immediately after the Effective Time, the directors
and officers of Merger Sub shall consist of the officers of Merger Sub in
office immediately prior to the Effective Time, in each case until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, or their
earlier death, resignation or removal.

  

(b)  At or prior to the Effective Time, Boron's Board of
Directors shall take all appropriate action to increase the number of
directors by five (5), it being understood that (i) three (3) of such
vacancies shall be reserved for one (1) representative of each of the Major
Silicon Members, in each case appointed in accordance with the terms and
conditions of such Major Silicon Member's Investor Letter Agreement, and (ii)
two (2) of such vacancies shall be reserved for independent directors who
are currently members of Holdings' Board of Directors or such other persons
as the Board of Directors of Holdings may identify, the identity of such
persons to be mutually agreed by the Board of Directors of Holdings and the
Board of Directors of Boron. Each of the foregoing directors shall serve
commencing as of the Effective Time and thereafter until his or her successor
has been duly elected or appointed and qualified, or his or her earlier
death, resignation or removal.

  

(c)  At or prior to the Effective Time, to the extent
consistent with applicable regulatory commitments and conditions,
Boron's Board of Directors shall take all appropriate action to cause the
Corporate Governance / Nominating Committee of Boron (the "
_Corporate Governance Committee_ ") to consist of not less than three (3)
members of Boron's Board of Directors, it being understood that the Corporate
Governance Committee shall include members who are independent directors on
each of Boron's Board of Directors and Holdings' Board of Directors, in each
case as of the date hereof, and that the number of such members from
Boron's Board of Directors shall exceed by one (1) the number of such members
from Holding's Board of Directors.

  

(d)  At or prior to the Effective Time, to the extent consistent
with applicable regulatory commitments and conditions, Boron's Board of
Directors shall take all appropriate action to cause the Executive Committee
of Boron's Board of Directors (the " _Executive Committee_ ") to include two
(2) of the directors appointed by Holdings to Boron's Board of
Directors pursuant to Section 1.7(b) that are independent directors, such two
(2) individuals to be designated by a majority of the members of the
Corporate Governance Committee formed pursuant to Section 1.7(c).

  

1.8   _Bank Merger_.

  

(a)  On the Closing Date and immediately following the Merger,
AmericanWest Bank, a Washington state-chartered bank and a wholly owned
Subsidiary of Silicon (" _Silicon Bank_ "), will merge (the " _Bank Merger_ ")
with and into Banner Bank, a Washington state-chartered bank and a wholly
owned Subsidiary of Boron (" _Boron Bank_ "); _provided_  that without
limiting any of the obligations of Boron or Silicon set forth herein with

    

-8- 
--- 

 


--- 

    

respect to the Bank Merger or any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1,
7.2 or 7.3 relating to the Bank Merger, if the parties agree that operational
issues relating to the Bank Merger would preclude the ability of the parties
to consummate the Bank Merger simultaneously with the Merger, Boron and
Silicon shall act reasonably and in good faith to mutually determine whether
to proceed with the Merger prior to the Bank Merger. Boron Bank shall be the
surviving entity in the Bank Merger (the " _Surviving Bank_ ") and shall
continue its corporate existence under the name Boron Bank and, following the
Bank Merger, the separate corporate existence of Silicon Bank shall cease.

  

(b)  The Bank Merger shall be implemented pursuant to an
agreement and plan of merger, in a form to be specified by Boron
and reasonably acceptable to Holdings and Silicon (the " _Bank Merger

be accomplished prior to the filing of applications with any Governmental
Entity for regulatory approval of the Bank Merger: (i) Silicon shall

Bank and delivered to Boron Bank and (ii) Boron shall cause Boron Bank to
adopt the Bank Merger Agreement, Boron, as the sole shareholder of Boron Bank,
shall approve the Bank Merger Agreement and Boron shall cause the Bank Merger

such certificates of merger and articles of combination and such other
documents and certificates as are necessary to make the Bank Merger effective
(" _Bank Merger Certificates_ ") at the appropriate time as determined
pursuant to the first sentence of Section 1.8. The time that the Bank Merger
occurs becomes effective pursuant to the foregoing sentence shall be the "
_Bank Merger Effective Time_ ").

  

(c)  The directors of the Surviving Bank shall, from and after
the Bank Merger Effective Time consist of the members of the Boron Board of
Directors at such time, in each case, until their successors shall have been
duly elected or appointed and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation
or removal. The Surviving Bank shall, prior to the Effective Time, amend
clauses (iv) and (v) of Article III, Section 4 of its bylaws to provide that
the restrictions set forth therein shall only apply to banks (and
holding companies thereof) that conduct business that is competitive with
that of Boron Bank in the geographic areas in which Boron Bank operates.

  

1.9   _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that the Merger shall
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code, and that this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a "plan of
reorganization" for the purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

least five (5) Business Days in advance of the Closing.

  

(b)  Boron shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to Holdings
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Boron and paid
over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, the withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to Holdings.

  

(c)  After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on
the books of Silicon of Silicon Common Stock that was issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

2.2   _Distribution of Merger Consideration to Silicon Holders_.

(b)  All shares of Boron Common Stock and Boron Non-Voting
Common Stock received by Holdings or any Silicon Holder as a result of the
Merger, the Distribution or the other transactions contemplated hereby shall
bear a legend or legends (and appropriate comparable notations or other
arrangements will be made with respect to any uncertificated shares)
referencing restrictions on transfer of such shares of Boron Common Stock or
Boron Non-Voting Common Stock under the Securities Act which legend shall
state in substance:

  

"The securities evidenced by this certificate have been issued and sold
without registration under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), or the securities laws of any state of
the United States (a " _State Act_ ") in reliance upon certain exemptions
from registration under said acts. The securities evidenced by this
certificate cannot be sold, assigned or otherwise transferred within the
United States unless such sale, assignment or other transfer is (i) made
pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act

    

-10-

and in accordance with each applicable State Act or (ii) exempt from, or not

Voting Common Stock shall be entitled to receive from Boron new Certificates
for a like number of shares not bearing such legend (or the elimination or
termination of such notations or arrangements) upon the request of such holder
at (i) such time as such restrictions are no longer applicable, and (ii) if
required by Boron, delivery of an opinion of counsel to such holder, which
opinion is reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to Boron, to the
effect that the restriction referenced in such legend (or such notations
or arrangements) is no longer required in order to ensure compliance with the
Securities Act (or any applicable state securities law).

  

Article III 
  
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF HOLDINGS AND SILICON

  

Except as Previously Disclosed by Silicon, Holdings and Silicon hereby
represent and warrant to Boron as follows:

Holdings has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. Holdings is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it
makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure
to be so licensed or qualified would not, either individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Holdings. True and complete copies of the Organizational Documents of
Holdings, as amended through the date hereof have previously been Made
Available by Holdings to Boron. The Organizational Documents of Holdings are
in full force and effect and Holdings is not in violation of any of their
provisions.

or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and

Adverse Effect on Silicon. True and complete copies of the Organizational
Documents of Silicon, as amended through the date hereof have previously been
Made Available by Silicon to Boron. The Organizational Documents of Silicon

existing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is duly
qualified to do business and, where such concept is recognized under
applicable Law, in good standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal,

failure to be so qualified would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Silicon and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to carry on

adequate consideration in the ordinary course of business of Silicon and its
Subsidiaries.

amounts owing to Silicon and its applicable Subsidiary and are carried on the
books of Silicon or the applicable Subsidiary at values determined in
accordance with GAAP, and are not subject to any material setoffs or claims
arising from acts or omissions of Silicon or any of its Subsidiaries. No GSE,

all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as may
reasonably be requested. No party nor any of their respective Subsidiaries
shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such

applicable Law or Contract; _provided_ that such party will use reasonable
best efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

regulations of NASDAQ and applicable Law, to duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of shareholders of Boron entitled to vote at the
meeting as promptly as practicable for the purpose of obtaining the Boron
Shareholder Approval (such meeting or any adjournment or postponement
thereof, the " _Boron Shareholders Meeting_ "). The Board of Directors of
Boron shall (i) recommend to Boron's shareholders the approval of (A) the

Consideration, and (B) the Amendment (the " _Boron Board Recommendation_ "),
(ii) include the Boron Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and (iii)
solicit and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Boron Shareholder

shall not be required to hold the Boron Shareholders Meeting if this
Agreement is terminated before the Boron Shareholders Meeting is held.

  

(b)  Boron shall as promptly as practicable prepare and file
with the SEC a proxy statement relating to the Boron Shareholders Meeting
(the " _Proxy Statement_ "). The Proxy Statement shall include the Boron Board
Recommendation with respect to the issuance of the number of shares of Boron
Common Stock sufficient to deliver the aggregate Merger Consideration. Boron
shall notify Silicon promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or
its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall
supply Silicon with copies of all written correspondence between Boron or any
of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the
other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Merger. If, at any
time prior to the receipt of the Boron Shareholder Approval, any event occurs
with respect to Boron, Silicon or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or any
change occurs with respect to other information supplied by a party for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement, which is required to be described in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, such party shall promptly
notify the other party of such event, and Boron promptly file with the SEC any
necessary amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, disseminate the information contained in such
amendment or supplement to Boron's shareholders.

so qualify or modify), the Boron Board Recommendation.

  

6.4   _Employee Benefit Plans_.

  

(a)  Following the Effective Time, Boron shall provide each
individual who is an employee of Silicon and its Subsidiaries at the
Effective Time (any such person, a " _Continuing Employee_ " and,
collectively, the " _Continuing Employees_ "), while employed by Boron or its
Subsidiaries, with compensation opportunities and employee benefits that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate (excluding any benefits accelerated
or payable as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) to
the compensation opportunities and

    

-46- 
--- 

 


--- 

    

employee benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Boron and its
Subsidiaries; _provided_ that for purposes of the foregoing sentence the
compensation opportunities and employee benefit plans generally provided to
employees of Silicon as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
deemed to be substantially comparable, on an aggregate basis, to those
provided to similarly situated employees of Boron and its Subsidiaries for
purposes of this sentence, it being understood that the Continuing Employees
may commence participation in Boron's benefit plans on different dates
following the Effective Time with respect to different benefit plans. Any
Continuing Employee whose employment is terminated within the one-year period
following the Effective Time under circumstances that would entitle such
Continuing Employee to severance benefits under the severance plan of Silicon
and its Subsidiaries, shall be entitled to severance benefits under
such severance plan. Nothing contained in this Section 6.4(a) shall be deemed
to grant any Continuing Employee any right to continued employment after the
Closing Date.

  

(b)  With respect to any employee benefit plans of Boron or its
Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Continuing Employee after the
Effective Time (a " _New Benefit Plan_ "), Boron shall: (i) waive all pre-
existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees and their
eligible dependents under any New Benefit Plans that provide health care
benefits in which such employees first become eligible to participate
after the Effective Time, except to the extent such pre-existing conditions,
exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the analogous Silicon Benefit
Plan; (ii) to the extent allowed by the provider of any New Benefit Plan that
provides health care benefits, provide each such employee and their eligible
dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the
Effective Time under a Silicon Benefit Plan that provided health care
benefits (to the same extent that such credit was given under the
analogous Silicon Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any such New
Benefit Plans in the plan year in which such employees first become eligible
to participate after the Effective Time; and (iii) recognize all service of
such Continuing Employees with Silicon and its Subsidiaries as well as actual
service by such Continuing Employees with any predecessors to Silicon and its
Subsidiaries, including any entities the stock or assets of were acquired by
Silicon and its Subsidiaries, for purposes of eligibility to participate and
vesting in any New Benefit Plan in which such employees first become eligible
to participate after the Effective Time to the same extent that such service
was taken into account under the analogous Silicon Benefit Plan prior to the
Effective Time and for benefit accrual purposes under any severance and
vacation plans of Boron or its Subsidiaries in which such Continuing Employee
participates; _provided_ that the foregoing service recognition shall not
apply (A) to the extent it would result in duplication of benefits for the
same period of services, or (B) for purposes of any defined benefit
retirement plan or benefit plan that provides retiree welfare benefits.

  

(c)  If requested by Boron in writing delivered to Silicon not
less than twenty (20) Business Days before the Closing Date, the Board of
Directors of Silicon (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt
resolutions and take such corporate action as is necessary to terminate
Silicon's 401(k) plans (collectively, the " _Silicon 401(k) Plan_ "),
effective as of immediately prior to the Closing Date and contingent upon the
occurrence of the Closing. Following the Effective Time and as soon as
practicable following receipt of a favorable determination letter from the
IRS on the termination of the Silicon 401(k) Plan, the assets thereof

    

-47- 
--- 

 


--- 

    

shall be distributed to the participants, and Boron shall take all actions
necessary, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, to permit the Continuing
Employees who are then actively employed to make rollover contributions of
"eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section
401(a)(31) of the Code but not inclusive of loans), in the form of cash, in
an amount equal to the full account balance (including loans) distributed to
such Continuing Employee from the Silicon 401(k) Plan to Boron's applicable
401(k) plan (the " _Boron 401(k) Plan_ "). Prior to the Effective Time, Boron
shall take all actions necessary to provide that, if the Silicon 401(k) Plan
is terminated as described in this Section 6.4(c), the Continuing Employees
shall be eligible as soon as practicable (but in any event, no later than
sixty (60) days) following the termination of the Silicon 401(k) Plan and
distribution of account balances thereunder to commence participation in the
Boron 401(k) Plan.

  

(d)  Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee,
officer, director or consultant of Boron or Silicon or any of their
Subsidiaries or affiliates any right to continue in the employ or service of
Silicon, Boron or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall interfere
with or restrict in any way the rights of Silicon, Boron or any Subsidiary or
affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the services of any employee,
officer, director or consultant of Boron or Silicon or any of their
Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or
without cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i)
establish, amend, or modify any Silicon Benefit Plan, New Benefit Plan or any
other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii)
alter or limit the ability of Boron or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates
to amend, modify or terminate any particular Silicon Benefit Plan, New
Benefit Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or
arrangement after the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of the
final sentence of Section 9.11, nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person, including any
current or former employee, officer, director or consultant of Boron or
Silicon or any of their Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right, benefit or
remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

  

6.5   _Indemnification; Directors ' and Officers' Insurance_. 

  

(a)  From and after the Effective Time, Boron shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to, (i) indemnify and hold
harmless each of Silicon's and each of its Subsidiaries' respective present
and former directors and officers (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_
") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any Proceedings, arising out of or pertaining to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and actions relating to the
enforcement of this Section 6.5, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that Silicon or such
Subsidiary, as the case may be, would have been permitted under its
respective organizational documents in effect on the date of this Agreement
or agreements in existence as of the date hereof and set forth on Section
6.4(a) of the Silicon Disclosure Schedule providing for indemnification
between Silicon or any of its Subsidiaries and any Indemnified Party, subject
to limitations imposed by applicable Law (including the advancing of expenses
as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; _provided_
, the Person to whom such expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to
the

    

-48- 
--- 

 


--- 

    

Surviving Company to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that
such Person is not entitled to indemnification).

  

(b)  For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Boron shall
cause the Surviving Company to maintain in effect, at its own
expense, directors' and officers' liability and fiduciary liability insurance
covering those Persons who are currently covered by Holdings' directors' and
officers' liability and fiduciary liability insurance policies (true, correct
and complete copies of which have been heretofore delivered to Boron) either
through continuation of the current policy or substitution by Boron of
another policy therefor on terms, including with respect to coverage and
insurance limits (with no retention), with an insurer or insurers that have
at the time such coverage is written the same or higher A.M. Best rating as
Boron's current primary insurer for such type of insurance, not materially
less favorable than the terms of such current insurance coverage with respect
to claims arising from or related to facts or events which occurred at or
prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement); _provided_ that in complying with its obligations pursuant to the
terms of this Section 6.5(b), Boron shall not be required to expend annually
in the aggregate an amount in excess of 200% of the annual premium currently
paid by Holdings (which current amount is set forth on Section 6.5(b) of the
Silicon Disclosure Schedule) (the " _Premium Cap_ ") and if Boron cannot
obtain such insurance coverage without paying in excess of the Premium Cap,
Boron shall purchase such insurance with the maximum aggregate coverage
available for the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing insurance coverage and
in satisfaction of its obligations under this Section 6.5(b), prior to the
Closing, Holdings may purchase a six (6) year prepaid "tail policy" that
provides the coverage in this Section 6.5(b); _provided,_ _further_ that if
the premium for such "tail coverage" exceeds the Premium Cap, then Holdings
may obtain "tail coverage" with the maximum aggregate coverage available
for such Premium Cap (and if Holdings does not act to so purchase such "tail
policy" prior to the Closing, Boron may purchase or may direct Holdings to
purchase the same).

  

(c)  In the event that, after the Effective Time, Boron or the
Surviving Company or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or a substantial portion of its properties and other
assets to any person, then, and in each case, Boron or the Surviving Company,

approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, the

other hand, shall each promptly advise the other party of any fact, change,
event or circumstance that has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on it or which it believes would or would be reasonably likely
to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations,
warranties or covenants contained herein; _provided_ that any failure to give
notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach shall not
be deemed to constitute a violation of this Section 6.7 or the failure of any
condition set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied, or otherwise
constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party failing to give such
notice, in each case unless the underlying breach would independently result
in a failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be
satisfied.

  

(b)  Boron, on the one hand, and Silicon and Holdings, on the
other hand, shall each promptly advise the other party of (i) any notice or

Entity or third party whose consent or approval is required for consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to
believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that (A) any such consent or
approval will not be obtained or (B) the receipt of any such consent or
approval will be materially delayed. Silicon shall notify Boron as promptly as
practicable of any notice or other communication from any party to any
Silicon Contract to the effect that such party has terminated or intends to
terminate or otherwise materially adversely modify its relationship with

transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such public announcement without the prior consent of the other
party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned);

after prior consultation, to the extent practicable in the circumstances)
issue such press release or make such public statement to the extent required
by applicable Law or the applicable rules of any stock exchange. Without
limiting the reach of the preceding sentence, Silicon and Boron shall

6.9   _Takeover Statutes_. Silicon and its Subsidiaries shall
not take any action that would cause the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover Statute. If
any Takeover Statute may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, each of Boron and Silicon and
the members of their respective Boards of Directors shall grant such approvals
and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the

agreement with respect to the transactions described in Section 6.10(a) and
shall immediately take all steps necessary to terminate any approval that may
have been heretofore given under any such provisions authorizing any Person
to engage in any transaction described in Section 6.10(a).

case, without payment or incurrence of further Liability thereunder and (ii)

respective Investor Letter Agreements. Such agreement shall be in a form
proposed by Boron and reasonably acceptable to Silicon.

Silicon shall (i) use its reasonable efforts to obtain any necessary waivers
from any individuals who are "disqualified individuals" (within the meaning
of Section 280G(c) of the Code and the regulations thereunder) of any payments
or benefits that could reasonably be viewed as "parachute payments" (within
the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations thereunder)
in the absence of a stockholder vote, and (ii) submit to a vote of the
stockholders of Silicon or any applicable affiliate for their determination
