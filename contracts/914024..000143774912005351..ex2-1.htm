(ii) Estimated Closing Debt, plus

  

  

(iii) if Estimated Closing Working Capital exceeds Base Closing Working

25  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(iv) if Base Closing Working Capital exceeds Estimated Closing Working
Capital, the amount of such excess.

  

  

The Purchase Price shall be paid in immediately available funds by wire
transfer to Parent and/or one or more Subsidiary Sellers in accordance with
written instructions given by Parent to Buyer not less than two (2) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date or such later time as may be agreed by Parent

in Section 2.8.

  

  

(b) Three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to
Buyer a written statement (the "Purchase Price Calculation Statement") setting
forth its good faith estimate of (i) the amount of (A) Closing Debt (the
"Estimated Closing Debt") and (B) Closing Working Capital (the "Estimated
Closing Working Capital") and (ii) the calculation of the Purchase Price based
thereon.

  

  

Section 2.8. Purchase Price Adjustment.

  

  

(a) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to
Parent a statement of Closing Working Capital and a statement of Closing Debt
and the balance sheet of the Business as of the close of business on the
Closing Date (collectively, the "Closing Statements"). The Closing Statements
shall be reviewed by KPMG LLP or, if KPMG LLP is unavailable, another
accounting firm of recognized international standing upon which Parent and
Buyer shall mutually agree (the "Closing Statement Firm"), with the cost of
such review to be shared equally by Buyer and Parent, and shall be prepared in
accordance with the accounting principles set forth on Schedule 2.8(a) (the
"Accounting Principles"). The Closing Statements shall be accompanied by an
agreed upon procedures report duly executed by the Closing Statement Firm.
Parent and Buyer shall work together in good faith to agree within fifteen
(15) Business Days of the date hereof upon the procedures to be followed by
the Closing Statement Firm in its review of the Closing Statements. During the
preparation of the Closing Statements by Buyer and the period of any dispute
with respect to the application of this Section 2.8, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Subsidiary Sellers and their respective Affiliates to, (i) provide
Buyer and Buyer's accountants, advisors and other representatives with
reasonable access during normal business hours to the Books and Records,
properties and personnel of Parent to the extent relevant to the preparation
of the Closing Statements and (ii) assist Buyer and Buyer's accountants,
advisors and other representatives in the preparation of the Closing
Statements.

  

  

(b) Parent may dispute the amounts reflected on the line items of a Closing
Statement (each, a "Disputed Item"), but only on the basis of (i) mathematical
errors or (ii) such Closing Statement not being calculated in accordance with
Section 2.8; provided, however, that in each case Parent shall notify Buyer in
writing of each Disputed Item, and specify in reasonable detail the amount
thereof in dispute and the basis therefor, within thirty (30) days after such
Closing Statement has been received by Parent. The failure by Parent to
provide a notice of Disputed Items to Buyer within such period will constitute
Parent's final and binding acceptance of all items in such Closing Statement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

26  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) If a notice of Disputed Items shall be timely delivered pursuant to clause
(b) above, Parent and Buyer shall, during the ten (10) Business Days following
the date of such delivery (the "Resolution Period"), negotiate in good faith
to resolve the Disputed Items. If, during the Resolution Period, the parties
reach an agreement, such agreement shall be evidenced in writing and such
Closing Statement (as revised pursuant to such written agreement) shall become
final and binding on the date of such agreement. If, during the Resolution
Period, the parties are unable to reach agreement, Parent and Buyer shall
refer all unresolved Disputed Items to BDO Seidman LLP or, if BDO Seidman LLP
is unavailable, another independent accounting firm of recognized
international standing upon which Parent and Buyer shall mutually agree (the
"Independent Accountant"). The Independent Accountant shall make a
determination, acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator, with respect to
unresolved Disputed Items within thirty (30) days after its engagement by
Parent and Buyer, which determination shall be made in accordance with the
rules set forth in this Section 2.8. In making such determinations, the
Independent Accountant shall consider only the Disputed Items (and not any
other items or amounts in such Closing Statement), and shall resolve the
amount of each Disputed Item within the range of difference between Buyer's
and Parent's calculations of such item. The Independent Accountant shall
deliver to Parent and Buyer, within such thirty (30) day period, a report
setting forth (i) its adjustments, if any, to such Closing Statement and (ii)
the calculations supporting such adjustments. Such report shall be final,
conclusive and binding on the parties. Parent and Buyer shall share equally
all costs incurred in connection with the engagement of the Independent
Accountant.

  

  

(d) If the Estimated Closing Working Capital exceeds the Final Closing Working
Capital, or if the Final Closing Debt exceeds the Estimated Closing Debt, then
Parent, for itself and as agent for the Subsidiary Sellers, shall pay to
Buyer, for itself and as agent for the Affiliated Buyers, the amount of such
shortfall in accordance with paragraph (e). If the Final Closing Working
Capital exceeds the Estimated Closing Working Capital, or if the Estimated
Closing Debt exceeds the Final Closing Debt, then Buyer, for itself and as
agent for the Affiliated Buyers, shall pay to Parent, for itself and as agent
for the Subsidiary Sellers, the amount of the excess in accordance with
paragraph (e).

  

  

(e) All payments to be made under paragraph (d) will be paid by the party
obligated to make such payment under this Section 2.8 (the "Paying Party") to
the other party (the "Receiving Party"), for itself and as agent for its
Affiliates (as applicable), within ten (10) days after the determination of
the Agreed Closing Statement, in dollars by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, in accordance with written instructions given by the
Receiving Party to the Paying Party (which instructions shall be provided by
the Receiving Party promptly, and no later than eight (8) days, after the
determination of the Agreed Closing Statement (or such later time as may be
agreed by Parent and Buyer)), together with interest on such amount from the
Closing Date to the date of such payment, at a rate equal to the Interest Rate
on the Closing Date.

  

  

(f) For purposes of the preparation of the Closing Statements and determining
amounts of payments to be made under Section 2.8(d), all amounts in a currency
other than dollars shall be converted to dollars at the applicable Bloomberg
Currency Composite Rate (London (CMPL)) (or any successor thereto) at 6 p.m.,
London time, on the Business Day prior to the Closing Date, or such other date
as Parent and Buyer may agree to be appropriate for the relevant calculation.

(a) Parent and Buyer acknowledge and agree that the Purchase Price shall be
allocated among Parent and each Subsidiary Seller as set forth in Schedule

(b) The portion of the Purchase Price allocated to each Subsidiary Seller of

Parent shall deliver to Buyer a preliminary allocation (a "Draft Allocation")
with respect to the Other Acquired Assets. Unless Buyer objects to the Draft
Allocation in writing within fifteen (15) days after receipt thereof, the
Draft Allocation shall become final (a "Final Allocation").

  

  

(c) The portion of the Purchase Price allocated to Parent and each Subsidiary
Seller that is a seller of a Consolidated Domestic Subsidiary, plus the
liabilities of such a Consolidated Domestic Subsidiary, shall be allocated
among the assets of such Consolidated Domestic Subsidiary pursuant to Section
338 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, and such allocation
shall be used to determine the "aggregate deemed sale price" and the "adjusted
grossed up basis" for the assets of such Consolidated Domestic Subsidiary
(including the assets of any of its Subsidiaries for which a Section
338(h)(10) Election is made or the assets of any of its Subsidiaries that is a
pass-through entity). Not later than forty-five (45) days following the
Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to Buyer a Draft Allocation with respect to
the assets of each Consolidated Domestic Subsidiary (and its Subsidiaries, as
applicable). Unless Buyer objects to the Draft Allocation in writing within
fifteen (15) days after receipt thereof, the Draft Allocation shall become the
Final Allocation.

  

  

(d) If Parent requests that a Section 338(g) Election be made with respect to
the Acquired Foreign Corporation, the portion of the Purchase Price allocated
to the Subsidiary Seller of the Acquired Foreign Corporation plus the
liabilities of such Acquired Foreign Corporation, shall be allocated among the
assets of such Acquired Foreign Corporation pursuant to Section 338 of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, and such allocation shall be
used to determine the "aggregate deemed sale price" and the "adjusted grossed
up basis" for the assets of such Acquired Foreign Corporation. Not later than
forty-five (45) days following the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to Buyer
a Draft Allocation with respect to the assets of the Acquired Foreign
Corporation (and its Subsidiaries, as applicable). Unless Buyer objects to the
Draft Allocation in writing within fifteen (15) days after receipt thereof,
the Draft Allocation shall become the Final Allocation.

  

  

(e) The portion of the Purchase Price allocated to each Subsidiary Seller of a
Pass-through Entity, plus the liabilities of such Pass-through Entity, shall
be allocated among the assets of such Pass-through Entity (and the assets of
any of its Subsidiaries to the extent the assets of such Subsidiary are
treated as sold) in accordance with Sections 1060, 743 or 751 of the Code (as
applicable) and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (as applicable). Not later
than forty-five (45) days following the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to
Buyer a Draft Allocation with respect to the assets of each Pass-through
Entity (and the assets of any of its Subsidiaries to the extent the assets of
such Subsidiaries are treated as sold). Unless Buyer objects to the Draft
Allocation in writing within fifteen (15) days after receipt thereof, the
Draft Allocation shall become the Final Allocation.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

28  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(f) Parent and Buyer agree that each Final Allocation, as adjusted, shall be
used by Parent, the Subsidiary Sellers, Buyer, the Affiliated Buyers, and
their respective Affiliates for all Tax reporting purposes.

  

  

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in subsections (b) through (f) of
this Section 2.9, if Buyer objects to a Draft Allocation within fifteen (15)
days after receipt thereof, the parties agree to work in good faith to resolve
such dispute. If the parties fail to reach a resolution of such dispute within
thirty (30) days after the date on which Buyer provides written notice of such
objection, the applicable Final Allocation shall be determined in accordance
with the dispute resolution procedures set forth in Section 2.8(c). The Final
Allocations shall be revised to take into account any adjustments to the
Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.8 allocated to, as applicable, (i) a
Subsidiary Seller of Other Acquired Assets with respect to such Other Acquired
Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder, (ii) Parent or the applicable Subsidiary Seller with

and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, (iii) the Subsidiary Seller of the
Acquired Foreign Corporation in a manner consistent with Section 338 of the

consistent with Sections 1060, 743 or 751 of the Code (as applicable) and the

(i) provide promptly to any Governmental Authority with regulatory
jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable Competition Laws
("Governmental Competition Authority") information and documents requested by
such Governmental Competition Authority, or necessary, proper or advisable in

(b) Each of Parent and Buyer shall (i) keep each other apprised of the status
of any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional
information from, any Governmental Competition Authority, and shall comply
with any such inquiry or request as promptly as practicable. Parent and Buyer
shall cooperate and consult with each other in connection with determining
whether any filing is to be made under any Competition Laws and the making of
all filings, notifications and any other material actions pursuant to this
Section 7.2, including, subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, by permitting counsel for the other party to review in advance,
and consider in good faith the views of the other party in connection with,
any proposed written communication to any Governmental Competition Authority
and provide counsel for the other party with copies of all filings and
submissions made by such party and all correspondence and other written
communications between such party (and its advisors) and any Governmental
Competition Authority and any other information supplied by such party and
Parent, the Subsidiary Sellers or Buyer or the Affiliated Buyers, as the case

be reasonably requested by the other party to this Agreement in such defense.

  

  

(c) If any objections are asserted by any Governmental Competition Authority
with respect to the Contemplated Transactions under any applicable Competition
Law or which would otherwise prevent, materially impede or materially delay
the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, or if any action is
instituted by any Governmental Competition Authority or any private party

Competition Law, or an order is issued enjoining the Contemplated Transactions
(but subject, for the avoidance of doubt, to the limitations set forth in
Section 7.2(e)), each of Parent and Buyer shall use its reasonable best
efforts to resolve any such objections or suits so as to permit consummation
of the Contemplated Transactions by the Closing, including in order to resolve
such objections or suits which, in any case if not resolved, could reasonably

judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted)

respects with each other and use its respective reasonable best efforts to
contest and resist any such action or proceeding, including defending through

agreement with a Governmental Competition Authority to delay or not to
consummate the Contemplated Transactions on the Closing Date, except with the
prior written consent of the other party to this Agreement. Parent and Buyer
shall not have any substantive contact with any Governmental Competition
Authority in respect of any filing or proceeding contemplated by this Section

permitted by such Governmental Competition Authority, gives the other party
the opportunity to participate.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall not be
required and Parent shall not be permitted by this Section 7.2 to take or
agree to undertake any action, including entering into any consent decree,
hold separate order or other arrangement, that would (i) require the
divestiture of any assets of Buyer, Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates; or (ii) require taking any other action that would reasonably be
expected to diminish the benefits reasonably expected to be derived by Buyer
on the date hereof from the acquisition in such a manner that Buyer would not
have entered into this Agreement in the face of such diminished benefits.

prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to Taxes.

  

  

(ii) Parent and Buyer shall retain, or cause to be retained, all Tax and
accounting books and records (including all computerized books and records,
and any such information stored on any other form of media) in their
possession (as well as those in the possession of the Acquired Entities or
their other Affiliates), in each case relevant for Taxes for Pre-Closing Tax
Periods until the applicable period for assessment under applicable Law
(giving effect to any and all extensions or waivers) has expired with respect
to the particular Taxes to which any such books and records relate ("Retention
Period"), and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with
any Taxing Authority.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(iii) Other than with respect to Tax matters relating to a Parent Consolidated
Group, between the date hereof and the Closing Date, Parent agrees to provide
Buyer with written notice describing in reasonable detail the filing of any
material amended Tax Return of an Acquired Entity, the entering into of any
closing agreement with respect to any material Taxes of an Acquired Entity and
the settling of any material Tax claim or assessment relating to an Acquired
Entity or Other Acquired Assets, in each case not later than ten (10) days
prior to taking the action to which such notice relates.

  

  

(iv) To the extent requested by Parent, and at Parent's expense, Buyer shall
reasonably cooperate with Parent in applying for and obtaining any available
Tax refunds with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods.

  

  

(b) Filing of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes.

  

  

(i) Parent Consolidated Tax Returns. Parent shall prepare or cause to be
prepared and file or cause to be filed all Parent Consolidated Tax Returns and
shall pay all Taxes owed with respect to such Tax Returns. If an Acquired
Entity for which a Section 338(h)(10) Election or a Section 338(g) Election is
made engages in a transaction outside the ordinary course of business on the
Closing Date but after the Closing, Buyer and its Affiliates (including the
Acquired Entities after the Closing) shall treat the transaction for all U.S.
federal income Tax purposes as occurring at the beginning of the day following
the Closing Date pursuant to Treasury Regulation section 1.338-1(d).

  

  

(ii) Pre-Closing Tax Returns. Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared all
Separate Company Returns of the Acquired Entities and their Subsidiaries for
Tax periods that end on or before the Closing Date that are required to be
filed after the Closing Date ("Pre-Closing Tax Returns"). Such Pre-Closing Tax
Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with past practice except to
the extent otherwise required by applicable Law. Not later than ten (10) days
prior to the due date for filing any such Pre-Closing Tax Return, Parent shall
deliver a copy of such Tax Return, together with supporting documentation, to
Buyer for Buyer's review and reasonable comment. Buyer will cause such Pre-
Closing Tax Return to be timely filed (as revised by Parent to incorporate
Buyer's reasonable comments), will timely pay all Taxes shown as due and
payable on such Pre-Closing Tax Return and will provide a copy of such Pre-
Closing Tax Return and evidence of filing to Parent. Not later than three (3)
days prior to the due date for the filing of such Pre-Closing Tax Return,
Parent or the applicable Subsidiary Seller, shall pay to Buyer or the
applicable Affiliated Buyer the amount, if any, by which the Taxes shown as
due and payable on such Pre-Closing Tax Return exceed the amount included as a
current liability for such Taxes in Final Closing Working Capital. For the
avoidance of doubt, (A) the amount due and payable with respect to such a Pre-
Closing Tax Return shall take into account any Taxes that have been paid to
the relevant Taxing Authority by Parent or an Affiliate of Parent (including
the Acquired Entities) prior to the Closing, (B) Parent and its Affiliates
shall not be liable for any interest, penalties or additions to Tax resulting
from the failure of Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Acquired Entities)
to timely pay any estimated or other Tax payments due after the Closing with
respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period and (C) any transactions entered into by
an Acquired Entity outside the ordinary course of business on the Closing Date
but after the Closing (other than those actions required or contemplated by
this Agreement) shall be treated as occurring in a Post-Closing Tax Period.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(iii) Straddle Period Tax Returns. Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared
all Separate Company Returns of the Acquired Entities and their Subsidiaries
for all Straddle Tax Periods ("Straddle Tax Returns"). Such Straddle Tax
Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with past practice except to
the extent otherwise required by applicable Law. Not later than ten (10) days
prior to the due date for filing any such Straddle Tax Return, Buyer shall
deliver a copy of such Tax Return, together with supporting documentation, to
Parent for Parent's review and reasonable comment. Buyer will cause such
Straddle Tax Return (as revised to incorporate Parent's reasonable comments)
to be timely filed and will timely pay all Taxes shown as due and payable on
such Straddle Tax Return and will provide a copy of such Straddle Tax Return,
as filed, to Parent. Not later than three (3) days prior to the due date for
the filing of such Straddle Period Tax Return, Parent or the applicable
Subsidiary Seller shall pay to Buyer or the applicable Affiliated Buyer the
amount, if any, by which the Taxes shown as due and payable on such Straddle
Tax Return that are allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period (determined in
accordance with subparagraph (iv), below) exceed the amount included as a
current liability for such Taxes in Final Closing Working Capital. For the
avoidance of doubt, (A) any Taxes that have been paid to the relevant Taxing
Authority by Parent or an Affiliate of Parent (including the Acquired
Entities) prior to the Closing shall be taken into account and credited
against the amount of Taxes that are allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period
with respect to such a Straddle Tax Return, (B) Parent and its Affiliates
shall not be liable for any interest, penalties or additions to Tax resulting
from the failure of Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Acquired Entities)
to timely pay any estimated or other Tax payments due after the Closing with
respect to a Straddle Tax Period and (C) any transactions entered into by an
Acquired Entity outside the ordinary course of business on the Closing Date
but after the Closing (other than those actions required or contemplated by
this Agreement) shall be treated as occurring in the Post-Closing Tax Period.

  

  

(iv) Allocation of Taxes for Straddle Tax Periods. For purposes of this
Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Section 7.3(g)), in the case
of Taxes that are payable with respect to a Straddle Tax Period, the portion
of any such Tax that is allocable to the portion of the Straddle Tax Period
ending on the Closing Date shall be:

  

  

(A) in the case of Taxes that are either (1) based upon or related to income
or receipts, or (2) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), deemed
equal to the amount that would be payable if the taxable year of the Acquired
Entity or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, (and any partnership in
which the Acquired Entity or any of its Subsidiaries is a partner) ended with
(and included) the Closing Date; provided that exemptions, allowances or
deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and
amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending on and
including the Closing Date and the period beginning after the Closing Date in
proportion to the number of days in each period; and

  

  

(B) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (e.g., real property
Taxes), deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Tax
Period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the
amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period), multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the period
ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of calendar days in the entire period.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(v) Tax Refunds. The amount of any refunds or credits of Taxes of any Acquired
Entity or with respect to any Other Acquired Assets for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be for the account of Parent (other than Tax reimbursements or
receivables relating to the service tax in India and Tax refunds or credits
included as a current asset in Final Closing Working Capital, which shall be
for the account of Buyer), and the amount of any refunds or credits of Taxes
of any Acquired Entity for any Post-Closing Tax Period shall be for the
account of Buyer; provided that any refund or credit of Taxes for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period that results from the carry back of a net operating loss,
net capital loss or other Tax attribute from a Post-Closing Tax Period shall
be for the account of Buyer. The amount of any refund or credit of Taxes of
any Acquired Entity for any Straddle Tax Period shall be equitably apportioned
between Buyer and Parent in accordance with the principles set forth in
Section 7.3(b)(iv). Each party shall forward, and shall cause its Affiliates
to forward, to the party entitled to receive a refund or credit of Tax
pursuant to this Section 7.3(b)(v) the amount of such refund or credit and any
interest thereon (or in the case of a Straddle Tax Period, the applicable
portion of any such interest) received from the relevant Taxing Authority
within 30 days after such refund or credit is received, net any costs or
expenses incurred by such party or its Affiliates in procuring such refund or
credit.

  

  

(vi) Amended Tax Returns. Unless required by applicable Law, no amended Tax
Return with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Tax Period shall
be filed by or on behalf of any Acquired Entity or any of its Subsidiaries
without the prior written consent of Parent.

  

  

(vii) Carrybacks. Neither Buyer, nor any Acquired Entity nor any of their
respective Affiliates will carry back any net operating losses, net capital
losses or other Tax attributes arising in a Post-Closing Tax Period to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates,
including the Acquired Entities; provided that if applicable Law requires that
any such loss or Tax attribute be carried back to a Pre-Closing Tax Period,
Buyer, the Acquired Entity or the Affiliate, as applicable, shall be entitled
to carry back the loss or Tax attribute to such period. For the avoidance of
doubt, if applicable Law permits, but does not require, any such loss or Tax
attribute to be carried back to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, nothing in this
Section 7.3(b)(vii) shall be interpreted to permit Buyer, any Acquired Entity
or any of their respective Affiliates to be able to carry back such loss or
Tax attribute to a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

  

  

(c) Section 338 Elections.

  

  

(i) Parent and Buyer will join in making a timely, irrevocable and effective
election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and any similar provision of
state or local law (each, a "Section 338(h)(10) Election") with respect to
Buyer's (or an Affiliated Buyer's) purchase of the shares of each Consolidated
Domestic Subsidiary (and any Subsidiaries of such a Consolidated Domestic
Subsidiary for which a Section 338(h)(10) Election can be made). To facilitate
such elections, at the Closing, Parent shall deliver to Buyer IRS Forms 8023
and any similar forms under state or local law (each a "Form 8023") with
respect to Buyer's (or an Affiliated Buyer's) purchase of the shares of each
Consolidated Domestic Subsidiary, which Forms 8023 shall have been duly
executed by authorized persons on behalf of Parent, and Buyer shall cause the
Forms 8023 to be duly executed by an authorized person for Buyer or an
Affiliated Buyer, as applicable. Parent shall cause such Forms 8023 to be
filed with the appropriate Taxing Authority as prescribed by Treasury
Regulation 1.338(h)(10)-1 or applicable provision under state or local law and
shall provide a copy of such Forms 8023, as filed, to Buyer.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) If requested by Parent with respect to the Acquired Foreign Corporation,
Buyer (or an Affiliated Buyer) shall make a timely and effective election
under Section 338(g) of the Code (a "Section 338(g) Election") with respect to
Buyer's (or such Affiliated Buyer's) purchase of the shares of such Acquired
Foreign Corporation. To facilitate such election, at the Closing, Parent shall
deliver to Buyer an IRS Form 8023 and a notice which meets the requirements of
Treasury Regulation 1.338-2(e)(4). Buyer shall cause such Form 8023 and such
notice to be duly executed by an authorized person for Buyer (or for an
Affiliated Buyer, if applicable). Parent shall cause such Form 8023 to be sent
for filing with the appropriate Taxing Authority. Unless so requested by
Parent, no Section 338(g) Election shall be made with respect to the Acquired
Foreign Corporation.

  

  

(iii) Parent and Buyer agree (A) to timely file (or cause to be timely filed)
all Tax Returns required to be filed with respect to the Section 338(h)(10)
Elections and the Section 338(g) Election (if applicable), including IRS Form
8883, (B) to file and to cause their respective Affiliates to file all other
Tax Returns consistent with such Section 338(h)(10) Elections and Section
338(g) Election, and (C) not to assert, or cause or permit their Affiliates to
assert, in connection with any audit or other proceeding with respect to
Taxes, any characterization inconsistent with the Section 338(h)(10) Elections
or Section 338(g) Election, as applicable, or any asset values or other items
inconsistent with the Final Allocations as determined pursuant to Section
2.9(c) in the case of the Section 338(h)(10) Elections, or Section 2.9(d) in
the case of the Section 338(g) Election, unless otherwise required by
applicable Laws.

  

  

(d) Asset Allocation Statements. Parent and Buyer agree (i) to timely file (or
cause to be timely filed) such Tax Returns (including IRS Form 8594) as are
required to be filed to report the allocation of the Purchase Price to the
Other Acquired Assets and the assets of the Pass-through Entities in
accordance with the Final Allocations determined pursuant to Section 2.9(b) in
the case of the Other Acquired Assets and Section 2.9(e) in the case of the
assets of the Pass-through Entities, and (ii) not to assert, or cause or
permit their Affiliates to assert, in connection with any audit or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes, any asset values or other items inconsistent
with the Final Allocations as determined pursuant to Section 2.9(b) with
respect to the Other Acquired Assets or Section 2.9(e) with respect to the
Pass-through Entities, unless otherwise required by applicable Laws.

  

  

(e) Property Taxes. All ad valorem taxes, real property taxes, personal
property taxes and similar obligations ("Property Taxes") attributable to the
Other Acquired Assets applicable to a Straddle Tax Period shall be prorated
based on the number of days in such period prior to and including the Closing
Date, on the one hand, and the number of days in such period after the Closing
Date, on the other hand, the amount of such Property Taxes allocable to the
portion of the period ending on the Closing Date being the responsibility of
Parent and the remainder being the responsibility of Buyer. Buyer shall pay
(or cause to be paid) prior to delinquency, all Property Taxes that become due
after the Closing Date. Buyer shall send to Parent a statement that apportions
each Property Tax pursuant to this Section 7.3(e) based upon the amount of
Property Taxes actually invoiced and paid to the applicable Taxing Authority
by Buyer or an Affiliated Buyer, as applicable. Such statement shall be
accompanied by proof of the actual payment of such Property Taxes by Buyer or
an Affiliated Buyer. Within ten (10) business days of receipt of each such
statement and proof of payment, Parent shall, or shall cause the applicable
Subsidiary Seller to, reimburse Buyer or the applicable Affiliated Buyer for
Parent's or the applicable Subsidiary Seller's allocated portion of such
Property Taxes to the extent such amount of Parent's (or the applicable
Subsidiary Seller's) portion of such Property Taxes is greater than the amount
accrued as a current liability for such Property Taxes in Final Closing
Working Capital.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(f) Transfer Taxes. Except for sales and use Taxes imposed by the United
States of America (or any political subdivision thereof), which shall be borne
and paid by Parent, all recoverable and non-recoverable transfer, documentary,
sales, use, stamp, registration, goods and services, VAT, real and personal
property transfer, and other similar Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording
charges and other fees and charges (such Taxes, fees and charges, including
any penalties or interest, "Transfer Taxes") incurred in connection with the
consummation of this Agreement, the Contemplated Transactions, the
Implementing Agreements and the Transition Agreements, as well as the cost of
the filing of all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect
to all such Transfer Taxes shall be borne and paid by Buyer when due. Parent
and Buyer shall file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation
required to be filed by it with respect to all such Transfer Taxes and, if
required by applicable Law, the parties will, and will cause their Affiliates
to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

  

  

(g) Tax Indemnity.

  

  

(i) From and after the Closing, Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer
Indemnitees from and against (A) any Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax Period
(determined under the principles set forth in Section 7.3(b)(iv), above) that
are (i) imposed on an Acquired Entity or for which an Acquired Entity is
otherwise liable, (ii) imposed on or with respect to the Other Acquired
Assets, or (iii) attributable to the Pre-Closing Reorganization (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, any U.K. degrouping charges associated with the
Acquired Entities), (B) any Taxes imposed on any Acquired Entity for a Pre-
Closing Tax Period pursuant to Treasury Regulation § 1.1502-6 or any analogous
state, local or foreign law or regulation as a result of such Acquired Entity
being a member of a Parent Consolidated Group for such Pre-Closing Tax Period,
(C) any Taxes attributable to the making of the Section 338(h)(10) Elections,
(D) any Taxes allocated to Parent pursuant to Section 7.3(f), (E) any U.S.
withholding Taxes for which the Buyer Indemnitees are liable as a result of
the inaccuracy of the documentation or certifications provided by Parent or
the Subsidiary Sellers pursuant to Section 8.2(i) or Section 8.2(j), and (F)
subject to Section 7.3(i) (and without duplication) reasonable out-of-pocket
legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with the contest of any amounts
described in (A) through (E) above; provided that, in each case (1) Parent
shall not be required to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees to the extent that
(I) the Taxes for which indemnity is sought are taken into account as a
liability in the determination of Final Closing Working Capital or Final
Closing Debt or (II) such Taxes result from actions taken after the Closing by
Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Acquired Entities) (other than actions
in the ordinary course of business or those actions required or contemplated
by this Agreement) and (2) any indemnification obligation of Parent shall be
reduced to the extent of any Tax benefit actually realized (including as a
result of any deduction or credit) by Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including the Acquired Entities) as a result of the payment of Taxes giving
rise to such indemnity.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Parent Indemnitees from and against (1) all Assumed Tax Liabilities, and (2)
subject to Section 7.3(i) (and without duplication) reasonable out-of-pocket
legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with the contest of any Assumed
Tax Liabilities.

  

  

(iii) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 7.3(g)(i) and Section
7.3(g)(ii), above, (1) Parent shall not be liable for, and shall not indemnify
the Buyer Indemnitees for, any claim for Taxes unless such claim has been
asserted by written notice to Parent prior to the date that is thirty (30)
days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with
respect to the Taxes which are the subject of such claim and (2) Buyer shall
not be liable for, and shall not indemnify the Parent Indemnitees for, any
claim for Assumed Tax Liabilities unless such claim has been asserted by
written notice to Buyer prior to the date that is thirty (30) days after the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to the Taxes
which are the subject of such claim.

  

  

(h) VAT. The consideration specified for all supplies of goods and services
contemplated by this Agreement shall be exclusive of any applicable VAT,
payable upon receipt of a valid VAT invoice.

  

  

(i) Tax Indemnification Procedures. If a claim is made by a Taxing Authority
that, if successful, would result in the indemnification of a party by the
other party pursuant to Section 7.3, the party receiving notice of such claim
shall promptly, but in no event later than 30 days after receipt of notice
from the Taxing Authority of such claim, notify the other party in writing of
such claim. If the Tax claim relates entirely to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (a
"Pre-Closing Tax Claim"), Buyer shall take or shall cause to be taken such
action in connection with a Proceeding involving such Pre-Closing Tax Claim as
Parent shall reasonably request in writing from time to time, including the
selection of counsel and experts and the execution of powers of attorney;
provided that within 30 days after the notice of such Pre-Closing Tax Claim
has been received (or such earlier date that any payment of Taxes with respect
to such claim is due but in no event earlier than 5 days after receipt of such
notice), Parent requests that such claim be contested. Parent shall control
the contest of such Pre-Closing Tax Claim and shall pay all reasonable out-of-
pocket costs and expenses that Buyer or its Affiliates incur at Parent's
request in connection with contesting such claim, including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys' and accountants' fees and disbursements.
Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Acquired Entities) shall enter into a
settlement with respect to such Pre-Closing Tax Claim or prosecute such Pre-
Closing Tax Claim to a determination in a court or other tribunal of initial
or appellate jurisdiction, as Parent may reasonably request; provided that if
the settlement is reasonably expected to adversely affect Buyer or its
Affiliates (including the Acquired Entities) after the Closing, Parent cannot
settle such Pre-Closing Tax Claim without Buyer's consent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Subject to the
penultimate sentence in this Section 7.3(i), in the case of a claim for Taxes
with respect to a Straddle Tax Period for which both Parent and Buyer
potentially have liability under Section 7.3(g) (a "Straddle Tax Claim"), (i)
Parent and Buyer shall jointly control the conduct of any Proceeding relating
to such Straddle Tax Claim, (ii) each party shall bear its own costs and
expenses incurred in connection with such Proceeding and (iii) neither party
shall, or shall cause its Affiliates (including the Acquired Entities) to,
enter into a settlement with respect to such Proceeding or prosecute such
Proceeding to a determination in a court or other tribunal of initial or
appellate jurisdiction, without the consent of the other party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that if the parties are
unable to mutually agree on whether to settle such a Straddle Tax Claim after
working in good faith to reach agreement, then the party that objects to such
settlement may assume the prosecution or defense of the Straddle Tax Claim at
its own expense, and the party advocating settlement shall not be liable for
any amount in excess of the amount that would have been paid by such party had
the Straddle Tax Claim been settled on the available settlement terms.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.3(i) to the contrary, Parent shall
retain sole control of any claims by a Taxing Authority that relate to a
Parent Consolidated Tax Return. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of
this Section 7.3(i), and not those of Section 10.4, shall govern any claim,
action or suit for which indemnity may be sought under Section 7.3(g).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(j) Section 754 Election. Parent and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the consent of ExxonMobil to the making by Badger of an
election pursuant to Section 754 of the Code for the taxable year that
includes the Closing Date.

  

  

(k) Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. The amount of any indemnification
payment made by a party under this Section 7.3 or Article 10 shall be treated
for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price unless otherwise
required under applicable Tax Law.

  

  

(l) Tax Treatment of Payments Made to Transferred Employees by Parent and
Parent Equity Awards Held by Transferred Employees. For the avoidance of
doubt, the parties intend that all U.S. federal income Tax deductions arising
out of payments made by Parent or a Consolidated Domestic Subsidiary to a
Transferred Employee pursuant to Section 7.4(o) shall be treated as arising in
the Pre-Closing Tax Period. In addition, Parent shall be entitled to take all
U.S. federal income tax deductions incurred in connection with the exercise by
a Transferred Employee of a stock option or stock appreciation right in
respect of Parent common stock, including such exercises occurring on or after
the Closing Date. Parent and Buyer shall (and shall cause their respective
Affiliates, including the Acquired Entities, to) take commercially reasonable
efforts to cause any payments made to a Transferred Employee in connection
with such person's employment with Shaw Energy and Chemicals Limited or Shaw EandC
International Services Ltd., as applicable, pursuant to Section 7.4(o), to be
treated as deductible by such Acquired Entity in a Pre-Closing Tax Period for
U.K. tax purposes.

  

  

(m) Conflict. To the extent the provisions of this Section 7.3 conflict with
any other provisions of this Agreement with respect to Taxes, the provisions
of this Section 7.3 shall control.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 7.4. Certain Employee Matters.

  

  

(a) Employees. Schedule 7.4 lists, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
each Employee, as of the date hereof, including the name, title, work
location, employer, whether full- or part-time, whether active or on leave
(and, if on leave, the nature of the leave and the expected return date),
annual salary or wage rate, most recent annual bonus received, current annual
bonus opportunity and vacation and paid time off accrual. If the name of any
Employee has been replaced with an identification number on Schedule 7.4 in
order to comply with applicable Law, Parent shall deliver an update of such
Schedule with the names of such individuals at the Closing. Periodically prior
to the Closing Date, including five (5) days prior to the Closing Date, Parent
shall reflect any additional employees, new hires, retirements, resignations,
dismissals and other employment terminations which may have occurred at any
time on or prior to the Closing Date by updating (i) Schedule 7.4(a) with
respect to the Business, (ii) the headings "Retained Baton Rouge Employees"
and "Retained Canada Employees" of Schedule 1.1(m) with respect to the
Retained Baton Rouge Business and the Retained Canadian Business,
respectively, and (iii) the headings "Retained Consulting Employees",
"Retained Other Business Employees" and "Retained Singapore Employees" of
Schedule 1.1(m) with respect to the Retained Consulting Employees, the
Retained Other Business Employees and the Retained Singapore Employees,
respectively.

  

  

(b) Continuation of Employment.

  

  

(i) Where applicable Law provides for the automatic transfer of employment of
any Employee upon the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, the
parties shall take or cause to be taken such actions as are required under
applicable Law to accomplish such transfer of employment of such Employee to
Buyer or an Affiliated Buyer as a matter of Law as of the Closing.

  

  

(ii) The parties acknowledge that the transfer of the portions of the Business
conducted by Parent and the Subsidiary Sellers in the European Union ("EU")
and certain other countries listed in Schedule 7.4(b) constitutes a transfer
of business within the meaning of EU Council Directive 2001/23/EC, the
national Laws implementing the same or any similar Laws applicable in non-EU
jurisdictions, and each Employee belonging to said portions of the Business
shall be referred to herein as a "Non-U.S. Employee" and shall be designated
as such on Schedule 7.4(b). The parties further acknowledge that, as a result,
the employment of the Non-U.S. Employees, including all related rights and
obligations, will transfer by operation of Law to Buyer or an Affiliated Buyer
(as the case may be) as of the Closing Date, except with respect to any
Non-U.S. Employee who timely exercises his or her rights, if any, under any
applicable Law to prevent such transfer from occurring, subject to Section
7.4(b)(iii) below (the Non-U.S. Employees who do not exercise their rights to
prevent such transfer, the "Non-U.S. Transferred Employees"). As a result,
Buyer or the Affiliated Buyers will assume by operation of Law, as of the
Closing Date, all Liabilities towards the Non-U.S. Transferred Employees
except to the extent otherwise provided in this Section 7.4.

  

  

(iii) The parties will use their reasonable efforts to obtain the approval of
the applicable Governmental Authority or any labor authority as may be
required for the transfer of any Non-U.S. Employees who, if any, are
"protected employees" under applicable Law.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Offers of Employment.

  

  

(i) Buyer shall, or shall cause an Affiliated Buyer to, make offers of
employment to the Employees in accordance with the provisions of this Section
7.4, at least thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date (or such longer
period required by applicable Law), with such employment to be effective as of
the Closing (or such later date as provided in Section 7.4(f)). Such offer of
employment shall be for a position that is comparable to the type of position
held by such Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date and shall be made
on terms and conditions sufficient to avoid statutory, contractual, common law
or other severance obligations, other than where such severance is automatic
pursuant to applicable Law (a "Qualified Offer"). Each Employee (other than a
Non-U.S. Employee) who accepts the offer of employment and commences active
employment with Buyer or an Affiliated Buyer on or after the Closing Date,
including offers described in Section 7.4(f), from Buyer or an Affiliated
Buyer, is referred to herein as a "U.S. Transferred Employee". U.S.
Transferred Employees and Non-U.S. Transferred Employees are referred to
collectively herein as "Transferred Employees". Except as otherwise
specifically provided in this Agreement or to the extent required by
applicable Law, effective as of 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date (or such later
date on which a Transferred Employee commences employment with Buyer or an
Affiliated Buyer), the Transferred Employees shall cease all active
participation in and accrual of benefits under the Seller Benefit Plans, other
than the Assumed Employee Benefit Plans.

  

  

(ii) Following receipt by the Canada Business Employees of Qualified Offers,
Buyer shall consult with each Canada Business Employee regarding his/her
transfer of employment to Buyer at Closing. If after consultation a Canada
Business Employee rejects Buyer's Qualified Offer, such Canada Business
Employee shall remain employed by Parent and its Subsidiaries; provided that,
if requested by Buyer, the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to agree upon terms pursuant to which the services performed by each such
Canada Business Employee will be provided to Buyer pursuant to the terms of
the Transition Services Agreement. Each Canada Business Employee who accepts
Buyer's Qualified Offer shall become a "Transferred Employee" upon his or her
transfer of employment to Buyer.

  

  

(d) Independent Contractors. Schedule 7.4(d) sets forth, for each individual
independent contractor engaged by the Business whose annual compensation
exceeds $100,000, such contractor's name, duties and rate of compensation.
Parent shall update Schedule 7.4(d) periodically prior to the Closing Date,
including five (5) days prior to the Closing Date.

  

  

(e) Continuation of Compensation and Benefits. For a period of six (6) months
immediately after the Closing Date (or for such longer period as required by
applicable Law), Buyer shall (or shall cause the Affiliated Buyers to) provide
to each Transferred Employee compensation and benefits that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to those provided by Parent or the applicable
Subsidiary Seller as in effect on the day prior to Closing (excluding equity
incentive compensation and defined benefit pension arrangements).

  

  

(f) Inactive Employees. With respect to Employees who are not actively at work
on the Closing Date due to short-term illness, short-term disability
(including maternity leave), worker's compensation or other approved leave of
absence (other than any such Employee whose employment is required to be
transferred to Buyer under applicable Law), Buyer or an Affiliated Buyer shall
be required to offer employment to such Employee, in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 7.4, as of the date such Employee returns to active
work at the conclusion of such leave, provided that the Employee returns to
active employment within six months following the Closing Date. On the date an
Employee returns to active employment, such Employee will become a Transferred
Employee. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall have the sole obligation to
provide compensation and benefits to each such Employee after, but not before,
the date an Employee becomes a Transferred Employee.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

60  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(g) Severance Obligations. Parent and Buyer intend that the Contemplated
Transactions shall not result in a severance of employment of any Employee
prior to or upon the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions and that
the Employees will have continuous and uninterrupted employment immediately
before and immediately after the Closing Date, and Buyer shall comply with any
requirements under applicable Law to ensure the same. Buyer shall bear any
costs related to, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Parent and the
Subsidiary Sellers from and against, any claims made by any Employee for any
statutory, contractual or common law severance or separation benefits and
other legally mandated payment obligations (including the employer portion of
any employment taxes, together with any compensation payable during any
mandatory termination notice period related thereto), in each case, arising
out of or in connection with the failure of Buyer or the Affiliated Buyers to
make offers of employment or continue the employment of any Employee in
accordance with this Agreement and as required by applicable Law. Parent and
the Subsidiary Sellers shall bear any costs related to, and shall indemnify
and hold harmless Buyer and Affiliated Buyers from and against, any claims
made by any Employee for any statutory, contractual or common law severance or
separation benefits and other legally mandated payment obligations (including
the employer portion of any employment taxes, together with any compensation
payable during any mandatory termination notice period related thereto), in
each case, arising out of or in connection with the refusal of an Employee to
accept a Qualified Offer.

  

  

(h) Allocation of Employment Liabilities. (i) Except with respect to any
Liabilities that transfer to Buyer or an Affiliated Buyer pursuant to
applicable Law or as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, Parent
and the Subsidiary Sellers shall retain liability and responsibility for all
employment and employee-benefit related Liabilities, obligations, claims or
losses that arise as a result of an event or events that occurred prior to
12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date, that relate to the Employees (or any dependent
or beneficiary of any Employee). Except as otherwise specifically provided in
this Agreement, effective as of 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date, Buyer or its
Affiliates shall assume and be solely responsible for all employment and
employee-benefits related Liabilities, obligations, claims or losses that
relate to the Transferred Employees (or any dependent or beneficiary of any
Transferred Employee) that arise as a result of an event or events that
occurred on or after 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date or are otherwise expressly
assumed by Buyer or its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

(i) Parent and the Subsidiary Sellers shall retain all Liabilities for all
workers' compensation, short- and long-term disability, medical, prescription
drug, dental, vision, life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment and
other welfare benefit claims incurred by Employees prior to 12:01 a.m. on the
Closing Date that are covered under the terms of the applicable plans of
Parent and the Subsidiary Sellers or their respective Affiliates. With respect
to claims incurred on or after 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date by the
Transferred Employees and their eligible dependents for workers' compensation,
short- and long-term disability, medical, prescription drug, dental, vision,
life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment and other welfare benefit
claims, Buyer or its Affiliates shall be responsible. For these purposes, a
claim shall be deemed to be incurred: (A) in the case of workers' compensation
and short- or long-term disability benefits (including related health
benefits), at the time of the injury, sickness or other event giving rise to
the claim for such benefits; (B) in the case of medical, prescription drug,
dental or vision benefits, at the time professional services, equipment or
prescription drugs covered by the applicable plan are obtained; (C) in the
case of life insurance benefits, upon death; and (D) in the case of accidental
death and dismemberment benefits, at the time of the accident.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

61  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(i) Service Credit. Effective from and after 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date,
Buyer or an Affiliated Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
recognize, for all purposes (including eligibility, vesting and benefit levels
and accruals, but other than benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension
plan) under all plans, programs and arrangements established or maintained by
Buyer or an Affiliated Buyer for the benefit of the Transferred Employees,
service with Parent or the Subsidiary Sellers and their respective Affiliates
prior to the Closing Date to the extent such service was recognized under the
corresponding Seller Benefit Plan covering such Transferred Employees and (ii)
waive any pre-existing condition exclusion, actively-at-work requirement or
waiting period under all employee health and other welfare benefit plans
established or maintained by Buyer or an Affiliated Buyer for the benefit of
the Transferred Employees, except to the extent such pre-existing condition
exclusion, requirement or waiting period would have applied to such individual
under the corresponding Seller Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Closing,
and (iii) provide full credit for any co-payments, deductibles or similar
payments made or incurred prior to the Closing Date for the plan year in which
the Closing occurs.

  

  

(j) Accrued Vacation. Except as otherwise required under applicable Law, as of
12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date, Buyer or an Affiliated Buyer shall assume and
honor all vacation days and paid time off days accrued but not yet taken by
the Transferred Employees as of the Closing Date (it being understood that
Buyer or an Affiliated Buyer may deduct from the number of vacation days and
paid time off days made available to any such Employee the number of days of
vacation or paid time off previously taken by such Employee in the applicable
year).

  

  

(k) In the case of any Employee referred to in Section 7.4(f), except as
otherwise required by applicable Law or otherwise specifically provided in
this Agreement, references to Closing Date in Sections 7.4(h) through (j)
shall instead be deemed to refer to the date such Employee became a
Transferred Employee.

  

  

(l) 401(k) Plan. Each Transferred Employee shall become fully vested in any
defined contribution plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
in which such Transferred Employee participates, including the Shaw Group,
Inc. 401(k) Plan. If Buyer or an Affiliated Buyer maintains or establishes a
defined contribution plan that includes a qualified cash or deferred
arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code ("Buyer's 401(k)
Plan"), Buyer or an Affiliated Buyer shall permit each Transferred Employee
participating in a Seller Benefit Plan that is a defined contribution plan
with a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section
401(k) of the Code ("Seller's 401(k) Plan") to effect, and Buyer or an
Affiliated Buyer agrees to cause Buyer's 401(k) Plan to accept, in accordance
with applicable Law, a "direct rollover" (within the meaning of Section
401(a)(31) of the Code) of his or her account balances (including earnings
thereon through the date of transfer and promissory notes evidencing all
outstanding loans) under Seller's 401(k) Plan if such rollover to Buyer's
401(k) Plan is elected in accordance with applicable Law by such Transferred
Employee, subject to each of Parent's or the Subsidiary Seller's and Buyer's
reasonable satisfaction that Seller's 401(k) Plan or Buyer's 401(k) Plan, as
applicable, is in compliance with all applicable Laws and that such plan
continues to satisfy the requirements for a qualified plan under Section
401(a) of the Code and that the trust that forms a part of such plan is exempt
from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code. Upon completion of a direct
rollover of a Transferred Employee's account balances, as described in this
Section 7.4(l), Buyer or an Affiliated Buyer and Buyer's 401(k) Plan shall be
fully responsible for all benefits relating to past service of such
Transferred Employee and none of Parent, the Subsidiary Sellers and Seller's
401(k) Plan shall have any liability whatsoever with respect to such benefits.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

62  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(m) WARN Act. Buyer agrees to provide, or cause its Affiliates to provide, any
required notice under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act
("WARN") and any similar federal, state or local Law or regulation, and to
otherwise comply with WARN and any other similar Law or regulation, in each
case with respect to any "plant closing" or "mass layoff" (as defined in WARN)
or group termination or similar event affecting Employees (including as a
result of the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions) and occurring on
and after 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date. None of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates shall take any action after the Closing that would cause any
termination of employment of any Employees that occurs before 12:01 a.m. on
the Closing Date to constitute a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" or group
termination under WARN or any similar federal, state or local Law or
regulation, or to create any liability or penalty to Parent or any Subsidiary
Seller for any employment terminations under applicable Law. On the Closing
Date, Parent shall notify Buyer of any layoffs of any U.S. Employees in the
90-day period prior to the Closing.

  

  

(n) Benefit Plans.

  

  

(i) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall take all actions necessary (including,
without limitation, complying with any consultation obligations and obtaining
any required regulatory or trustee consents) to effectuate the following,
effective as of the Closing:

  

  

(A) change the sponsoring entity of the UK Pension Plan so that the sponsoring
entity is not an Acquired Entity, including providing notification of such
change to the applicable Governmental Authority; and

  

  

(B) Parent and the Subsidiary Sellers shall retain all Liabilities relating to
the UK Pension Plan or the Canadian DB Plan.

  

  

(ii) From and after the Closing, Buyer and its Affiliates shall have no
Liabilities or obligations relating to the UK Pension Plan and the Canadian DB
Plan, except with respect to any and all direct rollovers by a Transferred
Employee of his/her defined contribution account in the UK Pension Plan to the
New UK DC Plan (as defined below).

  

  

(iii) Prior to the Closing, Buyer or an Affiliated Buyer shall complete all
actions necessary to establish a defined contribution plan in the United
Kingdom (the "New UK DC Plan"). Buyer or an Affiliated Buyer shall permit each
Transferred Employee participating in the UK Pension Plan to elect to
participate in the New UK DC Plan from and after the Closing.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

63  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(o) Retention Plan.

  

  

(i) Parent will promptly after the date hereof put in place a retention
program on the terms and conditions set forth on Schedule 7.4(o)(i) (the
"Retention Program").

  

  

(ii) At the applicable Transfer Date, each unvested stock option, stock
appreciation right and restricted stock unit held by a Transferred Employee
shall terminate and each Transferred Employee shall be entitled to receive
from Parent, subject to such Transferred Employee's execution of an unvested
equity payment memorandum in the form set forth in Schedule 7.4(o)(ii), an
amount in cash, less applicable Tax withholding, payable at or promptly after,
but in no event later than thirty (30) days following the applicable Transfer
Date, equal to the sum of (A)(i) the number of unvested restricted stock units
held by such Transferred Employee that would have vested if such Transferred
Employee's employment had terminated after continuous employment through
February 1, 2013, multiplied by (ii) the closing price of a share of common
stock of Parent as reported on the New York Stock Exchange on the applicable
Transfer Date and (B) with respect to each unvested stock option and stock
appreciation right that would have vested if such Transferred Employee's
employment had terminated after continuous employment through February 1,
2013, (i) the excess, if any, of the closing price of a share of common stock
of Parent as reported on the New York Stock Exchange on the Transfer Date over
the applicable per share exercise price of such stock option or stock
appreciation right multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of common stock of
Parent subject to such stock option or stock appreciation right (the "Vesting
Program").

  

  

(p) Transferred Employee Stock Options. For so long as any Transferred
Employee holds outstanding stock options or stock appreciation rights, upon
Parent's request, Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
notify Parent of any changes to such Transferred Employee's name, address or
payroll profile (e.g. changes to the employee's form W-4 or equivalent
non-U.S. form) as permitted under Applicable Law.

  

  

(q) No Third Party Beneficiaries. The provisions of this Section 7.4 are
solely for the benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement and nothing
in this Section 7.4, express or implied, shall confer upon any Employee, or
legal representative or beneficiary thereof, any rights or remedies, including
any right to employment or continued employment for any specified period, or
compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever under this
Agreement. Nothing in this Section 7.4, express or implied, shall be (i)deemed
an amendment of any plan providing benefits to any Employee, or (ii)construed
to prevent Buyer from terminating or modifying to any extent or in any respect
any benefit plan that Buyer may establish or maintain.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(r) Retained Overhead Employees. Not later than thirty (30) days following the
date hereof, Buyer may submit to Parent and its Subsidiaries a list of not
more than fifty (50) Employees charged primarily to the overhead of the
Business who but for the provisions of this Section 7.4(r) would receive a
Qualified Offer from Buyer. Buyer shall select such Employees in accordance
with (i) Buyer's legitimate anticipated business requirements for the services
of such Employees after the Closing Date and (ii) applicable Law. Parent shall
have the right to object to the selection of any such Employees on the basis
that their selection by Buyer is not in accordance with the criteria set forth
above; provided, however, that Parent shall have no right to object to the
selection by Buyer of an Employee based on the potential costs associated with
the severance of such Employee should Parent terminate the Employee following
any required consultations. If Parent objects to the selection of any such
Employee in accordance with the criteria above, Parent and Buyer shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve the dispute; provided that Buyer shall at
all times remain entitled to select up to fifty (50) Employees to be retained
by Parent pursuant to this Section 7.4(r). The Employees selected in
accordance with this Section 7.4(r) shall be the "Retained Overhead
Employees."

Buyer and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent, the Subsidiary Sellers
and each of their Affiliates, on the other hand, will cooperate with each
other in the defense or settlement of any Liabilities or Proceedings involving
the Business for which they have responsibility under this Agreement by
providing the other party and such other party's legal counsel and other
Persons reasonable access to Employees, Retained Business Employees, records,
documents, data, equipment, facilities, products, parts, prototypes and other
information regarding the Business and its products as such other party may
reasonably request, to the extent maintained or under the possession or

in addition to the Implementing Agreements, and take such other action as may
reasonably be necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions or to give effect to the transactions contemplated by the
Ancillary Agreements.

  

  

Section 7.7. Refunds and Remittances; Cash.

  

  

(a) Parent and Buyer will work together to reconcile the settlement of Assumed
Liabilities and Retained Liabilities which relate to periods both before and
after the Closing Date. Such expenses shall be allocated between Parent and
Buyer based on the number of days such party owned the Conveyed Assets during
the period in question. Parent will promptly reimburse Buyer for expenses paid
by Buyer that relate to the period prior to the Effective Time and Buyer will
promptly reimburse Parent for expenses paid by Parent that relate to the
period after the Effective Time.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

65  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) To the extent that Parent, any Subsidiary Seller or any of their
Affiliates on the one hand, or Buyer, any Affiliated Buyer or any of their
Affiliates, on the other, (i) receives any payment to which the other party is
entitled, each of Buyer and Parent agrees to promptly remit the proceeds to
the designated bank account of Parent or Buyer, as appropriate, and (ii) makes
a payment to a third party on behalf of the other party, each of Buyer and
Parent agrees to promptly reimburse Parent or Buyer, as applicable, by
depositing an equal amount in the bank account designated by such reimbursed
party.

7.8(a) from time to time prior to Closing to include additional Credit Support
Obligations entered into in the ordinary course of the Business and consistent
with past practice.

  

  

(b) With respect to the Credit Support Obligations set forth on Schedule

or other counterparties, and Buyer and Parent shall cooperate to obtain any
necessary release in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and
Parent with respect to all such Credit Support Obligations.

  

  

(c) If Buyer is not successful, for any reason, in obtaining the complete and
unconditional release of Parent and its Affiliates from any Credit Support
Obligation set forth on Schedule 7.8(a) by the Closing Date (each such Credit
Support Obligation, until such time as such Credit Support Obligation is
released in accordance with Section 7.8(b) (a "Continuing Credit Support
Obligation"), then:

  

  

(i) Buyer shall continue to use its reasonable best efforts, and Parent shall
continue to cooperate with Buyer in such efforts, to obtain promptly the
complete and unconditional release of Parent and its Affiliates from each
Continuing Credit Support Obligation until such release is obtained; and

  

  

(ii) Buyer shall indemnify Parent and its Affiliates for any demand or draw
upon, or withdrawal from, any Continuing Credit Support Obligation or any cash
or other collateral posted by Parent or its Affiliates under the terms of the
Credit Support Obligation and for the carrying costs of any cash collateral
not replaced by Buyer, the fronting fee costs, and any other reasonable out-
of-pocket third party costs and expenses resulting from each such Continuing
Credit Support Obligation, as evidenced by Parent to Buyer.

(a) From and after the date hereof and to the Closing, upon reasonable advance
notice from Buyer, Parent shall, and shall cause the Subsidiary Sellers to, to
the extent permitted by Law, permit Buyer and its authorized representatives
to have reasonable access, during regular business hours, to the assets,
Employees, facilities, Contracts, books and records and other documents and
data relating to the Business (other than the Excluded Assets); provided,
however, that no such access (or related activities or investigations) shall
unreasonably interfere with any EandC Group Member's normal operation of their
respective businesses, including the Business; provided, further, that all
information received by Buyer or its representatives and given by or on behalf
of any EandC Group Member in connection with this Agreement and the Contemplated

injury to any of its representatives conducting any investigation or

other communication that Parent believes in good faith is subject to any
contractual confidentiality obligation or covered by any attorney-client work
product or similar privilege, or to permit Buyer or its representatives to
conduct any environmental tests, including soil, water, air or other sampling
or testing, at or relating to the Leased Real Property.

Reorganization prior to the Closing in all respects in accordance with the

or shall cause its applicable Affiliates to, provide Buyer with copies of all
agreements to be executed and delivered by and among Parent and its Affiliates
in connection with the Pre-Closing Reorganization.

Agreement, take all actions reasonably necessary for the benefit of Shaw
Energy and Chemicals Limited, to reduce its share capital in accordance with

for the purpose of such reduction of share capital.

fault of any EandC Group Member, (ii) reasonably requested by and disclosed to a
Governmental Authority or (iii) later lawfully acquired by the EandC Group
Members from sources other than those related to its prior operating of the
Business. The obligation of Parent to hold, and to cause the EandC Group Members
to hold, any such information in confidence shall be satisfied if Parent
exercises the same care with respect to such information as it would take to
preserve the confidentiality of its own similar information.

  

  

Section 7.14. Waiver of Claims.

  

  

As of the Closing, Parent and its Affiliates shall waive all claims, rights

period prior to the Closing, in either case for the purpose of soliciting,
purchasing, procuring or sourcing from, or offering, selling, providing or
supplying to, such customer, vendor or supplier any goods or services similar
to those provided by the Business prior to Closing, or (B) attempt in any
manner to persuade any such customer, vendor or supplier of the Business to

Person, to the Knowledge of Parent, intends to (A) continue to operate the

Person's acquisition of the Retained Canadian Business and (B) compete
directly or indirectly with the Business through or by means of the Retained

part time basis, or in a consultancy or other non-employee role) any Employee
who is a member of the senior management of the Business as of the Closing
Date, or encourage or induce any such Employee to leave his or her employment
relationship with Buyer or any of its Affiliates; or

  

  

(vi) solicit for employment (either on a full-time or part-time basis, or in a

the fulfillment by Parent or any of its Affiliates of its obligations under
the Transition Services Agreement, whether relating to the Excluded Assets or
otherwise.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

71  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7.15, it shall
not be deemed to be a violation of Sections 7.15(b)(i), 7.15(b)(ii) and
7.15(b)(iii) for Parent or any of its affiliates:

that is competitive with the Business.

  

  

(f) Parent (on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates) acknowledges
that the restrictions contained in this Section 7.15 are reasonable and
necessary to protect the legitimate interests of Buyer and constitute a
material inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.
Parent (on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates) acknowledges that
any violation of this Section 7.15 will result in irreparable injury to Buyer
and agrees that Buyer shall be entitled to specific performance of this
Section 7.15 pursuant to Section 11.17. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Restricted Period applicable to Parent and its Affiliates shall

or any of its Affiliates is in breach of the obligations under this Section
7.15.

  

  

(g) If any provision contained in this Section 7.15 shall for any reason be
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this
Section 7.15, but this Section 7.15 shall be construed as if such invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein. It is the
intention of the parties that, if any of the restrictions or covenants
contained in this Section 7.15 is held to cover a geographic area or to have a
duration that is not permitted by applicable Law, or in any way construed to
be too broad or to any extent invalid, such provision shall (to the maximum
extent permitted by applicable Law) not be construed to be null, void and of
no effect, but shall instead be construed and interpreted or reformed to
provide for a covenant having the maximum enforceable geographic area,
duration and other extent (not greater than those contained herein) as shall
be valid and enforceable under applicable Law.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

72  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(h) During the Restricted Period, Buyer agrees, subject to the provisions of
this Section 7.15, not to, and agrees to prevent its Affiliates from, directly
or indirectly, in the United States or elsewhere, on such Person's own behalf
or on the behalf of another to solicit for employment (either on a full-time
or part-time basis, or in a consultancy or other non-employee role) any
Retained Business Employee, or encourage or induce any such employee to leave
his or her employment relationship with Parent or any of its Affiliates;
provided that this paragraph (h) shall not apply if (A) any such employee that
has been terminated by Parent or any of its Affiliates or (B) any such
employee contacts Buyer or any of its Affiliates in response to a solicitation
for employment made to the public in general, or other method not specifically
directed toward the employees of Parent or any or its Affiliates.

  

  

Section 7.16. IT Separation.

  

  

Attached hereto as Schedule 7.16, is a general outline of what the parties, as
of the date hereof, believe will reasonably be required to effectuate the IT
Separation together with a general indication of the cost with respect
thereto. Buyer and Parent shall work in good faith to finalize the scope and
cost of the IT Separation as soon as is reasonably practicable and shall each
use commercially reasonable efforts to take such actions prior to Closing as
may be reasonably required to timely effectuate the IT Separation in
accordance with the parties' mutual agreement. Buyer will reimburse Parent for
(i) the direct costs for Parent's, or its Affiliates', personnel and (ii) all
reasonable out of pocket costs incurred by Parent or its Affiliates, in each
case, in connection with actions taken by Parent or its Affiliates (with the
approval of Buyer which shall not be unreasonably conditioned, delayed or
withheld) prior to Closing to effectuate the IT Separation. All activities
related to IT Separation after the Closing shall be provided pursuant to the
Transition Services Agreement.

  

  

Section 7.17. Termination of Intra-Company Agreements.

  

  

Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement, (a) Parent shall cause all Contracts between any Acquired Entity,
on the one hand, and any other Affiliate of Parent, on the other hand, to be
terminated, effective as of the Closing; and (b) all intercompany receivables,
payables and other accounts between any Acquired Entity, on the one hand, and
any other Affiliate of Parent, on the other hand, in existence as of
immediately prior to the Closing shall be satisfied or settled by the relevant
Persons in full and without further liability of any Acquired Entity no later
than the Closing.

Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, from and after the

actions, causes of action, judgments, awards, Liabilities, losses, costs,
expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses), fines or damages
(including for lost profits and diminution of value) (each, a "Loss",
collectively the "Losses"), whether or not involving a Third Party Claim,
incurred or suffered by any of them to the extent such arise or result from:

contained therein relating to materiality or Material Adverse Effect or any
similar qualification or standard);

  

  

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Parent or any of its Affiliates
to be performed before, on or after the Closing Date, in each case contained

(c) any Retained Liability or any payment default by Stone and Webster Asia,
Inc. under the Singapore Agreements.

  

  

In no event shall Parent be obligated to indemnify any Buyer Indemnitee with
respect to any matter to the extent that such matter was reflected in the
calculation of the adjustment to the Purchase Price, if any, pursuant to
Section 2.8. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Article 10 or elsewhere in this Agreement, in no event shall any amounts be
recovered by Buyer under this Article 10 for any Loss related to Taxes,
Buyer's exclusive remedy with respect to claims for Taxes being set forth in
Section 7.3(g); provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of
Section 10.5 and Section 10.6 shall be applicable to the extent they apply to
claims for Losses related to Taxes.

  

  

Section 10.2. Indemnification by Buyer.

  

  

Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, from and after the
Closing, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Parent and its Affiliates and
each of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors or
representatives (the "Parent Indemnitees") from and against any and all
Losses, whether or not involving a Third Party Claim, incurred or suffered by
any of them to the extent such arise or result from:

  

  

(a) any breach of warranty or representation of Buyer contained in this
Agreement (determined without regard to any qualification or exception
contained therein relating to materiality or Buyer Material Adverse Effect or
any similar qualification or standard);

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

77

Section 10.3. Notice of Claims.

  

  

(a) If any of the Persons to be indemnified under this Article 10 (the
"Indemnified Party") has suffered or incurred any Loss (other than one
resulting from a Third Party Claim), the Indemnified Party shall so notify in
writing the party from whom indemnification is sought (the "Indemnifying
Party") promptly after obtaining knowledge of such claim, describing such
Loss, the amount or estimated amount thereof, if known or reasonably capable
of estimation, and the method of computation of such Loss, all with reasonable
specificity and containing a reference to the provisions of this Agreement or
any Implementing Agreement in respect of which such Loss shall have occurred.
A failure to give notice in a timely manner pursuant to this Section 10.3(a)
shall not limit the obligation of the Indemnifying Party under this Article 10
except to the extent such Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced thereby.
The Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate and assist the Indemnifying
Party in determining the validity of any claim of indemnity (including
reasonable access to and copies of records and information that are reasonably
relevant to such matters and the making available of employees on a mutually
convenient basis for providing additional information and explanation of any
material relating to such matters). If the Indemnifying Party does not notify
the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) calendar days following its receipt
of a notice delivered pursuant to this Section 10.3 that the Indemnifying
Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party under this Article 10,
such claim specified by the Indemnified Party in such notice shall be
conclusively determined to be a liability of the Indemnifying Party.

  

  

(b) If any Proceeding is instituted by or against a third party with respect
to which the Indemnified Party intends to claim any Liability or expense as a
Loss under this Article 10, the Indemnified Party shall promptly following
receipt by such Indemnified Party of notice of the Third Party Claim notify
the Indemnifying Party in writing and in reasonable detail of such Proceeding.
Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party,
promptly following the Indemnified Party's receipt thereof, copies of all
notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified
Party relating to the Third Party Claim. A failure to give notice and to
tender the defense of the Proceeding in a timely manner pursuant to this
Section 10.3(b) shall not limit the obligation of the Indemnifying Party under
this Article 10: (i) except to the extent such Indemnifying Party is
materially prejudiced thereby, and for this purpose, any failure to give
notice and to tender the defense that results in the Indemnifying Party not
controlling or participating in such Proceeding shall be deemed to materially
prejudice the Indemnifying Party, and (ii) except as provided by Section 10.4
below.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

78  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 10.4. Third Party Claims.

  

  

(a) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, upon
written notice to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days of receipt of
notice from the Indemnified Party of the commencement of any third party
claim, action or suit for which indemnity may be sought under Section 10.1 or
10.2 (a "Third Party Claim"), to conduct and control at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party, through counsel of its choosing that is reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, the defense or prosecution, as
applicable, of such Third Party Claim, and the Indemnifying Party may
compromise or settle the same; provided that the Indemnifying Party shall give
the Indemnified Party advance notice of any proposed compromise or settlement;
provided, further, that the Indemnifying Party will not, in defense of such
Third Party Claim, except with the consent of the Indemnified Party, consent
to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement (i) which provides
for any relief other than the payment of monetary damages and/or (ii) which
does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the third
party claimant to the Indemnified Party of a release from all Liability in
respect thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall
not be entitled to assume the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim
if at the time of assumption (w) the Third Party Claim is made by a
Governmental Authority in connection with a criminal matter, (x) the
Indemnifying Party fails to demonstrate its ability to conduct the defense or
prosecution actively and diligently, (y) a majority of the damages associated
with such Third Party Claim are not reasonably expected to be indemnifiable
hereunder or (z) the relief sought in connection with such Third Party Claim
consists primarily of injunctive or other equitable relief. If it assumes the
defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall
permit the Indemnified Party to participate in, but not control or file any
papers in respect of, the defense or prosecution of any such action or suit
through counsel chosen by the Indemnified Party, provided, that the fees and
expenses of such counsel and any counsel retained or used by the Indemnified
Party from the time the Indemnifying Party assumed the defense or prosecution
of the Third Party Claim shall be borne by the Indemnified Party, unless
representation of both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party by the
same counsel would create a conflict of interest, in which event the fees and
expenses of such counsel (and appropriate local counsel) shall be at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall be liable for
the fees, costs and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for
any period during which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense or
prosecution of a Third Party Claim (other than during any period in which the
Indemnified Party shall have failed to give notice of the Third Party Claim as
provided in Section 10.3, or if one of the circumstances set forth in
subparagraphs (w), (x), (y) or (z) exists). Whether or not the Indemnifying
Party shall have assumed the defense or prosecution of a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or
settle, compromise or discharge such Third Party Claim, without the
Indemnifying Party's prior written consent. If the Indemnifying Party elects
not to control or conduct the defense or prosecution of a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in, but not conduct
or control, the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim and, at its
own expense, to employ counsel of its own choosing for such purpose.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

79  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution of any Third
Party Claim, with such cooperation to include (i) the retention and, upon the
Indemnifying Party's request, the provision to the Indemnifying Party of
records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party
Claim, and (ii) the making available of employees on a mutually convenient
basis for providing additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder.

  

  

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of Section 7.3(g), and not
those of this Section 10.4, shall govern any claim, action or suit with
respect to Taxes.

  

  

Section 10.5. Expiration.

  

  

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, all covenants,
agreements (including those relating to indemnification in Section 10.1 or
10.2), warranties and representations made herein shall survive the Closing.

  

  

(b) Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, including as set forth in
Sections 7.3(g), 10.5(c), 10.6, 10.7 and 10.8, neither Parent nor Buyer will
have any liability (for indemnification or otherwise) for breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or for any obligation contained in this
Agreement or any Implementing Agreement unless on or before that date that is
eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date, a written notice in accordance
with Section 10.3 has been received by the appropriate Indemnifying Party;
provided that for the avoidance of doubt, (1) Parent shall be liable for any
claim properly asserted pursuant to Section 7.3(g) if such claim is asserted
by written notice to Parent prior to the date that is thirty (30) days after
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to the
Taxes that are the subject of such claim and (2) Buyer shall be liable for any
claim properly asserted pursuant to Section 7.3(g) if such claim is asserted
by written notice to Buyer prior to the date that is thirty (30) days after
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to the
Taxes that are the subject of such claim.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding subparagraph (b) above: (i) the representations and
warranties contained in Sections 4.1(a) (Organization), 4.2 (Authority;
Binding Effect), 4.6 (Capitalization of Acquired Entities), 4.23 (Brokers),
5.1 (Organization), 6.1 (Organization), 6.2 (Authority; Binding Effect) and
6.7 (Brokers) (collectively, the "Fundamental Representations") shall survive
the Closing until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations,
(ii) the representations and warranties contained in Section 4.22 (Anti-
Corruption Compliance) shall survive the Closing until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations, (iii) the Tax representations and
warranties set forth in Section 4.19 shall not survive the Closing for any
purpose and (iv) the covenants and agreements of the parties hereto (including
those relating to indemnification in Sections 7.3(g) (subject to the
limitation set forth in Section 7.3(g)(iii)), 10.1 or 10.2) to be performed
after the Closing Date shall survive indefinitely. Any claims in connection
with intentional misconduct or intentional misrepresentation shall survive
indefinitely.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

80  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 10.6. Limitations on Amount.

  

  

(a) Parent shall not have any liability under Section 10.1(a) or Section
10.1(b) for any individual Loss (or series of connected Losses) hereunder
unless such individual Loss (or series of connected Losses) exceeds U.S.
$50,000 (the "Per Claim Basket") and unless the aggregate of all Losses for
which Parent would, but for this provision, be liable exceeds on a cumulative
basis, U.S. $10,000,000 (the "Aggregate Basket") and, if such aggregate amount
is exceeded, Parent shall be required to pay only the amount of such Losses
which exceeds the amount of the Aggregate Basket; provided, however, that
Parent shall not have any liability for any such Losses pursuant to Section
10.1(a) (other than in respect of a breach of Section 4.22) in excess of, on a
cumulative basis, U.S. $60,000,000 (the "Ceiling") or pursuant to Section
10.1(a) in respect of a breach of Section 4.22 or Section 10.1(b) in excess
of, on a cumulative basis, the Purchase Price Cap.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 10.6(a),
neither the Per Claim Basket, nor the Aggregate Basket nor the Ceiling shall
apply to any Liability for any Losses (i) with respect to breaches of the
Fundamental Representations or (ii) relating to Taxes.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, in no event
shall Parent's aggregate liability under Section 10.1(a), Section 10.1(b) and
Section 7.3(g) exceed the Purchase Price (as it may be adjusted pursuant to
Section 2.8) (the "Purchase Price Cap"). The parties hereby acknowledge that
the Purchase Price Cap shall be a single amount applicable to all such claims
against Parent and/or its Affiliates (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
any claims made pursuant to Section 7.3(g)) and that any indemnification
payments made pursuant to Section 10.1(a), Section 10.1(b) and Section 7.3(g)
shall reduce the remaining amounts for all such claims under the Purchase
Price Cap.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, in no event
shall Buyer's aggregate liability under Section 10.2(a), Section 10.2(b) and
Section 7.3(g) exceed the Purchase Price Cap. The parties hereby acknowledge
that the Purchase Price Cap shall be a single amount applicable to all such
claims against Buyer and/or its Affiliates (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any claims made pursuant to Section 7.3(g)) and that any
indemnification payments made pursuant to Section 10.2(a), Section 10.2(b) and
Section 7.3(g) shall reduce the remaining amounts for all such claims under
the Purchase Price Cap.

  

  

Section 10.7. Other Limitations.

  

  

(a) Each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to mitigate any Loss upon
becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be expected to, or does,
give rise to a Loss, including incurring costs but only to the extent
reasonably necessary to mitigate such Loss.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

81  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The Indemnified Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all
insurance proceeds or other payments from third parties in order to mitigate
the amount of Losses hereunder. The amount of Loss for which the Indemnified
Party may be entitled to seek indemnification under this Agreement will be
reduced by (i) the amount of any insurance proceeds or other payment from a
third party received, realized or retained by the Indemnified Party or any of
its Affiliates with respect to such Loss (less the amount of any expenses
incurred by it in procuring such recovery), and (ii) any Tax benefit actually
realized (including by way of a deduction or credit) by the Indemnified Party
or any of its Affiliates (including the Acquired Entities) as a result of the
Loss giving rise to such indemnification. If such Person, after having
received any indemnification payment pursuant to this Agreement with respect
to a Loss, subsequently receives or realizes any insurance proceeds or other
payment in compensation for such Loss, the Indemnified Party will promptly
refund and pay to the Indemnifying Party an amount equal to such insurance
proceeds or payment (after deducting therefrom the amount of any expenses
incurred by it in procuring such recovery, to the extent such Indemnified
Party did not already receive payment for such expenses from the Indemnifying
Party), but not in excess of any amount previously paid by the Indemnifying
Party to the Indemnified Party in respect of such matter.

  

  

(c) If an Indemnified Party is indemnified for any Losses pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to any claim by a third party, then the appropriate
Indemnifying Party will be subrogated to all rights and remedies of the
Indemnified Party against such third party, and such Indemnified Party will
reasonably cooperate with and assist the Indemnifying Party in asserting all
such rights and remedies against such third party.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding any provision herein, Parent and its Affiliates shall not
in any event be liable to any Buyer Indemnitee and Buyer and its Affiliates
shall not in any event be liable to any Parent Indemnitee on account of any
indemnity obligation set forth in Section 10.1 or Section 10.2 for any
indirect, special, incidental or punitive damages (including loss of use,
damage to goodwill or loss of business) arising out of, or relating to, this
Agreement or any Implementing Agreement, other than any such damages payable
to a third party in connection with the resolution of a Third Party Claim.

  

  

(e) If, in connection with any claim for the Weymouth Environmental Liability,
Parent is contractually obligated to reimburse Washington Group International,
Inc. (or, if applicable, its successors) for such Weymouth Environmental
Liability, then, upon receipt of reasonably satisfactory documentation
evidencing such reimbursement, Buyer shall remit to Parent an amount equal to
such reimbursement amount; provided that Buyer shall not have any obligation
to remit to Parent any amount in excess of, on a cumulative basis, $500,000.

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, it is intended
that the provisions of this Agreement will not result in a duplicative payment
of any amount required to be paid under this Agreement, and this Agreement
shall be construed accordingly.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

82  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 10.8. Acknowledgements; Exclusive Remedy.

  

  

(a) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement or any
Implementing Agreement, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, other than with
respect to (i) claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud and (ii)
claims for equitable relief related to the breach of any covenant or agreement
of Parent contained in this Agreement requiring performance after the Closing,
Buyer's sole and exclusive remedy after the Closing with respect to any and
all claims against Parent and its Affiliates relating to this Agreement, any
document or certificate delivered in connection herewith (other than the
Ancillary Agreements), the Business, the Conveyed Assets, the Assumed
Liabilities, the Retained Liabilities or any applicable Law (including, inter
alia, any rights of contribution or recovery under CERCLA or other
Environmental Law) or otherwise shall be pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer
hereby waives, from and after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action (other
than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud and claims for
equitable relief related to the breach of any covenant or agreement of Parent
contained in this Agreement requiring performance after the Closing) it or any
of its Affiliates may have against Parent or any of its Affiliates or any of
their respective officers, directors, employees, agents or advisors arising
under or based upon this Agreement, any document or certificate delivered in
connection herewith (other than the Ancillary Agreements), the Business, the
Conveyed Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, the Retained Liabilities or any
applicable Law (including, inter alia, any rights of contribution or recovery
under CERCLA or other Environmental Law) or otherwise, except as set forth in
this Agreement or any Implementing Agreement.

  

  

(b) EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, ANY IMPLEMENTING AGREEMENT OR ANY
ANCILLARY AGREEMENT, (I) PARENT MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE CONVEYED ASSETS, THE
ASSUMED LIABILITIES OR THE BUSINESS, ANY OF THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS
(INCLUDING ANY CONSENTS OR APPROVALS REQUIRED IN CONNECTION THEREWITH) OR THE
BUSINESS, ASSETS, CONDITION OR PROSPECTS (FINANCIAL OR OTHERWISE) OF, OR ANY
OTHER MATTER INVOLVING THE CONVEYED ASSETS, ASSUMED LIABILITIES OR THE
BUSINESS AND (II) ALL OF THE ASSETS TO BE TRANSFERRED OR THE LIABILITIES TO BE
ASSUMED OR TRANSFERRED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE TRANSFERRED
OR ASSUMED ON AN "AS IS, WHERE IS" BASIS, AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR OTHERWISE ARE HEREBY
EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED.

  

  

(c) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement or any
Implementing Agreement, Parent acknowledges and agrees that, other than with
respect to (i) claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud and (ii)
claims for equitable relief related to the breach of any covenant or agreement
of Buyer contained in this Agreement requiring performance after the Closing,
Parent's sole and exclusive remedy after the Closing with respect to any and
all claims against Buyer and its Affiliates relating to this Agreement, any
document or certificate delivered in connection herewith (other than the
Ancillary Agreements), the Business, the Conveyed Assets, the Assumed
Liabilities or any applicable Law (including, inter alia, any rights of
contribution or recovery under CERCLA or other Environmental Law) or otherwise
shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this
Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, Parent hereby waives, from and
after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any
and all rights, claims and causes of action (other than claims of, or causes
of action arising from, fraud and claims for equitable relief related to the
breach of any covenant or agreement of Buyer contained in this Agreement
requiring performance after the Closing) it or any of its Affiliates may have
against Buyer or any of its Affiliates or any of their respective officers,
directors, employees, agents or advisors arising under or based upon this
Agreement, any document or certificate delivered in connection herewith (other
than the Ancillary Agreements), the Business, the Conveyed Assets, the Assumed
Liabilities or any applicable Law (including, inter alia, any rights of
contribution or recovery under CERCLA or other Environmental Law) or
otherwise, except as set forth in this Agreement or any Implementing
Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

83  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, ANY IMPLEMENTING AGREEMENT OR ANY
ANCILLARY AGREEMENT, BUYER MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND
WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO ANY OF THE CONTEMPLATED
TRANSACTIONS.

Section 11.2. Amendment; Waiver.

  

  

Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if, such
amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by
Buyer and Parent. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right,
power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

  

  

Section 11.3. Assignment.

  

  

No party to this Agreement may assign any of its rights or obligations under
this Agreement, including by sale of stock or by operation of Law in
connection with a merger or sale of substantially all assets, without the
prior written consent of the other party hereto, except that without such
consent, Buyer may assign its rights to purchase the Conveyed Assets to one or
more of its controlled Affiliates; provided, that no such assignment by Buyer
shall relieve Buyer of any of its obligations hereunder.

  

  

Section 11.4. Entire Agreement.

  

  

This Agreement (including Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits) and the Ancillary
Agreements comprise the entire agreement between the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, oral or written, with respect to such matters,
except for the Confidentiality Agreement, as amended hereby, which will remain
in full force and effect for the term provided for therein and any other
written agreement of the parties that expressly provides that it is not
superseded by this Agreement.

  

  

Section 11.5. Fulfillment of Obligations.

  

  

Any obligation of any party to any other party under this Agreement, which
obligation is performed, satisfied or fulfilled by an Affiliate of such party,
shall be deemed to have been performed, satisfied or fulfilled by such party.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

85  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 11.6. Parties in Interest.

  

  

This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Except as set
forth in Sections 10.1 and 10.2, nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to confer upon any Person other than Buyer, Parent or
their successors or permitted assigns, any rights or remedies under or by
reason of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 11.7. Public Disclosure.

  

  

No communication, release or announcement to the public or to employees or
others not directly involved in the negotiation or approval of this Agreement,
any Ancillary Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions shall be issued or
made by any party without the prior consent of the other party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as such
communication, release or announcement may be required by Law or the rules or
regulations of any U.S. or foreign securities exchange or similar
organization, in which case the party required to make the communication,
release or announcement shall allow the other party reasonable time to comment
thereon in advance of such issuance; provided, however, that each of the
parties may make internal announcements to their respective employees that are
consistent with the parties' prior public disclosures regarding the
Contemplated Transactions after reasonable prior notice to and consultation
with the other parties.

  

  

Section 11.8. Return of Information.

  

  

If for any reason whatsoever the Contemplated Transactions are not

of their respective agents, employees, or representatives (including all
copies, summaries and abstracts, if any, thereof) in accordance with the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement.

  

  

Section 11.9. Expenses.

  

  

(a) Whether or not the Contemplated Transactions are consummated, except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, including this Section 11.9, each of the
parties hereto shall be responsible for the payment of its or any of its
Affiliates' own costs and expenses incurred in connection with the

(b) The filing fees required by any Governmental Competition Authority shall
be borne by Buyer.

  

  

Section 11.10. Disclosure Schedules.

not be deemed to constitute an admission by Parent or any Subsidiary Seller,
or to otherwise imply, that any such matter is material for the purposes of
this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

86  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 11.11. Governing Law; Jurisdiction.

  

  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in
accordance with the Laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to
the conflicts of law provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or
any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

  

  

(b) The parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United
States Court for the Southern District of New York or any courts of the State
of New York located in the borough of Manhattan in New York City, for the
purposes of any Proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions (and each agrees that no such Proceeding relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought by it
except in such courts). The parties irrevocably and unconditionally waive (and
agree not to plead or claim) any objection to the laying of venue of any
Proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions in
the United States Court for the Southern District of New York or any courts of
the State of New York located in the borough of Manhattan in New York City or
that any such Proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Each of the parties also agrees that any final and non-
appealable judgment against a party in connection with any Proceeding shall be
conclusive and binding on such party and that such award or judgment may be
enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction, either within or outside of
the United States. A certified or exemplified copy of such award or judgment
shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such award or judgment.

  

  

Section 11.12. Counterparts.

  

  

This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed an original, and all of which shall constitute one and the
same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of
this Agreement by facsimile or other electronic imaging means shall be
effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 11.13. Headings.

  

  

The heading references herein and the Table of Contents hereto are for
convenience purposes only, do not constitute a part of this Agreement, and
shall not be deemed to limit or affect any of the provisions hereof.

  

  

Section 11.14. Severability.

  

  

The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the invalidity
or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision of this
Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any circumstance, is
invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be
substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and
enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable
provision, and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such
invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability
affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application
thereof in any other jurisdiction.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

87  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 11.15. Governing Language.

  

  

The English language shall be the definitive and controlling text of this
Agreement, notwithstanding the translation of this Agreement into any other
language.

  

  

Section 11.16. Waiver of Jury Trial.

  

  

EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ANY
IMPLEMENTING AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH
PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY IMPLEMENTING AGREEMENT, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 11.16.

  

  

Section 11.17. Specific Performance.

  

  

The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties
would not have any adequate remedy at law if any provision of this Agreement
was not performed in accordance with its terms or was otherwise breached or
threatened to be breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to equitable relief, without the proof of actual damages, including
in the form of an injunction or injunctions or orders for specific performance
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement. Such equitable relief shall be in addition
to any other remedy to which the parties hereto are entitled at law or in
equity as a remedy for such nonperformance, breach or threatened breach. Each
party agrees to (a) cooperate fully in any attempt by the other party in
obtaining any such equitable remedy and (b) waive any requirement for the
security or posting of any bond in connection with any such equitable remedy.
Each party further agrees that the only permitted objection that it may raise
in response to any action for equitable relief is that it contests the
existence of a breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this
Agreement. The rights and remedies of the parties shall be cumulative (and not
alternative).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

88  

  

 

 

 

  

  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed or caused this Agreement to be
executed as of the date first written above.
