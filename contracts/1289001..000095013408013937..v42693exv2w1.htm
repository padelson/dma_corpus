 _EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_   

  

 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any holder of any shares of capital stock of Company, Parent or Merger Sub: 

  

 (a) _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. 

  

 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each Share that is owned directly or indirectly by Company as treasury stock or by Parent, Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary (as defined in Section 3.1(a)) of Parent or Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefore. 

  

 (c) _Conversion of Company Common Shares_. Subject to Section 2.1(b) and Section 2.3(a), each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company, together with each associated Right (as hereinafter defined) under the Rights Agreement (as hereinafter defined) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (such shares collectively, " _Common Shares_ " or " _Shares_ " and each, a " _Share_ "), other than any Cancelled Shares (as defined, and to the extent provided in Section 2.1(b)) and any Dissenting Shares (as defined, and to the extent provided in Section 2.3(a)), shall be cancelled and shall be converted automatically into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation $12.25 per share in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ ") payable to the holder thereof upon surrender in the manner provided in Section 2.2(b) of the certificate or certificates (a " _Certificate_ ") which immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced such Shares. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) _Stock Options; Restricted Stock Units_. Company shall cause each option to purchase Common Shares (a " _Company Option_ "), outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, to be canceled at the Effective Time and shall thereafter represent the right to receive, at the Effective Time or as soon as practicable thereafter, in full satisfaction of the rights of the holder with respect thereto, an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the number of Common Shares subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (B) the amount by which the Merger Consideration exceeds the exercise price per share of Company Shares previously subject to such Company Option. Company shall cause each restricted stock unit with respect to Common Shares (" _Company RSUs_ ") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, to be canceled at the Effective Time, and shall thereafter represent the right to receive, at the Effective Time or as soon as practicable thereafter, in full satisfaction of the rights of the holder with respect thereto, an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the number of Company Shares subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (B) the Merger Consideration. In accordance with the terms of the 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, immediately prior to the Effective Time, any "Accumulation Period" and/or "Offering Period" (as such terms are defined in the 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan) shall terminate and each participant thereunder shall receive Common Shares in accordance with the terms of the 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. 

  

 2.2 _Exchange of Share Certificates_. (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company to act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause Merger Sub to deposit, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, an amount equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration. The deposit made by Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, pursuant to this Section 2.2(a) is hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." Such funds shall be invested in Permitted Investments by the Paying Agent as directed by the Surviving Corporation. Any interest or other income resulting from such investment shall be paid to and be income of Parent. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement. " _Permitted Investments_ " shall mean (i) direct obligations of the United States, (ii) obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest, (iii) commercial paper rated the highest quality by Moodys Investors Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors Ratings Group, (iv) certificates of deposit, money market funds, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of a commercial bank having at least $1 billion in assets and rated in one of two highest rating categories (without regard to refinements within such rating categories) by Moodys Investors Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors Ratings Group, or (v) pooled or commingled investment vehicles administered by a bank meeting the requirements of (iv) above that is limited to investments as described in (i) through (iv) above.

Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal specifying that delivery of the Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in customary form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration (such instructions shall include instructions for the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered on the transfer books of Company, subject to the receipt of appropriate documentation for such transfer). Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate (or evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation of loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefore the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article II, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled; _provided_ that in no event will a holder of a Certificate be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration if Merger Consideration was already paid with respect to the Shares underlying such Certificate in connection with an affidavit of loss. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Common Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of Company, payment may be issued to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Common Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation required to evidence and effect such transfer, and the Person requesting such issuance pays any transfer or other taxes required by reason of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establishes to the satisfaction of Parent and Company that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. All cash paid upon the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.2 shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Common Shares formerly represented by such Certificate. 

  

 For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Person_ " shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit corporations), general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 3.1(d)) or other entity of any kind or nature. 

  

 (c) _Transfers_. At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of Company of Common Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable Law. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund relating to the Merger Consideration that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of Company one hundred and eighty (180) days after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent or the Surviving Corporation. Any stockholders of Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration upon due surrender of their Certificates (or affidavits of loss reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation in lieu thereof), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Common Shares or for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. If any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to five years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity) any such Shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled hereto. 

  

 (e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration upon due surrender of the Common Shares represented by such Certificate pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 (f) _Withholding Rights_. Not withstanding anything to the contrary herein, each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Paying Agent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article II such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under provision of any federal, state, local or foreign tax law or under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. If Parent, Merger Sub, the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Common Shares in respect of which Parent, Merger Sub, the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding. 

   ##### 

  

  

 2.3 _Dissenters  Rights_. (a) Notwithstanding anything in any other Section of this Agreement to the contrary, Common Shares, including any Rights attached thereto, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded properly in writing appraisal for such Common Shares including any Rights attached thereto in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his right to appraisal. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive, subject to and net of any applicable withholding of Taxes (as defined in Section 3.1(n)(ii)), payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of such holder to receive, subject to and net of any applicable withholding of Taxes, payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 2.2, of the Certificate or Certificates that formerly evidenced such Dissenting Shares. 

  

 (b) Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received by Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served on or otherwise received by Company pursuant to the DGCL, and Parent shall have the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under DGCL. Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands. 

  

 2.4 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that Company changes the number of Common Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Common Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change.

Section 3.1(j) of the Company Disclosure Schedules lists all Compensation and Benefit Plans of Company and its Subsidiaries (" _Company Compensation and Benefit Plans_ "), and any Company Compensation and Benefit Plans containing "change of control" or similar provisions therein are specifically identified in Section 3.1(j) of the Company Disclosure Schedules. Company has made available to Parent a copy of all Company Compensation and Benefit Plans, a copy of each material document, if any, 

   ##### 

  

    

prepared in connection with each Company Compensation and Benefit Plan, and a
copy of each agreement, policy, practice or arrangement that covers employees
or former employees of Company and its Subsidiaries. 

   

 (i) None of the Company Compensation and Benefit Plans is (i) a multiemployer plan (within the meaning of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ "), (ii) a single employer pension plan (within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA) for which the Company or any Subsidiary could incur liability under Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA (a " _Multiple Employer Plan_ "), or (iii) subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Sections 412 or 4971 of the Code. 

   

 (ii) All Company Compensation and Benefit Plans are now and have always been operated in all material respects in accordance with their terms and the requirements of all applicable Laws and, to the extent subject to ERISA and the Code, are in compliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Law. Each Company Compensation and Benefit Plan that is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a " _Pension Plan_ ") and that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) or Section 401(k) of the Code has timely received a favorable determination letter from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ "), and each trust established in connection with any Plan which is intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code has received a determination letter from the IRS that it is so exempt, and nothing has occurred, whether by action or failure to act, that would cause the loss of such qualification or that would result in material costs to Company or any of its Subsidiaries under the Internal Revenue Services Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System. Each Company Compensation and Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" subject to Section 409A of the Code has been operated in all material respects in good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code and the regulations and other guidance promulgated thereunder since January 1, 2005. There is no pending or, to the knowledge of Company, threatened litigation relating to the Company Compensation and Benefit Plans. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any Pension Plan that, assuming the taxable period of such transaction expired, would subject Company or any of its Subsidiaries to a material tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) or Section 406 of ERISA. 

   

 (iii) No liability under Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Company and its Subsidiaries have not incurred and do not expect to incur any withdrawal liability with respect to a Multiple Employer Plan of Title IV of ERISA (regardless of whether based on contributions of any entity which is considered an employer with Company under Section 4001 0f ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (an " _ERISA Affiliate_ ")). No notice of a "reportable event," within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for which the thirty (30) day reporting requirement has not been waived or extended, other than an extension pursuant to Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation Reg. Section 4043.66, has been required to be filed for any Pension Plan or by any ERISA Affiliate within the preceding twelve (12) month period. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (iv) All contributions, premiums or payments required to be made under the terms of any Company Compensation and Benefit Plan have been timely made or have been reflected on the most recent consolidated balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference in Company Reports. Neither any Pension Plan nor any Multiple Employer Plan within the meaning of Section 431 and 432 of the Code or Section 305 of ERISA and no ERISA Affiliate has an outstanding funding waiver. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has provided, or is required to provide, security to any Pension Plan or to Multiple Employer Plan pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code. 

  

 (v) Neither Company nor its Subsidiaries have any obligations for, or liabilities with respect to, retiree health, disability or life benefits under any Company Compensation and Benefit Plan, except for benefits required to be provided under Section 4980B of the Code or any other applicable law requiring continuation of health coverage. 

  

 (vi) Neither the negotiation and execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) constitute an event under any Company Compensation and Benefit Plan that will or may result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration of payment, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect to any employee or former employee of Company or any of its Subsidiaries. There is no contract, agreement, plan or arrangement with an employee or former employee of Company or any of its Subsidiaries to which Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party as of the date of this Agreement that, individually or collectively and as a result of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (whether alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) or otherwise, would reasonably be likely to give rise to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to Sections 280G or 162(m) of the Code. No Company Compensation and Benefits Plan provides for a "gross-up" or similar payments in respect of any Taxes that may become payable under Section 409A or Section 4999(a) of the Code. 

  

 (vii) In addition to the foregoing, with respect to each Company Compensation and Benefit Plan that is not subject to United States law (a " _Non-U.S. Benefit Plan_ "): 

  

 (A) all employer and employee contributions to each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan required by law or by the terms of such Non-U.S. Benefit Plan have been made, or, if applicable, accrued in accordance with normal accounting practices; 

   ##### 

  

  

 (B) the fair market value of the assets of each funded Non-U.S. Benefit Plan, the liability of each insurer for any Non-U.S. Benefit Plan funded through insurance or the book reserve established for any Non-U.S. Benefit Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide for the benefits determined on any ongoing basis (actual or contingent) accrued to the date of this Agreement with respect to all current and former participants under such Non-U.S. Benefit Plan according to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine employer contributions to such Non-U.S. Benefit Plan; and 

  

 (C) each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan required to be registered has been registered and has been maintained in good standing with applicable regulatory authorities. Each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan is now and always has been operated in all material respects in compliance with all applicable non-United States laws. 

  

 (k) _Compliance with Laws_. The business of Company and its Subsidiaries is not being conducted in violation of any United States or non-United States federal, state or local law, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, injunction, decree, arbitration award, agency requirement, license or permit of any Governmental Entity (individually, " _Law_ " and collectively, " _Laws_ "), except for violations that would not be reasonably likely to, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent, or materially impair the ability of Company to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. No investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to Company or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or, to the knowledge of Company, threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity indicated in writing an intention to conduct the same, except for those the outcome of which would not be reasonably likely to, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent, or materially impair the ability of Company to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. Company and each of its Subsidiaries has, or has applied for, all permits, licenses, franchises, variances, exemptions, orders and other governmental authorizations, consents and approvals from Governmental Entities necessary to own, lease and operate its properties or to conduct its business as currently conducted, except for those the absence of which would not be reasonably likely to, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The provisions of this Section 3.1(k) shall not apply to Environmental Laws (as defined in Section 3.1(m)(iii)) which are covered exclusively in Section 3.1(m), tax Laws which are covered exclusively in Section 3.1(n), labor Laws which are covered exclusively in Section 3.1(o) or intellectual property Laws which are covered exclusively in Section 5.1(p). 

  

 (l) _Anti-takeover Statutes and Rights Agreement_.

No other state anti-takeover statute or regulation is applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 (ii) Company Board of Directors has resolved to, and Company after execution of this Agreement will, take all action necessary to render the Rights issued 

   ##### 

  

    

pursuant to the Rights Agreement inapplicable to the Merger, or the execution

thereby and none of the execution or delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger will result in (a) the occurrence of the "flip-in"
event described in Section 11 of the Rights Agreement, (b) the occurrence of
the "flip-over" event described in Section 13 of the Rights Agreement, or (c)
the Rights becoming evidenced by, and transferable pursuant to, certificates

 (ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary (including, but not limited to, Section 3.1(k)), the representations and warranties of Company in this Section 3.1(m) constitute the sole representations and warranties of Company with respect to any Environmental Law or Hazardous Substance.

 _ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_

Company further agrees that (i) neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of its or 

   ##### 

  

    

its Subsidiaries directors or officers shall, and that it shall cause its and
its Subsidiaries agents and representatives not to, engage in any
negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential information or data to,
or have any discussions with, any Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal,
or otherwise facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement
an Acquisition Proposal or (ii) agree to, approve, endorse or recommend any
Acquisition Proposal or enter into any letter of intent or other contract,

any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.
Company agrees that it will take the necessary steps to promptly inform the
individuals or entities referred to in the first sentence hereof of the
obligations undertaken by Company in this Section 5.2.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.2 or
elsewhere in this Agreement, prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote,
Company may, in connection with a possible Acquisition Proposal, refer any
third party to this Section 5.2 and Section 7.5(a) and make a copy of
this Section 5.2 and Section 7.5(a) available to a third party. 

  

 (b) Company shall as promptly as practicable (but in any event within forty-eight (48) hours) notify Parent orally (and then in writing within twenty-four (24) hours) after it or any of its Subsidiaries has received any proposal, inquiry, offer or request (or any amendment thereto) relating to or constituting an Acquisition Proposal, any request for discussions or negotiations, or any request for information relating to Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or a potential Acquisition Proposal or for access to the properties or books and records thereof of which Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, representatives (including, without limitation, any financial, legal, accounting or other advisors) or agents is or become aware, or any amendments to the foregoing. Such notice shall include a description of the terms and conditions of, and the identity of the person making, any Acquisition Proposal, proposal, inquiry, offer or request (including any amendments thereto). Company shall also as promptly as practicable (but in any event within forty-eight (48) hours) provide Parent with (i) a copy of any written notice or other written communication from any person informing Company or any of its Subsidiaries that it is considering making, or has made, a proposal regarding an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) a copy of any Acquisition Proposal, proposal (or any amendment thereof) received by Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and (iii) such other details of any such Acquisition Proposal that Parent may reasonably request. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.2(a), prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, the Board of Directors of Company may furnish information to and enter into discussions with a third party who has made an unsolicited, written, bona fide proposal or offer regarding an Acquisition Proposal which the Board of Directors of Company has: (i) determined in its good faith judgment (after consultation with a financial advisor of internationally recognized reputation) that such proposal or offer constitutes a Superior Proposal or may reasonably lead to a Superior Proposal, (ii) determined in its good faith judgment, after consultation with independent legal counsel (who may be Companys regularly engaged independent legal counsel) that, in light of such Acquisition Proposal, the furnishing of such information or entering into discussions is consistent with its fiduciary obligations to Company and its stockholders under applicable Law, (iii) provided written notice to Parent of its determination described in clauses (i) and (ii) above and provided the required information 

   ##### 

  

    

pursuant to Section 5.2(b), and (iv) obtained from such person an executed
confidentiality agreement on terms no less favorable to Company in the
aggregate than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (an "
_Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ ") (it being understood that such
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and any related agreements shall not
include any provision calling for any exclusive right to negotiate with such
party or having the effect of prohibiting Company from satisfying its
obligations under this Agreement including providing the required information
pursuant to Section 5.2(b), and shall contain a standstill
provision substantially similar to the standstill provision in the
Confidentiality Agreement). 

  

 (d) Company may, prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote: (i) withdraw, amend, modify or qualify, in any manner adverse to Parent, the approval or the recommendation of the Company Board of Directors of this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby in favor of a Superior Proposal (a " _Change in Board Recommendation_ "); and (ii) accept, approve, endorse or recommend a Superior Proposal, but in each case, if and only to the extent that: 

   

 (i) Company has received an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from such person (in circumstances not involving any breach of this Section 5.2); 

   

 (ii) The Board of Directors of Company, after consultation with and after receiving the advice of its financial advisors and independent legal counsel (who may be Companys regularly engaged independent legal counsel), has determined in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; 

   

 (iii) The Board of Directors of Company, after consultation with and after receiving the advice of its independent legal counsel (who may be Companys regularly engaged independent legal counsel), has determined in good faith that taking such action is consistent with its fiduciary obligations to Company and its stockholders under applicable Laws; 

   

 (iv) Company has provided to Parent the information required to be provided under Section 5.2(b) in respect of such Acquisition Proposal and has promptly notified Parent in writing of the determinations described in Section 5.2(d)(ii) and Section 5.2(d)(iii); 

   

 (v) The Notice Period has elapsed and, if Parent has proposed to revise the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with Section 5.2(e) within such Notice Period, the Board of Directors of Company has again made the determinations in Section 5.2(d)(ii) and Section 5.2(d)(iii) taking into account such proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Merger; and 

   

 (vi) The Fee and Expenses shall have been paid. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) Company covenants that it shall not enter, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to enter, into any agreement, understanding or arrangement providing for a Superior Proposal (a " _Superior Proposal Agreement_ ") and the Board shall not make a Change in Board Recommendation unless (i) Company has provided Parent with a copy of the Superior Proposal Agreement and written notice of the determination of the Board of Directors of Company that the Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal promptly upon the Board of Directors of Company making such determination, and (ii) Company has provided Parent with an opportunity, for a period of three (3) Business Days from the date of delivery to Parent of the notice of its intention to enter into the Acquisition Proposal (the " _Notice Period_ "), to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby such that the Superior Proposal no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal as determined by the Board of Directors of Company, acting in good faith and in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties (the " _Right to Match_ "). If Parent exercises the Right to Match, then the Board of Directors of Company shall review in good faith and in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties, in consultation with and after receiving the advice of its financial advisors and independent legal counsel (who may be Companys regularly engaged independent legal counsel), any such proposal by Parent to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, including an increase in, or modification of, the Merger Consideration, to determine whether the Superior Proposal to which Parent is responding would be a Superior Proposal when assessed against the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby as they are proposed by Parent to be amended. If the Board of Directors of Company determines that the amended terms and conditions of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby proposed by Parent are at least as favorable to Companys stockholders as the terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal, Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall enter into an amended agreement reflecting Parents proposed amendments to the terms and conditions of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby and the Board of Directors of Company shall not make a Change in Board Recommendation and shall not enter into a Superior Proposal Agreement, but rather shall promptly reaffirm its recommendation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, as so amended. In the event Parent does not exercise the Right to Match or the Board of Directors of Company acting in good faith and in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties determines that the amended terms and conditions of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby proposed by Parent are not at least as favorable to Companys stockholders as the Superior Proposal, and therefore the Superior Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal, then Company shall terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.3 and contemporaneously with such termination, Company shall pay the Fee and Expenses, both of which shall occur prior to the execution of the Superior Proposal Agreement. Each successive amendment to any Superior Proposal that results in an increase in, or modification of, the consideration (or value of such consideration) to be received by the stockholders shall constitute a new Superior Proposal for the purposes of this Section 5.2(e) and Parent shall be afforded a new Notice Period in respect of each such Superior Proposal which shall, however, be three (3) Business Days. 

  

 For purposes of this Section 5.2, " _Superior Proposal_ " means an unsolicited bona fide offer made by a third person to consummate any Acquisition Proposal, that in the good faith determination of the Board of Directors of Company, after consultation with its financial advisors and after taking into account relevant financial, legal, regulatory, estimated timing of consummation and other aspects of such proposal and the person or group making such proposal, 

   ##### 

  

 

(i) would, if consummated in accordance with its terms, result in a
transaction more favorable to Companys stockholders than the Merger (taking
into account any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of the Merger or this
Agreement) and (ii) is reasonably likely to be consummated; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that any such offer shall not be deemed to be a "Superior
Proposal" if any financing required to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by such offer is not committed and is not likely in
the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of Company
(after consultation with its financial advisors) to be obtained by such third
person on a timely basis. For purposes of the definition of "Superior
Proposal," each reference to "10%" in the definition of "Acquisition
Proposal" shall be replaced with "50%." 

   

 5.3  _Further Assurances_. (a) Each party hereby agrees to perform any further acts and to execute and deliver any documents which may be reasonably necessary to carry out the provisions of this Agreement. 

  

 (b) From the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date, each party hereto shall provide the other prompt notice of (i) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of which could reasonably be expected to cause any of its representations or warranties contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect and (ii) any material failure of such party to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of such notice pursuant to this Section 5.3 shall not otherwise affect the rights and remedies available to the party so notified hereunder. 

  

 5.4 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. (a) Each party hereto shall file or cause to be filed with (i) the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice any notifications required to be filed under the HSR Act, (ii) the appropriate Governmental Entity each of the Foreign Antitrust Filings, in each case in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations promulgated under the relevant Law, with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) the appropriate Governmental Entity each filing under the Exon-Florio Provision. Each party hereto will use its reasonable best efforts to make such filings in a timely manner and to respond on a timely basis to any requests for additional information made by either of such agencies. 

  

 (b) Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and use (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, necessary, proper or advisable on its part under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby as soon as practicable, including preparing and filing as soon as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings and using their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain as soon as practicable all Company Required Statutory Approvals or Parent Required Statutory Approvals, as the case may be, and all consents, registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party in order to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information and the preservation of any applicable attorney-client privilege, work-product doctrine, self-audit privilege or other similar privilege, Parent and Company shall have the right to review and comment on in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult the other on, all the 

   ##### 

  

    

information relating to Parent or Company, as the case may be, and any of
their respective Subsidiaries, that appear in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any Governmental Entity in connection with
obtaining the relevant approvals, consents or expirations of waiting periods
in relation to the filings. In exercising the foregoing right, each of Company
and Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. 

  

 (c) Subject to applicable Law and the preservation of any applicable attorney-client privilege, Company and Parent each shall, upon request by the other, furnish the other with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 (d) Subject to any confidentiality obligations and the preservation of any attorney-client privilege, Company and Parent each shall keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications received by Parent or Company, as the case may be, or any of its Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 (e) Subject to the fiduciary duties of Companys Board of Directors under the DGCL and its rights and obligations under Section 5.2, in each case as determined by the Board of Directors of Company after consultation with independent legal counsel (who may be Companys regularly engaged independent legal counsel), in the event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Entity or private party challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby, each of Parent, Merger Sub and Company shall cooperate in all respects with each other and use its respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ that neither Merger Sub nor Parent will be required by this Section 5.4 to take any action, including into entering into any consent decree, hold separate orders or other arrangements, that (A) requires the divestiture of any assets of Merger Sub, Parent or Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or (b) limits Parents freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, Company and its Subsidiaries or any portion thereof or any of Parents or its Affiliates other assets or businesses.

   ##### 

  

    

Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting with the consent of
Parent to the extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement
or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to Companys stockholders or

of the Company Meeting.

(a) Parent agrees that, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary thereof, the current and former employees of Company and its Subsidiaries will continue to be provided with, in the aggregate, compensation and benefits under employee benefit plans that are substantially comparable to those provided by Company and its Subsidiaries to such employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, employees of the Company or any Subsidiary shall receive credit for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting (but not for benefit accruals) under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement (other than equity-based compensation plans) established or maintained by the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries for service accrued or deemed accrued prior to the Effective Time with the Company or any Subsidiary; _provided_ , _however_ , that such crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of any such benefit or result in an unusual or unintended increase in such benefit; _provided_ , _further_ , to the extent that an employee of the Company or any Subsidiary is paid severance as a result of the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby, such employee shall not be provided with full credit for service recognized by the Surviving Corporation for purposes of any future severance or severance-like payments.

No initial finding by Company, Parent, Surviving Corporation, their respective counsel, independent counsel, arbitrators or the stockholders of Company, Parent or Surviving Corporation shall be effective to deprive the Indemnified Parties of the protection of this indemnity, nor shall a court or other forum to which an Indemnified Party may apply for enforcement of this indemnity give any weight to any such adverse finding in deciding any issue before it. Upon making a request for indemnification, an Indemnified Party shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification under this Section 5.9 and a challenging party shall have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption in reaching any contrary determination. The termination of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation by judgment, order, settlement, arbitration award or conviction, or upon a plea of _nolo contendere_ or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, (i) adversely affect the rights of the Indemnified Party to indemnification except as indemnification may be expressly prohibited under this Section 5.9, (ii) create a presumption that the Indemnified Party did not act in good faith and in a manner which was reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of Company and its stockholders or (iii) with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, create a presumption that the Indemnified Party had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. 

  

 (b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (a) of this Section 5.9, upon receiving written notification of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Merger Sub in writing thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party except if, and only to the extent that, such failure materially prejudices Merger Sub. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) Merger Sub shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Party, promptly after statements therefor are received, and otherwise advance to such Indemnified Party upon request reimbursement of documented expenses reasonably incurred, (ii) Merger Sub will cooperate in the defense of any such matter, and (iii) any determination required to be made with respect to whether an Indemnified Partys conduct complies with the standards set forth under the DGCL shall be made by independent counsel mutually acceptable to Merger Sub and the Indemnified Party; _provided, however_ , that (A) Merger Sub shall be obligated pursuant to this Section 5.9(b) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction, except to the extent there is, in the opinion of counsel to an Indemnified Party, under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any significant issue between the positions of such Indemnified Party and any other Indemnified Party or Indemnified Parties, in which case each Indemnified Party with a conflicting position on a significant issue shall be entitled to retain separate counsel mutually satisfactory to Parent and such Indemnified Party, (B) the Indemnified 

   ##### 

  

    

Parties shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (C) Parent shall
not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent
(which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 (d) The certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall include provisions for exculpation of director and officer liability and indemnification no less favorable than as set forth in Companys certificate of incorporation and by-laws in effect on the date hereof for six (6) years after the Effective Time. 

  

 (e) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 5.9. 

  

 (f) The rights of each Indemnified Party under this Section 5.9 shall be in addition to any right such Person might have under the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under applicable Law (including the DGCL) or under any agreement of any Indemnified Party with Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The provisions of this Section 5.9 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their respective heirs and representatives. 

  

 5.10 _Expenses_.

" _Takeover Statute_ " shall mean any restrictive provision of any applicable "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "interested stockholder" or other similar anti-takeover Law, including Section 203 of the DGCL. 

  

 5.12 _Parent Vote_. Parent shall vote (or consent with respect to) or cause to be voted (or a consent to be given with respect to) any Common Shares and any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub beneficially owned by it or any of its Affiliates (as such term is defined under the Exchange Act), or with respect to which it or any of such Affiliates has the power (by agreement, proxy or otherwise) to cause to be voted (or to provide a consent), in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby at any meeting of stockholders of Company or Merger Sub, respectively, at which this Agreement shall be submitted for approval and at all adjournments or postponements thereof (or, if applicable, by any action of stockholders of either Company or Merger Sub by consent in lieu of a meeting). 

  

 5.13 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Company shall use all reasonable efforts to approve in advance, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, any dispositions of Common Shares (including derivative securities with respect to such Common Shares) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is or will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16 of the Exchange Act with respect to equity securities of the Company.

EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARENT AND MERGER SUB NOR COMPANY MAKES ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, AND EACH HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES MADE BY ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, FINANCIAL AND LEGAL ADVISORS OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT TO THE EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE MERGER, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER OR THE OTHERS REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING. 

  

 8.7 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Parties are intended to be third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement. 

  

 8.8 _Obligations of Parent and of Company_. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. 

   ##### 

  

  

 8.9 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import, when used in this Agreement, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.

 8.11 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of Law or otherwise; _provided, however_ , that Parent may designate, by written notice to Company, another wholly-owned direct or indirect subsidiary to be a constituent corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, so long as such designation would not reasonably be expected to (i) impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or significantly increase the risk of not obtaining, any Parent Required Statutory Approval or Company Required Statutory Approval or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period, (ii) significantly increase the risk of any Governmental Entity entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, (iii) significantly increase the risk of not being able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise or (iv) materially delay the consummation of the Merger; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent or Merger Sub may assign on a collateral basis any and all of its rights and interests hereunder to any provider of debt financing of the transactions contemplated hereby. If the requirements of the previous sentence are met and Parent wishes to designate another wholly-owned direct or indirect subsidiary to be a constituent corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, then all references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such other subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made herein with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties made with respect to such other subsidiary as of the date of such designation.

 (1) Elections of directors of the Corporation need not be by written ballot, except and to the extent provided in the By-laws of the Corporation.

    ##### 

  

    

liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach
of fiduciary duty as a director.

    

ARTICLE VI  

  

Indemnification of Directors, Officers and Others  

  

 (1) A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (a) for any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders; (b) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; (c) under Section 174 of the General Corporation Law; or (d) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. 

   

 If the Delaware General Corporation Law hereafter is amended to further eliminate or limit the liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation, in addition to the limitation on personal liability provided herein, shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by the amended General Corporation Law. 

   

 (2) Each person who is or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a _"Proceeding"_ ), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such Proceeding is an alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith, and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, except as provided in the second paragraph hereof, the Corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such Proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board. The right to indemnification conferred in this section shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation for any expenses incurred in defending any such Proceeding in advance of its final disposition; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if the General Corporation Law requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by a director or officer in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director or officer, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a Proceeding shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on 

    ##### 

  

    

behalf of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it
shall ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled
to be indemnified under this section or otherwise. The Corporation may, by
action of its Board, provide indemnification to employees and agents of the
Corporation with the same scope and effect as the foregoing indemnification
of directors and officers. 

   

 If a claim under the first paragraph of this Section is not paid in full by the Corporation within thirty (30) days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any Proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the General Corporation Law for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. 

   

 The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a Proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this Section shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, by-laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. 

   

 (3) The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any such expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the General Corporation Law. 

    

 (4) Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article VI shall not adversely affect any right or protection of any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Corporation is authorized to provide indemnification of (and advancement of expenses to) agents of the Corporation (and any other persons to whom Delaware law permits the Corporation to provide indemnification) through by-laws provisions, agreements with such agents or other persons, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, in excess of the indemnification and advancement otherwise permitted by Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, subject only to limits created by applicable Delaware law (statutory or non-statutory), with respect to actions for breach of duty to the Corporation, its stockholders and others. 

   ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE VII 

   

By-Laws 

   

 The directors of the Corporation shall have the power to adopt, amend or repeal by-laws. 

   

ARTICLE VIII 

   

Reorganization 

   

 Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between this Corporation and its creditors or any class of them and/or between this Corporation and its stockholders or any class of them, any court of equitable jurisdiction within the State of Delaware may, on the application in a summary way of this Corporation or of any creditor or stockholder thereof or on the application of any receiver or receivers appointed for this Corporation under the provisions of section 291 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code or on the application of trustees in dissolution or of any receiver or receivers appointed for this Corporation under the provisions of section 279 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code order a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of this Corporation, as the case may be, to be summoned in such manner as the said court directs. If a majority in number representing three-fourths in value of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of this Corporation, as the case may be, agree to any compromise or arrangement and to any reorganization of this Corporation as a consequence of such compromise or arrangement, the said compromise or arrangement and the said reorganization shall, if sanctioned by the court to which the said application has been made, be binding on all the creditors or class of creditors, and/or on all the stockholders or class of stockholders, of this Corporation, as the case may be, and also on this Corporation. 

   

ARTICLE IX 

   

Amendment 

   

 The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provisions contained in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by law, and all the provisions of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and all rights conferred on stockholders, directors and officers in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation are subject to this reserved power.

The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of  _nolo_ _contendere_ or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such persons conduct was unlawful. 

   #####

 (c) To the extent that any person described in Section 9.01(a) and (b) of these By-laws has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in said Sections, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith. 

  

 (d) Any indemnification under Section 9.01(a) and (b) of these By-laws (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of any person described in said Sections is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 9.01(a) and (b) of these By-laws. Such determination shall be made, with respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of such determination, (i) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or even if obtainable a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (3) by a committee of disinterested directors designated by a majority vote of the disinterested directors, even though less than a quorum, or (4) by the stockholders of the Corporation. 

  

 (e) Expenses incurred by an officer or director of the Corporation in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding shall be, and expenses incurred by a person other than a director or an officer of the Corporation in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding may be, paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding as authorized by the directors in the manner provided for in Section 9.01(d) of these By-laws upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of any person described in said Section to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation pursuant to this Article IX. 

  

 (f) The indemnification provided by this Article IX shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any by-laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or 

   ##### 

  

    

otherwise, both as to action in such persons official capacity and as to
action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as
to a person who has ceased to be director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and
administrators of such a person. Any repeal or amendment of any of
the provisions of this Article IX shall not adversely affect any right or
