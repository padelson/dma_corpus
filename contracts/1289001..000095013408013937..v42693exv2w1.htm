shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i)&nbsp;a letter of
transmittal specifying that delivery of the Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits

exchange for the Merger Consideration (such instructions shall include instructions for the payment
of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered on the transfer books of Company, subject to the receipt of appropriate
documentation for such transfer). Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate (or evidence
reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation of loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other
documents as may reasonably be requested by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefore the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled
to receive pursuant to this Article&nbsp;II, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled; <I>provided </I>that in no event will a holder of a Certificate be entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration if Merger Consideration was already paid with respect to the Shares underlying
such Certificate in connection with an affidavit of loss. No interest will be paid or accrued on
any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership
of Common Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of Company, payment may be issued
to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Common Shares is presented to
the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation
required to evidence and effect such transfer, and the Person requesting such issuance pays any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of such payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or establishes to the satisfaction of Parent and Company that such tax
has been paid or is not applicable. All cash paid upon the surrender of a Certificate in
accordance with the terms of this Section&nbsp;2.2 shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Common Shares formerly represented by such
Certificate.

into any agreement, understanding or arrangement providing for a Superior Proposal (a &#147;<U>Superior
Proposal Agreement</U>&#148;) and the Board shall not make a Change in Board Recommendation unless
(i)&nbsp;Company has provided Parent with a copy of the Superior Proposal Agreement and written notice
of the determination of the Board of Directors of Company that the Acquisition Proposal constitutes
a Superior Proposal promptly upon the Board of Directors of Company making such determination, and
(ii)&nbsp;Company has provided Parent with an opportunity, for a period of three&nbsp;(3) Business Days from
the date of delivery to Parent of the notice of its intention to enter into the Acquisition
Proposal (the &#147;<U>Notice Period</U>&#148;), to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby such that the Superior Proposal no longer
constitutes a Superior Proposal as determined by the Board of Directors of Company, acting in good
faith and in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties (the &#147;<U>Right to Match</U>&#148;). If
Parent exercises the Right to Match, then the Board of Directors of Company shall review in good
faith and in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties, in consultation with and after
receiving the advice of its financial advisors and independent legal counsel (who may be Company&#146;s
regularly engaged independent legal counsel), any such proposal by Parent to amend the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, including an
increase in, or modification of, the Merger Consideration, to determine whether the Superior
Proposal to which Parent is responding would be a Superior Proposal when assessed against the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby as they are proposed by Parent to be amended.
If the Board of Directors of Company determines that the amended terms and conditions of the
Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby proposed by Parent are at least as favorable to
Company&#146;s stockholders as the terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal, Company, Parent and
Merger Sub shall enter into an amended agreement reflecting Parent&#146;s proposed amendments to the
terms and conditions of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby and the Board of
Directors of Company shall not make a Change in Board Recommendation and shall not enter into a
Superior Proposal Agreement, but rather shall promptly reaffirm its recommendation of the Merger
and the transactions contemplated hereby, as so amended. In the event Parent does not exercise the
Right to Match or the Board of Directors of Company acting in good faith and in a manner consistent
with its fiduciary duties determines that the amended terms and conditions of the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby proposed by Parent are not at least as favorable to Company&#146;s
stockholders as the Superior Proposal, and therefore the Superior Proposal continues to be a
Superior Proposal, then Company shall terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section&nbsp;7.3 and
contemporaneously with such termination, Company shall pay the Fee and Expenses, both of which
shall occur prior to the execution of the Superior Proposal Agreement. Each successive amendment
to any Superior Proposal that results in an increase in, or modification of, the consideration (or
value of such consideration) to be received by the stockholders shall constitute a new Superior
Proposal for the purposes of this Section&nbsp;5.2(e) and Parent shall be afforded a new Notice Period
in respect of each such Superior Proposal which shall, however, be three (3)&nbsp;Business Days.

section or otherwise. The Corporation may, by action of its Board, provide indemnification to
employees and agents of the Corporation with the same scope and effect as the foregoing
indemnification of directors and officers.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a claim under the first paragraph of this Section is not paid in full by the Corporation
within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the claimant
may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the
claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the
expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action
brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any Proceeding in advance of its
final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the
Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under
the General Corporation Law for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed,
but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the
Corporation (including its Board, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a
determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is
proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth
in the General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its
Board, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable
standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has
not met the applicable standard of conduct.

right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of this Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, by-laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any
director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise against any such expense, liability or loss, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss
under the General Corporation Law.
</DIV>



<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article&nbsp;VI shall not
adversely affect any right or protection of any director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification. To the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law, the Corporation is authorized to provide indemnification of (and advancement of
expenses to) agents of the Corporation (and any other persons to whom Delaware law permits the
Corporation to provide indemnification) through by-laws provisions, agreements with such agents or
other persons, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, in excess of the
indemnification and advancement otherwise permitted by Section&nbsp;145 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, subject only to limits created by applicable Delaware law (statutory or
non-statutory), with respect to actions for breach of duty to the Corporation, its stockholders and
others.
