and the shares of the capital stock in LSBC, LSBE and Rotex
(collectively, "Purchased Assets"), owned by Sellers as of the
Closing Date, subject to the terms and conditions hereafter
specified.

     2.   Assumption of Liabilities.  Except liabilities that are
covered by insurance policies of Sellers (and not to include any
deductibles or retention amounts), and except for liabilities

Sellers, (c) environmental and superfund liabilities, (d) all
outstanding contracts and agreements, (e) indebtedness to LSB

Inventory consigned to Sellers.

     affecting the Purchased Assets, or any judgment, decree,
     order, statute or regulation to which the Sellers are
     subject.  This Agreement constitutes the valid and binding
     agreement of the Sellers enforceable against the Sellers in
     accordance with its terms.

          5.4       Employees.  Exhibit 5.4 attached hereto sets
     forth the names and positions of employees of Sellers as of
     the Closing Date.

          5.5       Compliance with Law.  All material licenses,
     certificates and permits necessary for the legal conduct of
     Sellers' business activities are valid and in full force and
     effect.

     6.   Representations and Warranties of Purchaser.

          6.1       Incorporation and Qualification.  Purchaser
     is a duly organized and existing limited liability company
     under the laws of the State of Oklahoma and has all power
     and the authority to enter into this Agreement and to carry
     out and perform the terms and provisions hereof.

          6.2       Authority to Consummate Transaction.  The
     execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and the
     consummation of the transaction contemplated hereby will
     not, violate any provisions of the Articles of Incorporation
     or Bylaws of Purchaser.  Purchaser has full power and
     authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to
     perform its obligations hereunder.  This Agreement
     constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of
     Purchaser enforceable and binding against Purchaser in
     accordance with its terms.

     any nature, legal or administrative, pending or threatened,
     against Purchaser.

          6.4       Insurance.  Exhibit 6.4 attached hereto
     contains a description of all insurance policies maintained
     by Sellers on their assets or business, including the
     insurance carrier, the type of coverage and the expiration
     dates of the current policies.

     Sellers and the Purchased Assets as requested by Purchaser,
     and that Purchaser has been given unlimited access to the
     facilities and the books and records of Sellers.

     7.   Sellers' Employees.   Sellers shall use reasonable
efforts to assist Purchaser, if requested, to obtain the services
of any employees listed on Exhibit 5.4 whom Purchaser desires to
employ.  Purchaser shall be liable for, and hereby indemnifies
Sellers for, all loss costs, damages and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees) incurred in connection with the
termination of employment of any employee by Seller or Purchaser

or the purchase by the Purchaser of the automotive parts business
of Sellers.  At the Closing Purchaser shall hire at least the
requisite number of employees of the Sellers at wages and
benefits essentially equivalent to their current compensation
package sufficient to avoid the applicability of the Workers
Adjustment and Retaining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. '2101, et
seq. ("WARN ACT").  In reliance thereon, the Sellers have
determined that the notification requirements of the WARN Act
will not be triggered by the termination of their employees.  In
the event that the Purchaser fails to employ the requisite number
of employees terminated by the Sellers at wages and benefits
essentially equivalent to their current compensation package
under terms sufficient to avoid applicability of the WARN Act as
a result of the Sellers' termination of their employees as
provided above, then, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, the Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Sellers and their officers, directors, agents,
representatives, shareholders and affiliates from and against any
and all liabilities, claims, demands, losses, damages, fines,
penalties, costs and expenses (including, without limitation,
reasonable attorney's fees) which any of them suffered or
incurred or may suffer or incur as a result of, or in connection
with, or arising out of the Sellers' failure to comply with, or
give notification under, the WARN Act.

     8.   "Run-off".  Purchaser shall promptly reimburse Sellers
for the full amount of all "run-off" claims connected but not
limited to any insurance program of whatever type and/or claims
connected to DriveLine's and Sellers' employees under the Self-
insured Workers' Compensation programs, health benefit plans,
disability programs, Section 125 Cafeteria plan, or life
insurance programs, whether such claims are incurred as active,
inactive or terminated employees.  For the purpose of this
Agreement, "run-off" shall mean any claim paid, in part or in
whole, on or after the Closing Date, regardless of when such
claim was incurred.  This is intended to include, without
limitation, claims resulting from COBRA elections.

     9.   No Brokerage.  Sellers shall indemnify Purchaser
against all loss, cost, damage, or expense, including attorney's
fees, incurred by Purchaser in any action based upon a claim by a
broker that Sellers have employed or otherwise engaged such
broker in connection with the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement; and, Purchaser shall indemnify Sellers against all
loss, cost, damage or expense, including attorney's fees,
incurred by Sellers in any action based upon the claim of a
broker that Purchaser has employed or otherwise engaged such
broker in connection with the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement.

     10.  Actions of Sellers After February 1, 2000 and Pending
Closing.  Sellers represent and warrant that from February 1,
2000 to the date of this Agreement, Sellers have conducted their
business only in the ordinary course of business and have not
taken any action proscribed in Section 9.1, except for the
acquisition of certain assets of The Zeller Corporation.  Sellers
covenant that from February 1, 2000 through the Closing Date:

          10.1      Conduct of Business.  Unless Purchaser shall

               (c)  Have in effect and maintain all insurance of
          the kind and in the amounts consistent with their
          normal business practices; and
               (d)  Maintain their assets on a basis consistent
          with that prevailing generally in the industry or trade
          and as required by good business practice.

          10.2      Availability of Books and Records.  Sellers
     shall make available for inspection by Purchaser, its
     agents, accountants and attorneys, at reasonable times, all
     of their assets, books and records of accounts, contracts
     and other information, documentary or otherwise, as is
     appropriate to provide to Purchaser all pertinent
     information pertaining to or affecting the Purchased Assets.

     information so obtained and any document or instrument
     heretofore or hereafter obtained by Purchaser in connection

     are not consummated for any reason, then after the Agreement
     is terminated, Purchaser will continue to hold in confidence
     all information obtained from Sellers and will return to
     Sellers all copies of any documents or instruments obtained
     by Purchaser from Sellers in connection with the
     transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

          10.3      Notice of Material Events.  Sellers shall
     promptly give Purchaser notice of the occurrence of any
     material event relating to the Purchased Assets or the
     occurrence of any event or change in facts, which cause any
     of the representations made by Sellers in this Agreement to
     be inaccurate in any material respect.

     11.  Possession and Risks of Loss.  Possession or the right
