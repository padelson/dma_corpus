Purchase Agreement. Subject to the last sentence of <U>Section&nbsp;6.4(c)</U>, without the prior
written consent of the other party, prior to the Effective Time each of Parent and the Company
shall not, and shall cause its respective Affiliates not to, enter into any agreement, arrangement

affects Parent&#146;s rights and obligations; it being understood and agreed that any amendment,
modification or waiver which (A)&nbsp;decreases the price paid by the Intel Buyer for the Intel
Business, (B)&nbsp;materially increases the conditionality of the closing of the Intel Transaction
(including with respect to the related acquisition financing, if any), (C)&nbsp;increases the potential
liability of such transaction to Parent or the Post-Sale Company (including through a modification
to Section&nbsp;9.2 or 9.3 of the Intel Purchase Agreement) or (D)&nbsp;amends, modifies or waives Section
6.10, Annex A, 6.12, 6.16 or 6.17 of the Intel Purchase Agreement or materially amends or modifies
Section&nbsp;2.3 of the Intel Purchase Agreement, in each case, shall be deemed, without exclusion of
other amendments, modifications or waivers, to materially and adversely affect Parent&#146;s rights and
obligations, or (ii)&nbsp;terminate the Intel Purchase Agreement by the mutual written agreement of the
Company and Intel Buyer. Subject to the foregoing, the Company shall deliver promptly to Parent
copies of all amendments, modifications and waivers to the Intel Purchase Agreement.

converted into domestic limited liability companies without requiring novation, third party
consents or otherwise adversely impacting customer relationships (&#147;<U>Conversion-Eligible

Conversion-Eligible Subsidiaries specified in such request to limited liability companies,
provided, that Parent shall be liable for the payment of any and all costs or expenses related to
the conversion of the Conversion-Eligible Subsidiaries into limited liability companies, and shall
remit such payment to the Company prior to any such conversion. In no event shall the Company be
required to effect any such conversion prior to one day before the Effective Time. In the event
that a conversion is effected, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, refrain from
making any election under Treasury Regulation&nbsp;Section&nbsp;301.7701-3 to treat the resulting domestic
limited liability company as an association taxable as a corporation.

for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The information that the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
be required to provide to the Basis Study Firm shall be governed by <U>Section&nbsp;6.3</U>, and solely
for purposes of the application of <U>Section&nbsp;6.3</U> to the provision of information to the Basis
Study Firm, the Basis Study Firm shall be deemed to be a &#147;Representative&#148; of Parent. The Basis
Study Firm shall be directed to provide its final report, and any interim drafts of such report, to
each of the Company and Parent. Parent shall pay the costs, fees and expenses of the Basis Study
Firm under the terms of the engagement contemplated by this <U>Section&nbsp;6.20</U>. The engagement
letter with the Basis Study Firm shall not impose any completion date on the Company that is
related to the Basis Study Firm&#146;s work thereunder, and in no event shall the Closing be impeded or
delayed as a result of the timing of the completion of the Basis Study Firm&#146;s work thereunder.

or the Company shall have failed to perform its obligations under this Agreement, then the party
seeking to enforce this Agreement against such nonperforming party under this Agreement shall be
entitled to specific performance and the issuance of immediate injunctive and other equitable
relief without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy, and the
parties further agree to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in
connection with the obtaining of any such injunctive or other equitable relief, this being in
addition to and not in limitation of any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in
equity. Without limiting the foregoing, each of the parties hereby acknowledges and agrees that it
may be difficult to prove damages with reasonable certainty, that it may be difficult to procure
suitable substitute performance, and that injunctive relief and/or specific performance will not
cause an undue hardship to the parties. Each of the parties hereby further acknowledges and agrees
that the existence of any other remedy contemplated by this Agreement shall not diminish the
availability of specific performance of the obligations hereunder or any other injunctive relief
and agrees that in the event of any action by the other party for specific performance or
injunctive relief, it will not assert that a remedy at Law or other remedy would be adequate or
that specific performance or injunctive relief in respect of such breach or violation should not be
available on the grounds that money damages are adequate or any other grounds. Any such remedies,
and any and all other remedies provided for in this Agreement, shall be cumulative in nature and
not exclusive and shall be in addition to any other remedies whatsoever which any party may
otherwise have.

binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective
permitted successors and assigns.
