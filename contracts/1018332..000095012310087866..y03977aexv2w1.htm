 (e) Any portion of the Consideration Fund (including any interest from or the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the applicable former stockholders of the Company nine (9) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation.

 (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Paying Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable to any Person in respect of cash from the Consideration Fund

escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall not have
been surrendered prior to the date on which any Merger Consideration in
respect thereof would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration in respect of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, and any holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share who has not theretofore complied with this
_Article III_ with respect thereto shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration in
respect thereof (if any). 

   

 (g) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact (such affidavit shall be in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Paying Agent) by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if required by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable and customary amount as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which such Person is entitled in respect of such Certificate pursuant to this _Article III_. 

   

 (h) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all steps reasonably necessary to cause the transactions contemplated hereby and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company in connection with this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

each trust or other funding arrangement, (ii) each summary plan description
and summary of material modifications, (iii) the most recently filed annual
report on IRS Form 5500 and all schedules thereto and (iv) the most recently
received IRS determination letter.

Nothing has occurred since the most recent determination or opinion letter or application therefor relating to any such Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualification or exemption or the imposition of any liability, penalty or tax under ERISA or the Code. 

   

 (d) With respect to each Foreign Plan, except as would not reasonably be expected to result in a material liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole:

   ##### 

  

    

actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine
employer contributions to such Foreign Plan and no transaction contemplated
by this Agreement shall cause such assets or insurance obligations to be less
than such benefit obligations; and 

   

 (iii) each Foreign Plan required to be registered has been registered and has been maintained in good standing with applicable regulatory authorities. 

  

 (e) No material liability under Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code has been incurred by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate that has not been satisfied in full.

      ##### 

  

    

under applicable Law; _provided_ that (x) prior to furnishing any material
nonpublic information, the Company receives from such Person an executed
confidentiality agreement containing terms that are not materially less
favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement (it being understood and agreed that such confidentiality agreement
need not restrict the making of Acquisition Proposals (and related
communications) to the Company or the Companys Board of Directors, and shall
contain provisions that expressly permit the Company to comply with the
provisions of this _Section 6.4_); provided that such
confidentiality agreement may not include any provision calling for an
exclusive right to negotiate with the Company; and (y) any such material
nonpublic information so furnished has been previously provided to Parent or
is provided to Parent substantially concurrently with it being so furnished to
such Person or its Representatives. The Company shall provide Parent with a

ensure that its Representatives are aware of the provisions of this _Section
6.4(b)_. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation

or disclosing a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 or 14e-2(a) under the
Exchange Act, or otherwise making disclosure to comply with applicable Law;
provided, that any such disclosure that constitutes a Change in
Recommendation shall be subject to _Section 6.4(c)_ (it being agreed that a
"stop, look and listen" communication by the Board of Directors to the
Companys stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or a
factually accurate public statement by the Company that describes the
Companys receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this
Agreement with respect thereto shall not be deemed to be a Change
in Recommendation).

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company may make a Change in Recommendation if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors) that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under

applicable Law either (i) based only upon any fact, event, circumstance,
development or change that is unknown to the Companys Board of Directors as
of the date hereof but becomes known prior to the Company Special Meeting (or
if known, the magnitude or consequences of which were not reasonably
foreseeable by the Companys Board of Directors as of the date hereof) (an "
_Intervening Event_ "), or (ii) if the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal and
financial advisors) that the Company has received an Acquisition Proposal
which constitutes a Superior Proposal; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no
Change in Recommendation may be made (A) until after the fifth (5th) Business
Day following Parents receipt of written notice from the Company advising
Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company intends to make a Change in
Recommendation (a " _Notice of Adverse Recommendation_ ") and specifying the
reasons therefor, including, if the basis of the proposed action by the
Companys Board of Directors is (x) an Intervening Event, details of
such event or (y) a Superior Proposal, the terms and conditions of any such
Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the
financial terms or any other material term of such Superior Proposal shall
require a new Notice of Adverse Recommendation and a new five (5)
Business Day period) and (B) _provided_ , that, during the five (5) Business
Day period following the date of receipt of the Notice of Adverse
Recommendation, if requested by Parent, the Company shall engage in good-
faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that
(v) the Intervening Event is no longer a basis for a Change in Recommendation
or (w) the Acquisition Proposal that was determined to constitute a Superior
Proposal is no longer a Superior Proposal, as applicable. Any Notice of
Adverse Recommendation shall be accompanied by a copy of the most current
version of any written agreement (or draft thereof) relating to the
transaction that constitutes the related Superior Proposal. In determining
whether to make a Change in Recommendation or in determining whether an
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors
of the Company shall take into account any changes to the terms of
this Agreement proposed by Parent (which changes may be based on changes to
the terms of the Intel Purchase Agreement proposed by Intel Buyer) in
response to a Notice of Adverse Recommendation or otherwise. Notwithstanding
any other provisions of this Agreement, in the event Parent receives a Notice
of Adverse Recommendation, Parent may, during such five (5) Business Day
period, engage in discussions with the Intel Buyer with respect to
modifications to the Intel Purchase Agreement related to such good faith
negotiations with Parent and enter into any agreement, arrangement
or understanding in furtherance thereof provided that such agreement,
arrangement or understanding is not materially adverse to the Company; it
being understood and agreed that any agreement, arrangement or understanding
which limits or impairs the ability of the Intel Buyer to engage
in discussions with or provide information to any Person shall be deemed
materially adverse to the Company. 

   

 (d) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this _Section 6.4_, the Company shall promptly advise Parent in writing of any Acquisition Proposal, and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt, if any proposal, offer or inquiry is received by, any information is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company in respect of any Acquisition Proposal (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the Person making any such proposal, offer or inquiry and the terms and conditions thereof (and shall include with such notice copies of any written materials received from or on behalf of such Person relating to any Acquisition Proposal). The Company shall (i) keep Parent promptly and reasonably informed of all material developments 

      ##### 

  

    

affecting the status and material details (including any material change to
the terms thereof) of any such Acquisition Proposal and any discussions and
negotiations concerning the material terms and conditions thereof and (ii)
provide to Parent as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof
copies of all material written correspondence relating to any such Acquisition
Proposal exchanged between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and the Person making the proposal, offer, inquiry or request, on the
other hand. 

   

 Section 6.5 _Employee Benefits_. 

  

 (a) For eighteen (18) months following the Effective Time, subject to any requirements imposed by local Law, Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) to, provide to those individuals who are employed by the Post-Sale Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") and who remain in the employment of the Surviving Corporation (i) base salary or hourly wage rates that, on an individual-by-individual basis, are no less favorable than those provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time (ii) total incentive compensation opportunities (excluding any (A) equity or equity-based compensation opportunities and (B) retention and other incentives implemented in connection with the Transactions) that, on an individual-by-individual basis, are no less favorable than the total incentive compensation opportunities (excluding any (A) equity or equity-based compensation opportunities, except to the extent deemed appropriate by Parent, and (B) retention and other incentives implemented in connection with the Transactions) available to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (iii) employee benefits (excluding defined benefit and other pension plans) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits (excluding defined benefit and other pension plans) provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall have no obligation to provide equity based incentives or defined benefit or other pension plans to the Continuing Employees following the Effective Time. Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) to, cause any employee benefit plans covering any of the Continuing Employees following the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Post-Closing Plans_ ") to recognize the service of each Continuing Employee (to the extent such service was recognized by the Company and its Affiliates under Benefit Plans) for all purposes of vesting, eligibility and benefit entitlement (but excluding benefit accruals), except to the extent such service credit would result in a duplication of benefits for the same period. Parent shall cause each Post-Closing Plan to waive pre-existing condition limitations to the extent waived or not applicable under the analogous Benefit Plan, and Parent shall cause the Continuing Employees to be given credit under the applicable Post-Closing Plan for amounts paid prior to the Effective Time during the year in which the Effective Time occurs under a corresponding Benefit Plan during the same period for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Post-Closing Plan. 

   

 (b) Parent and the Company hereby agree that the occurrence of the Effective Time shall constitute a "Change in Control" for purposes of all Benefit Plans in which the term is relevant. 

   

 (c) For eighteen (18) months following the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) to, 

      ##### 

  

    

pay to any Continuing Employee whose service with Parent and its Affiliates is
terminated during such eighteen (18) month period severance benefits that are
no less favorable than those provided to such Continuing Employee under the
terms of the Company severance plan or program in which such individual is
eligible to participate as of the date hereof. 

   

 (d) Following the date hereof, Parent and the Company shall cooperate, and the Company shall take all actions reasonably requested by Parent, on or prior to December 31, 2010, as are necessary to reduce and/or avoid the application of Section 280G of the Code to the payments to be made to the individuals whose names are set forth on _Section 6.5(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ (which actions may include, for example, accelerating the vesting or payment of equity awards or accelerating the payment of 2010 bonuses); provided, that in determining whether a Parent request is reasonable, the Company shall take into account potential material financial effects on the executives as well as the Companys ability to retain the executives in the event the Closing does not occur. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of this Agreement shall (i) create any right in any employee to continued employment by Parent, the Company, the Post-Sale Company, the Surviving Corporation or any respective Subsidiary thereof, or preclude the ability of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any respective Subsidiary thereof to terminate the employment of any employee for any reason or (ii) require Parent, the Company, the Post-Sale Company, the Surviving Corporation, or any respective Subsidiary thereof, to continue any Benefit Plan or prevent the amendment, modification, or termination thereof in accordance with plan terms after the Closing Date. 

   

 (f) This _Section 6.5_ shall be binding upon and shall inure solely to the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 6.5_, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 6.5_ or is intended to be, shall constitute or be construed as an amendment to or modification of any employee benefit plan, program, arrangement or policy of Parent, the Company, the Post-Sale Company, the Surviving Corporation or any respective Subsidiary thereof. 

   

 (g) Immediately following the Closing, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to terminate the employment of the individuals listed on _Section 6.5(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_. Parent agrees that such terminations shall be treated as terminations of employment by the Surviving Corporation without "cause" for purposes of the employment agreements entered into between the Company and such individuals. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay each such individual all amounts contemplated for payment to such individual by his or her employment agreement, in each case in the manner and as determined by the terms of his or her employment agreement in effect on the date hereof, and in each case consistent with the methodologies utilized by the Company in the calculations previously delivered by the Company to Parent on September 14, 2010. 

   

 Section 6.6 _Publicity_. Neither the Company nor Parent (nor any of their respective Affiliates) shall issue any press release or make any public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior agreement of the other party (and none of Parent or its Affiliates shall issue or make any press release or other 

   ##### 

  

 

public announcement with respect to the Intel Purchase Agreement or the Intel
Transaction without the prior agreement of the Company). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, with respect to any communications to be delivered orally,
including by conference call or webcast, this _Section 6.6_ shall be deemed
satisfied if, to the extent practicable, the disclosing party gives
advance notice of such disclosure to the other party, including copies of any
talking points, scripts or similar documents, and consults with the other
party and considers in good faith any comments by such other party with
respect thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , the prior agreement of the other
party shall be required with respect to such disclosures to the extent that
the non-disclosing party reasonably determines that any such disclosure would
be materially adverse to the non-disclosing party. Notwithstanding the
foregoing sentences of this _Section 6.6_, (i) each party shall be permitted
to issue any press release or make any public announcement or disclosure as
provided by this Agreement or as may be required by Law or by any listing
agreement with a national securities exchange, in which case the party
proposing to issue such press release or make such public announcement or
disclosure shall use its reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with the
other party before making any such public announcements, and (ii) either party
may make any oral or written public announcements, releases or statements
without complying with the foregoing procedures if the substance of such
announcements, releases or statements was publicly disclosed and previously
subject to the foregoing requirements for agreement and/or consultation and
consideration. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company will no longer be
required to consult with Parent in connection with any such press release or
public announcement if the Companys Board of Directors has effected any
Change in Recommendation or shall have resolved to do so. 

   

 Section 6.7 _Directors  and Officers Insurance and Indemnification_. 

  

 (a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and indemnification for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with the Transactions), now existing in favor of the Company Indemnified Parties as provided in the organizational documents of the Company or its Subsidiaries or in any Contract, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, accurate and complete copies of which (or forms thereof) have been provided to Parent (except as provided herein), shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. Parent shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) (A) indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and advance expenses to DandO Indemnified Parties with respect to all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such at any time prior to the Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with the Transactions), to the fullest extent that the Company or its Subsidiaries would be permitted by applicable Law and (B) indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and advance expenses to Company Indemnified Parties with respect to all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such at any time prior to the Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with the Transactions) to the fullest extent required by the organizational documents of the Company or its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that in the case of clauses (A) and (B), the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides a customary undertaking to repay such advances if it is finally determined that such Person was not entitled to indemnification with respect to the applicable act or omission. Parent shall cause the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and limitation of 

      ##### 

  

    

director, officer, member of board of managers and employee liability that are
no less favorable to the Company Indemnified Parties than those set forth in
the Companys and its Subsidiaries organizational documents as of the date
of this Agreement, which provisions thereafter shall not be amended, repealed
or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of the Company Indemnified Parties, unless such modification shall
be required by applicable Law. 

   

 (b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 6.7(a)_, to the fullest extent that the Company would be permitted by applicable Law to do so, Parent shall (and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to): (i) indemnify and hold harmless each DandO Indemnified Party against and from any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains to: (A) any action or omission or alleged action or omission taken or not taken in such DandO Indemnified Partys capacity as a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time; or (B) this Agreement, the Intel Purchase Agreement and any of the Transactions; and (ii) pay in advance of the final disposition of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation the reasonable expenses (including attorneys fees) of any DandO Indemnified Party upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such DandO Indemnified Party to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such DandO Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without Parents or the Surviving Corporations prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 6.7(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, Parent shall not (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to) settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all of the DandO Indemnified Parties covered by the claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. 

   

 (c) Parent shall provide or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for a period of not less than six (6) years after the Effective Time, the DandO Indemnified Parties who are insured under the Companys directors and officers insurance and indemnification policies (a correct and complete copy of which has been made available to Parent) with insurance and indemnification policies, or "tail policies," in each case, that provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is no less favorable than the existing policies of the Company or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance (or an amount for any such "tail policy") in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the last annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance prior to the date hereof; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage (or cost of such tail policy) exceed such amount, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain policies (or a "tail policy") with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount. The DandO Indemnified Parties may be required to make reasonable application and provide reasonable and 

      ##### 

  

    

customary representations and warranties to applicable insurance carriers for
the purpose of obtaining such insurance. 

   

 (d) The DandO Indemnified Parties and Company Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section 6.7_ applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.7_. The provisions of this _Section 6.7_ are intended to be for the benefit of each DandO Indemnified Party and Company Indemnified Party and his or her successors, heirs or representatives. Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any DandO Indemnified Party or Company Indemnified Party in enforcing its indemnity and other rights under this _Section 6.7_. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this _Section 6.7_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation, and shall be enforceable by the DandO Indemnified Parties and Company Indemnified Parties and their successors, heirs or representatives. In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or merger, or transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.7_. 

   

 (f) From and after the Closing, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor the director and officer litigation reimbursement policy in effect as of the date hereof, a copy of which is set forth in _Section 6.7(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_. 

   

 Section 6.8 _Company Special Meeting; Proxy Statement_. 

  

 (a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare with Parent and file with the SEC a preliminary Proxy Statement and furnish the information required to be provided to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to the DGCL and any other applicable Laws. The Company shall use its reasonable efforts to respond to any comments of the SEC or its staff and cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the stockholders of the Company as soon as reasonably practicable after the Proxy Statement has been cleared by the SEC for mailing to the stockholders of the Company. Each of the Company and Parent shall supply such information specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement necessary so that, at the date it is first mailed to the Companys stockholders or at the time of the Company Special Meeting, the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Each of the parties hereto shall use their reasonable efforts so that the Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to Parent or the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors should become known to Parent or the Company which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy 

      ##### 

  

    

Statement, so that such document would not include any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. The
Company agrees to provide Parent and its counsel any comments or
communications, whether written or oral, that the Company or its counsel may
receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Proxy Statement promptly after receipt of such comments or communications.
Prior to the filing or mailing of the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC or its staff
with respect thereto, Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such document or any proposed responses
to such comments or communications, and the Company shall give due
consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by Parent and its counsel. 

   

 (b) The Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC for mailing to the stockholders of the Company, in accordance with applicable Law and its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of the Companys stockholders (including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the " _Company Special Meeting_ ") for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval. The Companys obligations pursuant to this _Section 6.8_ shall not be diminished or otherwise affected by (i) the receipt, disclosure or commencement of any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal) or (ii) any proposed or actual change, qualification, withdrawal or modification of the Company Board Recommendation. 

   

 (c) The Company shall, through the Board of Directors of the Company (in the case of clauses (i) and (ii)), but subject to the right to make a Change in Recommendation in accordance with  _Section 6.4_, (i) recommend to the stockholders of the Company that such stockholders adopt this Agreement and give the Company Stockholder Approval (the " _Company Board Recommendation_ "), (ii) include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and (iii) use reasonable best efforts to solicit the Company Stockholder Approval. If there shall have been a Change in Recommendation, the Company shall nevertheless submit this Agreement and the Merger to a vote of its stockholders, and the Proxy Statement and any and all accompanying materials (including, if the Change in Recommendation occurs after the mailing of the Proxy Statement to stockholders of the Company, the proxy card, which shall provide that signed proxies which do not specify the manner in which the Shares subject thereto are to be voted shall be voted "FOR" adopting this Agreement) shall be identical in form and content to proxy materials that would have been prepared by the Company had no Change in Recommendation been made, except for appropriate changes to the disclosure in the Proxy Statement stating that such Change in Recommendation has been made and, if applicable, describing matters relating to the Superior Proposal or Intervening Event giving rise to the Change in Recommendation to the extent required by applicable Law, and provided that the Company shall not be obligated to recommend to its stockholders the adoption of this Agreement or the approval of the Merger at the Company Special Meeting if the Board of Directors of the Company shall have made a Change in 

      ##### 

  

    

Recommendation in accordance with _Section 6.4_. Prior to any Change in
Recommendation, the Company shall provide Parent with such information with
respect to the solicitation of the Company Stockholder Approval as Parent may
reasonably request. 

   

 Section 6.9 _Appropriate Actions_. 

  

 (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall (and shall cause their applicable Subsidiaries to) use its respective reasonable best efforts promptly to (i) take, or to cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or to cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to consummate and make effective the Transactions in the most expeditious manner practicable; (ii) obtain from any Governmental Entities any actions, non-actions, clearances, waivers, consents, approvals, permits or orders required to be obtained by the Company or Parent or any of their Subsidiaries in connection with the authorization, execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; (iii) make all registrations, filings, notifications or submissions (" _Filings_ ") (in each case, promptly after the date of this Agreement) which are necessary or advisable, and thereafter promptly make any other required submissions and responses, with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement including (A) those required under the HSR Act and such other foreign antitrust, competition or merger control Law, as listed on  _Annex A_ (except as otherwise agreed by the parties, such Filings under the HSR Act shall be made no later than ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, and such foreign Filings shall be made no later than twenty (20) Business Days after the date of this Agreement), except any foreign Filings that must be filed by an earlier date (B) the actions with respect to CFIUS and FOCI mitigation described in _Section 6.9(c)_, and (C) Filings required under any other applicable Law, including submission of notification of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the United States Department of State at least sixty (60) days in advance of Closing pursuant to 22 C.F.R. § 122.4(b); (iv) furnish all information reasonably required for any Filings to be made pursuant to any applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (v) act in good faith and reasonably cooperate with the other parties in connection with any Filings (including to provide copies of all such Filings to outside counsel for the non-filing party and, if requested by the other party, to consider in good faith all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested by the other party); (vi) keep the other party informed in all material respects of any material communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, any Governmental Entity and of any material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case, relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (vii) provide the other parties prior notice of any communication with, and any proposed understanding, undertaking or agreement with, any Governmental Entity regarding any Filings; (viii) consult and cooperate with each other party in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party in connection with proceedings relating to or arising out of the Filings; (ix) not participate independently in any meeting, primarily relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and involving any substantive conversation, with any Governmental Entity in respect of any such Filings or any investigations or other inquiries relating thereto without giving the other parties prior notice of the meeting or conversation and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend or participate; (x) obtain all necessary consents, 

      #####

the Company, Parent or Merger Sub shall be required to make any payments to
any such third parties or concede anything of value to obtain such consents,
approvals or waivers); (xi) avoid the entry of, or have vacated or
terminated, any decree, order, or judgment that would restrain, prevent or

Other Facilities pursuant to Section 2-110 of the NISPOM, (C) receive written

the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby at the behest of any
Governmental Entity without the consent of the other parties to

subsequent refiling thereof by a party shall require the consent of the other
party. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding _Section 6.9(a)_, or any other provision of this Agreement, the Company shall not, without Parents prior written consent, commit to any divestiture transaction or, subject to the terms of _Section 6.9(c)_, agree to any restriction on its business, and nothing in this _Section 6.9_ shall (i) limit any applicable rights a party may have to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_ so long as such party has up to then complied in all material respects with its obligations under this _Section 6.9_, or (ii) require Parent to offer, accept or agree to (A) sell, divest, dispose of, or, subject to the terms of _Section 6.9(c)_, hold separate any part of its or the Companys businesses, operations, assets or product lines (or a combination of Parents and the Companys respective businesses, operations, assets or product lines), (B) not compete in any geographic area or line of business, and/or (C) subject to the terms of _Section 6.9(c)_, restrict the manner in which, or whether, Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates may carry on business in any part of the world. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Parent and/or Merger Sub shall not be required to agree to sell, divest, dispose of or, subject to the terms of _Section 6.9(c)_, hold separate any assets or businesses, or, subject to the terms of _Section 6.9(c)_, otherwise take or commit to take any action that could reasonably be expected to limit its freedom of action with respect to, or ability to retain, one or more of the Companys businesses, product lines or assets. 

   

 (c) In connection with and without limiting anything in this Agreement, as soon as practicable after the date hereof, Parent and the Company shall prepare, prefile and file with CFIUS a joint voluntary notice of the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to Exon-Florio. Parent and the Company shall each, to their fullest ability, provide CFIUS with any additional or supplemental information requested by CFIUS or its member agencies during the Exon-Florio review process. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this _Section 6.9(c)_, Parent and the Company, in cooperation with each other, shall each use 

      ##### 

  

    

reasonable best efforts to take all steps advisable, necessary or desirable to
finally and successfully complete the Exon-Florio review process as promptly
as practicable and to make any and all commercially reasonable undertakings
necessary to obtain a written notification issued by CFIUS that it has
concluded its review (or, if CFIUS deems a forty-five (45) day investigation
necessary, its investigation) and determined that there are no unresolved
national security concerns with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby so as to enable the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event, with the
consummation of the Merger to occur no later than the Termination Date). In
addition, as soon as practicable after the date hereof, the Company shall
prepare and submit to the DSS of the United States Department of Defense ("
_DoD_ ") and, to the extent applicable, any other agency of the United States
Government, notification of the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to
the NISPOM and any other applicable national or industrial security
regulations, and the Company shall fully cooperate with Parent in requesting
from DSS approval to operate the business of the Company, located in
Arlington, Virginia, pursuant to a FOCI mitigation arrangement in accordance
with the NISPOM and the remainder of the Companys business free of any such
NISPOM mitigation arrangement. Such cooperation by the Company shall include
using its reasonable best efforts to novate or terminate each 6.9(a)(1)
Contract. The Company, Parent, and Merger Sub each agrees to take any and all
commercially reasonable steps, including agreeing to actions, restrictions or
conditions proposed by CFIUS or any other agency or branch of the U.S.
Government, including the DoD, as a condition to obtaining CFIUS and DoD
approval for the transactions contemplated hereby on the terms above. 

   

 (d) The Company and its Board of Directors shall (i) use their commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if any state takeover statute or similar statute becomes applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use their commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Parent shall take all actions necessary to (a) cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform promptly their respective obligations under this Agreement, (b) cause Merger Sub to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and (c) ensure that, prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall not conduct any business, make any investments or incur or guarantee any indebtedness, other than consummating the Merger pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 Section 6.11 _No Control of Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys or its Subsidiaries operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

The inclusion of any item in the Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to be an admission or evidence of materiality of such item, nor shall it establish any standard of materiality for any purpose whatsoever.

Delivery of an executed signature page to this Agreement by electronic transmission shall be as effective as delivery of a manually signed counterpart of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 9.6 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure Schedule and the exhibits hereto, together with the other instruments referred to herein), the Confidentiality Agreement and, when referenced herein, the Intel Purchase Agreement (a) constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and (b) are not intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that it is specifically intended that (A) the DandO Indemnified Parties and Company Indemnified Parties (with respect to _Section 6.7_ from and after the Effective Time) and (B) the Companys stockholders and holders of Company Options, Restricted Stock Awards, Company Deferred Stock Units and Company Warrants (with respect to their rights under _Article III_ of this Agreement from and after the Effective Time) are third-party beneficiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the first sentence of paragraph 3 of the Co-Buyer Disclosure Agreement (which amends the Confidentiality Agreement) shall be superseded by this Agreement. 

  

 Section 9.7 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void, 

   ##### 

  

 

unenforceable or against its regulatory policy, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated and
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible. 

   

 Section 9.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of laws provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. 

  

 Section 9.9 _Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto hereby (a) expressly and irrevocably submits to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery, any other court of the State of Delaware or any Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the Transactions, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions in any court other than the Delaware Court of Chancery, any other court of the State of Delaware or any Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware and (d) agrees that each of the other parties shall have the right to bring any action or proceeding for enforcement of a judgment entered by the Delaware Court of Chancery, any other court of the State of Delaware or any Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees that a final judgment in any action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. 

  

 Section 9.10 _Service of Process_. Each party irrevocably consents to the service of process outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in _Section 9.9_ in any such action or proceeding by mailing copies thereof by registered or certified United States mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to its address as specified in or pursuant to  _Section 9.3_. However, the foregoing shall not limit the right of a party to effect service of process on the other party by any other legally available method. 

  

 Section 9.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, MERGER SUB OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT. 

  

 Section 9.12 _Specific Performance_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, the parties agree that immediate, extensive and irreparable damage would occur for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are 

   ##### 

  

 

otherwise breached. Accordingly, the parties agree that, if for any reason
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall have failed to perform its
obligations under this Agreement, then the party seeking to enforce this
Agreement against such nonperforming party under this Agreement shall
be entitled to specific performance and the issuance of immediate injunctive
and other equitable relief without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of
money damages as a remedy, and the parties further agree to waive any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the
obtaining of any such injunctive or other equitable relief, this being
in addition to and not in limitation of any other remedy to which they are
entitled at Law or in equity. Without limiting the foregoing, each of the
parties hereby acknowledges and agrees that it may be difficult to prove
damages with reasonable certainty, that it may be difficult to
procure suitable substitute performance, and that injunctive relief and/or
specific performance will not cause an undue hardship to the parties. Each of
the parties hereby further acknowledges and agrees that the existence of any
other remedy contemplated by this Agreement shall not diminish
the availability of specific performance of the obligations hereunder or any
other injunctive relief and agrees that in the event of any action by the
other party for specific performance or injunctive relief, it will not assert
that a remedy at Law or other remedy would be adequate or that specific
performance or injunctive relief in respect of such breach or violation should
not be available on the grounds that money damages are adequate or any other
grounds. Any such remedies, and any and all other remedies provided for in
this Agreement, shall be cumulative in nature and not exclusive and shall be
in addition to any other remedies whatsoever which any party may otherwise
have. 

   

 Section 9.13 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties; _provided_ , that Parent and Merger Sub may assign their rights and obligations pursuant to this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent so long as Parent continues to remain primarily liable for all of such rights and obligations. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns. 

  

 Section 9.14 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such costs and expenses, whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, provided that Parent shall pay all costs and expenses in connection with the filings of the notification and report forms under the HSR Act in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the notice to CFIUS of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to Exon-Florio. Other than Taxes imposed upon a holder of Shares, Company Options, Restricted Stock Awards, Company Deferred Stock Units or Company Warrants, Parent shall pay all Taxes incident to preparing for, entering into and carrying out this Agreement (including (i) transfer, stamp and documentary Taxes or fees and (ii) sales, use, gains, real property transfer and other or similar Taxes or fees). For the avoidance of doubt, none of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall be responsible for the payment of income Taxes imposed upon a holder of Shares which result from the transactions contemplated herein. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 9.15 _Waivers_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any failure of any of the parties to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition herein may be waived at any time prior to the Effective Time by the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the party expressly granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

If there be no such quorum, the holders of a majority of such shares so present or represented may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without further notice, until a quorum shall have been obtained.

 SECTION 1. _Certificates; Signatures_. The shares of the Corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the Board of Directors of the Corporation may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock shall be uncertificated shares.

Notwithstanding the adoption of such a resolution by the Board of Directors, every holder of stock represented by certificates and upon request every holder of uncertificated shares shall be entitled to have a certificate, signed by or in the name of the Corporation by the Chairman or Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors, or the President or Vice-President, and by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer, or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation, representing the number of shares registered in certificate form. Any and all signatures on any such certificate may be facsimiles. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if he were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.

 SECTION 2. _Transfers of Stock_.

 The Board of Directors shall have power and authority to make all such rules and regulations as it may deem expedient concerning the issue, transfer and registration of certificates representing shares of the Corporation. 

  

 SECTION 4. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. The Corporation may issue a new certificate of stock in place of any certificate, theretofore issued by it, alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and the Board of Directors may require the owner of any lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or his legal representative, to give the

 SECTION 1. _Bank Accounts and Drafts_. In addition to such bank accounts as may be authorized by the Board of Directors, the primary financial officer or any person designated by said primary financial officer, whether or not an employee of the Corporation, may authorize such bank accounts to be opened or maintained in the name and on behalf of the Corporation as he may deem necessary or appropriate, payments from such bank accounts to be made upon and according to the check of the Corporation in accordance with the written instructions of said primary financial officer, or other person so designated by the Treasurer.

ARTICLE XIII 

   

 _Indemnification_  

  

 The Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by and in accordance with Section 145 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, as that Section may be amended and supplemented from time to time, indemnify any director, officer or trustee which it shall have power to indemnify under that Section against any expenses, liabilities or other matters referred to in or covered by that Section; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not require the Corporation to indemnify or advance expenses to any person in connection with any action, suit, proceeding, claim or counterclaim initiated by or on behalf of such person. The Corporation may, in the discretion of the Board of Directors, indemnify to the fullest extent permitted by and in accordance with Section 145 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, as that Section may be amended and supplemented from time to time, any other employee or agent of the Corporation (i.e., an employee or agent who is not a director, officer or trustee of the Corporation) which it shall have power to indemnify under that Section against any expenses, liabilities or other matters referred to in or covered by that Section. The indemnification provided for in this Article (i) shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those indemnified may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement or vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in their official capacities and as to action in another capacity while holding such office or position, (ii) shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, trustee, or other employee or agent and (iii) shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. The Corporations obligation to provide indemnification under this Article shall be offset to the extent of any other source of indemnification or any otherwise applicable insurance coverage under a policy maintained by the Corporation or any other person. 

  

 To assure indemnification under this Article of all such persons who are determined by the Corporation or otherwise to be or to have been "fiduciaries" of any employee benefit plan of the Corporation which may exist from time to time, such Section 145 shall, for the purposes of this Article, be interpreted as follows: an "other enterprise" shall be deemed to include such an employee benefit plan, including, without limitation, any plan of the Corporation which is governed by the Act of Congress entitled 

   ##### 

  

 

"Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974," as amended from time to
time; the Corporation shall be deemed to have requested a person to serve an
employee benefit plan where the performance by such person of his duties to
the Corporation also imposes duties on, or otherwise involves services by,
such person to the plan or participants or beneficiaries of the plan;
excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan
pursuant to such Act of Congress shall be deemed "fines"; and action taken or
omitted by a person with respect to an employee benefit plan in the
performance of such persons duties for a purpose reasonably believed by such
person to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan
shall be deemed to be for a purpose which is not opposed to the best
interests of the Corporation. 

   

ARTICLE XIV 

   

 _Amendments_

Bylaws adopted by the Board of Directors may be repealed or changed, and new Bylaws made, by the stockholders, and the stockholders may prescribe that any Bylaw made by them shall not be altered, amended or repealed by the Board of Directors.
