         Facilities, if any (the "Resident Funds"); (ii) all deposits, escrow or
         security  accounts  or other funds of, or  established  by, any Seller,
         that are  related  to the  Senior  Living  Assets  (including,  without
         limitation,  all  amounts  in the HUD  Facility's  replacement  reserve
         account  and any other  mortgage  escrow or  funding  reserve  balances
         established   pursuant  to,  or  otherwise  in  connection   with,  the

         each case will be required to be  maintained by Buyer after the Closing
         Date, but excluding for the avoidance of doubt,  items that fall within
         the scope of clause (iii) below (the "Seller Deposits");  and (iii) all
         deposits,  escrow or security  accounts  and other funds held by Seller
         for  application   against  future  liabilities  of  residents  of  the
         Facilities,  including without limitation,  life care contracts, if any
         (the  "Resident  Deposits" and together with the Resident Funds and the
         Seller Deposits, the "Assumed Accounts");

                  (i) accounts receivable relating to rent and services rendered
         to  residents  from the first  day of the  month  prior to the month in
         which the Closing Date occurs until the Closing Date ("Current Accounts
         Receivable")  and  any  other  accounts  receivable  of the  Facilities
         arising on or after the Closing Date;

                  (j) all assignable or  transferable  rights and obligations of
         Seller under the Resident Agreements;

                  (k) copies of  employee  and  medical  records of  individuals
         employed by Constellation Senior Services, Inc. ("CSS") with respect to
         all  Transferred  Employees from whom Buyer obtains  written consent to
         receive such records; and

                  (l) all other  assignable  or  transferable  assets,  owned or
         leased  by,  or  licensed  to or  used  by  Seller  exclusively  in the
         operation of the Senior Living Assets as currently operated;  provided,
         however,  that the  Purchased  Assets  shall not include  any  Excluded
         Assets.

         From time to time prior to the Closing,  Seller shall  promptly  update
and supplement the description of the Purchased Assets (including the Schedules)
with respect to any matter arising  which,  if existing or occurring at the date
of this Agreement  would have been required to have been set forth in a Schedule
or which is necessary to correct the  information set forth in this Agreement or
in any  Schedule  which  has been  rendered  inaccurate  or which  occurs in the
ordinary  course of business  prior to the Closing  (which shall include any and
all actions or events permitted by Section 10(a)(ii),  whether expressly or with
the  consent of Buyer).  The  delivery of any such  supplement  shall not in any
manner constitute a waiver by Buyer of the requirement that the  representations
of Seller be true and correct on the date of this  Agreement  and on the Closing
Date.

         Seller understands that Buyer is a "real estate investment trust" under
the Code and that Buyer  intends to enter into an  agreement  with a third party
("Tenant") to lease and operate certain of the  Facilities,  it being agreed and
understood that none of the negotiation,  execution,  delivery, or effectiveness
of any  agreement  between  Buyer and  Tenant  shall be a  condition  to Buyer's
obligation to consummate the  transactions  contemplated by this  Agreement.  At
Buyer's expense, Seller shall cooperate in a commercially reasonable manner with
Buyer in connection with the negotiation of such agreement and the  consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         Seller further  understands  and agrees that Buyer shall have the right
to elect to designate any one or more of the Facilities and Purchased  Assets to
be acquired directly by Tenant and, in such event, at Closing Seller shall sell,
convey,  transfer and deliver such Facility or Facilities,

                                      -3-
<PAGE>
Purchased  Assets and Assumed  Liabilities  directly to Tenant.  Any such direct
sale to Tenant  shall be subject to the  following  conditions:  (i) Buyer shall
remain obligated in all respects under this Agreement,  (ii) Tenant shall,  with
respect to such transaction, have the same obligations (including as a result of
any breach of the  representations  and warranties of Tenant  pursuant to clause
(iv) below) as if Tenant were  "Buyer"  hereunder,  and Buyer shall remain fully
liable in respect of such obligations,  as provided below; (iii) such sale shall
not impede or delay the Closing;  and (iv) all applicable closing conditions and
deliverables  in Sections  6, 13 and 14 of this  Agreement  applicable  to Buyer
shall be equally applicable to Tenant and shall be satisfied (including, without
limitation,  that the  representations  and  warranties  of Buyer  contained  in
Section 9 shall, to the extent  applicable,  be true and correct as to Tenant as
of the Closing  Date,  to the same  extent as is  required of Buyer  pursuant to
Section 14(b), and Tenant shall deliver to Seller a certificate signed by a Vice
President of Tenant certifying the truth and correctness of such representations
and warranties).

         In  the  event  Tenant  defaults  in  the  performance  of  any  of its
obligations  under this  Agreement  or breaches  any of the  representations  or
warranties of Tenant,  Buyer shall, on demand, pay or perform such obligation in
accordance with the terms hereof. Seller shall not be required to institute suit
or exhaust its remedies  against Tenant in order to enforce the payment by Buyer
of the obligations of Tenant hereunder.

         The  parties  further   acknowledge  that   notwithstanding  any  other
provision of this  Agreement to the contrary,  Buyer has elected to acquire from
CHSI  all of  the  issued  and  outstanding  capital  stock  of  The  Heartlands
Retirement   Community  -  Ellicott   City  I,  Inc.,  a  Maryland   corporation
("Heartlands  I"), and the Heartlands  Retirement  Community - Ellicott City II,
Inc., a Maryland  corporation  ("Heartlands II").  Notwithstanding  such capital
stock  acquisition,  the  parties  agree  that  the  substantive  understandings
contained in this Agreement, including, without limitation, Sections 1, 2, 3 and
17 of this Agreement,  shall be applied to such transaction as though the assets
of Heartlands I and Heartlands II (together,  the  "Heartlands  Entities")  were
being purchased.  The parties shall make such adjustments on the Closing Date as
may be necessary to give effect to the parties' intended economic allocations.

         Heartlands I is also known as the HUD  Facility,  as defined in Section
12(a).  In the event of a  delayed  closing  with  respect  to the HUD  Facility
pursuant to Section 6(b), for purposes of this Agreement,  all references to the
closing  with  respect  to the HUD  Facility  shall  be  deemed  to refer to the
simultaneous closing with respect to Buyer's purchase of Heartlands II.

         2. EXCLUDED  ASSETS.  The Purchased Assets shall not include any assets
other  than  those  specifically  described  in  Section 1 above,  and,  without
limiting  the  generality  of the  foregoing,  Seller shall retain and not sell,
convey,  transfer or deliver to Buyer,  and Buyer shall not purchase or have any
rights in, the following assets, each of which is specifically excluded from the
Purchased Assets being sold hereunder (collectively, the "Excluded Assets"):

                  (a) cash and cash equivalents (including marketable securities
         and short-term investments), other than the Assumed Accounts;

                                      -4-

         provided,  that Section 17(c) shall govern the allocation between Buyer
         and Seller of the Tax matters addressed therein;

         parties;

         party as Seller hereto;

         Seller  and  its  affiliates  in  any of the  following  words,  logos,
         stylized    lettering,    other    designs   and   variants    thereof:
         "Constellation," "CEG" and "Constellation Energy Group;"

                  (f) all  books,  documents,  records  and  files  prepared  in
         connection with or relating in any way to the transactions contemplated
         by this  Agreement,  including  bids  received  from other  parties and
         analyses  relating  in any way to the  Purchased  Assets,  the  Assumed
         Liabilities and the Senior Living Assets;

                  (g) all rights of Seller and its affiliates  under or pursuant
         to  this   Agreement  and  the  other   agreements   and   transactions
         contemplated hereby;

                  (h) the assets,  properties and rights of Seller's  affiliates
         not used  exclusively  in the  operation of the Senior Living Assets as
         currently  operated  and the  exclusion  of which  will not  materially
         impair such  operation of the Senior Living Assets,  including  without
         limitation, a vehicle owned or leased by Seller's affiliate,  Baltimore
         Gas and Electric Company, which is currently used at the HUD Facility;

                  (i) the rights and obligations of Seller under any agreements,
         contracts,  leases,  subleases,  licenses, and similar instruments that
         are not assignable by Seller;

                  (j) any rights under or amounts payable from present or former
         insurance policies covering Seller or the Senior Living Assets;

         in  connection  with such Benefit  Plan,  including  any trusts,  trust
         funds, contracts, agreements or other assets of any kind;

                  (l) the CSS Agreement, the LCS Agreement and LCS Property; and

                  (m)  all  accounts  receivable  relating  to  rent  and  other
         services rendered to residents arising prior to the Closing Date, other
         than Current Accounts Receivable ("Aged Accounts Receivable").

         have occurred any damage,  destruction  or other  casualty  losses with
         respect to the  Facilities,  unless such damage,  destruction  or other
         casualty  losses,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  (a)  have  an
         estimated  cost (as  determined  by Seller in good  faith) to repair or
         replace of less than Eight  Million  Dollars  ($8,000,000),  (b) can be
         substantially  repaired or replaced  within  ninety (90) days after the
         date of such  damage,  destruction  or loss,  and (c)  either  (1) such
         repair or  replacement  has been  completed by Seller to the reasonable
         satisfaction  of Buyer by the  Closing  Date,  or (2) if such repair or
         replacement  has not been  completed by the Closing  Date,  then Seller
         either (x) shall assign to Buyer the unexpended proceeds under Seller's
         insurance policies with respect to such damage, destruction or loss and
         shall credit  against the Purchase  Price the amount of any  deductible
         under such insurance  policies (unless already paid by Seller),  or (y)
         Buyer  shall  receive  a credit  against  the  Purchase  Price  for the
         aggregate amount contemplated by clause (x);

         Section 19(a)(ii); or

                  (iv) this Agreement is terminated by Buyer pursuant to Section
         5(b)(ii)   if  (A)  the  results  of  the  due   diligence,   analyses,
         investigations  and  other  examinations  performed  by or on behalf of
         Buyer solely with respect to title,  survey,  zoning,  engineering  and
         environmental  matters related to the Facilities pursuant to Section 10
         (the  "Due  Diligence   Investigation")  shall  disclose  one  or  more
         conditions  that,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  constitute  a
         Material  Asset Defect,  and (B) Seller shall not have agreed to reduce
         the  Purchase  Price  dollar for dollar by the cost to repair or remedy
         any such  Material  Asset  Defect that is in excess of  $500,000  (such
         excess, if any, the "Defect Repair Amount").

The term "Diligence  Period" shall mean the period beginning on the date of this
Agreement and ending on October 10, 2002.

              (b) Material Asset Defect. For purposes hereof, the term "Material
Asset Defect" means:  (A) a physical defect at any Facility,  (B) a violation of
law or breach of any  covenant or  condition of record that (C) a failure of any
Facility to comply with applicable  zoning,  or (D) a title or survey defect, in
the case of clause (A), (C) or (D) other than a Permitted Encumbrance, where the
cost to repair or remedy such disclosed defect,  violation or failure to comply,
individually or

                                      -8-
<PAGE>
in the aggregate together with all other such defects, violations or failures to
comply, exceeds $500,000;  provided,  however, that the $500,000 threshold shall
not apply to Diligence  Period Liens.  A Material Asset Defect shall not include
defects or violations  (1) where the cost for repairing or remedying is included
in  Seller's  2002  capital  expenditure  budget,  attached  hereto as  Schedule
5(b)(i), but only to the extent that such defect or violation can be repaired or
remedied  for the amounts  budgeted  therefor in such 2002  capital  expenditure
budget,  (2) that are disclosed in any of the reports or other documents  listed
in Schedule 7(r) other than those matters described in Schedule 5(b)(ii), or (3)
arising from any damage,  destruction or other  casualty loss occurring  between
the date of this  Agreement  and the  Closing  Date,  as to which  the  terms of
Section 5(a)(i) shall control.  The term "Diligence Period Liens" shall mean all
mechanics  liens and other  liens for labor,  materials  or  supplies,  judgment
liens,  mortgages,  deeds of trust and other  financing  liens,  and other liens
(other than Permitted Encumbrances),  in each case of a liquidated sum affecting
the Senior Living  Assets,  and in each case that are discovered by Buyer during
the Diligence Period. As contemplated by this Section 5(b)(i),  Seller shall pay
and  discharge  in full (or agree to reduce  the  Purchase  Price by any  unpaid
amount) all Diligence  Period Liens,  except for any Diligence Period Liens that
Seller is  contesting  in good faith,  as to which Seller shall have  provided a
bond or other commercially reasonable security.

                  (ii) Buyer shall submit a list of any defects,  violations  or
failures to comply which individually or in the aggregate  constitute a Material
Asset  Defect no later than the end of the  Diligence  Period.  All such  claims
shall identify the Material Asset Defect with  particularity,  include copies of
all reports of any Person who  discovered  the Material Asset Defect and include
the costs  (or a  reasonable  estimate  of the  costs) to repair or remedy  such
Material  Asset  Defect,  as  provided  by any Person  making  such  estimate or
identifying  such costs  ("Material  Asset Defect  Claim").  Buyer's  failure to
submit a Material  Asset  Defect  Claim on or prior to the end of the  Diligence
Period shall be deemed a waiver of Buyer's rights  hereunder with respect to any
and all  Material  Asset  Defects.  Seller  shall  provide any  objection to any
Material Asset Defect Claim  (including any objections  with respect to the cost
(or  estimated  cost) to repair or remedy as specified by Buyer) within five (5)
business days after receipt thereof. Buyer and Seller shall promptly and in good
faith attempt to resolve any disputes with respect to any Material  Asset Defect
Claim submitted by Buyer and agree on the cost to repair or remedy such Material
Asset Defect.  In the event such  disputes are not resolved,  and Seller has not
agreed to reduce the Purchase Price by the cost to repair or remedy any Material
Asset Defect in excess of $500,000,  on or prior to the tenth business day after
the expiration of the Diligence Period,  Buyer shall have the right to terminate
this Agreement. Any such termination shall be deemed a Deposit Return Event.

              (c) Purchase Price. In consideration for the Purchased Assets:

                  (i) Subject to the  adjustments  set forth in this  Agreement,
Buyer  shall  pay  to  Seller  (or  Seller's   designee)  in  cash  a  price  of
Seventy-Seven  Million  Two-Hundred  Fifty-Thousand  Dollars  ($77,250,000) (the
"Purchase Price"); and

                  (ii)  Buyer  shall  assume  and agree to pay and  perform  and
otherwise discharge when due the Assumed Liabilities.

              (d) Closing Date Payments.

              (i) On the Closing  Date:  Buyer shall pay to Seller (or  Seller's
designee),  in  immediately  available  funds  by wire  transfer  to an  account
designated  in  writing  by  Seller,  the  Purchase  Price,  (A)  reduced by the
following  amounts (if any) (1) an amount  equal to the  Deposit,  (2)  interest
thereon  from the date on which the Deposit was  received by Seller  through and
including  the Closing Date at a rate of five  percent  (5%) per annum,  (3) the
Defect  Repair  Amount and  Diligence  Period  Lien  amounts  (to the extent not
otherwise  paid for by Seller or bonded in  accordance  with Section  5(b)(i) or
otherwise adjusted hereunder),  and (4) any amount credited to Buyer pursuant to
Section  17 or any  other  applicable  provision  of  this  Agreement;  and  (B)
increased  by the  following  amounts  (if any) (1)  amounts  payable or paid by
Seller  in  connection  with  securing  title  commitments  (up to $7,500 in the
aggregate), TPA Approval or approval of the First HUD Loan Lender and the Second
HUD Loan Lender,  as applicable;  and (2) any amount credited to Seller pursuant
to Section 17 or any other applicable provision of this Agreement.  In addition,
Seller  and  Buyer  shall  each  pay  fifty   percent  (50%)  of  all  transfer,
recordation,   documentary,  sales,  use,  stamp,  registration,  real  property
transfer  and  other  such  taxes  and  fees  incurred  in  connection  with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

              (ii) It is  understood  and  agreed  that  (i) the  amount  of the
Purchase  Price  allocated  to the HUD  Facility  and  Heartlands  II (the  "HUD
Facility Allocable Amount") shall be Twenty-Five Million,  Five Hundred Thousand
Dollars  ($25,500,000),  which  amount  shall be paid by Buyer to  Seller on the
closing date with respect to the HUD Facility, if Section 6(b)(i) is applicable,
by (a) the  assumption of the First HUD Loan and the Second HUD Loan and (b) the
payment  to  Seller  in cash of an  amount  equal to the  excess  of (1) the HUD
Facility Allocable Amount over (2) the sum of the outstanding principal balances
of the First HUD Loan and the Second HUD Loan on the Closing Date.  The Purchase
Price shall also be reduced by One Million Three Hundred  Seventy-Five  Thousand
Dollars ($1,375,000) (the "HUD Facility Fee Amount").

         6. CLOSING.

              (a)  Closing.   Subject  to  Section  6(b)  and  to  the  parties'
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions  precedent set forth in Sections 13 and
14, the  closing  and  consummation  of the  transactions  contemplated  by this
Agreement  (the  "Closing")  shall take place on October 25, 2002 at 10:00 a.m.,
Eastern Time,  at the offices of Kirkland & Ellis at 655 15th Street,  NW, Suite
1200,  Washington,  DC 20005, or, if the conditions set forth in Sections 13 and
14 have not been satisfied or waived as of such date, on such later date that is
as soon as possible after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth
in Sections 13 and 14 (such applicable date being the "Closing Date").

              (b) HUD Facility Closing.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  in the
event that Seller and Buyer shall have failed to obtain the TPA  Approval by the
Closing Date despite the parties' compliance with their obligations  pursuant to
Section 12, (such condition a "Delay"), the closing date with respect to the HUD
Facility  (but not  with  respect  to any  other of the  Facilities  other  than
Heartlands II) shall be extended until three (3) business days after the earlier
to occur of receipt of the TPA Approval,  or satisfaction of the No TPA Approval
Closing  Condition.  In the event that the closing  date with respect to the HUD
Facility  shall be so  extended,  (A) such Delay shall affect only the timing of
the sale and closing as to the HUD

                                      -10-
<PAGE>

Facility,  (B) Buyer,  subject to compliance  with  applicable law, shall on the
date of the Closing with respect to the other Facilities  become the operator of
the HUD Facility pursuant to the terms of an interim management agreement in the
form of Exhibit A attached hereto (the "Interim  Management  Agreement"),  which
Interim  Management  Agreement  shall  transfer the risk of an  occurrence  of a
material  adverse  effect at the HUD  Facility  to Buyer from and after the date
thereof, (C) the HUD Facility Allocable Amount (subject to any adjustments up or
down that are  contemplated  by  Section  5(d)(i)  and  Section 17 that were not
previously  accounted for in connection with the Closing  hereunder with respect
to the other  Facilities),  shall be paid by Buyer to Seller on the closing date
with respect to the HUD Facility,  (D) notwithstanding  anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement or in the Interim  Management  Agreement,  (1) there
shall be no adjustment to the Purchase Price in favor of Buyer in respect of any
claims, losses, expenses (including,  without limitation,  reasonable legal fees
and  expenses),   costs,  suits,  actions  proceedings,   damages,   demands  or
liabilities  (collectively,  "Claims") to which the Heartlands  Entities  become
subject, to the extent such Claims arise out of or result from the management or
operation  of the HUD  Facility by Buyer or its designee on or after the Closing
Date, which Claims shall be the  responsibility of Buyer, (2) the Purchase Price
shall be  increased  by the amount of any  Claims  that are paid by Seller on or
prior to the closing with respect to the HUD  Facility,  to the extent that such
Claims  arise out of or  result  from the  management  or  operation  of the HUD
Facility  by Buyer or its  designee on or after the  Closing  Date,  and (3) the
Purchase Price also shall be increased,  by post-closing  payments from Buyer to
Seller in the amount of any Claims (as such Claims arise without  regard to time
limitation)  that are made against Seller (other than the Heartlands  Entities),
to the extent that such Claims  arise out of or result  from the  management  or
operation  of the HUD  Facility by Buyer or its designee on or after the Closing
Date, but are not resolved or otherwise  covered by the foregoing  provisions of
this clause (D),  or are first made after the  closing  with  respect to the HUD
Facility,  and (E) in no event shall  Seller take any action as owner of the HUD
Facility  (including  as owner of the Shares or the  Heartlands  Entities) on or
after the Closing Date,  other than (1) those  consented to by Buyer in its sole
discretion,  (2) those required by law (including,  without limitation,  the HUD
regulatory agreements), or (3) those required or permitted to be taken by Seller
as owner  under,  and in  accordance  with the  terms of this  Agreement  or the
Interim Management  Agreement;  provided,  however, that Seller shall not amend,
modify,  or waive any rights under, or terminate the loan documents  relating to
the First HUD Loan and Second HUD Loan  except as required  by  applicable  law.
Seller shall provide written notice to Buyer of any such Claims and Seller shall
reasonably  cooperate  with Buyer,  at Buyer's  expense,  in contesting any such
Claim.  For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that, for all Tax purposes
(including income Tax purposes),  the parties shall consistently account for the
HUD Facility in the following  manner:  (i) the Seller shall remain the owner of
the HUD Facility during the pendency of the Interim  Management  Agreement,  and
(ii) the sale of the HUD  Facility  by the  Seller  shall  not be deemed to have
taken place until the actual  occurrence of the closing date with respect to the
HUD Facility.

              (c) Closing  Date  Deliverables  of Seller.  On the Closing  Date,
Seller shall deliver to Buyer the following:

                  (i)  duly-executed  special  warranty deeds for the Owned Real
         Property,  subject  only  to  the  Permitted  Encumbrances,  in a  form

income tax purposes to be included in the Purchase  Price),  among the Purchased
Assets  under  the  principles  of Code  Section  1060  (such  schedule  and the
allocations it contains,  the  "Allocation").  If Seller raises any objection to

deemed completed until all are completed.  Unless otherwise  expressly  provided
for herein, all transfers of assets and liabilities provided for herein, as well
as all other actions related to the Closing, shall be deemed to have occurred at
12:01 a.m., Eastern Time, on the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
Section  6(b) is  applicable,  then  except as  otherwise  specified  in Section
17(h)(v), the foregoing sentences shall not apply to the transactions that occur
on the closing  date with  respect to the

                                      -13-
<PAGE>
HUD  Facility,   and  such  transactions   shall  be  deemed  to  have  occurred
simultaneously at 12:01 a.m.,  Eastern Time, on the closing date with respect to
the HUD Facility.

         7. SELLER'S  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.  Subject to the exceptions
and  limitations  set forth in this  Section 7 and Section 8 and the matters set
forth on the  Schedules  to this  Agreement,  each  Seller and CHSI  jointly and
severally  represents and warrants to Buyer as of the date of this Agreement and
as of the  Closing  Date  (except  with  respect  to those  representations  and
warranties that speak as to a particular  date or time,  which shall be true and
correct  as of such  date or time) as set  forth  below.  For  purposes  of this
Agreement,  "knowledge,"  when used in the phrase  "Seller's  knowledge" in this
Agreement  means,  and  shall be  limited  to,  the  actual  knowledge  (without
independent investigation) of the principal executive officer of each Seller and
any individual  acting as an executive  director with respect to a Facility (but
only to the extent the representations and warranties in this Section 7 apply to
such Seller or Facility). Buyer understands and agrees that such individuals are
acting solely as officers or representatives of Seller and not in any individual
capacity,  and  that  such  individuals  shall  have no  liability  to  Buyer in
connection  with the  breach  of any  representations  or  warranties  set forth
herein. Except as otherwise noted, the following  representations and warranties
are  given  as to CHSI  and  each of its  Subsidiaries  that is a party  to this
Agreement.

              (a)  Organization  and Good  Standing.  Seller is duly  organized,
validly  existing  and in good  standing  under  the  laws of the  state  of its
incorporation  or formation  and has all  requisite  power and authority to own,
lease and  operate  its  properties  and to carry out its  business as now being
conducted.  Seller is duly qualified in each jurisdiction in which the ownership
of property or the conduct of its business requires such  qualification,  except
where the failure to do so would not,  individually or in the aggregate,  have a
Material Adverse Effect.

              As used in this  Agreement,  the term  "Material  Adverse  Effect"
means  any  material  adverse  effect  on  the  business,  assets,  liabilities,
financial condition or results of operations of the Senior Living Assets,  taken
as a whole,  except for any change or effect resulting from (i) the execution or
delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions  contemplated
hereby  or  (ii)  changes  in  economic,  regulatory,  or  political  conditions
generally.

              (b)  Authority.  Seller has the  corporate  power and authority to
enter into this Agreement and the transactions  contemplated hereby and to carry
out its obligations hereunder.  The execution,  delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the transactions  contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by
all necessary action and no other action on the part of the Seller's  directors,
shareholders,  partners,  managers or members is required in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of
Seller enforceable  against Seller in accordance with its terms,  except as such
enforceability  is  limited  by  general  principles  of equity  and  applicable
provisions of  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  moratorium,  reorganization  or similar
laws.

              (c)  Consents.  Other than with  respect to (i) the TPA  Approval,
(ii) the consents  required in connection with the Ground Leases, if applicable,
and the Facilities Agreements, (iii) the notice required to prepay the First HUD
Loan,  if  applicable,  (iv) the

                                      -14-
<PAGE>
approval  of the  First HUD Loan  Lender  and the  Second  HUD Loan  Lender,  if
applicable,  (v) consents required under financing agreements  applicable to the
Facilities,  the underlying obligations for which will be discharged and paid in
full on or prior to the  Closing  (other  than the First HUD Loan and the Second
HUD Loan) and (vi) such other approvals,  notices and filings as may be required
by any federal,  state or local  regulatory  agency  required to consummate  the
transactions  contemplated hereby, no consent, approval of or by, or filing with
or notice to any other individual, corporation, partnership, association, trust,
limited  liability  company or any other  entity or  organization,  including  a
government or political  subdivision or agency, unit or instrumentality  thereof
(a  "Person")  is  required  with  respect  to  Seller  in  connection  with the
execution,  delivery or performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions  provided  for  hereby,  except  where the  failure to obtain  such
consent  or  approval,   make  such  filing  or  give  such  notice  would  not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

              (d) No Breach.  Subject to  obtaining  the  consents  required  in
connection with the Ground Leases, if applicable,  and the Facilities Agreements
and the other consents  identified in Section 7(c),  and, except as set forth on
Schedule 7(d), the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and the compliance by Seller with any of
the  provisions  hereof does not and will not (i) conflict with or result in the
breach of any other  organizational  documents  of Seller  and (ii)  violate  or
conflict  with,  or result in a breach of, any  provisions  of, or  constitute a
default  (or an event  which,  with  notice  or  lapse  of time or  both,  would
constitute a default)  under,  or result in  termination  of, or accelerate  the
performance  required  by,  or  result  in the  creation  of any  lien or  other
encumbrance upon the Purchased Assets (other than Permitted  Encumbrances) under
any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any material agreement, instrument
or obligation to which Seller is a party,  or by which the Purchased  Assets are
otherwise bound,  under any applicable order,  injunction,  judgment,  decree or
award,  federal,  state,  local or  foreign  law,  ordinance,  statute,  rule or
regulation, excluding from the foregoing clause (ii), such violations, conflicts
and  breaches  or  defaults,  the  occurrence  of which  would not, in any case,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

              (e) Real  Property.  Schedule  1(a)(i)  sets forth the address and
description  of each Owned Real  Property.  With respect to each parcel of Owned
Real Property:

                            (A) Seller has good and marketable fee simple title,
              free and clear of all liens and encumbrances,  except for (1) real
              estate taxes,  assessments and other governmental  levies, fees or
              charges imposed with respect to such Owned Real Property which are
              not due and  payable  as of the  Closing  Date or which  are being
              contested  in good faith and are listed in Schedule  7(e)(i);  (2)
              mechanics liens and similar liens for labor, materials or supplies
              provided with respect to such Owned Real Property  incurred in the
              ordinary  course of  business  for  amounts  which are not due and
              payable and which  would not,  individually  or in the  aggregate,
              have a Material  Adverse Effect and which,  to the extent provided
              in Section 5(b)(i), will be satisfied in full or bonded against on
              the Closing Date;  (3) zoning,  building  codes and other land use
              laws  regulating  the use or occupancy of such Owned Real Property
              or the  activities  conducted  thereon  which are  imposed  by any
              governmental  authority having  jurisdiction  over such Owned Real
              Property which are not violated by the current use or occupancy of
              such Owned Real

                                      -15-
<PAGE>
              Property or the operation of the Senior Living Assets as currently
              conducted   thereon;   (4)   easements,   covenants,   conditions,
              restrictions  and other similar matters of record  affecting title
              to such Owned Real Property  which would not constitute a Material
              Adverse  Effect;  (5) admissions and resident  agreements  entered

              and will not  otherwise  cause such Ground  Lease to cease to be a
              valid  and  binding  agreement  or in full  force  and  effect  on
              identical terms following the Closing;

                            (C) Seller's  possession and quiet  enjoyment of the

              circumstance  exists  which,  with the  delivery  of  notice,  the
              passage  of  time or  both,  would  constitute  such a  breach  or
              default,  or permit the termination,  modification or acceleration
              of rent under such Ground Lease;

                            (E) no security deposit or portion thereof deposited
              with respect to such Ground Lease has been applied in respect of a

                            (F)  Seller  does not  owe,  nor will not owe in the

record affecting such Real Property.

              (f)  Brokers.  Seller  has not  retained  any  broker or finder or

              (g) Tangible Assets.  Seller has, and as of the Closing Buyer will
have,  good and  marketable  title  to,  or a valid  and  enforceable  leasehold
interest  (to  Seller's  knowledge  under which there exists no default) in, the
tangible  assets included in the Purchased  Assets,  free and clear of all liens
and  encumbrances,  except for (i)  Permitted  Encumbrances,  (ii) liens arising
under original  purchase price  conditional sales contracts and equipment leases
with third  parties  entered  into in the  ordinary  course of business  and are

title,  or in the validity of any leasehold  interest,  if any, that (as to this
clause (iii) only) would not, individually or in the aggregate,  have a Material
Adverse Effect.

              (h)  Compliance  With Laws.  Except as set forth on Schedule 7(h),
the operation of the Senior  Living  Assets has been  conducted in compliance in
all material respects with all applicable laws,  governmental  regulations,  the

occupancy, zoning, adequacy of parking,  environmental protection,  occupational
health and safety and fire safety  applicable  thereto,  except for  violations,
non-compliance or other matters, if any, which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

              (i)  Permits.  Except  as  set  forth  on  Schedule  7(i),  Seller
possesses all Permits  (including  all  healthcare  licenses)  necessary for the
operation of the Senior  Living  Assets as currently  operated,  except for such
Permits as to which the  failure to possess  would not,  individually  or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

              (j) Actions and Proceedings.  Except as set forth on Schedule 7(j)
and such matters as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect, there is no action, suit,  arbitration or regulatory  proceeding
or claim pending, or, to Seller's knowledge, threatened against Seller involving
or affecting the Purchased Assets,  the Senior Living Assets,  this Agreement or
the  transactions  contemplated  hereby and, other than Permitted  Encumbrances,
there are no decrees,  injunctions,  liens,  orders or  judgments of or with any
court or governmental  department or agency outstanding against Seller or any of
its  Subsidiaries  relating to or affecting  the  Purchased  Assets,  the Senior
Living Assets, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

              (k) Subsidiaries.  Schedule 7(k) sets forth for each Subsidiary of
CHSI  that  holds  title  to any of the  Purchased  Assets,  including,  without
limitation,   the  Heartlands  Entities,   (i)  its  name  and  jurisdiction  of
incorporation  or  formation,  (ii) the number of shares of  authorized  capital
stock of each class of its capital  stock or other  equity  interest,  (iii) the
number of issued and  outstanding  shares of each class of its capital  stock or
other equity interest, the names of the holders thereof and the number of shares
held by each  such  holder  and (iv)  its  directors  and  officers.  Each  such
Subsidiary is duly organized,  validly existing,  and in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or formation. Each such Subsidiary
is duly authorized to conduct business and is in good standing under the laws of
each jurisdiction where such qualification is required, except where the lack of
such qualification would not, individually or in the aggregate,  have a Material
Adverse  Effect.  Each such  Subsidiary has full power and authority to carry on
the  businesses in which it is engaged and to own and use the  properties  owned
and used by it.

              As used in this  Agreement,  the  term  "Subsidiary"  means,  with
respect to any  Person,  any other  Person of which at least a  majority  of the
outstanding  capital stock or other equity  interests having the power to direct
or cause the direction of the  management  and policies of such Person,  whether
through the ownership of voting securities,  by contract or otherwise, are owned
directly or indirectly by the first Person or one or more  Subsidiaries  of such
Person.

(including  the notes thereto) were prepared in accordance  with U.S.  generally
accepted  accounting  principles  consistently  applied  throughout  the periods
involved and present  fairly the financial  condition of Seller as of such dates
and the results of  operations of Seller for such  periods;  provided,  however,
that the  financial  statements  as of and for the six (6) months ended June 30,
2002 lack  footnotes  and other  presentation  items and are  subject  to normal
year-end adjustments and other usual and customary adjustments.

              (m) Events Subsequent to Most Recent Balance Sheet.  Except as set
forth on Schedule 7(m),  since the date of the Most Recent Balance Sheet,  there
has not  occurred  any  event,  change,  effect,  fact,  circumstance  or  other
occurrence which has had, or which could be reasonably expected to, individually
or in the aggregate,  have a Material Adverse Effect; the business of Seller has
been conducted only in the ordinary course  consistent  with past practice;  and

date).

              (i) Each  agreement  set  forth on  Schedule  7(n) is a valid  and
binding agreement of the Seller party thereto,  and is in full force and effect,
and neither  Seller nor, to Seller's  knowledge,  any other party  thereto is in
default or breach in any respect under the terms of any such  agreement,  except
for any such failures and defaults or breaches that would not,  individually  or
in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

              (o) Trademarks. Schedule 7(o) identifies each trademark or service
mark  registration  (collectively,  "Marks")  which have been  issued to Seller.
Seller has the valid legal right to use each of the Marks.  Seller has  received

Excluded  Assets and (iii)  assets set forth on  Schedule  7(p),  the  Purchased

that are  non-transferable,  which are reasonably required to operate the Senior
Living Assets immediately following the Closing Date substantially in the manner

the failure of which to include  would not,  individually  or in the  aggregate,
have a Material Adverse Effect.

plan" (as such term is defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974,

arrangement  sponsored by CSS for the benefit of employees  associated  with the

                  (iii) Neither Seller nor any other entity that is treated as a
single  employer  with  Seller for  purposes  of Section 414 of the Code has any
liability  under  Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA that could become a liability
of Buyer.

                  (iv) To  Seller's  knowledge,  no  action,  suit,  proceeding,
hearing or  investigation  with respect to the Benefit Plans (other than routine
claims for benefits) is pending or threatened.

agreement or other labor agreement with any union or labor organization.

              (r) Environmental,  Health and Safety Matters. Except as set forth
on Schedule 7(r) and except for those matters that, which have not had, or which

any Environmental Law or has liability under Environmental Laws, in each case in
connection  with the  operation of the Senior  Living Assets and (iv) Seller has
not entered into or is subject to any court decree or is subject to any judgment
relating  to  compliance  with any  Environmental  Law or  liability  under  any
Environmental Law.

              (s) Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as set forth on Schedule 7(s),
Seller  has  no  liability  (whether  known  or  unknown,  whether  asserted  or
unasserted,  whether  absolute  or  contingent,  whether  accrued or  unaccrued,
whether liquidated or unliquidated,  and whether due or to become due, including
any  liability  for  Taxes),  except for (i)  liabilities  set forth on the Most

<PAGE>

not  required by  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  to be  disclosed,
reflected or reserved against on a balance sheet.

              (t) Affiliated Transactions.  No affiliate of CHSI (other than any
Seller) has been involved in any material  business  arrangement or relationship

              (c)  Mutual  Covenants.  Buyer and  Seller  covenant  and agree as
follows:

                  (i)  State  Regulatory  Approvals,  Notices  and  Filings.  In
addition to the actions required by Section 12, Buyer and Seller shall each file
or cause  to be filed  such  other  notices  and  filings  required  to be filed
pursuant to applicable law, in each case in order to consummate the transactions
contemplated  hereby and to permit Buyer to operate the Senior  Living Assets as
currently operated, including the approvals set forth in Section 12 (which shall
be governed by the  provisions  of Section  12).  Except as  otherwise  provided
herein,  Buyer and Seller shall bear the costs and expenses of their  respective
filings.  Buyer and Seller shall use their  respective  commercially  reasonable
best efforts to make all such filings promptly (and in any event within fourteen
(14)  days)  following  the date  hereof to obtain  any  approvals  and make any
notices and filings as may be required by any federal, state or local regulatory
agency to permit Buyer to consummate the  transactions  contemplated  hereby and
operate the Senior  Living  Assets as  currently  operated,  in each case at the
earliest  possible  date,  to respond  promptly to any requests  for  additional
information  and  documentary  materials made by any agency or department and to
make  any  further  filings  that  may be  necessary,  proper  or  advisable  in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby at each
of their  respective  cost and expense  (including the institution or defense of
legal  proceedings).  Each of Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller,  on the other,
shall consult with the other prior to any  meetings,  by telephone or in person,
with the staff of the applicable governmental authorities, and each of Buyer and
Seller  shall  have  the  right  to have a  representative  present  at any such
meeting.

                  (ii)  Assignments.  With respect to any Facilities  Agreement,
Ground  Lease or Permit  which (1) is  material to the  operation  of the Senior
Living Assets as currently  operated by Seller (including,  without  limitation,
the Ground Leases) (2) is able to be assigned to Buyer and requires  consent for
the  assignment  thereof  to  Buyer,  Seller  shall  take  such  actions  as

                                      -27-
<PAGE>
are commercially reasonable and necessary,  and Buyer shall cooperate fully with
Seller in all reasonable  respects,  to effect assignment thereof to Buyer as of
the Closing Date. It is understood that such actions by Seller shall not include
any requirement of Seller to expend monies,  commence any litigation or offer or
grant any  accommodation  (financial or  otherwise)  to any third party.  In the
event that Seller is unable to obtain the requisite  approval for  assignment of
any such Facilities Agreement or Permit, then at the written request of Buyer on
or before the  Closing  Date  (except  where such  action  would be  unlawful or
prohibited by such Facilities Agreement or Permit),  Seller shall (x) retain any
such Facilities  Agreement or Permit and enter into an arrangement with Buyer to
provide  Buyer  with  the  benefits  of such  Facilities  Agreement  or  Permit,
provided,  however,  that Buyer shall perform  Seller's  obligations  thereunder
arising  on or after the  Closing  Date (and  indemnify  Seller  against  Losses
suffered in connection  therewith) until such Facilities  Agreement or Permit is
assigned to Buyer or expires at the earliest  opportunity in accordance with its
terms, and (y) take all commercially  reasonable  actions required to accomplish
the  assignment  to Buyer of such  Facilities  Agreement  or  Permit  as soon as
practicable after the Closing Date.

                  (iii) Other  Governmental  Approvals.  Buyer and Seller  shall
cooperate  with each other and take all  reasonable  steps and make all  filings
necessary to obtain  authorization for the sale of the Senior Living Assets from
all other applicable governmental authorities.

                  (iv)  Audit.  As soon as  practicable  after the date  hereof,
Buyer and Seller shall enter into a side letter  reasonably  satisfactory to the
parties covering the terms under which Buyer or Tenant shall conduct an audit of
the financial  results of the  Facilities (as a group) for fiscal 2001, the stub
period  ending  September 30, 2002 and any other  periods  required  pursuant to
Regulation S-X under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,  for the purpose of
Buyer or Tenant  complying with the requirements of a Form 8-K to be filed under
the  Securities  and  Exchange  Act of 1934,  as  amended.  Such  audit will not
commence  until  after the  Closing  Date,  and Buyer  shall pay all of Seller's
external and internal costs associated with any assistance  provided to Buyer or
Tenant in connection with such audit.

                  (v) Other Actions.  Buyer and Seller shall otherwise use their
respective  commercially  reasonable  efforts to cause the  satisfaction  of all
conditions  precedent in this Section 10 and Sections 12, 13 and 14 and to cause
the Closing to occur as soon as  reasonably  practicable  after the date of this
Agreement.

                  (vi)  Receivables.  Prior to the execution of this  Agreement,
Seller shall have  delivered to Buyer an aging  statement with respect to all of
its accounts  receivable as of the most recent  practicable date.  Subsequent to
the  Closing,  Buyer  shall  have the right and  authority  to  collect  Current
Accounts Receivable and, as provided in this Section 10(c) (vi) , shall have the
obligation  to  collect,  for the  account of and on behalf of Seller,  the Aged
Accounts  Receivable.  Buyer  shall have the right and  authority  to endorse in
Seller's name any checks received on account of any Current Accounts Receivable.
Seller shall transfer and deliver to Buyer any amount that Seller may receive on
or after the Closing Date in respect of any of the Current Accounts  Receivable.
From and after the Closing Date and until sixty (60) days after the Closing Date
(the "Collection  Period"),  Buyer shall use commercially  reasonable efforts to
collect on behalf (and for the account) of Seller all Aged Accounts  Receivable,
which are

                                      -28-
<PAGE>
identified  in Schedule  10(c) (vi) (which  shall be provided at the Closing and
may be updated,  if necessary,  within five days after the  Closing),  utilizing
collection  efforts and  processes  consistent  with those  utilized by Buyer in
collecting its accounts receivable,  which are identified in Schedule 10(c) (vi)
(i), and Buyer shall remit to Seller  within five (5) days after the end of each
month, all amounts collected with respect to the Aged Accounts Receivable,  less
Buyer's  out-of-pocket  expenses  incurred  in  collecting  such  Aged  Accounts
Receivable.  Any such payment shall be accompanied  by a schedule  setting forth
the Aged Accounts Receivable by Facility, the party responsible for payment, the
amount  of  the  Aged  Accounts   Receivable,   the  amount  collected  and  any
out-of-pocket  expenses  incurred  by Buyer in  collecting  such  Aged  Accounts
Receivable (the "Remittance Schedule"). Any payment received by Buyer during the
Collection  Period from any account  debtor owing on any accounts  receivable of
the  Facilities  shall first be applied in reduction  of the oldest  outstanding
balance due from such account  debtor  including the Aged  Accounts  Receivable.
Sixty (60) days after the  Closing  Date,  Buyer  shall  provide  Seller  with a
schedule  setting  forth all Aged  Accounts  Receivable  not  collected by Buyer
(which schedule shall provide  information  similar to that set forth in Buyer's
monthly Remittance Schedules),  and Seller shall thereafter be free to institute
litigation  or other  collection  procedures  with respect to the Aged  Accounts
Receivable as Seller shall determine in its sole discretion. Consistent with the
terms of Section 18, and at Seller's expense, Buyer shall transfer all documents
related to, and provide  such  assistance  as Seller may  reasonably  request in
collecting, such Aged Accounts Receivable.  During the Collection Period, Seller
may not initiate  litigation or other collection  procedures with respect to the
Aged Accounts Receivable;  provided, however, that Seller may continue to pursue
any pending litigation with respect to the Aged Accounts  Receivable  instituted
prior to the Collection Period.

              (d) Covenants of Guarantor.  The Guarantor  hereby  absolutely and
unconditionally  guarantees  the  prompt,  complete  and  full  payment  of  all
obligations  of Seller under Section 5(a) and Section  16(a) of this  Agreement,
including,  without limitation,  Seller's obligation to refund the Deposit, with
interest thereon,  to Buyer as provided therein. In the event Seller defaults in
the performance of any of its obligations under Section 5(a) or 16(a), Guarantor
shall,  on demand,  pay or perform such  obligation in accordance with the terms
hereof.  Buyer shall not be required to  institute  suit or exhaust its remedies
against  Seller in order to enforce the payment by Guarantor of the  obligations
of Seller hereunder.

         11. EMPLOYEES.

              (a) Employees.  Schedule 11(a) attached  hereto contains a list of

disability,  administrative,  or military  leave or any other type of leave that
entitles the Employee to  reinstatement  upon  completion of the leave under the
applicable  leave  policies  of CSS  (collectively,  "Leave").  Seller  shall be
entitled to update  Schedule  11(a) as necessary at any time prior to Closing to
reflect any and all employment changes.

              (b)  Employment  Offers  to  Employees.  As soon as is  reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement,  Buyer shall offer employment with
Buyer,  effective as of the Closing Date, to all or substantially  all Employees
(including,  without limitation, each Employee

                                      -29-
<PAGE>

who is on Leave as of the Closing Date, commencing at such time as such Employee
is ready to return to work,  provided,  that such Employee is ready to return to
work within one hundred  twenty (120) days of the Closing  Date).  All Employees
who accept  employment  with Buyer  pursuant  to the  offers  described  in this
Section 11(b) are referred to herein as "Transferred Employees." Buyer will give
each active  Employee  and each  Employee who is on Leave no less than seven (7)
days in which to accept or reject Buyer's employment offer.

              (c) Transfer Time,  Etc. All  Transferred  Employees  shall become
employees  of Buyer as of 12:01 a.m.,  Eastern  Time,  on the  Closing  Date and
except as otherwise  provided  herein,  at such time,  Buyer shall assume and be
responsible  for payment of all  salaries  and  benefits and all other costs and
liabilities arising from such Transferred Employees employment by Buyer from and
after the Closing Date relating to the  Transferred  Employees  except that with
regard to an  Employee  on Leave  such  obligation  shall not  attach  until the
Employee on Leave commences  employment with Buyer.  Seller shall be responsible
for, and shall pay, any and all severance  payments  payable to any  Transferred
Employee  arising as a  consequence  of the  transactions  contemplated  by this
Agreement.

              (d) Time  Off.  On the  Closing  Date,  Seller  shall pay Buyer an
amount equal to Seller's  liabilities for accrued vacation  benefits relating to
the Transferred Employees.

              (e)  COBRA.  On and  after  the  Closing  Date,  Buyer  will  make
available  health  continuation  coverage  as  required  under the  Consolidated
Omnibus Budget  Reconciliation  Act of 1985, as codified at Section 4980B of the
Code and Part 6 of  Subtitle  B of Title I of ERISA  and any  similar  state law
("COBRA"), for all Transferred Employees and other "qualified beneficiaries" (as
such term is  defined  in  Section  4980B(g)(1)  of the Code) who  experience  a
qualifying  event (within the meaning of COBRA) and therefore become entitled to
COBRA coverage on and after the Closing Date and to all  individuals  associated
with the Senior  Living  Assets who are  receiving or entitled to receive  COBRA
coverage on account of a qualifying event occurring prior to the Closing Date to
the extent that such  entitlement  extends to any period after the Closing Date.
The  premiums  for such  COBRA  coverage  shall be paid by the  insured,  unless
otherwise determined by Buyer, in its sole discretion.

              (f) WARN Act. To the extent that any obligations  under the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining  Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. Section 2101 et. seq., or
under any similar provision of any federal,  state,  regional,  foreign or local
law,  rule or regulation  (collectively,  "WARN  Obligations")  might arise as a

              (b) HUD Mortgages. Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that (i)
the HUD  Facility  is  currently  subject  to a  mortgage  loan in the  original
principal   amount  of  Ten  Million  Six  Hundred  Seventy   Thousand   Dollars
($10,670,000) (the "First HUD Loan"),  which loan is secured by a first mortgage
lien on the HUD  Facility,  and (ii) at the Closing or, if Section 6(b) applies,
the closing with respect to the HUD  Facility,  Buyer shall  receive a credit in
the amount of 1% of the outstanding principal amount of the First HUD Loan as of
the Closing Date;  provided that such credit shall not apply to the closing with

premiums  and all other costs and expenses  related to  obtaining  such right to
prepayment of the Second HUD Loan.

              (c) Assumption of First and Second HUD Loans.  Consistent with the

         Seller in order to obtain the  preliminary  approval of HUD for Buyer's

                  that property financed with certain FHA insured mortgage loans

                  and persons affiliated with the proposed transferees including
                  management  entities,  and such  other  information  as may be
                  reasonably  requested for the purpose of obtaining approval of
                  the TPA;

                           (B) diligently pursue TPA Approval;

                           (C)  take   all   commercially   reasonable   actions
                  necessary to obtain the TPA Approval and cooperate  reasonably
                  with Buyer in obtaining TPA Approval;

                           (D) permit Buyer to obtain information concerning the
                  HUD  Facility  directly  from HUD and/or from the lender under
                  the First HUD Loan and the Second HUD Loan; and

                           (E)  submit  interim  financial  information  and any
                  other documentation required by HUD for final TPA Approval.

                  (iii) The  receipt  of the  executed  TPA  Application  by the
         mortgage  lender under the First HUD Loan (the "First HUD Loan Lender")
         and the mortgage lender under the Second HUD Loan (the "Second HUD Loan
         Lender")  and the  approval  of HUD  under  the  Regulatory  Agreements
         executed in connection  with the First HUD Loan and the Second HUD Loan
         are required in connection  with Buyer's  assumption of Seller's rights
         and  obligations  under the First HUD Loan and the  Second HUD Loan and
         the documents executed in connection therewith.  To that end, Buyer and

                  or  Seller   deem   reasonably   appropriate   to  obtain  the
                  countersignature  of the

                                      -32-
<PAGE>

                  First HUD Loan  Lender and the  Second HUD Loan  Lender on the
                  TPA Application;

                           (B) within fifteen (15) days after request  therefor,
                  to submit such  additional  information  as the First HUD Loan
                  Lender and the Second HUD Loan  Lender  request in  connection

                  assignment of 100% of the  ownership  interest in the owner of
                  the HUD Facility to Buyer and the TPA Applications,  provided,
                  however, Seller agrees that Buyer, at its expense, may discuss
                  the  scope  and  nature of any such  material  requested  with
                  counsel  for the First HUD Loan Lender and the Second HUD Loan
                  Lender and narrow the scope or nature of the  information in a

                  HUD's approval to the assignment of the ownership  interest in
                  the owner of the HUD Facility to Buyer;

                           (D)  within  five (5) days  after  request  therefor,
                  Buyer shall pay all fees, costs, and expenses of the First HUD
                  Loan Lender and the Second HUD Loan Lender in  obtaining  such
                  approval of the TPA Application for submission to HUD; and

                           (E)  to   diligently   pursue   approval  of  Buyer's
                  assumption  of all of the  ownership  interest of the owner of

              (e) TPA Conditions.  If HUD requires a physical  inspection of the
HUD Facility as a condition  of TPA  Approval,  within a  reasonable  time after
receipt of notice of such requirement (not to exceed fifteen (15) days),  Seller
shall obtain a physical  inspection (the "HUD Inspection") and shall immediately
notify Buyer of the results and any  deficiencies in the HUD Inspection.  If the
HUD  Inspection  reports  that  there  are  physical  needs of the HUD  Facility
requiring  immediate  repair or replacement  and HUD requires that  arrangements
must be made for such repair and replacement as a condition of TPA Approval,  or
if HUD imposes any other special  conditions in connection with the TPA Approval
which  are in no way  related  to or  resulting  from the  identity  of Buyer or
Tenant,  then Seller  shall make such repairs and  replacements  or satisfy such
conditions  prior to Closing in a manner  reasonably  acceptable to both HUD and
Buyer.

              (f) HUD Audit  Condition.  Buyer represents and warrants to Seller
that there are no outstanding HUD audit findings  affecting any properties owned
by Buyer or its affiliates.  Seller  represents and warrants to Buyer that there
are no outstanding HUD audit findings  affecting the HUD Facility or Seller.  If
there are any outstanding unresolved HUD audit investigations  affecting the HUD
Facility or Seller,  then, in addition to other closing  conditions set forth in
this Agreement,  it shall be a condition to Buyer's  obligations  hereunder with
respect to the HUD Facility that Seller shall have obtained written confirmation
from HUD or other evidence  reasonably  satisfactory to Buyer that any HUD audit
has been  closed as to all  findings  such that as of the  closing  for such HUD
Facility,  all such HUD audits  shall be closed and there shall be no  liability
whatsoever under any HUD audit.

Facility shall be the satisfaction of the conditions  contained in Sections (c),
(d)(i) and (d)(ii).

              (a)  Compliance  with  Agreement.  Seller shall have performed and
complied in all material respects with all covenants,  agreements and conditions
required by this  Agreement to be performed or complied  with by Seller prior to
the Closing Date.

              (b)  Representations  and  Warranties.   The  representations  and
warranties of Seller made in this  Agreement (as amended by Seller in accordance
with  Section 1) shall be true and  correct in all  material  respects as of the
date hereof and on and as of the Closing  Date,  as though made on and as of the
Closing  Date,  except for  representations  and  warranties  that speak as of a
specific  date or time  (which  need only be true and  correct  in all  material
respects as of such date or time).

              (c) Litigation.  There shall not be any judicial restraining order
or injunction,  preliminary or otherwise,  in effect  prohibiting the applicable
Closing of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement.  There shall not be
pending or threatened  any  litigation or proceeding  instituted by any federal,
state  or  foreign  governmental  agency  to  restrain,  prohibit  or  otherwise
interfere with or obtain  substantial  monetary  damages in connection  with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or operation of
the Senior Living Assets by Buyer.

              (d) Consents; Licensing, Etc.

                  (i)  Approvals,  notices and filings as may be required by any
federal,  state or local  regulatory  agency to permit Buyer to  consummate  the
transactions  contemplated  hereby  and  operate  the  Senior  Living  Assets as
currently operated shall have been obtained.

                  (ii) Either (A) the TPA Approval shall have been obtained,  or
(B) if the TPA  Approval  shall not have been  obtained on or prior to August 1,
2003,  then (x) Seller  shall have given such  notices and taken such actions as
necessary pursuant to Section 901 of the Trust Indenture governing the First HUD
Loan to allow the immediate  prepayment  of the First HUD Loan in full,  and (y)
the Second HUD Loan shall have become  prepayable (the "No TPA Approval  Closing
Condition").

              (e) Material Adverse Effect.  There shall not have occurred at any
time between the first day following the conclusion of the Diligence  Period and
the Closing Date any event, change, fact, circumstance or other occurrence which
has had,  or which  could be  reasonably  expected  to,  individually  or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

              (f) NOI Event.  Annualized NOI for the period beginning January 1,
2002 and ending on the last day of the month  immediately  prior to the month in
which the Closing  occurs shall be no less than the remainder of (i)  Annualized
NOI for the four-month  period ended April 30, 2002,  minus (ii)  $300,000.  The
term  "Annualized  NOI" means an amount equal to (x) the aggregate net operating
income  attributable  to the  Facilities for any period of months (in each case,
the  "Applicable  Period"),  calculated  on a basis  consistent  with the manner
presented to Buyer and as shown on Exhibit B attached hereto,  multiplied by (y)
the  quotient  of 12  divided  by the total  number of months in the  Applicable
Period.  As an  example  only,  if the net  operating  income of Seller  for the
four-month  period ended April 30, 2002 were to be $1,000,000,  then  Annualized
NOI would be $3,000,000 (calculated as $1,000,000 x (12/4)).

              (g) Real Estate.

                  (i)  Seller  shall  have  obtained  and  delivered  to Buyer a
written  consent for the  assignment  of the Ground  Leases from the landlord or
other party whose  consent  thereto is  required  under such Ground  Leases (the
"Ground Lease Consent"),  in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer
and Buyer's  lender,  if such Ground  Leases  shall  remain in effect  after the
Closing.

                  (ii) Except as otherwise provided in Section 12 hereof, Seller
shall have obtained and delivered to Buyer an estoppel  certificate with respect
to each of the Ground  Leases,  dated no more than thirty (30) days prior to the
Closing Date,  from the other party to such Ground Lease,  in a form  reasonably
acceptable to Buyer,  and which, in the case of the Ground Lease with respect to
the HUD Facility,  shall include,  without  limitation,  affirmation of tenant's
purchase option contained therein.

                  (iii)  Seller shall have  obtained  and  delivered to Buyer an
estoppel  certificate  with  respect to the ALSA  Agreement,  dated no more than

affidavits dated as of the Closing Date and in form and substance required under
the Treasury Regulations issued pursuant to Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue
Code so that Buyer is exempt from  withholding any portion of the Purchase Price
thereunder.

                  (v) To the extent that Buyer has  identified any lien that (A)
Seller  has,  at any time from the end of the  Diligence  Period to the  Closing
Date,  caused or permitted to be imposed on the Senior  Living Assets and (B) if
in existence  prior to the end of the  Diligence  Period,  and if  discovered by
Buyer  prior  to the end of the  Diligence  Period,  would  have  constituted  a
"Diligence  Period Lien," Seller shall,  on or prior to the Closing Date, pay or
discharge in full such lien (or agree to reduce the Purchase Price by any unpaid
amount), except for any such lien that Seller is contesting in good faith, as to
which  Seller  shall  have  provided  a bond or  other  commercially  reasonable
security.

         14. SELLER'S  OBLIGATION TO CLOSE.  Seller's  obligation to close under
this Agreement is subject to the  fulfillment on or prior to the Closing Date of

conditions;  provided, however, that in the event that the closing date shall be
extended with respect to the HUD Facility pursuant to the terms hereof, the only
conditions  to the  closing  with  respect  to the  HUD  Facility  shall  be the

interfere with or obtain  substantial  monetary  damages in connection  with the
consummation  of  the  transactions  contemplated  by  this  Agreement,  or  the
operation of the Senior Living Assets by Buyer.

              (d) Consents, Licensing, Etc.

federal,  state or local  regulatory  agency to permit Seller to consummate  the

                  (ii) (A) Buyer's  breach of or failure to perform any covenant
         or agreement in this  Agreement  requiring  performance  by Buyer on or
         after the Closing Date or (B) Buyer's breach of any  representation  or
         warranty in this Agreement which survives the Closing.

provided,  however,  that no Seller Indemnified Party shall have any claim under
clause (ii)(B) above for any breach of a representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement or the other agreements  contemplated hereby if Seller had actual
knowledge of such breach at the time of the Closing; and, provided further, that
Buyer  shall  not have any  liability  whatsoever  to the  extent  that a Seller
Indemnified  Party  had  otherwise  been  compensated  for  such  matter  as  an
adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to the terms of this Agreement  (other
than this Section 16(b)).

                                      -37-

         (c)  Exclusive  Remedy.  Except  for an action  commenced  pursuant  to
Section 20, any claim or cause of action based on, arising out of or relating in
any way to any of the transactions  contemplated under this Agreement (including
all  Schedules  attached  hereto) must be brought by either party in  accordance
with the  provisions  and  limitations  of this  Section 16,  whether such claim
arises out of any contract,  tort or  otherwise,  except for claims or causes of
action  based on fraud.  Except as  otherwise  provided in this  Agreement,  the
parties hereby waive to the fullest extent  permitted under  applicable law, any
and all  rights,  claims and causes of action they may have  against  each other
relating  to the  subject  matter of this  Agreement  and the  other  agreements
contemplated  hereby arising under or based on any federal,  state,  provincial,
local or foreign  statute,  law,  ordinance,  rule or  regulation  or otherwise,
including such rights, claims and causes of action Buyer may have against Seller
under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,  Compensation and Liability Act,
42 U.S.C., Section 9601, et seq., breaches of statutory or implied warranties or
otherwise,   nuisance  or  other  tort   actions,   and  common  law  rights  of
contribution.

         (d)  Procedures  Relating  to  Indemnification  Among Buyer and Seller.
Following  the discovery of any facts or  conditions  which could  reasonably be
expected to give rise to a Loss or Losses for which  indemnification is provided
under  this  Agreement,  the party  seeking  indemnification  (the  "Indemnified
Party") shall, as promptly as reasonably  possible  thereafter,  provide written
notice  to the party  from whom  indemnification  is sought  (the  "Indemnifying
Party"),  setting  forth the specific  facts and  circumstances,  in  reasonable
detail,  relating  to such Loss or Losses and the amount of Loss or Losses (or a
reasonable, good-faith estimate thereof if the actual amount is not known or not
capable  of  reasonable  calculation)   ("Indemnification  Notice");   provided,
however,  that  failure to give such  Indemnification  Notice on a timely  basis
shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the
Indemnifying  Party shall have been  actually  and  materially  prejudiced  as a
result of such failure.

         (e) Procedures Relating to Indemnification for Third Party Claims.

                  (i) In order for an  Indemnified  Party to be  entitled to any
indemnification  provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out of
or involving a claim or demand made by any Person  (other than any party to this
Agreement  or its  affiliates)  against the  Indemnified  Party (a "Third  Party
Claim"),  such Indemnified Party must provide an  Indemnification  Notice to the
Indemnifying  Party of the Third Party Claim as promptly as reasonably  possible
after  receipt by such  Indemnified  Party of notice of the Third  Party  Claim.
Thereafter,  the  Indemnified  Party shall  deliver to the  Indemnifying  Party,
within five (5) business days after the  Indemnified  Party's  receipt  thereof,
copies of all notices and documents  (including  court  papers)  received by the
Indemnified  Party relating to the Third Party Claim;  provided,  however,  that
failure to provide an  Indemnification  Notice, or deliver copies of all notices
and documents, in a timely manner shall not affect the indemnification  provided
hereunder except to the extent the  Indemnifying  Party shall have been actually
prejudiced as a result of such failure.

                  (ii) If a Third  Party  Claim is made  against an  Indemnified
Party,  the  Indemnifying  Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense
thereof and, if it so chooses and  acknowledges  its obligation to indemnify the
Indemnified Party therefor,  to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected
by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably  satisfactory to the

                                      -38-
<PAGE>

Indemnified  Party.  Notwithstanding  any  acknowledgment  made  pursuant to the
immediately  preceding  sentence,  the  Indemnifying  Party shall continue to be
entitled  to  assert  any  limitation  on  its  indemnification   responsibility
contained in Sections 16(g),  16(h),  16(i) and 16(j).  Should the  Indemnifying
Party so elect to assume the defense of a Third Party  Claim,  the  Indemnifying
Party  shall  not  be  liable  to  the  Indemnified  Party  for  legal  expenses
subsequently  incurred by the  Indemnified  Party in connection with the defense
thereof.  If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense,  the Indemnified Party
shall  have the  right to  participate  in the  defense  thereof  and to  employ
counsel,  at  its  own  expense,  separate  from  the  counsel  employed  by the
Indemnifying  Party, it being understood,  however,  that the Indemnifying Party
shall control such defense.  The Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the fees
and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified  Party for any period during
which the  Indemnifying  Party  has not  assumed  the  defense  thereof.  If the
Indemnifying  Party  chooses to defend any Third  Party  Claim,  all the parties
hereto shall  cooperate in the defense or prosecution of such Third Party Claim.
Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying  Party's
request) the  provision  to the  Indemnifying  Party of records and  information
which are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making officers and
employees  available  on a  mutually  convenient  basis  to  provide  additional
information  and  explanation  of  any  material  provided  hereunder.   If  the
Indemnifying  Party shall have assumed the defense of a Third Party  Claim,  the
Indemnifying  Party shall not admit any  liability  with  respect to, or settle,
compromise  or  discharge,  or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect
to, such Third Party Claim without the Indemnified Party's prior written consent
if such admission,  settlement,  compromise,  discharge, or consent (i) does not
include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff
to such  Indemnified  Party of a release  from all  liability in respect of such
Third Party Claim, or (ii) would result in injunctive or other equitable  relief
being imposed against the Indemnified Party.

         (f) Losses Net of Insurance and Taxes. The amount of any and all Losses
under this Section 16 and elsewhere under this Agreement shall be determined net
of any amounts  recovered by the  Indemnified  Party under  insurance  policies,
indemnities,  or other  reimbursement  arrangements with respect to such Losses.
Each party hereby waives, or agrees to use its commercially  reasonable  efforts
to procure the waiver of, any subrogation  rights that its insurer may have with
respect to any indemnifiable  Losses.  The amount of any and all Losses shall be
reduced by the amount of any net  reduction  in Tax  payable by the  Indemnified
Party in connection with such Losses through and including the Tax year in which
the indemnification payment is made, calculated by assuming that the Indemnified
Party is subject to an income tax rate of 40%. Any indemnity  payment under this
Agreement  shall be  treated  as an  adjustment  to the  Purchase  Price for tax
purposes.

         (g) Survival;  Time Limitation.  The  representations and warranties in
this Agreement shall terminate at the close of business on the first anniversary
of the Closing Date  (except to the extent  otherwise  required  with respect to
Section 9(g).  Any claim by any Buyer  Indemnified  Party for indemnity  arising
under this  Agreement  shall be brought  within  twelve  (12)  months  after the
Closing Date; provided,  however, Buyer shall not be permitted to make any claim
for  Losses  as to which  Buyer  has a right to  reimbursement  under  any title
policies that it obtains. A claim shall be deemed to have been brought only upon
delivery  of a proper  Indemnification  Notice to the other  party at the notice
address  set forth in Section 21 . Any claim  required  to be made  within  such
twelve (12) month period not so timely made shall be forever barred.

                                      -39-
<PAGE>

         (h) Monetary Limitation. Buyer shall have no claim under this Agreement
against  Seller or any of its  affiliates  for any  Losses  unless and until the
aggregate  of all such Losses  incurred or  sustained  by the Buyer  Indemnified
Parties  exceeds one percent (1%) of the Purchase  Price (the  "Threshold")  and
then only for the excess over the Threshold.

         (i)  Limitation  of  Liability.   Seller's   aggregate   liability  for
indemnification  pursuant to this  Agreement  shall in no event exceed an amount
equal to twenty percent (20%) of the Purchase Price.

         (j) Mitigation.  Each party hereto shall take all reasonable  steps and
use all commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any and all Losses.

         (k)  Losses.  As used in this  Agreement,  "Losses"  means  any and all
costs,  claims,  losses,  liabilities,  obligations  (including  corrective  and
remedial obligations), damages and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and
expenses but excluding any liability  relating to  consequential  damages,  lost
profits or punitive damages).

         17. APPORTIONMENTS.

              (a)  General.  The  following  items shall be  apportioned  at the
Closing on an accrual  basis as of the close of business on the day  immediately
preceding  the Closing Date  (except to the extent the same are included  within
Current Accounts Receivable, Inventory or Accounts Payable):

                  (i) Rents and other amounts payable under the Ground Leases;

                  (ii) Debt service and other  amounts  payable  under the First
         HUD Loan and the Second HUD Loan;

                  (iii) Amounts payable under Facilities Agreements;

                  (iv) Amounts payable with respect to the tangible  assets,  as
         listed in Schedule 7(g);

                  (v) Fuel, electric, water and other utility costs;

                  (vi) Municipal assessments and governmental license and permit
         fees;

                  (vii) Real estate and personal  property taxes and assessments
         other  than  special  assessments,  based  on the  rates  and  assessed
         valuation applicable in the fiscal year for which assessed;

                  (viii) Water rates and charges;

                  (ix) Sewer and vault taxes;

                  (x) Any other  prepaid  expenses  related to the Senior Living
         Assets; and

                                      -40-
<PAGE>

                  (xi) Any  other  assets,  liabilities  and  items of income or
         expense   normally   apportioned   in  sales  of  property  in  similar
         situations, if not already included within the items described above in
         this Section 17, all  determined in accordance  with GAAP  consistently
         applied.

If any of the  foregoing  cannot be  apportioned  at the Closing  because of the
unavailability  of the amounts which are to be apportioned,  such items shall be
apportioned  on the basis of a good  faith  estimate  by the  parties,  and such
apportionments  shall be reconciled as part of the adjustment process in Section
17(h).

              (b) Water,  Gas or Electric.  If there are water,  gas or electric
meters located at the Facilities, Seller shall obtain readings thereof to a date
not more than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing  Date and the unfixed  water
rates and charges,  sewer taxes and rents and gas and  electricity  charges,  if
any, based thereon for the intervening time shall be apportioned on the basis of
such last  readings.  If such  readings are not  obtainable by the Closing Date,
then, at the Closing, any water rates and charges, sewer taxes and rents and gas
and electricity charges which are based on such readings shall be prorated based
upon the per diem  charges  obtained by using the most  recent  period for which
such  readings  shall then be available.  Upon the taking of  subsequent  actual
readings,  the apportionment of such charges shall be recalculated and Seller or
Buyer, as the case may be, promptly shall make a payment to the other based upon
such recalculations.  The parties agree to make such final recalculations within
sixty (60) days after the Closing Date.

              (c) Real Property  Taxes. If any refunds of real property taxes or
assessments,  water  rates and  charges or sewer  taxes and rents  shall be made
after the  Closing,  the same shall be held in trust by Seller or Buyer,  as the
case may be, and shall first be applied to the  unreimbursed  costs  incurred in
obtaining the same, then to any required refunds to residents under the Resident
Agreements,  and the  balance,  if any,  shall be paid to Seller (for the period
prior to the  Closing  Date) and to Buyer  (for the period  commencing  with the
Closing Date).

              (d)  Assessments.  If, on the Closing Date,  any of the Facilities
shall be or shall have been  affected  by any special or general  assessment  or
assessments  or real  property  taxes  payable on a lump sum or which are or may
become payable in installments  of which the first  installment is then a charge
or lien and has  become  payable,  Seller  shall  pay or cause to be paid at the
Closing  the unpaid  installments  of such  assessments  (but only to the extent
attributable to periods prior to the Closing Date).

              (e)  Insurance.   No  insurance  policies  of  Seller  are  to  be
transferred to Buyer,  and no  apportionment  of the premiums  therefor shall be
made.

              (f)  Deposits  and  Escrows.  At the  Closing,  (i)  Seller  shall
transfer  to Buyer all of the  Assumed  Accounts,  and (ii)  Buyer  shall pay to
Seller  an  amount  equal  to all  of the  Seller  Deposits.  The  apportionment
provisions of Section 17(a) shall not apply to these Assumed Liabilities.

              (g) Accrued Vacation.  On the Closing Date, Seller shall pay Buyer
an amount equal to Seller's  liabilities  for accrued  vacation  benefits as set
forth on Schedule 7(v) relating to

                                      -41-
<PAGE>
the  Transferred  Employees  and, in  connection  therewith,  Buyer shall assume
Seller's  obligation to pay the same.  The  apportionment  provisions of Section
17(a) shall not apply to these Assumed Liabilities.

              (h) Purchase Price Adjustment.

                  (i) At least  three (3)  business  days prior to the  Closing,
Seller  shall in good  faith  determine  an  estimate  of the  Current  Accounts
Receivable, the value of the inventory at the Facilities (the "Inventory"),  and
all Accounts Payable,  in each case as of the Closing Date. Seller shall provide
Buyer with a schedule of the Current Accounts Receivable, Inventory and Accounts
Payable for  purposes of this  Section 17. Such  determination  shall be made in
accordance with generally accepted  accounting  principles ("GAAP)  consistently
applied  using the then  available  information  of Seller and  consistent  with
Seller's past practice (to the extent in accordance with GAAP). Buyer shall have
an  opportunity  to review and approve these items,  which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

                  (ii) The Purchase Price shall be reduced  dollar-for-dollar by
the amount,  if any,  by which the  Accounts  Payable  exceed the sum of Current
Accounts Receivable plus the Inventory. The Purchase Price shall be increased by
the amount,  if any, by which the sum of Current  Accounts  Receivable  plus the
Inventory exceeds Accounts Payable. The Purchase Price shall be further adjusted
in respect of the  apportionments  pursuant to this Section 17(a),  (b), (c) and
(d)).  The  aggregate  amount of the  adjustments  made pursuant to this Section
17(h) (ii)) shall be the  "Preliminary  Closing  Adjustment." If a net amount is
owed by Seller to Buyer as a result of such apportionments, such amount shall be
credited  against the Purchase Price. If a net amount is owed by Buyer to Seller
as a result of such  apportionments,  such amount shall be added to the Purchase
Price.

                  (iii) As promptly as practicable, but no later than forty-five
(45) days after the Closing Date, Seller will cause to be prepared and delivered
to Buyer a statement  setting forth  Seller's  final  calculation of the Current
Accounts Receivable,  the Inventory, the Accounts Payable (which may include any
Inventory, Current Accounts Receivable or Accounts Payable that should have been
included as of the Closing but were not included in the list that was  delivered
pursuant to Section 17(h) (i) ), as well as any amounts that either could not be
apportioned at the Closing (as  contemplated by Section 17(a) , (b) , (c) or (d)
) or that  were  apportioned  on the basis of  estimates  now  capable  of being
finalized and adjusted (collectively, all such items to constitute the "Seller's
Final  Closing  Items").  The Seller's  Final  Closing  Items shall  reflect the
covered items as at the close of business on the day  immediately  preceding the
Closing Date and shall be derived from the Seller's  financial  statements as of
the day immediately  preceding the Closing Date,  prepared on a basis consistent
with those  used in the  preparation  of the Most  Recent  Balance  Sheet and in
accordance  with  accounting  policies  and  practices  that  were  used  in the
preparation of the Most Recent Balance Sheet.

                  (iv) Any payments  shown to be due to Buyer or Seller when the
difference  between the  Preliminary  Closing  Adjustment and the Seller's Final
Closing  Items is  calculated  shall  be paid by wire  transfer  of  immediately
available  funds no more than ten (10) days  after the  Seller's  Final  Closing
Items have been determined.

                                      -42-
<PAGE>

                  (v) HUD Facility  Purchase  Price  Adjustment.  At the closing
with respect to the HUD  Facility (if separate  from the Closing with respect to
the other  Facilities,  as  contemplated  by Section  6(b) ), (a)  Seller  shall
transfer to Buyer,  and Buyer  shall be  entitled to retain,  any amount of cash
held in the HUD Facility  Operating  Account as of the closing date with respect
to the HUD Facility  and (b) Seller and Buyer shall  reconcile  all  adjustments
required  hereunder  with  respect to the HUD  Facility  as if the  closing  had
occurred on and as of the Closing Date,  taking into account payments made by or
on behalf of Buyer and Seller under the Interim Management Agreement.

              (i) Survival.  The provisions of this Section 17 shall survive the
Closing hereunder.

         18. RECORDS/LITIGATION AND TAX MATTERS.

              (a) After the Closing Date,  Buyer shall provide to Seller and its
affiliates (and their counsel, auditors, accountants,  agents, advisors or other
representatives)  reasonable  access to the  Purchased  Assets and  permit  such
Person to remove  Excluded  Assets  and take  copies of any  books,  records  or
accounts  relating to the Senior Living Assets as conducted or operated prior to
the  Closing  Date;  and Buyer  shall not  destroy or dispose of any such books,
records and accounts  without first  offering to surrender to Seller such books,
records and accounts which Buyer may intend to destroy or dispose of.

              (b)  After  the  Closing  Date,  each  party  shall  provide  such
assistance  as the  other  party  may from time to time  reasonably  request  in
connection with the preparation of tax returns  required to be filed,  any audit
or other  examination by any taxing  authority,  any judicial or  administrative
proceeding  relating to liability for taxes,  or any claim for refund in respect
of such taxes or in connection  with any litigation and  proceedings  related to
the Senior Living  Assets,  including  making  available  documents,  witnesses,
employees for interviews,  litigation preparation and testimony.  The requesting
party shall reimburse the assisting party for the  out-of-pocket  costs incurred
by the assisting party.

              (c) The parties  agree that (i) on and prior to the  closing  date
with respect to the HUD Facility,  the  Heartlands  Entities shall remain in the
consolidated  group of Seller for federal income Tax purposes (and, that similar
treatment  shall be accorded the Heartlands  Entities for state and local income
Tax purposes), (ii) Seller shall have sole responsibility, authority and control
over the Tax  returns  filed with  respect to the  Heartlands  Entities  for all
periods  ending on or before the closing date with respect to the HUD  Facility,
and (iii) Seller shall be responsible for all Taxes (including  payment thereof)
relating  to such Tax returns  (except  that Buyer and the  Heartlands  Entities
shall be responsible  for the Taxes of the Heartlands  Entities  attributable to
the day of closing for the HUD  Facility,  and shall  reimburse  Seller for such
Taxes paid by Seller).  Buyer agrees to  reasonably  cooperate in providing  any
records,  information  and documents to Seller to enable Seller to file such Tax
returns.  With respect to Tax returns (if any) filed for the Heartlands Entities
that include both periods  before and after the closing date with respect to the
HUD Facility ("Straddle Returns"),  Buyer shall have sole responsibility to file
such Straddle  Returns,  provided that Seller shall have the right to review and
comment on such Straddle  Returns  prior to their  filing,  that Seller shall be
responsible for all Taxes  (including  payment thereof) on such Straddle Returns
attributable to the

                                      -43-
<PAGE>

portion of the taxable  period prior to the closing date with respect to the HUD
Facility and that Buyer and Seller shall  negotiate in good faith to resolve any
disputes with respect to such Straddle Returns. Seller will reasonably cooperate
in providing any records, information, and documents to Buyer to enable Buyer to
file such Straddle  Returns.  In the event that Buyer and Seller fail to resolve
any dispute with respect to any such Straddle Return,  then any disputed aspects
shall be  resolved  before  the last day on which  such  Straddle  Return is due
(taking into account any  extensions) by a "big four"  accounting  firm mutually
agreed  upon by Buyer and Seller  having no  material  relationship  with either
Buyer or Seller.

         19. TERMINATION RIGHTS.

              (a) This  Agreement  may be  terminated  at any time  prior to the
Closing Date as follows and in no other manner:

                  (i) by mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller;

                  (ii) by Buyer,  if any of the  conditions set forth in Section
         13 (other than  Section  13(d) (ii)) shall not have been  fulfilled or
         waived by Buyer on and as of the Closing Date (provided,  however, that
         Buyer  is  not  then  in  material   breach  of  its   representations,
         warranties, contracts or agreements contained in this Agreement);

                  (iii) by Seller, if any of the conditions set forth in Section
         14 (other than  Section  14(d) (ii)) shall not have been  fulfilled  or
         waived by Seller on and as of the Closing Date (provided, however, that
         Seller  is  not  then  in  material  breach  of  its   representations,
         warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement); or

                  (iv) by Buyer, if a Deposit Return Event occurs.

              (b) In the event of  termination  by Buyer or Seller  pursuant  to
this Section 19, written  notice  thereof shall  forthwith be given to the other
party and the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement shall be terminated,
without  further action by any party. If the  transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement are terminated as provided herein:

                  (i) Buyer shall return to Seller all  documents and copies and
         other  materials  received from or on behalf of Seller  relating to the
         transactions  contemplated hereby,  whether so obtained before or after
         the execution hereof; and

                  (ii) all  confidential  information  received  by  Buyer  with
         respect to the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities and the Senior
         Living  Assets  shall be  treated  in  accordance  with the  terms  and
         conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full
         force and effect notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement.

              (c)  If  this  Agreement  is  terminated   and  the   transactions
contemplated  hereby  are  abandoned  as  described  in this  Section  19,  this
Agreement  shall become void and of no further force and effect,  except for the
provisions of:

                                      -44-
<PAGE>

                  (i) Section  10(b) (i) relating to the  obligation of Buyer to
         keep confidential certain information and data obtained by it;

                  (ii)  Section  23  relating  to  publicity;

                  (iii) Section 27 relating to certain expenses;

                  (iv)  Sections  7(f) and 9(f)  relating to  finder's  fees and
         broker's fees; and

                  (v) this Section 19.

         Nothing in this  Section  19 shall be deemed to release  any party from
any liability  for any breach by such party of the terms and  provisions of this
Agreement or to impair the right of any party to compel specific  performance by
another party of its obligations under this Agreement.

         20. SPECIFIC  PERFORMANCE.  Each party hereto  acknowledges  and agrees
that the  other  party  would be  damaged  irreparably  in the  event any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific
terms or otherwise are breached.  Accordingly, each party hereto agrees that the
other  party  shall be  entitled  to an  injunction  or  injunctions  to prevent
breaches of the  provisions of this Agreement and to enforce  specifically  this
Agreement and the terms and  provisions  hereof in any action  instituted in any
court of the United States or any state  thereof  having  jurisdiction  over the
parties hereto and the matter (subject to the provisions set forth in Section 22

terms hereof may be properly  venued in, and shall be brought in, the federal or
state courts located in the City of Baltimore,  Maryland on an exclusive  basis.
Each party hereto agrees that it shall submit to the jurisdiction of such courts
for purposes of actions to enforce the terms of this Agreement.

         23.  PUBLICITY.  Buyer and  Seller  agree  that,  from the date  hereof
through  and  including  the Closing  Date,  no public  release or  announcement
concerning the transactions  contemplated  hereby shall be issued or made by any
party hereto  without the prior consent of the other party (which  consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld), except (a) as such release or

                                      -46-
<PAGE>
announcement  may  be  required  by  law  or the  rules  or  regulations  of any
securities  exchange  or state  regulatory  requirements  (or in the  opinion of
counsel such release or  announcement  is appropriate  or desirable  under or in
light of such laws and regulations),  in which case the party making the release
or announcement  shall allow the other party  reasonable time to comment on such
release or  announcement  in advance of such  issuance and (b) that,  subject to
Buyer's  prior  approval  (not to be  unreasonably  withheld)  of the  form  and
substance  thereof,  Seller  may make  such an  announcement  to its  employees.
Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  Buyer and Seller shall  cooperate to prepare a
joint press  release to be issued on the Closing  Date and,  upon the request of
either  Buyer or Seller,  at the time of the signing of this  Agreement  (except
that in no event shall any such press  release  issued by any party  hereto name
any other party hereto  without such other party's prior approval which will not
be  unreasonably  withheld).  Buyer and  Seller  agree to keep the terms of this
Agreement  confidential,  except to the extent required by applicable law or for
financial reporting purposes and except that the parties may disclose such terms
to their respective counsel, auditors,  accountants,  agents, advisors and other
representatives  as necessary in connection  with the ordinary  conduct of their
respective  businesses  (so long as such Persons are obligated to keep the terms
of  this  Agreement  confidential).  Notwithstanding  anything  to the  contrary
contained herein, either party may withhold its consent in its sole and absolute
discretion to any mention of its name in any public release or announcement.

         24. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This Agreement,  the attached  Schedules and the
agreements referred to herein or executed simultaneously herewith, set forth the
entire agreement and understanding of the parties in respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby and supersede all prior agreements, arrangements
and undertakings, whether written or oral, relating to the subject matter hereof
(other than the Access  Letter and the  Confidentiality  Agreement,  which shall
continue  in  effect).   Except  as  otherwise  specifically  provided  in  this
Agreement,  no  conditions,  usage of trade,  course of dealing or  performance,
understanding or agreement purporting to modify, vary, explain or supplement the
terms or conditions of this Agreement  will be binding unless  hereafter made in
writing  and  signed  by the  party to be  bound,  and no  modification  will be
effected by the  acknowledgment  or acceptance of documents  containing terms or
conditions at variance with or in addition to those set forth in this Agreement,
except as otherwise specifically agreed to by the parties in writing.

         25. ASSIGNMENT. This Agreement and any rights and obligations hereunder
shall  not be  assignable  or  transferable  by Buyer or  Seller  (including  by
operation  of law in  connection  with a  merger  or sale of  stock,  or sale of
substantially  all the assets,  of Buyer or Seller)  without  the prior  written
consent of the other party,  and any purported  assignment  without such consent
shall be void and  without  effect;  provided,  however,  that each of Buyer and
Seller may (a) assign any or all of its rights and interests hereunder to one or
more of its  affiliates  and (b)  designate  one or  more of its  affiliates  to
perform  its  obligations  hereunder;   and,  provided  further,  however,  that
notwithstanding  such  assignment,   each  of  Buyer  and  Seller  shall  remain
responsible for the performance of all of its respective obligations hereunder.

         26.  AMENDMENT AND WAIVER.  This  Agreement  may be amended,  modified,
superseded  or  canceled,  and  any of the  terms,  covenants,  representations,
warranties  or  conditions  hereof may be waived,  only by a written  instrument
executed by the parties hereto,  or, in the case of a waiver, by or on behalf of
the party waiving  compliance.  The failure of any party at any time or times to
require  performance of any provision hereof shall in no manner affect the

                                      -47-
<PAGE>
right at a later  time to  enforce  the  same.  No  waiver  by any  party of any
condition,  or of any breach of any term,  covenant,  representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to be
or construed as a further or continuing  waiver of any such  condition or breach
or a waiver of any other condition or of any breach of any other term, covenant,
representation or warranty.

         27. EXPENSES.  Whether or not the transactions  contemplated hereby are

transactions contemplated hereby, including legal, due diligence, accounting and
investment banking fees and expenses,  shall be paid by the party incurring such
costs or expenses.

         28.  HEADINGS.  The section and  paragraph  headings  contained in this

                  (d) references to Schedules are to schedules  attached to this
         Agreement, each of which is hereby incorporated and made a part of this
         Agreement for all purposes as if set forth in full herein;

                  (e)  the  words  "including,"  "include,"  "includes"  and all
         variants thereof mean "including, without limitation;" and

         Agreement are to United States dollars.

         31.  NO  STRICT  CONSTRUCTION.   Notwithstanding  the  fact  that  this
Agreement  has been drafted or prepared by one of the parties,  Buyer and Seller
confirm that both they and their  respective  counsel have reviewed,  negotiated
and adopted  this  Agreement as the joint  agreement  and  understanding  of the
parties,  and the  language  used in this  Agreement  shall be

                                      -48-
<PAGE>
deemed to be the language  chosen by the parties  hereto to express their mutual
intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any Person.

         32.  SCHEDULES.  The disclosures in the schedules hereto (including any
disclosures made in amendments  pursuant to Section 1) (the "Schedules")  relate
only to the sections identified in such Schedules.  The inclusion of information

Assumed  Liabilities  or Seller.  Matters  listed on any one  Schedule  shall be
deemed  disclosed  with  reference to all sections of the  Schedules  and all of
Section 7 hereof.

         33. SEVERABILITY.  Whenever possible,  each provision of this Agreement
shall  be  interpreted  in  such  manner  as to be  valid  and  effective  under
applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement or the application of any
such provision to any Person or circumstance  shall be held invalid,  illegal or
unenforceable  in  any  respect  by a  court  of  competent  jurisdiction,  such
invalidity,  illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision
hereof.

indemnification  as set forth in Section 16 and  except as  otherwise  expressly

with either Seller or Buyer.

              (d)  Seller  shall be solely  responsible  for the  payment of any
