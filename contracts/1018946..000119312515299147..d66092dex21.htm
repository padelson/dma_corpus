ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

ARTICLE II

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON SHARE CAPITAL

Section 2.01 _Effect of the Merger on Share Capital_. At the Effective Time,
as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company or the holder of any share capital of Parent, Merger
Sub or the Company:

 

(a) _Cancellation of Certain Company Common Shares_. Each Company Common Share
that is owned by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company (as treasury shares or
otherwise) or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiaries will automatically be cancelled and retired and will cease to
exist, and no consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(b) _Conversion of Company Common Shares_. Each Company Common Share issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i)
shares to be cancelled and retired in accordance with _Section 2.01(a)_, and
(ii) Dissenting Shares) will be converted into the right to receive $65.00 in
cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

(c) _Cancellation of Shares_. All Company Common Shares will no longer be
outstanding and all Company Common Shares will be cancelled and retired and
will cease to

 



-3- ##### Table of Contents

  

 exist, and, subject to _Section 2.03_, each holder of a certificate
formerly representing any such shares (each, a " _Certificate_ ") or of Book-
Entry Shares will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
(subject to _Section 2.01(a)_) the right to receive the Merger Consideration
in accordance with _Section 2.02_.

 

(d) _Conversion of Merger Sub Share Capital_. Each common share, par value
$0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one newly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable common share, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Company.

 

Section 2.02 _Surrender and Payment_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a paying agent
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") to act as the
agent for payment of the Merger Consideration for: (i) the Certificates, or
(ii) book-entry shares which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented the Company Common Shares (the " _Book-Entry Shares_ "). Parent
will enter into a paying agent agreement with the Exchange Agent in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Company at least two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or cause the Surviving Company to deposit in trust, with the Exchange
Agent, sufficient cash in U.S. dollars to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration that is payable in respect of all of the issued and outstanding
Company Common Shares represented by the Certificates and the Book-Entry
Shares, other than Dissenting Shares and shares to be cancelled and retired
pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)_ (such aggregate amount as deposited with the
Exchange Agent, the " _Payment Fund_ "). If for any reason (including losses)
the Payment Fund is at any time inadequate to pay the amounts to which holders
of Company Common Shares shall be entitled under _Section 2.02(b)_, Parent
shall take all steps necessary to enable or cause the Surviving Company
promptly to deposit in trust additional cash in U.S. dollars with the Exchange
Agent sufficient to make all payments required under this Agreement, and
Parent and the Surviving Company shall in any event be liable for the payment
thereof. The Exchange Agent shall cause the Payment Fund to be (i) held for
the benefit of the holders of record of Company Common Stock (other than the
Dissenting Shares and any shares to be cancelled and retired pursuant to
_Section 2.01(a)_) and (ii) applied promptly to making the payments pursuant
to _Section 2.02(b)_. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose
other than to fund payments pursuant to  _Section 2.02(b)_, except as
expressly provided for in this Agreement. Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Company to, pay all fees and expenses of the Exchange Agent,
including those in connection with the exchange of Company Common Shares for
the Merger Consideration. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time and in any event no later than the third (3rd) Business Day
following the Closing, Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent
to send, to each record holder of Company Common Shares at the Effective Time
(other than any shares to be cancelled and retired pursuant to _Section
2.01(a)_), a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that
the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares
to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that _,_ with respect to any holder
of Company Common Shares whose shares were converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to  _Section 2.01(b)_ and who appears at
the Closing in person or by authorized representative, Parent and Surviving
Company shall, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to, provide the Letter of
Transmittal to such holder at the Closing.

 



-4- ##### Table of Contents

  

(b) Each holder of Company Common Shares that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration (other than the Dissenting Shares
and any shares cancelled and retired pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)_) shall be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Common
Shares represented by a Certificate or Book-Entry Share as promptly as
reasonably practicable following (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a
Certificate (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance
with _Section 2.05_), together with a duly completed and validly executed
Letter of Transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be requested
by the Exchange Agent, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange
Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may
reasonably request) in the case of Book-Entry Shares, together with such other
documents as may be reasonably requested by the Exchange Agent. No interest
shall be paid or accrued on the cash payable hereunder upon the surrender or
transfer of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share, and until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 2.02_, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the Company Common Shares theretofore represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares. Upon payment of the Merger Consideration
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_ , each Certificate or
Certificates so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled.

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Book-Entry Share, as applicable, is registered, it shall be a
condition to such payment that (i) such Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry
Share shall be properly transferred, and (ii) the Person requesting such
payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Tax required as
a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

(d) All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or transfer of Book-Entry
Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Company Common Shares
formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, and from and
after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers
of Company Common Shares on the share transfer books of the Surviving Company.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are
presented to the Surviving Company, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for
the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures
set forth, in this _Article II_.

 

(e) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of
Company Common Shares nine (9) months after the Effective Time shall be
returned to the Surviving Company, and any such holder who has not exchanged
Company Common Shares (other than Dissenting Shares and shares cancelled and
retired pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)_) for the Merger Consideration
in accordance with this _Section 2.02_ prior to that time shall thereafter
look only to the Surviving Company for payment of the Merger Consideration.
Notwithstanding

 the foregoing, none of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Company, the Exchange Agent, or any other Person shall be liable to any holder
of Company Common Shares for any amounts paid to a Governmental Entity
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders by the earlier of the fifth (5th)
anniversary of the Closing Date and such time at which such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity shall
become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

(f) The Exchange Agent shall invest all cash included in the Payment Fund as
reasonably directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that any investment of
such cash shall be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term
obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S.
government. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be paid to Parent pursuant to _Section 2.02(e)_. Nothing contained
herein and no investment losses resulting from investment of the Payment Fund
shall diminish the rights of any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
to receive the Merger Consideration as provided herein.

 

Section 2.03 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, including  _Section 2.01_, Company Common Shares
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.01(a)_) and held by a holder
who (i) has made written objection to the Merger in advance of the
Shareholders Meeting called in accordance with _Section 5.04_ and (ii) has
properly exercised dissenters rights with respect to such shares in
accordance with Section 83 of the IBCA (such Company Common Shares being
referred to collectively as the " _Dissenting Shares_ " until such time as
such holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses such holders right to dissent
and payment under the IBCA with respect to such shares) shall not be
converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead shall
be entitled to only such rights as are granted by Section 83 of the IBCA;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails
to perfect, withdraws or loses such holders right to dissent and payment
pursuant to Section 83 of the IBCA or if a court of competent jurisdiction
shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by
Section 83 of the IBCA, such Company Common Shares shall be treated as if they
had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.02(b)_, without interest
thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate (or effective affidavits of loss
in lieu thereof) formerly representing such share or transfer of such Book-
Entry Share, as the case may be. The Company shall provide Parent prompt
written notice of any written objections or elections to dissent received by
the Company, and Parent shall have the opportunity and right to participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the
prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Company shall not make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

 

Section 2.04 _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this
Agreement, if at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
share capital of the Company shall occur (other than the issuance of
additional shares of share capital of the Company not in violation of this
Agreement), including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization,
share split (including reverse share

 split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any share
dividend or distribution paid in shares, the Merger Consideration and any
other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately
adjusted to reflect such change.

Section 2.05 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person (in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent) claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably requested by Parent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such customary
terms as may be reasonably required by Parent as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it or the Surviving Company with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the Company Common Shares formerly represented by such Certificate as
contemplated under this _Article II_.

 

Section 2.06 _Treatment of Share Options, Restricted Shares and Other Share-
based Compensation_.

 

(a) The Company shall take all requisite action so that, at the Effective
Time, each option to acquire Company Common Shares (each, a " _Company Share
Option_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be, by virtue of the
consummation of the Merger, without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company, the holder of that Company Share Option or any other
Person and without regard to the level of achievement of any applicable
performance goals or targets, cancelled and converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (x) the
aggregate number of Company Common Shares subject to such Company Share
Option, multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over
the per share exercise price under such Company Share Option. Parent shall
cause the Surviving Company to pay the holders of Company Share Options the
amounts due under this _Section 2.06(a)_ in accordance with _Section
2.06(c)_.

 

(b) The Company shall take all requisite action so that, at the Effective
Time, each restricted share unit award, performance share unit award and
other right, contingent or accrued, to acquire or receive Company Common
Shares or benefits measured by the value of such shares, and each other award
of any kind consisting of Company Common Shares, other than Company Share
Options (each, a " _Company Share Award_ "), that may be held, awarded,
outstanding, payable or reserved for issuance under any Company Share Plan (as
defined below) immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then
vested, exercisable or free of restriction, shall be, by virtue of the
consummation of the Merger, without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company, the holder of that Company Share Award or any other Person
(and with the level of achievement of any applicable performance goals or
targets with respect to Company Share Awards whose vesting is contingent on
the achievement of performance goals or targets (such Company Share Awards, "
_Company Performance Share Awards_ ") deemed to have been achieved at the
lesser of (i) 150% of the target level and (ii) the maximum level (the lesser
of (i) and (ii), the " _Deemed Performance Level_ ")), vested, free of
restriction and cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount
in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of
Company Common Shares in respect of such Company Share Award multiplied by (y)
the Merger Consideration. Parent shall 

 



-7- ##### Table of Contents

  

 cause the Surviving Company to pay the holders of Company Share Awards the
amounts due under this _Section 2.06(b)_ in accordance with _Section
2.06(c)_. If any outstanding Company Performance Share Award that is unvested
as of the date hereof becomes vested pursuant to the terms of the applicable
award agreement prior to the Effective Time and vests at a level lower than
the Deemed Performance Level then, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
the holder of such Company Performance Share Award shall be issued such number
of Company Common Shares, if any, equal to the excess of (1) the number of
Company Common Shares that would have vested in respect of such Company
Performance Share Award if the performance goals or targets applicable to such
Company Performance Share Award had been achieved at the Deemed Performance
Level, over (2) the actual number of Company Common Shares that vested
in respect of such Company Performance Share Award from the date hereof to
the time immediately prior to the Effective Time (such additional Company
Common Shares, the " _True-Up Shares_ "), it being understood that in no event
shall the holder of any Company Performance Share Award be entitled to a
greater number of aggregate Company Common Shares in respect thereof than such
number as would have vested based on the Deemed Performance Level.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, this
_Section 2.06(b)_ shall not apply to any equity award granted pursuant to the
Contracts set forth under the heading "Obligations" on _Section 3.02(b)(i)_
of the Company Disclosure Letter and no such equity award shall be considered
a Company Share Award for purposes of this Agreement.

(c) When any payment pursuant to _Section 2.06(a)_ (in respect of Company
Share Options) or _Section 2.06(b)_ (in respect of Company Share Awards)
becomes payable at the Closing, any such payment shall first be made to the
regular payroll account of the Company, and the Company or the Surviving
Company, as applicable, shall pay to the applicable recipient of such payment
such amount, reduced by any required withholding Taxes in full payment
thereon, no later than five (5) days after the Effective Time. The amount of
any such withholding Taxes shall be treated as having been received by such
recipient for all purposes of this Agreement.

 

(d) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and the
compensation committee of the Company Board, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions (including obtaining any employee consents)
that may be necessary to effectuate the provisions of paragraphs (a), (b) and
(c) of this _Section 2.06_.

 

Section 2.07 _Withholding_. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that, except as
required pursuant to _Section 2.06(c)_, they are not aware of any
requirement to withhold or deduct any amounts for Taxes from any payment
pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Parent and
Merger Sub become aware that any Taxes are required to be withheld from any
amount payable pursuant to this Agreement under applicable Tax Law, Parent
shall promptly (but in any event no later than five (5) Business Days prior to
the time of such withholding, except to the extent resulting from a change in
Law that occurs within five (5) Business Days of the time of such
withholding) notify the Company, and Parent and the Company shall discuss the
requirement for such withholding in good faith; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such notice shall not apply with respect to any withholding Taxes required
pursuant to _Section 2.06(c)_. If Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, is
required to withhold Taxes from any such amount payable, then Parent or Merger
Sub, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause to be
deducted and withheld) from any amount payable pursuant to this

Section 4.04 _Financial Capability_.

 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company true and complete copies of (i) the
executed commitment letter from the lenders listed therein, including any
related fee letter in redacted form, dated as of the date hereof (as amended
or otherwise modified, in each case but only to the extent permitted under
_Section 5.14(a)_, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to which, and
subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the lender parties thereto have
committed to lend the amounts set forth therein to Merger Sub for the purpose
of funding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Debt
Financing_ ") and (ii) the executed equity commitment letter, dated as of the
date hereof (as amended or otherwise modified, in each case but only to the
extent permitted under _Section 5.14(a)_, the " _Equity Commitment Letter_ "
and, together with the Debt Commitment Letter, the " _Financing Commitments_
") from the investors listed therein pursuant to which, and subject to the
terms and conditions thereof, the investors parties thereto have committed to
invest the amounts set forth therein (the " _Equity Financing_ " and, together
with the Debt Financing, the " _Financing_ "). The Equity Commitment Letter
provides, and will continue to provide, that the Company is a third party
beneficiary thereto.

(b) As of the date hereof, all of the Financing Commitments are in full force
and effect and have not been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise amended,
supplemented or modified in any respect. Each of the Financing Commitments, in
the form so delivered, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent
and Merger Sub and, in the case of the Debt Commitment Letter only, to
Parents Knowledge, the other parties thereto. Except for a fee letter
relating to fees with respect to the Debt Financing (a complete copy of which
has been provided to the Company, with only fee amounts, market flex
provisions and certain other economic terms (none of which would adversely
affect the amount, conditionality, enforceability, termination or availability
of the Debt Financing) redacted), as of the date hereof there are no side
letters or other agreements, contracts or arrangements related to the funding
or investing, as applicable, of the Financing that could adversely affect the
availability, conditionality, timeliness or sufficiency of the Financing
other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments and delivered
to the Company prior to the date hereof. As of the date hereof, no event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would (i)
constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub under any
term, or a failure of any condition, of the Financing Commitments or (ii) to
Parents Knowledge, result in any portion of the Financing
contemplated thereby to be unavailable. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has
reason to believe that Parent would be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any
term or condition of the Financing Commitments required to be satisfied by it.
Parent and/or Merger Sub have fully paid any and all commitment fees or other
fees required by the Financing Commitments to be paid on or before the date of
this Agreement. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions to Parents 

 



-33- ##### Table of Contents

  

 obligation to consummate the Merger (as applicable), the aggregate proceeds
of the Financing, if funded in accordance with the Financing Commitments,
together with any cash on hand, will be sufficient to fund all of Parents
and Merger Subs obligations under _Article II_ of this Agreement, including
the treatment of Company Share Options and Company Share Awards pursuant to
_Section 2.06_ and payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section
2.02(b)_, and all payments, fees and expenses payable by the Company, Parent
or Merger Sub related to or arising out of the consummation of the

Amounts_ "), including the funding, refinancing or prepayment of any
indebtedness or other obligations of the Company or its Subsidiaries set forth
in the Companys balance sheet that become due or payable by the Company or
its Subsidiaries in connection with or as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the payment of all related fees and
expenses (collectively, the " _Refinancing Amounts_ "). There are

investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the Financing (including any
"flex provisions"), other than as expressly set forth in the Financing
Commitments.

Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company the Limited Guarantee duly
executed by the Guarantor. The Limited Guarantee is in full force and effect

be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium and other similar Laws
affecting creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity) and
no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default on the part of the Guarantor under the Limited
Guarantee.

Section 4.09 _Interest in Competitors_. None of Parent, Merger Sub or any of

the shares of share capital of the Surviving Company for its own account, for
investment purposes only and not with a view to the distribution (as such term

the payment of the Closing Amounts and all associated costs and expenses of
the Merger (including any the Refinancing Amounts) and all other amounts
required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, be Solvent at and after the Effective Time. As
used in this _Section 4.12_, the term "Solvent" means, with respect to a
particular date, that at such time, (a) the sum of the assets, at a fair
valuation, of Parent and Merger Sub (and, after the Merger, the Surviving
Company) (on a consolidated basis) and of each of them (on a standalone
basis) exceed their debts, (b) each of Parent and Merger Sub (and, after the
Merger, the Surviving Company) (on a consolidated basis) and each of them (on
a standalone basis) has not incurred and does not intend to incur, and does

such debts mature and (c) each of Parent and Merger Sub (and, after the
Merger, the Surviving Company) (on a consolidated basis) and each of them (on
a stand-alone basis) has sufficient capital and liquidity with which to
conduct its business. For purposes of this _Section 4.12_, "debt" means any
liability on a claim, and "claim" means any (x) right to payment, whether or
not such a right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed,
contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable,
secured or unsecured, and (y) any right to an equitable remedy for breach
of performance if such breach gives rise to a payment, whether or not such
right to an equitable remedy is reduced to judgment, fixed, contingent,
matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, secured or unsecured.

developments, discussions or negotiations regarding any Takeover Proposals,
or material changes to the terms of, any such Takeover Proposal or any
amendment thereto (including copies

 of any written proposed agreements). The Company hereby agrees that it shall
not, and shall not permit its Subsidiaries to, enter into any Contract that
prohibits or restricts it from providing to Parent the information
contemplated by this _Section 5.03(c)_.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  _Section 5.03_, at any
time following the date of the Solicitation Period End-Date and prior to
obtaining the Requisite Company Vote at a meeting called to consider the
Merger (the " _Shareholder Approval Date_ "), if the Company receives a _bona
fide_ written Takeover Proposal that did not result from a breach of _Section
5.03(b)_ or _Section 5.03(c)_, the Company may take the following actions, if
and only to the extent that, the Company Board or the Special Committee, if
such committee still exists, determines in good faith prior to taking any such
action described in clauses (A), (B) or (C), after consultation with outside
legal counsel and financial advisor, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes
or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal: (A) contact
such Third Party to clarify the terms and conditions thereof, (B) furnish
nonpublic information to the Third Party making such Takeover Proposal, if,
and only if, prior to so furnishing such information, the Company receives
from the third party an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (1) any non-public information concerning the Company or its
Subsidiaries that is provided or made available by the Company to any Third
Party given such access which was not previously provided or made available to
Parent shall be provided or made available to Parent
substantially concurrently, if such information is written, or otherwise
promptly thereafter (and in any event within two (2) Business Days), and (2)
the Company shall make available such portions of the Company Material
Contracts set forth on  _Section 3.14(a)(x)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter to the extent relating to any commercially sensitive information or
relating to pricing or other matters that are commercially sensitive or
competitive in nature, the exchange of which would reasonably be expected to
be harmful to the operations of the Company, in a manner no less favorable to
the Company in all material respects than the manner in which such portions of
such Contracts were made available to Parent; and (C) engage in discussions
or negotiations with the third party with respect to such Takeover Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, without limiting _Section 5.03(c)_, the
Company shall, prior to or substantially concurrently with engaging in such
discussions or negotiations, or reasonably promptly thereafter (and in any
event within two (2) Business Days), provide to Parent the material terms and
conditions of such Takeover Proposal (including copies of any such written
Takeover Proposal) made to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.03_, at any
time following the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the
Requisite Company Vote, the Company Board may: (A) effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change of the type contemplated by clause (1) of the definition
thereof (or agree to take such action) in response to an Intervening Event;
or (B) effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a
Superior Proposal and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.04(a)_ to enter into a definitive Company Acquisition Agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal so long as (x) in the case of clause (A) or
(B), the Company Board or the Special Committee, if such committee still
exists, concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such actions would be reasonably likely to
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Laws, and (y) in
the case of clause (B), such Superior Proposal did not result from a breach
of this _Section 5.03_; _provided, however,_ that, in each case, prior to
taking any of the actions set forth in clause (A) or (B) of this _Section
5.03(e)_:

 

(i) in the case of clause (A), (1) the Company Board or the Special Committee,
if such committee still exists, has given Parent at least four (4) Business
Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action which notice
will contain a reasonably detailed description of such Intervening Event and
the reasons for the proposed Company Adverse Recommendation Change, (2) after
providing such notice, the Company shall have negotiated, and shall have
caused its Representatives to negotiate, with Parent in good faith (to the
extent Parent desires to negotiate) during such four (4) Business Day period
to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions in this Agreement and the
Financing so that failure to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to such Intervening Event would not be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law
and (3) following the end of such notice period, the Company Board or the
Special Committee, if such committee still exists, shall have considered
in good faith any revisions to this Agreement proposed by Parent in writing
in a form that would be a binding agreement if accepted by the Company, and
shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that failure to effect such Company Adverse Recommendation Change
would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Company Boards
fiduciary duties under applicable Law even if such revisions were to be given
effect; and

 

(ii) in the case of clause (B), (1) the Company Board or the Special
Committee, if such committee still exists, has given Parent at least four (4)
Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action
(which notice shall include an unredacted copy of the relevant proposed
transaction agreements (including the proposed definitive agreement for such
Superior Proposal and a copy of any financing commitments relating thereto or,
to the extent not made in writing, a written summary of the material terms of
any Superior Proposal, including, in each case, any financing commitments
relating thereto) (a " _Superior Proposal Notice_ "), (2) after providing
such notice, the Company shall have negotiated, and shall have caused its
Representatives to negotiate, with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent
desires to negotiate) during such four (4) Business Day period to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions in this Agreement and the Financing so
that such Takeover Proposal no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal, (3)
following the end of such notice period, the Company Board or the Special
Committee, if such committee still exists, shall have considered in good faith
any revisions to this Agreement and the Financing proposed by Parent in
writing in a form that would be a binding agreement if accepted by the
Company, and shall have determined (taking into account such proposed
revisions), after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial
advisor, that such Takeover Proposal continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal and, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
failure to take such actions in response to such Superior Proposal would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties
under applicable Law and (4) in the event of any material change to the terms
of or any change to the consideration payable to the holders of Equity
Interests in connection with such Superior Proposal (or amendment thereof),
the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to Parent an additional
notice consistent with that described in clause (1) above and the notice
period in clause (1) shall have recommenced and the condition in clauses (2)
and (3) shall have occurred again, except that the notice period shall be at
least two (2) Business Days (rather than the four (4) Business Days otherwise
contemplated by clause (1) above).

(f) Only in connection with the Company Board or the Special Committee, if
such committee still exists, providing a Superior Proposal Notice (to the
extent otherwise permitted hereunder), the parties hereby agree that in order
to enable the Special Committee (or the Company Board) to be sufficiently
comfortable that the Superior Proposal that is the subject of the Superior
Proposal Notice will remain available to the Company when and if this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.03(a)_ or _Section 7.04(a)_,
the Company may enter into a binding agreement (the " _Conditional
Commitment_ ") with the party making such Superior Proposal (the " _Committed
Bidder_ "), which Conditional Commitment (i) may provide that such Committed
Bidder is obligated, on behalf of the Company, to pay the Termination Fee,
(ii) may attach as an exhibit thereto a fully negotiated and signed agreement
and the plan of merger relating to such Superior Proposal, which agreement, by
its express terms, is effective only upon the payment of the Termination Fee
and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof and
(iii) may provide that the Company shall enter into such agreement and/or that
such agreement shall automatically become binding on the Company only on and
after (and in no event before) the occurrence of all of the following events:
(A) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, (B) the
payment by the Company (or by the Committed Bidder on behalf of the Company)
of the Termination Fee and (C) without limiting Parents or Merger Subs
obligations under this Agreement, shall not provide for the imposition of any
liability or obligation on Parent or any of its Affiliates following
the termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, until the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, except as
expressly permitted by this _Section 5.03(f)_, the Company shall otherwise
remain subject to all of its obligations under this Agreement.

(g) Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Company Board or the Special
Committee, if such committee still exists, from (i) complying with its
disclosure obligations under applicable Law with regard to a Takeover
Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange
Act (or any similar communication to shareholders of the Company); _provided_
, _however_ , that any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen"
communication or other similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, or an express rejection of the Takeover
Proposal or a reaffirmation of the Company Board Recommendation) shall be
deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if the Company Board
fails to expressly and publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation
within five (5) Business Days following any request by Parent (it being agreed
that Parent may only make one (1) request with respect to any single
such disclosure), or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to
the shareholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under
the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the shareholders of the
Company, it being understood that none of the foregoing shall constitute a
"Company Adverse Recommendation Change").

(h) It is understood and agreed that the Company, the Company Board, the
Special Committee and its outside legal counsel shall be entitled to rely on
and deem applicable to the Company, the Company Board and the Special
Committee the Law applicable to corporations incorporated in the State of
Delaware and the Law applicable to companies

 incorporated in the Commonwealth of The Bahamas for purposes of making the
conclusions contemplated by this _Section 5.03_ (and providing advice with
respect thereto) relating to the fiduciary obligations of directors, and
accordingly, an action that would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
either the directors fiduciary duties under the law of the Commonwealth of
The Bahamas or the fiduciary duties that would be applicable to the directors
if the Company were incorporated in the State of Delaware, shall be deemed
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties for
purposes of this _Section 5.03_. The immediately preceding sentence is
intended only to govern the contractual rights of the parties to this
Agreement; it being understood and agreed that nothing in this Agreement is
intended to modify any fiduciary duties of the Company Board or any
committee thereof (including the Special Committee) under applicable Law.

(i) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.03_ to the contrary, the
Company shall not, and shall not permit its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to,
reimburse or agree to reimburse the Expenses of any Third Party in connection
with a Takeover Proposal or any inquiry, discussion, offer or request that
could reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, in any Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered
into with such Third Party).

 

Section 5.04 _Proxy Statement; Shareholders  Meeting_.

 

(a) The Company shall (i) prepare and file with the SEC, as promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement (and in no event later than the
third (3rd) Business Day after the Solicitation Period End-Date), a proxy
statement in preliminary form relating to the Shareholders Meeting (such
proxy statement, including the letter to shareholders, notice of meeting and
form of proxy, including any amendment or supplement thereto, the " _Proxy
Statement_ "), (ii) use reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as
practicable to resolve all comments from the SEC concerning the Proxy
Statement and (iii) as promptly as practicable after receiving confirmation
from the SEC that it has no further comments to the Proxy Statement, mail the
Proxy Statement to the shareholders of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company shall be under no obligation to mail the Proxy Statement to
its shareholders or call, give notice of or convene the Shareholders Meeting
on or prior to the Solicitation Period End-Date. The Company agrees that at
the date of mailing to shareholders of the Company and at the time of the
Shareholders Meeting (A) the Proxy Statement will comply in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, and (B) will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to information
contained or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement and supplied by
or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion (or incorporation by
reference) in the Proxy Statement.

(b) The Company shall promptly notify Parent of the receipt of any comments
of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and of any request by the SEC
for any amendment or supplement thereto or for additional information and
shall promptly provide to Parent copies of all correspondence between the
Company, its Subsidiaries and/or any of their respective Representatives and
the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall

 



-47- ##### Table of Contents

  

 use its reasonable best efforts (with the assistance of Parent, who shall
use its reasonable best efforts to provide such assistance) to promptly
provide responses to the SEC with respect to all comments received on the
Proxy Statement from the SEC. Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement
(or, in each case, any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any
comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response and
the Company shall give good faith consideration to including any such
reasonable comments in the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or response letter. The Company will provide Parent a reasonable
opportunity to participate in any discussions or meetings with the SEC.

(c) The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date
on which the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy
Statement (or after 10 calendar days have passed since the filing of the
preliminary Proxy Statement with the SEC without notice from the SEC of its
intent to review the Proxy Statement) but under no circumstances prior to the
Solicitation Period End-Date, take all action necessary in accordance with
applicable Law, the rules of NASDAQ and the Companys Charter Documents to
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the shareholders of
the Company (including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the "
_Shareholders  Meeting_") for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Company
Vote. Unless the Company Board shall have effected a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change in accordance with _Section 5.03_, the Company shall
include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies in favor of the Requisite
Company Vote and otherwise comply in all material respects with legal
requirements applicable to the Shareholders Meeting. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company, after consultation
with Parent, may adjourn or postpone the Shareholders Meeting (i) to allow
reasonable additional time for any supplemental or amended disclosure
(including any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement) which the
Company has determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal
counsel) is necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or
amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the Companys
shareholders within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the
Shareholders Meeting, (ii) if as of the time for which the Shareholders
Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there
are either (A) insufficient Company Common Shares represented (either in
person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at
the Shareholders Meeting or (B) insufficient affirmative votes to authorize,
adopt and approve this Agreement or (iii) with the prior written consent of
Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such postponements and adjournments
pursuant to clause (ii) of the preceding provision shall not be, in the
aggregate, for a period exceeding thirty (30) Business Days without Parents
prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , _further_ , that any such
postponement or adjournment shall not result in the Shareholders Meeting
occurring fewer than five (5) Business Days prior to the End Date without
Parents prior written consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
shall, at the request of Parent, postpone or adjourn the Shareholders
Meeting to a date specified by Parent if as of the time for which the
Shareholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy
Statement) there are either (1) insufficient Company Common Shares
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct business at the Shareholders Meeting or (2) insufficient affirmative
votes to authorize, adopt and approve this Agreement;  _provided, however_ ,
that Parent may not postpone or adjourn the Shareholders Meeting more than a
total of

 two times, and no such postponements or adjournments shall be for a period
exceeding ten (10) Business Days. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, in the event that subsequent to the date hereof, the Company
terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.04_, the Company shall not
be required to convene or hold the Shareholders Meeting or submit this
Agreement to its shareholders for approval. 

Section 5.05 _Notices of Certain Events_. The Company shall notify Parent and
Merger Sub, and Parent and Merger Sub shall notify the Company, promptly of
(i) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) any notice or other
communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) subject to, and not in limitation of
_Section 5.17_, any Legal Actions commenced, or to such partys Knowledge,
threatened, against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent or its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, that are related to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and (iv) any breach, inaccuracy or misrepresentation of
a representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement or any breach or
non-performance of a covenant that would or would be reasonably expected to,
individually or in the aggregate with all such breaches, inaccuracies,
misrepresentations and non-performance, as applicable, cause a condition to
Closing set forth in _Article VI_ to not be satisfied. In no event shall (x)
the delivery of any notice by a party pursuant to this _Section 5.05_ limit
or otherwise affect the respective rights, obligations, representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement or (y) disclosure by the
Company or Parent be deemed to amend or supplement the Company Disclosure
Letter or constitute an exception to any representation or warranty. This
_Section 5.05_ shall not constitute a covenant or agreement for purposes of
_Section 6.02(b)_ or  _Section 6.03(b)_.

Section 5.06 _Employees; Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) Except as determined in good faith by the Chief Executive Officer of the
Surviving Company, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the date which is twelve (12) months following the Effective Time
(or if earlier, the date of the employees termination of employment with
Parent and its Subsidiaries), Parent shall cause the Surviving Company and
each of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to provide the employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries who remain employed immediately after the
Effective Time (collectively, the " _Company Continuing Employees_ ") with
base compensation and non-equity based bonus and commission opportunities
that are comparable, in the aggregate, to those provided by the Company and
its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and all other
benefits that are, in the aggregate, at least as favorable as such benefits
provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

(b) Except as determined in good faith by the Chief Executive Officer of the
Surviving Company, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company and each
of its Subsidiaries to, provide to each Company Continuing Employee who is
terminated without cause during the period commencing at the Effective Time
and ending no earlier than twelve (12) months following the Effective Time,
severance benefits equal to the severance benefits provided under the
applicable severance benefit plans, programs, policies, agreements and
arrangements of the Company and its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date
hereof and set forth on _Section 5.06(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(c) With respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, excluding any equity compensation arrangements maintained
by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, " _Parent Benefit Plans_
") in which any Company Continuing Employees will participate effective as of
the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to,
recognize all service of the Company Continuing Employees with the Company or
any of its ERISA Affiliates prior to the Effective Time, as the case may be as
if such service were with Parent or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, for
vesting and eligibility purposes (but not for benefit accrual purposes under a
defined benefit plan and not for any purpose under any equity-based plan) in
any Parent Benefit Plan in which such Company Continuing Employees may be
eligible to participate after the Effective Time; _provided_ that such service
shall not be recognized to the extent that (x) such recognition would result
in a duplication of benefits or compensation or (y) such service was not
recognized under the corresponding Company Employee Plan or Foreign Company
Employee Plan. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, (i) each Company Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible
to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all Parent Benefit Plans
to the extent such Parent Benefit Plan is comparable to a Company Employee
Plan or Foreign Company Employee Plan in which such Company Continuing
Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately before the
Effective Time and replaces such Company Employee Plan or Foreign Company
Employee Plan in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs and (ii) for
purposes of each Parent Benefit Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Continuing Employee in
the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall cause (A) all
pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such
Parent Benefit Plan to be waived for such Company Continuing Employee and his
or her covered dependents to the extent waived or satisfied under the
comparable Company Employee Plan as of the Effective Time and (B) the amount
of eligible expenses incurred by such Company Continuing Employee and his or
her covered dependents which was credited to deductible and maximum out-of-
pocket co-insurance requirements under the applicable Company Employee Plan
for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs will be credited for
purposes of satisfying the deductible and maximum out-of-pocket co-insurance
requirements under the applicable Parent Benefit Plan for the plan year in
which the Effective Time occurs. 

(d) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.06_, express or implied (i) shall be
construed to establish, amend or modify any benefit or compensation plan,
program, agreement, Contract, policy or arrangement or (ii) shall alter or
limit the ability of the Surviving Company, Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any benefit or compensation plan,
program, agreement, Contract, policy, or arrangement at any time assumed,
established, sponsored or maintained by any of them. The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth in this _Section 5.06_ shall
not create any right in any Company Employee or any other Person to any
continued employment or continued service or to any particular term or
condition of employment or service with the Surviving Company, Parent or any
of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates and that the terms set forth
in this _Section 5.06_ are not intended to, and shall not be construed to,

Section 5.07 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree (i) that all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation by the Company and its Subsidiaries
now existing in favor of each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior
to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer or
director of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective predecessors and each Person who served at the request of the
Company or its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, member, trustee or
fiduciary of another company, corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust,
pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise (each, together with
such Persons heirs, executors or administrators, " _Indemnified Party_ ") as
provided in the Company Charter Documents, in each case as in effect on the
date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other Contracts in effect on the
date hereof and disclosed in _Section 5.07_ of the Company Disclosure Letter,
shall survive the Merger (with the obligations of the Company being assumed by
the Surviving Company) and shall remain in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms for a period of six (6) years following the
Effective Time, and, in the event that any proceeding with respect to which
such indemnification or advancement of expenses may be available is
pending or asserted or any claim with respect to which such indemnification
or advancement of expenses may be available is made during such period, until
the final disposition of such proceeding or claim and (ii) to cause the
Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to fulfill, honor and respect all such
rights of the Indemnified Parties for a period of six (6) years following the
Effective Time, in each case, with respect to any acts or omission occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, and, in the event that any proceeding with
respect to which such indemnification or advancement of expenses may be
available is pending or asserted or any claim with respect to which such
indemnification or advancement of expenses may be available is made during
such period, until the final disposition of such proceeding or claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Company shall only be required to
advance expenses to any Indemnified Party upon receipt by Surviving Company
of an undertaking (in customary form and substance) by such Indemnified Party
to repay any expenses advanced by the Surviving Company if it is ultimately
determined in a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified
under applicable Law.

(b) From and after the Effective Time until the sixth (6th) anniversary
thereof, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the Surviving
Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, indemnify,
defend and hold harmless each Indemnified Party against all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, in each case, arising out of or pertaining to (i) the fact
that such Indemnified Party is or was a director, officer, member, trustee or
fiduciary of Company or its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
predecessors, or served at the request of the Company or its Subsidiaries as
a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another company,
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee
benefit plan or enterprise at or prior to the Effective Time, (ii) matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including this

-51- ##### Table of Contents

  

 an Indemnified Party taken in their capacity as such occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time (including in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), and shall reimburse each Indemnified Party
for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party
in connection with investigating or defending any such losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments and fines as such expenses
are incurred, subject to the Surviving Companys receipt of an undertaking (in
customary form and substance) by such Indemnified Party to repay such legal
and other fees and expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party
and paid in advance by the Surviving Company if it is ultimately determined
in a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified under applicable
Law.

 

(c) The Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company
to, (i) maintain in effect for a period of six (6) years after the Effective
Time, if available, the current policies of directors and officers liability
insurance maintained by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Company may substitute therefor
policies, of at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and
conditions that are not less advantageous, in the aggregate, to the directors
and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries and other Indemnified
Parties when compared to the insurance maintained by the Company as of the
date hereof) or (ii) obtain "tail" insurance policies from the Companys
current insurance carrier or an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
with a claims period of six (6) years from the Effective Time with at least
the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are not
less advantageous, in the aggregate, to the directors and officers of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and other Indemnified Parties, in each case with
respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which occurred at or
before the Effective Time (including in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement); _provided, however,_ that in no event will
the Company expend or the Surviving Company be required to expend an annual
premium for such coverage in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by
the Company for such insurance prior to the date of this Agreement (the "
_Maximum Premium_ "). If such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at an
annual premium equal to or less than the Maximum Premium, the Company or
Surviving Company, as applicable will obtain, and Parent will cause the
Surviving Company to obtain, that amount of directors and officers
insurance (or "tail" coverage) obtainable for an annual premium equal to the
Maximum Premium. The Company may, prior to the Effective Time, acquire a six
year tail policy that is consistent with the first sentence of this _Section
5.07(c)_, such policy shall be prepaid at the Effective Time and shall be non-
cancelable. If the Company acquires such a tail policy, the obligations of
Parent and the Surviving Company pursuant to the first sentence of this 
_Section 5.07(c)_ shall be deemed satisfied.

(d) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company under this  _Section
5.07_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger, and shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified
Party to whom this _Section 5.07_ applies without the consent of
such affected Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the
Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section 5.07_ applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 5.07_, each of whom may enforce the provisions
of this  _Section 5.07_), until the later of (i) the sixth (6th) anniversary
of the Effective Time and (ii) in the event that any proceeding with

 respect to which such indemnification or advancement of expenses may be
available is pending or asserted or any claim with respect to which such
indemnification or advancement of expenses may be available is made, in each
case, prior the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, until the final
disposition of such proceeding or claim.

 

(e) In the event Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving company or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set

release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the

Section 5.08  _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement
(including those contained in this _Section 5.08_), each of the parties
hereto shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, and to
satisfy all conditions to, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the obtaining of
all necessary material permits, waivers, consents, approvals and actions or
nonactions from Governmental Entities and Educational Agencies, and the making
of all necessary material registrations and filings (including filings with
Governmental Entities and Educational Agencies) and the taking of all steps as
may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action
or proceeding by, any Governmental Entities or Educational Agency, (ii)
the obtaining of all necessary material consents or waivers from Third
Parties and (iii) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the Merger and to fully carry out the purposes of this
Agreement. Parent will take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub to
perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger on
the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. The Company and Parent
shall, subject to applicable Law, promptly (x) reasonably cooperate and
coordinate with the other in the taking of the actions contemplated by clauses
(i), (ii) and (iii) immediately above and (y) supply the other with any
information that may be reasonably required in order to effectuate the taking
of such actions; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be required to
make any payments to Third Parties to secure any of the foregoing Consents
contemplated by clause (ii) above and shall not be required to modify any
such Contract to which the consent or waiver may relate in any material
respect, and the Company shall not take any of the foregoing actions without
Parents prior written consent; _provided_ , _further_ , that, for the
avoidance of doubt, none of the parties hereto shall be obligated or required
to waive a condition to Closing set forth in _Article VI_. If the Company or
Parent receives a request for additional information or 

 



-53- ##### Table of Contents

  

 documentary material from any Governmental Entity or Educational Agency with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then it shall use
reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably
practicable and after consultation with the other party, an appropriate
response in compliance with such request, and, if permitted by applicable Law
and by any applicable Governmental Entity or Educational Agency, provide the
other partys counsel with advance notice and the opportunity to attend and
participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity or Educational Agency
in respect of any filing made thereto in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the
Company shall have the right to review in advance, and the other party shall
consider in good faith the views and comments of the other in
connection with, all of the information relating to Parent or the Company, as
the case may be, and any of their respective Affiliates, that appears in any
filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any Third Party and/or
any Governmental Entity or Educational Agency in connection with the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither Parent nor
the Company shall commit to or agree (or permit their respective Subsidiaries
to commit to or agree) with any Governmental Entity to stay, toll or extend
any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust
Laws, without the prior written consent of the other (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to _Section
5.08(a)_ hereof, the parties hereto shall (i) provide or cause to be provided
as promptly as reasonably practicable to Governmental Entities with
jurisdiction over the Antitrust Laws (each such Governmental Entity, a "
_Governmental Antitrust Authority_ ") information and documents requested by
any Governmental Antitrust Authority as necessary, proper or advisable to
permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including preparing and filing any notification and report form and
related material required under the HSR Act and any additional consents and
filings under any Other Antitrust Laws as promptly as practicable following
the date of this Agreement ( _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of the
filing under the HSR Act, such filing shall be made within ten (10) Business
Days of the date of this Agreement) and thereafter to respond as promptly as
practicable to any request for additional information or documentary material
that may be made under the HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Laws and
(ii) subject to the terms set forth in _Section 5.08(c)_ hereof, use their
reasonable best efforts to take such actions as are necessary or advisable to
obtain prompt approval of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement by any Governmental Entity or expiration of applicable
waiting periods.

 

(c) In the event that any Legal Action by a Governmental Entity, Educational
Agency, or Third Party challenging the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, or any other agreement contemplated hereby,
each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best
efforts to contest, defend and resist any such action or proceeding and to
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each
of Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts
to obtain any necessary approval from any Governmental Antitrust Authority or
to prevent the initiation of any

 



-54- ##### Table of Contents

  

 lawsuit by any Governmental Entity under any Antitrust Law or to prevent the
entry of any Order that would otherwise make the Merger unlawful, which
reasonable best efforts shall include: (i) disposing or transferring any
asset, including those of Parent, Merger Sub or (after the Effective Time) the
Surviving Company; (ii) licensing or otherwise making available to any Person,
any technology or other Intellectual Property of Parent, Merger Sub or (after
the Effective Time) the Surviving Company; (iii) holding separate any assets
or operations (either before or after the Closing Date) of Parent, Merger Sub
or (after the Effective Time) the Surviving Company; or (iv) changing or
modifying any course of conduct or otherwise making any commitment (to any
Governmental Entity or otherwise) regarding future operations of the business
of Parent, Merger Sub or (after the Effective Time) the Surviving
Company (any of the actions set forth in clause (i) through (iv) of this
_Section 5.08(d)_, a " _Remedial Action_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent and Merger Sub may condition the taking of any such Remedial Action
upon the consummation of the Merger and, if so conditioned, will not be
required to take any such Remedial Actions unless and until the Effective Time
occurs. If any action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) challenging the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Merger as violative of any Antitrust Law, or if any Order is entered,
enforced or attempted to be entered or enforced by a court or other
Governmental Entity, which Order would make the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the Merger illegal or would otherwise prohibit, prevent,
restrict, impair or delay consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding
and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any such Order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Merger and to have such Order repealed, rescinded or made
inapplicable so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the Merger. 

Section 5.09 _Educational Consents_.

 

(a) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate and use their
respective reasonable best efforts to obtain the Pre-Closing Educational
Consents and to make the Pre-Closing Educational Notices and Pre-Closing
Educational Courtesy Notices.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will coordinate
regarding the submission to all applicable Educational Agencies of all
letters, notices, applications or other documents required to obtain the Pre-
Closing Educational Consents, including the pre-acquisition review
applications with the ED in order to obtain the ED Pre-Acquisition Review
Notices, and to make all Pre-Closing Educational Notices and Pre-Closing
Educational Courtesy Notices. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide
the other with (i) reasonable advance review and consultation regarding any
notices or applications to be filed with any Educational Agency with respect
to any Pre-Closing Educational Consent, Pre-Closing Educational Notice, or
Pre-Closing Educational Courtesy Notice and (ii) a copy of any notice or
application as filed with, or any notice received from, any Educational
Agency with respect to any Pre-Closing Educational Consent, Pre-Closing
Educational Notice, or Pre-Closing Educational Courtesy Notice. To the extent
practical, prior to attending any meetings, telephone calls or discussions
with any Educational Agency concerning any Pre-Closing Educational Consent,
Pre-Closing Educational Notice, or Pre-Closing Educational Courtesy Notice the

 



-55- ##### Table of Contents

  

 parties shall discuss and agree upon strategy and issues to be pursued and
responses to likely questions. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub will use
their respective reasonable best efforts to ensure that their appropriate
officers and employees shall be available to attend, as any Educational Agency
may reasonably request, any scheduled meetings or telephone calls in
connection with obtaining any Pre-Closing Educational Consent or making any
Pre-Closing Educational Notice or Pre-Closing Educational Courtesy Notice. At
the reasonable request of any party, the other parties hereto shall promptly
provide telephonic or written updates and information on the status of any
Pre-Closing Educational Consent, Pre-Closing Educational Notice, or Pre-
Closing Educational Courtesy Notice. In the event that any Educational Agency
provided with a Pre-Closing Educational Notice or Pre-Closing Educational
Courtesy Notice responds by stating that a pre-closing consent is required,
the parties shall then use their reasonable best efforts to obtain such
consent prior to the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that the parties
acknowledge and agree that under no circumstances shall such pre-closing
consent constitute a Pre-Closing Educational Consent.

(c) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts to file all applications or notices in connection with the Pre-
Closing Educational Consents, Pre-Closing Educational Notice, and Pre-Closing
Educational Courtesy Notice within thirty (30) days following the date
hereof. 

(d) In the event that any Educational Agency denies in writing, or
definitively indicates that it will not issue by the Closing Date, a required
Pre-Closing Educational Consent for any School and does not indicate that such
Pre-Closing Educational Consent can be issued after the Closing (a " _Rejected
Education Consent_ "), then, unless and until the Educational Agency changes
its decision to deny or not issue such Pre-Closing Educational Consent, the
Company shall cease enrollment of new students at such School (but no earlier
than the date that is 90 days after the date hereof, unless earlier required
by the applicable Educational Agency). With respect to a Rejected Education
Consent, in the event that such Educational Agency does not change its
decision to deny or not issue such Pre-Closing Educational Consent after a
reasonable opportunity (not to exceed ten Business Days) for the Educational
Agency to consider a request by the Company (in consultation with Parent and
Merger Sub) for reconsideration of the Rejected Educational Consent, then the
Company shall (x) use its reasonable best efforts to consult with such
Educational Agency regarding an orderly teach out of such School and use its
reasonable best efforts to develop a teach-out plan therefor, in all cases,
with implementation of the teach-out conditioned on the occurrence of the
Closing to the extent required or permitted by such Educational Agency (or any
earlier time established by such Educational Agency subject to the third-to-
last sentence of this paragraph) and (y) use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain any required approvals of such teach out from the applicable
Educational Agencies, including obtaining any required approval of a teach-out
plan for such School. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to obtain approval from the applicable
Educational Agencies to implement the teach-out of such School following the
Closing Date notwithstanding the denial or failure to issue a required Pre-
Closing Educational Consent. If the Educational Agency requires or directs
the Company to initiate a teach-out of such School prior to the Closing Date
and does not change its decision to require the initiation of a teach-out
prior to the Closing Date after a reasonable opportunity for the
Educational Agency to consider a request by the Company (in consultation with
Parent and Merger Sub) for reconsideration of such Educational Agencys
decision, then the Company shall use reasonable

 



-56- ##### Table of Contents

  

 best efforts to initiate the teach-out of such School prior to the Closing
Date, provided that the Company need not necessarily begin transferring
students to another school as part of the teach-out until after the Closing
Date. Notwithstanding clause (x) of _Section 5.05_, the obligations of the
Company under this _Section 5.09(d)_ shall cease to be of any force or effect
(and the Company shall have no obligations under this _Section 5.09(d)_)
from and after the time Parent or Merger Sub delivers a notice to the Company
pursuant to clause (iv) of _Section 5.05_. In addition, the obligations of
the Company under this  _Section 5.09(d)_ shall cease to be of any force or
effect (and the Company shall have no obligations under this _Section
5.09(d)_) from and after the time Parent or Merger Sub delivers a notice to
the Company pursuant to  _Section 5.14(c)_ until such time, if any, that the
Company receives written notice from Parent certifying that the basis for such
notice delivered pursuant to _Section 5.14(c)_ has ceased to exist. For
purposes of this  _Section 5.09(d)_ the term "Pre-Closing Educational
Consent" does not include any consent or approval from the ED (including the
ED Pre-Acquisition Review Notices).

 

Section 5.10 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be a release
mutually agreed to by the Company and Parent. Thereafter, each of the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub agrees that no public release or announcement concerning
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the
prior written consent of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), except for any such release or announcement
that is expressly permitted by _Section 5.03_ or required by applicable Law
or the rules or regulations of any applicable United States securities
exchange or Governmental Entity to which the relevant party is subject,
wherever situated, in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement shall, to the extent legally permitted, consult with the other
party about, and allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such
release or announcement in advance of such issuance and shall reasonably
consider any such comments in good faith;  _provided_ that (i) each party may
issue such press releases or make any such public statements in connection
with any dispute between the parties hereto regarding this Agreement without
obtaining the other parties prior written consent, (ii) the restrictions in
this _Section 5.10_ shall not apply to the receipt and existence of a
Takeover Proposal or a Company communication in connection with or following a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change affected in accordance with _Section
5.03_ and (iii) for the avoidance of doubt, Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Affiliates may disclose this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby to any direct or indirect investor or in connection with
normal fund raising and related marketing or informational or reporting
activities.

Section 5.11 _Takeover Statutes_. If any "control share acquisition", "fair
price", "moratorium" or other anti-takeover Law becomes or is deemed to be
applicable to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then each of the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub, and their respective board of directors shall grant such approvals
and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated
hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise act to render such anti-takeover Law
inapplicable to the foregoing.

 

Section 5.12 _Control of Operations_. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control
or direct the Companys

 



-57- ##### Table of Contents

  

 operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement complete control and supervision over its operations.

Section 5.13 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all such steps as may be required to cause to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act any dispositions of Company Common
Shares (including derivative securities with respect to such shares) that are
treated as dispositions under such rule and result from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by each director or officer of the Company who
is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to the Company.

 

Section 5.14 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done,
all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Debt
Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter,
including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect, and
comply with, the Financing Commitments in accordance with their terms without
amendment, alteration or waiver other than as permitted in this _Section
5.14(a)_, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent
and Merger Sub to obtaining the Financing, (iii) enter into definitive
agreements with respect thereto on terms and conditions contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter (including any "flex" provisions) (or other terms that would
not adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to timely consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby) and (iv) consummate the Financing at or
prior to the Closing. Parent shall not, and shall not permit Merger Sub to,
agree to or permit any amendment, supplement or other modification of, or
waive any of its rights under, any Financing Commitment or any definitive
agreements related to the Financing, in each case, without the Companys prior
written consent (which consent may be withheld in its sole and absolute
discretion); _provided, however_ , that Parent and Merger Sub may (without
obtaining the Companys consent) amend, supplement or modify the Debt
Commitment Letter if such amendment, supplement or modification (I) does not
reduce the aggregate principal amount of the Financing, (II) does not impose
new or additional conditions, or expand or modify any of the existing
conditions, to the consummation of the Financing, (III) is not reasonably
expected to hinder, delay or prevent the Closing, (IV) could not reasonably be
expected to make the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the
conditions to obtaining the Financing) less likely to occur in any respect
or (V) could not reasonably be expected to adversely impact the ability of
Parent or Merger Sub to enforce or cause the enforcement of its rights under
any of the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements relating
thereto (and, for the avoidance of doubt, Parent and Merger Sub shall be
permitted to amend, supplement or modify the Debt Commitment Letter to add
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities
that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof, if
the addition of such parties, individually or in the aggregate would not
prevent, delay or impair the availability of the Debt Financing under the Debt
Commitment Letter or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement). Upon any such amendment, supplement or modification of the
Debt Commitment Letter in accordance with this _Section 5.14(a)_, Parent
shall provide a copy thereof to the Company and references to "Financing
Commitments" and "Debt Commitment Letter" shall include such documents as

 



-58- ##### Table of Contents

  

 permitted to be amended, supplemented or modified under this _Section
5.14(a)_ and references to "Financing" and "Debt Financing" shall include the
financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as permitted to be
amended, supplemented or modified under this _Section 5.14(a)_.

 

(b) In the event all or any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on
the terms and conditions or from the sources contemplated by the Financing
Commitments for any reason, (i) Parent shall promptly notify the Company and
(ii) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to arrange
and obtain, and to negotiate and enter into definitive agreements
with respect to, alternative financing from alternative sources (the "
_Alternative Financing_ ") in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable
following the Closing and satisfy the Closing Amounts, including the
Refinancing Amounts; _provided_ that any such Alternative Financing shall not
(A) be on economic terms that are less favorable in the aggregate to Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company than the Financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters (including the "market flex" provision set forth in the fee
letter provided with the Debt Commitment Letters) or (B) impose any additional
conditions to funding that are not contained in the Financing Commitments
which would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the ability or
likelihood of Parent or Merger Sub to timely consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In the event any Alternative Financing is
contemplated in accordance with this _Section 5.14(b)_, references to "Debt
Financing," "Equity Financing," "Financing," "Debt Commitment Letter," "Equity
Commitment Letter" and "Financing Commitments" shall include such Alternative
Financing, as applicable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
nothing in this Agreement shall require, and in no event shall the reasonable
best efforts of Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or construed to require,
Parent or Merger Sub to (x) seek the Equity Financing from any source other
than those counterparty to, or in any amount in excess of that contemplated
by, the Equity Commitment Letter or (y) pay any fees in excess of those
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter.

(c) Upon request from the Company, Parent shall keep the Company reasonably
informed of the status of its efforts to consummate the Financing. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub shall give the
Company prompt written notice (i) of any actual, threatened or alleged breach
or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or
default) by any party to any Financing Commitment of which Parent becomes
aware, (ii) of the receipt of any notice or other communication from any
person with respect to any actual or potential breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to any Financing Commitment or any definitive
document related to the Financing or (iii) of any material adverse change
with respect to the Debt Financing or Equity Financing which Parent or Merger
Sub is actually aware and believes in good faith would reasonably be expected
to materially delay or prevent the Closing or materially and adversely affect
the availability of the Financing on the Closing Date.

(d) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
provide to Parent and Merger Sub, at Parents sole expense, all reasonable
cooperation requested by Parent that is reasonable and customary in connection
with the Financing, including the following: (i) furnishing Parent and Merger
Sub and their Financing Sources with the financial or

 



-59- ##### Table of Contents

  

 other reasonably pertinent information regarding the Company and its
subsidiaries as expressly required by paragraph 7 of Exhibit C of the Debt
Commitment Letter and or the definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing or as may otherwise be reasonably requested by Parent to consummate
the Debt Financing, including customary financial information of the Company
and its Subsidiaries sufficient to permit Parent to prepare and provided
financial statements, pro forma financial information, financial data, audit
reports and other financial information and any other financial statements and
financial data expressly required as conditions to funding under the Debt
Commitment Letter reasonably promptly upon such information becoming
available and Parents request therefor, (ii) upon reasonable notice,
participation in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations and due
diligence sessions, (iii) assisting with the preparation of definitive
financing documents required in connection with the Financing, as may be
reasonably requested by Parent, (iv) obtaining legal opinions, surveys and
title insurance reasonably requested by Parent and customary for financings
similar to the Financing, (v) executing and delivering, and causing its
subsidiaries to execute and deliver customary certificates (including a
solvency certificate in the form attached to the Debt Commitment Letter
delivered by the chief financial officer of the Company) and (vi) facilitating
the entrance into other documents and instruments relating to guarantees, the
pledge of collateral and other matters ancillary to the Debt Financing as may
be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Financing and
otherwise reasonably facilitating the pledge of collateral and providing of
guarantees contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (provided that the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to enter into any such
document or instrument that will be effective prior to the Effective Time);
_provided, however_ , that, notwithstanding the above, (A) nothing in this
_Section 5.14_ shall require such cooperation to the extent it would
interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, (B) no obligation of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries under any certificate, document or instrument shall be effective
until the Effective Time and none of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
shall be required to take any action under any certificate, document or
instrument that is not contingent upon the Closing (including the entry into
any agreement that is effective before the Effective Time) or that would be
effective prior to the Effective Time, (C) the Company Board nor any board or
other governing body of the Companys Subsidiaries shall be required prior
to the Effective Time to adopt resolutions approving the agreements,
documents and instruments pursuant to which the Debt Financing is obtained,
(D) no officer who is not remaining in such position following the Closing
shall be obligated to execute or deliver any documents in connection with the
Financing, (E) none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to bear any cost or expense for which it will not be reimbursed
pursuant to this _Section 5.14_ or to pay any commitment or other similar
fee or make any other payment in connection with the Financing or any of the
foregoing prior to the Effective Time, (F) none of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries shall be required to take any action that would subject it to
actual or potential liability under any agreement and related documents unless
and until the Closing occurs, (G) none of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries shall be required to take any action that will (1) conflict with
or violate the Companys organizational documents or any Laws, (2) cause any
condition to the Closing set forth in _Article VI_ to not be satisfied or
otherwise cause a breach of this Agreement, (3) result in the contravention
of, or that would reasonably be expected to result in a violation or breach
of, or a default under, any Contract to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party (other than the Credit Agreement or any
Contracts entered into in connection therewith) or (4) result in any officer
or director of the

 



-60- ##### Table of Contents

  

 Company or any of its Subsidiaries incurring any material personal liability
with respect to any matters relating to the Debt Financing and (H) none of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or
disclose information where the Company reasonably determines that such access
or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries or contravene any Law or any material contract to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party; _provided_ that the
Company and its Subsidiaries will use reasonable best efforts to provide such
information in a manner that does not violate such agreement or law or waive
such privilege. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the execution
and delivery of any documents in connection with the Debt Financing shall be
deemed to become effective only if and when the Effective Time occurs and
shall be derived exclusively from the authority of Parent as controlling
shareholder and of the Board of Directors of the Surviving Company as
constituted after giving effect to the Effective Time. Parent shall, promptly
upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-
pocket costs incurred by the Company or its subsidiaries in connection with
this _Section 5.14(d)_. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company,
its affiliates and its and their respective Representatives from and against
any and all liabilities or losses suffered or incurred by them in connection
with the arrangement of the Financing and any information utilized in
connection therewith (other than information provided by the Company or its
subsidiaries expressly for use in connection therewith).

(e) Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining
of the Financing is not a condition to the Closing, and reaffirms its
obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
irrespective and independently of the availability of the Financing.

 

Section 5.15 _Stock Exchange De-listing_. The Surviving Company shall cause
the Companys securities to be delisted from NASDAQ and deregistered under
the Exchange Act as soon as practicable following the Effective Time.

Section 5.16 _Acquisition of Company Common Shares_. Parent and Merger Sub
shall not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates not to, acquire,
directly or indirectly (including pursuant to derivative contracts), any
Company Common Shares or other securities convertible into, exchangeable for
or exercisable for Company Common Shares or any securities of any Subsidiary
of the Company or any rights to acquire, directly or indirectly, any Company
Common Shares except pursuant to this Agreement.

 

Section 5.17 _Shareholder Litigation_. In the event of any shareholder Legal
Action related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is brought or, to the Companys Knowledge,
threatened in writing against the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or the members
of the Company Board or the board of directors (or other similar governing
body) of any of the Companys Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall promptly notify Parent of any such shareholder Legal Action
brought or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened against the Company,
its Subsidiaries and/or members of the Company Board or the board of
directors (or other similar governing body) of any of the Companys
Subsidiaries and shall (a) keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the
status thereof, (b) give Parent the opportunity to participate in, but not
control, the defense of any such Legal Action, (c) give due consideration to
Parents advise with respect to such Legal Action and

of such Legal Action. The Company shall not settle any pending or threatened
shareholder Legal Action related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without Parents prior written
consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

 

Section 5.18 _Credit Agreement_. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to deliver to Parent no later than two (2) Business Days prior to the
Effective Time a copy of an executed payoff letter (subject to delivery of
funds as arranged by Parent) in customary form with respect to the Credit
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall this _Section
