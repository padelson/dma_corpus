2 ARTICLE II.

 

TREATMENT OF SECURITIES

 

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the Parties or holders of any securities of the Parties:

(i) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to the other provisions of
this _Article II_ , each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding shares of Company Common
Stock to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.1(a)(ii)_, any shares of
Company Common Stock subject to an unvested Company Restricted Share Award
which is to be assumed by Parent pursuant to _Section 2.4(c)_, and any
Dissenting Shares) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive,
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, (A) $60.00 in cash, without
interest (the " _Cash Consideration Portion_ ") and (B) that number of validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable Parent Shares (the " _Stock Consideration
Portion_ ", and together with the Cash Consideration Portion, the " _Merger
Consideration_ ") equal to the quotient determined by dividing the Stock Value
by the VWAP of Parent Stock, and rounding the result to the nearest 1/10,000
of a Parent Share. From and after the Effective Time, all such shares of
Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each applicable holder of such shares
of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon the
surrender of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with _Section
2.2_, including the right to receive, pursuant to  _Section 2.6_, cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Stock, if any, which would otherwise be
issuable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this
_Section 2.1(a)(i)_ (the " _Fractional Share Consideration_ "), together
with the amounts, if any, payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(f)_.

(ii)  _Cancellation of Certain Shares_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned
or held in treasury by the Company or owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist,
and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor

 

(iii) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock,
$0.001 par value per share, of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
automatically converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation and those
shares of the Surviving Corporation shall constitute the only outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



3 (b) _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted appropriately, without duplication, to reflect the effect of any
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock or Parent
Stock, as applicable), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to the
shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Stock outstanding after the date
hereof and prior to the Effective Time;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing in this _Section 2.1(b)_ shall be construed to permit the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries or Parent to take any action with respect to
its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

Section 2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the
exchange agent in connection with the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). The
Exchange Agent shall also act as the agent for the Companys stockholders for
the purpose of receiving and holding their certificate or certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") and non-certificated shares of
Company Common Stock represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and
shall obtain no rights or interests in the shares represented thereby. At or
immediately after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Exchange Agent (i) evidence of Parent Stock issuable
pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(i)_ in book-entry form equal to the aggregate
Parent Stock portion of the Merger Consideration (excluding any Fractional
Share Consideration), and (ii) cash in immediately available funds in an
amount sufficient to pay the aggregate cash portion of the Merger
Consideration, Fractional Share Consideration and any dividends under _Section
2.2(f)_ (such evidence of book-entry shares of Parent Stock and cash
amounts, together with any dividends or other distributions with respect
thereto, the " _Exchange Fund_ "), in each case, for the sole benefit of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock. In the event the Exchange Fund
shall be insufficient to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration Portion,
Fractional Share Consideration and any dividends under _Section 2.2(f)_,
Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be promptly deposited, additional
funds with the Exchange Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency
in the amount required to make such payment. Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to make, and the Exchange Agent shall make, delivery of the Merger
Consideration, including payment of the Fractional Share Consideration and
any amounts payable in respect of dividends or other distributions on shares
of Parent Stock in accordance with _Section 2.2(f)_ out of the Exchange Fund
in accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for
any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement. The cash
portion of the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as
reasonably directed by Parent; _provided_ _,_ _however_ _,_ that no
such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this _Article II_ , and, to
the extent of any such loss, Parent shall fund additional cash amounts into
the Exchange Fund to enable such payments to be made. Any interest or other
income from such investments shall be payable to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as Parent directs.

 



4 (b) _Procedures for Surrender_.

 

(i) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of
record of shares of Company Common Stock whose shares of Company Common Stock
were converted pursuant to _Section 2.1_ into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)
or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent and shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify and
(ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates or transfer
of the Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration issuable and payable in respect of such shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.1_, including any amount payable in
respect of Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.6_,
and any dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent Stock in
accordance with _Section 2.2(f)_.

(ii) Upon (A) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate for
cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal properly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto or (B) receipt by
the Exchange Agent of an "agents message" in the case of Book-Entry Shares
and, in each case, such other documents as may be required pursuant to such
instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the Exchange Agent shall, and
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to, issue and pay to such holder, the
applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this _Article
II_ , including any Fractional Share Consideration that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to the provisions of _Section 2.6_, and any amounts
that such holder has the right to receive in respect of dividends or other
distributions on shares of Parent Stock in accordance with  _Section 2.2(f)_
for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share, and each Certificate or Book-Entry Share so
surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The Exchange Agent shall
accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-
Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the
Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance
with normal exchange practices. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer or stock
records of the Company, any cash to be paid upon, or shares of Parent Stock to
be issued upon, due surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share formerly
representing such shares of Company Common Stock may be paid or issued, as the
case may be, to such a transferee if such Certificate or Book-Entry Share is
presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer or other similar Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_, each Certificate and
Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this _Article II_ , including any amount payable in respect
of Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.6_, and any
dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent Stock in accordance with
_Section 2.2(f)_, without interest thereon.

 



5 (c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company
Common Stock on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of Certificates outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company
Common Stock except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. At any time following twelve
(12) months after the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the
Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received
with respect thereto) remaining in the Exchange Fund that have not been
disbursed, or for which disbursement is pending subject only to the
Exchange Agents routine administrative procedures, to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be
entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation and Parent (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors
thereof with respect to the applicable Merger Consideration, including any
amount payable in respect of Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with
_Section 2.6_ and any dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent
Stock in accordance with _Section 2.2(f)_, payable upon due surrender of
their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures in
_Section 2.2(b)_, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent
shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for any
Merger Consideration or other amounts delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof and, if required
by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such holder of a bond in such
customary amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably
necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to any such Certificates, the applicable
Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.1_
hereof, including any amount payable in respect of Fractional Share
Consideration in accordance with  _Section 2.6_, and any dividends or other
distributions on shares of Parent Stock in accordance with _Section 2.2(f)_.

 

(f) _Dividends or Distributions with Respect to Parent Stock_. No dividends or
other distributions with respect to Parent Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or
Book-Entry Share with respect to the shares of Parent Stock issuable
hereunder, and all such dividends and other distributions shall be paid
by Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall be included in the Exchange Fund,
in each case until the surrender of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share in

 



6  accordance with this Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws, following
surrender of any such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Share there shall be paid to the holder thereof, without interest,
(i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such shares of Parent
Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) at
the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and
with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such
shares of Parent Stock.

Section 2.3 _Appraisal Rights_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Company Common Stock, if any, as to which the holder thereof shall have (i)
properly demanded appraisal and otherwise complied with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_ ") and (ii) not effectively withdrawn
or lost such holders rights to appraisal (each, a " _Dissenting Share_ "),
shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration and
other amounts payable pursuant to _Section 2.1_ and _Section 2.2_, but
instead at the Effective Time shall become entitled only to payment of the
fair value of such shares of Company Common Stock determined in accordance
with Section 262 (it being understood and acknowledged that at the Effective
Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than the right to receive
the fair value of such Dissenting Shares as determined in accordance
with Section 262); _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that if any such holder shall
fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares under Section 262, then
the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders
Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to
have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become
exchangeable solely for the right to receive, without interest or
duplication, the Merger Consideration and other amounts payable pursuant to
_Section 2.1_ and _Section 2.2_.

 

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by
the Company for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, of any
withdrawals of such demands and of any other instruments served and received
by the Company under Section 262, and Parent shall have the opportunity to
participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle
or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand, or agree to
do any of the foregoing.

Section 2.4 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) Except as provided in _Section 2.4(d)_, as of the Effective Time, each
option to purchase Company Common Stock (a " _Company Stock Option_ ")
granted under any Company Equity Plan that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or
exercisable, shall be assumed by Parent and shall be converted into a stock
option (a " _Parent Stock Option_ ") to acquire Parent Stock in accordance
with this _Section 2.4_.

 



7  Each such Parent Stock Option as so assumed and converted shall continue to
have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (but taking into
account any changes thereto provided for in the applicable Company Equity
Plan, in any award agreement or in such Company Stock Option by reason of this
Agreement or the Transactions). As of the Effective Time, each such Parent
Stock Option as so assumed and converted shall be for that number of whole
shares of Parent Stock determined by multiplying the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time by the Stock Award Exchange Ratio, which product shall be
rounded down to the nearest whole share, at a per share exercise price
determined by dividing the per share exercise price of such Company Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Stock Award Exchange
Ratio, which quotient shall be rounded down to the nearest whole cent;
_provided_ , _however_ , that each Company Stock Option (A) which is an
"incentive stock option" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be
adjusted in accordance with the requirements of Section 424 of the Code and
(B) shall be adjusted in a manner which complies with Section 409A of the
Code.

 

(b) As of the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted stock unit award
(each, a " _Company RSU Award_ ") under any Company Equity Plan that is not
then vested shall be assumed by Parent and shall be converted into a
restricted stock unit award for Parent Stock (the " _Parent RSU Award_ ") with
associated rights to the issuance of additional shares of Parent Stock in
accordance with this _Section 2.4_. Each Parent RSU Award as so assumed and
converted shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and
conditions as applied to the applicable Company RSU Award immediately
prior to the Effective Time (but taking into account any changes thereto,
including any necessary changes to any issuance provisions, provided for or
permitted in the applicable Company Equity Plan, in any award agreement or in
such Company RSU Awards, by reason of this Agreement or the Transactions). As
of the Effective Time, the number of shares of Parent Stock underlying each
such Parent RSU Award as so assumed and converted (which shall be rounded up
to the nearest whole share) shall be equal to the product of (i) the
applicable number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company RSU
Award, multiplied by (ii) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the
nearest whole share of Parent Stock. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall
have the ability to adjust any dividend equivalent rights associated with the
Parent RSU Awards to reflect dividends on Parent Stock giving effect to the
changes and adjustments contemplated to the corresponding Company RSU Awards
by reason of this Agreement or the Transactions.

(c) As of the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted stock
award (collectively, the " _Company Restricted Share Awards_ ") granted under
any Company Equity Plan that is not then vested shall be assumed by Parent and
shall be converted into an award of shares of restricted stock of
Parent (collectively, the " _Parent Restricted Share Awards")_ in accordance
with this _Section 2.4_. Each Parent Restricted Share Award as so assumed and
converted shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms
and conditions as applied to the applicable Company Restricted Share Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time (but taking into account any changes
thereto provided for in the applicable Company Equity Plan, in any award
agreement or in such Company Restricted Share Award, by reason of this
Agreement or the Transactions). As of the Effective Time, the number of shares
of Parent Stock underlying each

 



8  such Parent Restricted Share Award as so assumed and converted (which shall
be rounded up to the nearest whole share) shall be equal to the product of (i)
the applicable number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
award, multiplied by (ii) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio.

(d) Each outstanding Company Stock Option that is held as of the Effective
Time by a Non-Employee Holder and vested as of the Effective Time shall be
cancelled at the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash, rounding such amount (x) up to the nearest whole cent if half
a cent or more or (y) down to the nearest whole cent if less than half a cent,
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the excess, if any, of (A)
$75.00 less (B) the per share exercise price of such Company Stock Option. In
no event shall any of the Company Stock Options described in this  _Section
2.4(d)_ be assumed by Parent. In no event shall the vesting of any of the
Company Stock Options described in this _Section 2.4(d)_ be accelerated as a
result of the provisions of this _Section 2.4(d)_. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Non-Employee Holder_ " means any non-employee director of the
Company or any employee or former employee of the Company who is not a
Continuing Employee as of the Effective Time.

 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall adopt such resolutions as
are necessary to effect the treatment of the Company Stock Options, Company
Restricted Share Awards and Company RSU Awards (collectively, the " _Company
Equity Awards_ ") as contemplated by this _Section 2.4_. At the Effective
Time, Parent shall assume all obligations of the Company under the Company
Equity Plans, each outstanding Parent Stock Option, Parent Restricted Share
Award and Parent RSU Award and the agreements evidencing the grants thereof
and shall administer and honor all such awards in accordance with the terms
and conditions of such awards and the Company Equity Plans pursuant to which
they were granted (subject to the adjustments required by reason of this
Agreement or the Transactions or such other adjustments or amendments made by
Parent in accordance with such terms and conditions).

(f) Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in _Article II_ , any
payment to which a current or former employee of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company becomes entitled pursuant to this _Section 2.4_
shall be made through the Surviving Corporations payroll as promptly as
practicable following the Effective Time. Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to make any payments under _Section 2.4_ payable to holders who are not
current or former employees of the Company or any Subsidiary in accordance
with _Section 2.2_.

 

Section 2.5 _Withholding_. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and
withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement,
any amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted with respect to such
consideration under the Code, or any applicable provisions of state, local or
foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely
remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



9 Section 2.6 _Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Parent Stock shall be
issued in connection with the Merger, no certificate or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a shareholder of Parent. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to
the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a
share of Parent Stock (after aggregating all shares represented by the
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive, in
lieu thereof and upon surrender thereof, cash, without interest, in an amount
equal to such fractional part of a share of Parent Stock (rounded to the
nearest one thousandth when expressed in decimal form) _multiplied by_ the
VWAP of Parent Stock.

filed or furnished all forms, documents and reports with the SEC (such forms,
documents and reports, the " _Company SEC Documents_ ") required to be filed
or furnished prior to the date hereof by it with the SEC. As of their
respective dates, or, if amended, as of the date of (and giving effect to)
the last such amendment (and, in the case of registration statements and proxy
statements, on the date of effectiveness and the dates of the relevant
meetings, respectively), the Company SEC Documents complied in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, and the applicable rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, and none of the Company SEC Documents
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. None of the Company SEC Documents is, to the knowledge of the
Company, the subject of ongoing SEC review or outstanding or unresolved
comments. The Company has, prior to the date hereof, provided Parent or its
Representatives with accurate and complete copies of all SEC comment
letters received and response letters submitted and other correspondence with
the SEC with respect to the Company SEC Documents, within the year prior to

requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto in effect at the time of such filing and fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for
the respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and to any other adjustments
described therein, including the notes thereto) in conformity with United
States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (" _GAAP_ ") (except, in the
case of the unaudited statements, to the extent permitted by the SEC) applied
on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated
therein or in the notes thereto).

 

(c) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party to, nor
does it have any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-
balance sheet partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Company or
one of the Company Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated
affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or person, on the other hand) or any "off-balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), in
each case where the result, purpose or effect of such Contract is to avoid
disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of,
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in the Companys financial
statements or other Company SEC Documents. 

 



14 Section 3.5 _Internal Controls and Procedures_.

 

(a) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are
defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the
Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. The Companys
disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that
all material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is
accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "). The Companys management has
completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control
over financial reporting in compliance with the applicable requirements of
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2014,
and such assessment concluded that such controls were effective. The Company
has disclosed to Parent (i) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material
respect the Companys ability to report financial information and (ii) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in the Companys internal control over financial
reporting, in each case, that was disclosed to the Companys auditors or the
audit committee of the Company Board in connection with its most recent
evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting prior to the date
hereof.

 

(b) The Company has complied with and is in compliance in all material
respects with all current listing and corporate governance requirements of
the NASDAQ, and is in compliance in all material respects with all applicable
rules, regulations and requirements of the SEC and with the Sarbanes-Oxley

Section 3.6 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether or not
accrued, contingent or otherwise, that would be required by GAAP to be
reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and the consolidated
Company Subsidiaries (or in the notes thereto), except (a) as
disclosed, reflected or reserved against in the Companys consolidated
balance sheet (or the notes thereto) as of March 31, 2015 included in the
Company SEC Documents filed or furnished and publicly available prior to the
date hereof, (b) for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business
since March 31, 2015, (c) as expressly permitted or contemplated by this
Agreement and (d) as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this
_Section 3.6_, the term "liabilities" shall not include obligations of the
Company or any Company Subsidiaries to perform under or comply with any
applicable Law, action, judgment or Contract, but would include such
liabilities and obligations if there has been a default or failure to perform
or comply by the Company or any Company Subsidiaries with any such Law,
action, judgment or Contract if such default or failure would, with or
without the giving of notice or passage of time or both, reasonably be
expected to result in a monetary obligation.

(a) The Company, the Company Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of the
Company, the Company Collaboration Partners (with respect to the applicable
Company Products), are, and since January 1, 2012 have been, in compliance
with all Laws applicable to the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or such
Company Collaboration Partners, as applicable, except where such non-
compliance would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 2012, neither
the Company, any Company Subsidiary nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any
Company Collaboration Partner (with respect to the applicable Company
Products) has received any written notice or, to the knowledge of the Company,
other communication from any Governmental Entity regarding any material
violation of, or material failure to comply with, any Law.

(b) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries are in possession of all
franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances,
exceptions, consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental
Entity necessary for the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to own, lease
and operate their properties and assets or to carry on their businesses
as they are now being conducted (the " _Company Permits_ "), except where the
failure to have any of the Company Permits would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) all Company Permits are in
full force and effect and are not subject to any administrative or judicial
proceeding that could result in modification, termination or revocation
thereof and (ii) the Company and each Company Subsidiary is in compliance with
the terms and requirements of all Company Permits.

the relevant meetings, respectively), the Parent SEC Documents complied
in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the applicable rules and regulations

303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), in each case where the result, purpose
or effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction
involving, or material liabilities of, Parent or any of the Parent
Subsidiaries in Parents financial statements or other Parent SEC Documents.

 

Section 4.5 _Internal Controls and Procedures_.

and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in
paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act)
as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Parents disclosure
controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all
material information required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that
it files or

 



35  furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to
Parents management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Parents management has
completed an assessment of the effectiveness of Parents internal control over
financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2014, and such assessment
concluded that such controls were effective. Parent has disclosed to the
Company (a) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that
are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect Parents
ability to report financial information and (b) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in Parents internal control over financial reporting, in each case,
that was disclosed to Parents auditors or the audit committee of the Parent
Board in connection with its most recent evaluation of internal controls over
financial reporting prior to the date hereof.

(b) Parent has complied with and is in compliance in all material respects
with all current listing and corporate governance requirements of the NYSE,
and is in compliance in all material respects with all rules, regulations and
requirements of the SEC and with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

Subsidiary has any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether or not
accrued, contingent or otherwise, that would be required by GAAP to be
reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of the Parent and the consolidated
Parent Subsidiaries (or in the notes thereto), except (a) as disclosed,
reflected or reserved against in Parents consolidated balance sheet (or the
notes thereto) as of March 31, 2015 included in the Parent SEC Documents filed
or furnished and publicly available prior to the date hereof, (b) for
liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business since March 31, 2015,
(c) as expressly permitted or contemplated by this Agreement and (d) as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this _Section 4.6_, the term
"liabilities" shall not include obligations of the Parent or any Parent
Subsidiaries to perform under or comply with any applicable Law, action,
judgment or Contract, but would include such liabilities and obligations if
there has been a default or failure to perform or comply by the Parent or any
Parent Subsidiaries with any such Law, action, judgment or Contract if such
default or failure would, with or without the giving of notice or passage of
time or both, reasonably be expected to result in a monetary obligation.

Section 4.7  _Compliance with Laws; Permits_.

(a) Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries are, and since January 1, 2012 have
been, in compliance with all Laws applicable to Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries, except where such non-compliance would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Since January 1, 2012, neither Parent nor any of the Parent
Subsidiaries has received any written notice or, to the knowledge of Parent,

recommend, any Competing Proposal, (D) after receipt or public announcement
of a Competing Proposal (other than a tender offer or exchange offer), fail to
publicly affirm the Company Board Recommendation within five (5) business days
after a request by Parent to do so (or, if earlier, by the close of business
on the business day immediately preceding the scheduled date of the
Stockholders Meeting), or (E) following the commencement of a tender offer or
exchange offer relating to the Company Common Stock by a Person
unaffiliated with Parent, fail to affirm the Company Board Recommendation and
recommend that the Companys stockholders reject such tender offer or exchange
offer within five (5) business days after the commencement of such tender
offer or exchange offer pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or,
if earlier, by the close of

 



47  business on the business day immediately preceding the scheduled date of the
Stockholders Meeting) (any action in this clause (i) being referred to as a "
_Change of Recommendation_ ") or (ii) cause or allow the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, term sheet, agreement or
commitment (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement referred to in
_Section 5.3(b)_) constituting or relating to, or that is intended to or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Competing Proposal (a " _Company
Acquisition Agreement_ ").

(e) _Fiduciary Exception to No Change of Recommendation Provision_.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company
Board may make a Change of Recommendation and/or, if applicable, terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(i)_ if after receiving a bona
fide, written Competing Proposal that did not result from a material breach
of _Section 5.3_, the Company Board has determined in good faith (after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and a financial advisor
of nationally recognized reputation) that (A) such Competing
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (B) in light of such Competing
Proposal, the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of the members of the Company Board under applicable Law;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that, prior to making such Change of Recommendation
or terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(i)_, (1) the
Company has given Parent at least four (4) business days prior written notice
of its intention to take such action (which notice shall specify the material
terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal, and which notice, or the
public disclosure thereof, shall not constitute a Change of Recommendation)
and has contemporaneously provided to Parent a copy of the Superior Proposal,
a copy of any proposed Company Acquisition Agreement with the Person making
such Superior Proposal and a copy of any financing commitments relating
thereto (or, if not provided in writing to the Company, a written summary of
the material terms thereof), (2) the Company has negotiated, and has caused
its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such notice
period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to propose
revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would cause such
Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal, (3) following
the end of such notice period, the Company Board shall have considered in
good faith any written revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent, and shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) that the Superior Proposal would nevertheless continue
to constitute a Superior Proposal if the revisions proposed by Parent were to
be given effect, and (4) in the event of any change to any of the financial
terms (including the form, amount and timing of payment of consideration) or
any other material terms of such Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each
case, have delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent with that
described in clause (1) above of this proviso and a new notice period under
clause (1) of this proviso shall commence (except that the four (4) business
day period notice period referred to in clause (1) above of this proviso shall
instead be equal to three (3) business days) during which time the Company
shall be

 



48  required to comply with the requirements of this _Section 5.3(e)(i)_ anew
with respect to such additional notice pursuant to clauses (1) through (4)
above of this proviso; and  _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company has
complied in all material respects with its obligations under this _Section
5.3_.

 

(ii) Other than in connection with a Superior Proposal (which shall be subject
to _Section 5.3(e)(i)_ and shall not be subject to this _Section
5.3(e)(ii)_), nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Company
Board from making a Change of Recommendation in response to an Intervening
Event if the Company Board has determined in good faith (after consultation
with the Companys outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the members of the Company
Board under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to making
such Change of Recommendation, (1) the Company has given Parent at least four
(4) business days prior written notice of its intention to take such
action, which notice shall specify the reasons therefor (and which notice, or
the public disclosure thereof, shall not constitute a Change of
Recommendation), (2) the Company has negotiated, and has caused its
Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such notice
period after giving any such notice, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate,
to enable Parent to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that
it would not permit the Company Board to make an Change of Recommendation
pursuant to this _Section 5.3(e)(ii)_, and (3) following the end of such
notice period, the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any
written revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent, and
shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with the Companys
outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation) that failure to make a Change of Recommendation in response to
such Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
members of the Company Board under applicable Law.

(f) _Limits on Release of Standstill and Confidentiality_. The Company and
the Company Subsidiaries shall not release any third party from, or waive,
amend or modify any provision of, or grant permission under, any standstill
provision in any agreement to which the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries is a party, other than to the extent the Company Board has
determined in good faith (after consultation with the Companys outside legal
counsel) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of the members of the Company Board under applicable Law;
_provided_ that, in the case of any such action with respect to any standstill
provision or similar obligation, the Company shall, concurrently and on
substantially the same terms, offer to release, waive, amend, modify or grant
permission under any corresponding standstill provision or similar obligation
in any agreement to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party,
including the Confidentiality Agreement.

(g) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3_
shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from (i) taking and
disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any
disclosure to the Companys stockholders if the Company Board

 



49  has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
advisors, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties of the members of the Company Board under applicable Laws with respect
to the fact that a Competing Proposal has been made, the identity of the party
making such Competing Proposal or the material terms of such Competing
Proposal (and, subject to the following proviso, no such disclosure shall,
taken by itself, be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation), or (iii) from
making any "stop, look and listen" communication or any other similar
disclosure to the Companys stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall in no way
eliminate or modify the effect that any such position or disclosure would
otherwise have under this Agreement and any such position or disclosure that
relates to a Competing Proposal (other than any "stop, look and listen"
communication) shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation unless the
Company Board expressly and concurrently reaffirms the Company Board
Recommendation. 

(h) _Stockholders  Meeting_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, no Change of Recommendation shall relieve the Company from its
obligations to submit the adoption of this Agreement to a vote of its
stockholders at the Stockholders Meeting.

 

(i) _Compliance by Representatives_. It is agreed that any violation of the
restrictions on the Company and the Company Subsidiaries set forth in this
_Section 5.3_ by any Representative of the Company or any Company
Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 5.3_ by the
Company.

 

(j) _Certain Definitions_.

 

(i) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

" _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " shall mean a customary
confidentiality agreement (which need not prohibit the making of a Competing
Proposal) with terms no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement may include provisions that are less
favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement so long as the Company offers to amend the
Confidentiality Agreement concurrently with execution of such Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement to include substantially similar provisions for the
benefit of the parties thereto; _provided_ , _further_ that an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement need not include a standstill or other similar
obligation so long as the Company offers to amend the Confidentiality
Agreement concurrently with execution of such Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement to remove any standstill or similar obligation in the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 

" _Competing Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer made by a Person or group
(other than a proposal or offer by Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries)
at any time, including any amendment or modification to any existing proposal
or offer, which is structured to permit (A) such Person or group to acquire
beneficial ownership of at least fifteen percent (15%) of the assets of,
equity interest in, or businesses of, the Company (whether pursuant to a
merger,

 



50  consolidation or other business combination, sale of shares of capital
stock, sale of assets, tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise, including
any single or multi-step transaction or series of related transactions), or
(B) a merger, consolidation, recapitalization or other transaction that
results in the stockholders of the Company immediately preceding such
transaction holding less than eighty percent (85%) of the equity interests of
the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction, in each case other than
the Merger.

" _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Competing Proposal (with
references to 15% and 85% being deemed to be replaced with references to 50%),
which the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with the
Companys outside legal and financial advisors to be more favorable to the
stockholders of the Company from a financial point of view than the Merger,
taking into account all relevant factors (including all the terms and
conditions of such proposal or offer and this Agreement (including any
changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such
offer or otherwise)) and taking into account (1) all financial, legal,
regulatory and other aspects of such proposal or offer (including any
termination fees, any expense reimbursement provisions, the conditions to the
consummation of such Competing Proposal and whether such Competing Proposal is
fully financed) and (2) the identity of the Person making such Competing
Proposal. 

(ii) For purposes of this _Section 5.3_:

 

References to the " _Company Board_ " shall mean the Company Board or, to the
extent applicable, a duly authorized committee thereof.

References to a " _Person_ " means any Person or "group," as defined in
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, other than, with respect to the Company,
Parent or any Parent Subsidiaries.

Section 5.4 _SEC Filings; Stockholders  Meeting_.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, (i) the Company and Parent shall jointly prepare the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus in preliminary form, and (ii) Parent shall prepare and
cause to be filed with the SEC, the Form S-4 with respect to the Parent Stock
issuable in the Merger, which will include the Proxy Statement/Prospectus.
Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to (A)
have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing, and promptly (and in any event within two (2)
business days) after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities
Act, the Company shall file with the SEC the definitive Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, (B) ensure that the Form S-4 complies in all material
respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act or Securities Act
and (C) keep the Form S-4 effective for so long as necessary to complete the
Merger. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information
concerning itself, its affiliates and the holders of its shares to the other
and provide such other assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection
with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and Proxy
Statement/Prospectus. The Form S-4 and Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall
include all information reasonably requested by such other Party to

 



51  be included therein. Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify
the other upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from
the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Form S-4 or Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or any other proxy or consent solicitation statement with
respect to any meeting of the Company stockholders and shall, as promptly as
practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other with copies of
all correspondence between it and its Representatives, on one hand, and the
SEC, on the other hand, and all written comments with respect to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 or any other proxy or consent
solicitation statement with respect to any meeting of the Company
stockholders received from the SEC and advise the other party of any oral
comments with respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 or any
other proxy or consent solicitation statement with respect to any meeting of
the Company stockholders received from the SEC. Each of the Company and Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to
any comments from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as
practicable to any comment from the SEC with respect to the Form S-4.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing the Form S-4 (or any amendment
or supplement thereto) or mailing the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or any other proxy or consent solicitation
statement with respect to any meeting of the Company stockholders or
responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, each of the
Company and Parent shall cooperate and provide the other a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such document or response in advance
(including the proposed final version of such document or response) and
consider in good faith any comments provided by the Company or Parent or any
of their respective Representatives with respect thereto. No amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 will be made by
Parent or the Company without the approval of the other Parties, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Parent
shall advise the Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the
time of effectiveness of the Form S-4, the issuance of any stop order
relating thereto or the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Stock
issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have any
such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated.
Parent shall also use its reasonable best efforts to take any other action
required to be taken under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any
applicable foreign or state securities or "blue sky" Laws and the rules and
regulations thereunder in connection with the issuance of the Parent Stock in
the Merger, and the Company shall furnish all information concerning the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the holders of the Company Common Stock
as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such actions.

(b) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval,
any information relating to the Company or Parent, respectively, or any of
their respective affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Parent
which, in the reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent,
respectively, should be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, any
of the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so that any of such
documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties, and the
Company and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any
necessary

 



52  amendment of, or supplement to, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form
S-4 and, to the extent required by Law, in disseminating the information
contained in such amendment or supplement to stockholders of the Company.
Nothing in this _Section 5.4(b)_ shall limit the obligations of any Party
under _Section 5.4(a)_. For purposes of this _Section 5.4_, any information
concerning or related to the Company, its affiliates or the Stockholders
Meeting will be deemed to have been provided by the Company, and any
information concerning or related to Parent or its affiliates will be deemed
to have been provided by Parent.

 

(c) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the Company Governing
Documents, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold the Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the
stockholders of the Company entitled to vote at the Stockholders Meeting and
to hold the Stockholders Meeting as soon as practicable after the Form S-4 is
declared effective under the Securities Act (or such later date as the Parties
shall agree). Except in each case to the extent that the Company Board shall
have made a Change of Recommendation as permitted by _Section 5.3_ and
subject to _Section 5.3(h)_, the Company shall, through the Company Board,
recommend to its stockholders that they give the Company Stockholder
Approval, include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and
solicit and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder
Approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 5.4(c)_,
if, on a date for which the Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, the Company
has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Company
Common Stock to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, whether or not a
quorum is present, the Company shall have the right to make one or more
successive postponements or adjournments of the Stockholders Meeting;
_provided_ that the Stockholders Meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a
date that is in the aggregate more than thirty (30) days after the date for
which the Stockholders Meeting was originally scheduled (other than,
following consultation with Parent, any adjournments or postponements
required by applicable Law, including adjournments or postponements to the
extent required under applicable Law to ensure that any required supplement or
amendment to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is provided or made available to
the Company stockholders or to permit dissemination of information which is
material to stockholders voting at the Stockholders Meeting and to give the
Company stockholders sufficient time to evaluate any such supplement or
amendment or other information, provided that in no event shall the number of
days by such the Stockholders Meeting is adjourned or postponed exceed thirty
(30) days in the aggregate, less the number of days by which the Stockholders
Meeting has been adjourned or postponed in order to obtain the Company
Stockholder Approval). Once the Company has established a record date for the
Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall not change such record date or
establish a different record date for the Stockholders Meeting without the
prior written consent of Parent, unless, following consultation with Parent,
required to do so by applicable Law or the Company Governing Documents.
Without the prior written consent of Parent, the adoption of this Agreement
shall be the only matter (other than matters of procedure and matters required
by applicable Law to be voted on by the Companys stockholders in connection
with the adoption of this Agreement) that the Company shall propose to be
acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the Stockholders Meeting.

 



53 Section 5.5 _Tax Matters_. Except as set forth in Section 5.5(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, prior to (a) consummating any transaction that (i)
is described in clause (i) or (x) of _Section 5.1(b)_ and (ii) is not subject
to Parents consent right provided in  _Section 5.1(b)_ on the basis that
such transaction involves solely the Company and one or more Company
Subsidiaries or solely Company Subsidiaries, or (b) altering any intercompany
arrangements or agreements or the ownership structure among the Company and
its wholly owned Subsidiaries or among the Companys wholly owned
Subsidiaries, the Company shall, in each case, consult with Parent reasonably
prior to consummating any such transaction and shall not proceed with any
such action or transaction described in clause (a) or (b) hereof without
Parents consent (not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed) if
such action or transaction would, without taking into account any action or
transaction entered into by Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries
(including, after the Effective Time, the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries), reasonably be expected to have adverse Tax consequences that,
individually or in the aggregate, are material to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries or, after the Effective Time, to Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries.

 

ARTICLE VI.

Company Subsidiaries to, (i) provide to Parent and Parents Representatives
reasonable access at reasonable times upon reasonable prior notice to the
officers, employees and other personnel, agents, properties, offices and other
facilities of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and to the books and

reviews and audits to allow Parent to be in compliance with its policies and
procedures and any applicable Law at the Effective Time); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not be required to provide access to or
disclose any such information to the extent such access or disclosure would
result in the loss of attorney-client privilege of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries (provided that the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
shall use their reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or
disclosure in a manner that does not result in a loss of attorney-client
privilege).

(b) Parent will hold, and will cause its Representatives to hold, any
nonpublic information, including any information exchanged pursuant to this
_Section 6.1_, in confidence to the extent required by and in accordance with
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



54 (c) No inspection by Parent or any of its Representatives shall affect or be
deemed to modify or waive any of the representations and warranties of Parent
or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement.

(d) Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other of:

or materially delay or impede the consummation of the Transactions; and

(iv) any event, condition, fact or circumstance that has a materially adverse
impact on the likelihood that all of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_
will be satisfied prior to the Outside Date;

 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
_Section 6.1(d)_ shall not cure any breach of any representation or warranty
requiring disclosure of such matter prior to the date of this Agreement or
otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to any Party. The
failure to deliver any such notice shall not affect any of the conditions set
forth in _Article VII_ or give rise to any right to terminate under _Article
VIII_ , except for any such failure that constitutes a willful breach of this
Agreement.

 

Section 6.2 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party will use

and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Party agrees to make an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act

execution of this Agreement, and in any event within fifteen (15) business
days (unless Parent and Company mutually agree otherwise), and to supply as
promptly as practicable and advisable any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act, including
responding to any Request for Additional Information and Documentary Material

filings and submissions; (ii) promptly inform the other Party of any
communication received by such Party from, or given by such Party to, the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ "), the Federal
Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") or any other Governmental Entity with respect
to any Antitrust Law, by promptly providing copies to the other Party of
any such written communications, and of any material communication received
or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party under any
Antitrust Law, in each case regarding any of the Transactions; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that materials may be redacted (A) to remove references
concerning the valuation of Parent, Company or any of their Subsidiaries, (B)
as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and (C) as necessary to
address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns; and (iii) permit
the other Party to review in advance any communication that it gives to, and
consult with each other in advance of any meeting, substantive telephone call
or conference with, the DOJ, the FTC or any other Governmental Entity with
respect to the subject matter of this _Section 6.2(b)_, or, in connection
with any proceeding by a private party under any Antitrust Law, with any other
Person ( _provided_ , _however_ , that materials may be redacted (A) to
remove references concerning the valuation of Parent, Company or any of their
Subsidiaries, (B) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and

other Governmental Entity or other Person with respect to the subject matter
of this _Section 6.2(b)_. Parent shall, on behalf of the Parties, control
and lead all communications and strategy relating to the Antitrust Laws
(provided that the Company is not constrained from complying with applicable
Law); _provided_ , _further_ , that the Parties shall 

 



56  consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views
of one another, regarding the form and content of any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of either Party in connection with proceedings under
or relating to any Antitrust Law prior to their submission.

 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, if and to the
extent necessary to obtain any waiting period expirations or terminations,
consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, orders, registrations, approvals,
permits, and authorizations for the Transactions under the HSR Act or any
other Antitrust Law, Parent shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
to, use their reasonable best efforts to negotiate, effect and agree to any
sale, divestiture, license, termination, holding separate or other similar
arrangement with respect to, or other disposition of or restriction on, any
indication of any of their respective approved or in-development products or
product lines that (x) is the reduction of sub-cutaneous fat or (y) is
substantially the same as any indication of any approved or in-development
product of the Company and its Subsidiaries (a " _Parent Overlap Product_ "),
or the portion of any of the businesses, divisions, assets, business
arrangements, contracts or interests therein of the Parent and its
Subsidiaries consisting of Parent Overlap Products (a " _Parent Remedial
Action_ "), in each case, solely to the extent reasonably necessary so as to
permit and cause the condition set forth in _Section 7.1(d)_ to be satisfied
by the date that is three (3) business days before the Outside Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, any Parent Remedial Action shall only be required to become
effective from and after the Closing. In furtherance of the immediately
preceding sentence, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure
that (x) no requirement for non-action, a waiver, consent or approval of the
FTC, the DOJ, any State Attorney General or other Governmental Entity, in
each case, with respect to any Antitrust Law, (y) no decree, judgment,
injunction, temporary restraining order or any other order in any suit or
proceeding with respect to any Antitrust Law, and (z) no other matter relating
to any Antitrust Law, would preclude satisfaction of the condition set forth
in _Section 7.1(d)_ by the date that is three (3) business days before the

notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any such Company
Remedial Action is expressly consented to in writing by Parent and is
conditioned upon, and shall become effective only from and after, the
Closing.

(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 6.2(c)_ or any other provision
of this Agreement, in no event shall Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries
be required to (i) offer, accept or agree to any sale, divestiture, license,

consents, waivers, authorizations and approvals of all third parties, other
than Governmental Entities, necessary, proper or advisable for the
consummation of the Transactions and to provide any notices to such third
parties required to be provided prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that without the prior written consent of Parent, the Company
shall not incur any significant expense or liability, enter into any
significant new commitment or agreement or agree to any significant
modification to any contractual arrangement to obtain such consents or
certificates in each case, that would have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 6.3 _Publicity_. So long as this Agreement is in effect, neither the
Company nor Parent, nor any of their respective affiliates, shall issue or
cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement with
respect to the Merger or this Agreement without the prior consent of the other

that it is required by applicable Law or by any listing agreement with or the
listing rules of a national securities exchange or trading market to issue or
cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement
with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or the other Transactions, in
which event such Party shall endeavor, on a basis reasonable under the
circumstances, to provide a meaningful opportunity to the other Party to
review and comment upon such press release or other announcement as far in
advance as practicable and shall give due consideration to all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto; _provided_ _,_ _however_ ,
that, without limiting any of its obligations under _Section 5.3_, the
Company shall not be required by this _Section 6.3_ to provide any such
review or comment to Parent in connection with the receipt and existence of a
Competing Proposal or a Change of Recommendation and matters related thereto;
_provided_ _,_ _further_ , that each Party and their respective affiliates may
make statements that substantially reiterate (and are not inconsistent with)
previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made by

58 Section 6.4 _Directors  and Officers Insurance and Indemnification_. For
not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless all past and
present directors and officers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses
(including advancing reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the
final disposition of any actual or threatened claim, suit, proceeding or
investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by
Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that such Indemnified Party agrees in advance to
return any such funds to which a court of competent jurisdiction has
determined in a final, nonappealable judgment such Indemnified Party is not
ultimately entitled), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities
and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened
claim, action, investigation, suit or proceeding in respect of acts or
omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective
Time (including acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of
this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger or any of the
other Transactions), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, in connection with such persons serving as an officer or
director of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or of any Person
serving at the request of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another Person, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law or provided pursuant to the Company Governing Documents or
the organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary or any indemnification
agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this Agreement. The Parties
agree that for six years after the Effective Time all rights to elimination or
limitation of liability, indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts
or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, now existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided
in their respective certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable
organizational documents) or in any agreement shall survive the Merger and
shall continue in full force and effect. For six years after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the
provisions in (i) the Company Governing Documents and the organizational
documents of any Company Subsidiary and (ii) any other agreements of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries with any Indemnified Party, in each
case, regarding elimination or limitation of liability, indemnification of
officers, directors, employees and agents or other fiduciaries and advancement
of expenses that are in existence on the date of this Agreement, and no such
provision shall be amended, modified or repealed in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights or protections thereunder of any such Indemnified
Party in respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at
or prior to the Effective Time (including acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Merger or any of the other Transactions) without the consent of such
Indemnified Party. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall purchase a
single premium directors and officers liability insurance "tail policy" with
a claims period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time for the
benefit of the Companys current directors and officers that provides
coverage for acts and omissions as directors, officers, employees and agents
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary occurring prior to the Effective Time
(the " _D andO Insurance Policy_") that is no less favorable than the Companys
existing policy as of the date of this Agreement or, if insurance coverage
that is no less favorable is unavailable, the best available coverage;
_provided_ , that Parent shall not be required to pay an aggregate cost for
the DandO Insurance

 



59  Policy in excess of 250% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date
of this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that, if Parent is unable to
obtain such DandO Insurance Policy as of the Effective Time, the Company may
purchase such a DandO Insurance Policy with an aggregate cost not in excess of
250% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the DandO Insurance Policy is not obtained by
either Parent or the Company at or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect, for a period
of six (6) years from the Effective Time, for the benefit of the Companys
current directors and officers with respect to their acts and omissions as
directors, officers, employees or agents of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, a directors and
officers liability insurance policy that is no less favorable than the
Companys existing policy as of the date of this Agreement or, if insurance
coverage that is no less favorable is unavailable, the best available
coverage; _provided_ that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to
pay an annual premium for such insurance policy in excess of 250% of the last
annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement, in which case
the Surviving Corporation shall obtain the maximum amount of coverage
reasonably available for 250% of the last annual premium paid prior to the
date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.4_ to the
contrary, if any Indemnified Party notifies Parent on or prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time of a matter in respect of which such Person
may seek indemnification pursuant to this _Section 6.4_, the provisions of
this  _Section 6.4_ that require the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and
advance expenses shall continue in effect with respect to such matter until
the final disposition of all claims, actions, investigations, suits and
proceedings relating thereto. In the event Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.4_. The
rights and obligations under this _Section 6.4_ shall survive consummation of
the Merger and shall not be terminated or amended in a manner that is adverse
to any Indemnified Party without the written consent of such Indemnified
Party.

Section 6.5 _Takeover Statutes_. The Parties shall (a) take all action
necessary so that no Takeover Statute or, in the case of the Company, any
similar provision of the Company Governing Documents, is or becomes applicable
to the Agreement, the Voting Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
Transactions and (b) if any such Takeover Statute or, in the case of the
Company, any similar provision of the Company Governing Documents, is or
becomes applicable to any of the foregoing, to take all action necessary so
that the Merger and the other Transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
eliminate or minimize the effect of such Takeover Statute on the Agreement,
the Voting Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions.

Section 6.6 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all
action necessary to cause each of Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to
perform their respective obligations under this Agreement and to cause Merger
Sub to consummate the Transactions, including the Merger, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 



60 Section 6.7 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

 

(a) Following the Closing, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, assume, honor and fulfill all of the Company Benefit Plans in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the date of this
Agreement or as subsequently amended as permitted pursuant to the terms of
such Company Benefit Plans. For a period of 12 months following the Effective
Time, Parent shall provide (or cause the Surviving Corporation or another
affiliate of Parent to provide) to each employee of the Company or the any
Company Subsidiary who continues in employment with the Surviving Corporation
or any other affiliate of Parent following the Effective Time (each, a "
_Continuing Employee_ ") with (i) a base salary or hourly wage rate, as
applicable, and cash bonus opportunity that are no less than the base salary
or hourly wage rate, as applicable, and cash bonus opportunity provided to
such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii)
other employee benefits (including, without limitation, employee health and
welfare and retirement benefits), other than equity incentive compensation
and severance or post-termination benefits, which are no less favorable in the
aggregate than at Parents option either (A) those employee benefits provided
to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time or (B)
those employee benefits that Parent or its affiliates provide to their
similarly situated employees during such period. In addition, for a period of
18 months following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide (or cause the
Surviving Corporation or another affiliate of Parent to provide) to each
Continuing Employee severance and post-termination benefits at least as
favorable as the severance and post-termination benefits provided under
Company Benefit Plans (after giving effect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement) in which such Continuing Employee participates and/or to
which such Continuing Employee is a party as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Effective as of the Effective Time and thereafter, Parent
shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, that
periods of employment with the Company (including any current or former
affiliate of the Company or any predecessor of the Company to the
extent recognized by the Company) shall be taken into account for all
purposes under all employee benefit plans maintained by Parent or an affiliate
of Parent for the benefit of the Continuing Employees, including vacation or
other paid time-off plans or arrangements, 401(k), pension or other
retirement plans and any severance or health or welfare plans (other than for
purposes of equity incentive compensation and determining any accrued benefit
under any defined benefit pension plan or as would result in a duplication of
benefits).

(b) Effective as of the Effective Time and thereafter, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) ensure that no eligibility waiting
periods, actively-at-work requirements or pre-existing condition limitations
or exclusions shall apply with respect to the Continuing Employees under the
applicable health and welfare benefits plan of Parent or any affiliate of
Parent (except to the extent applicable under Company Benefit Plans
immediately prior to the Effective Time), (ii) waive any and all evidence of
insurability requirements with respect to such Continuing Employees to the
extent such evidence of insurability requirements were not applicable to the
Continuing Employees under the Company Benefit Plans immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (iii) credit each Continuing Employee with all deductible
payments, out-of-pocket or other co-payments paid by such employee under the
Company Benefit Plans prior to the Closing Date during the year in which the
Closing occurs for the

 



61  purpose of determining the extent to which any such employee has satisfied
his or her deductible and whether he or she has reached the out-of-pocket
maximum under any health benefit plan of Parent or an affiliate of Parent for
such year. The Merger shall not affect any Continuing Employees accrual of,
or right to use, in accordance with Company policy as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, any personal, sick, vacation or other paid-time-
off accrued but unused by such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

(c) If requested by Parent in writing delivered to the Company not less than
ten (10) business days before the Closing Date, the Company Board (or the
appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and take such corporate
action as is necessary to terminate any 401(k) plans maintained by the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Company
401(k) Plans_ "), effective as of the day prior to the Closing Date. Following
the Effective Time, the assets thereof shall be distributed to the
participants, and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall, to the extent
permitted by Parents or the Surviving Corporations applicable 401(k) plan
(collectively, the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ "), permit the Continuing Employees
who are then actively employed to make rollover contributions of "eligible
rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code
and, for the avoidance of doubt, inclusive of loans), in the form of cash
and, with respect to loans, notes, in an amount equal to the full account
balance (inclusive of loans) distributed to such Continuing Employees from the
Company 401(k) Plans to the Parent 401(k) Plan.

 

(d) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall take all reasonable actions, including adopting any necessary
resolutions, to (i) terminate the Company ESPP as of immediately prior to the
Closing, (ii) ensure that no offering period under the Company ESPP shall be
commenced on or after the date of this Agreement, (iii) if the Closing shall
occur prior to the end of the offering period in existence under the Company
ESPP on the date of this Agreement, cause a new exercise date to be set under
the ESPP, which date shall be the business day immediately prior to
the anticipated Closing, and (iv) prohibit participants in the Company ESPP
from altering their payroll deductions from those in effect on the date of
this Agreement (other than to discontinue their participation in the ESPP in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Company ESPP).

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee any
right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict in
any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any affiliate of
Parent, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate
the services of any Continuing Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever,
with or without cause, except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in a
written agreement between Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Company or
any affiliate of Parent and the Continuing Employee or any severance, benefit
or other applicable plan or program covering such Continuing Employee.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in
this _Section 6.7_ shall (i) be deemed or construed to be an amendment or
other modification of any Company Benefit Plan or employee benefit plan of
Merger Sub, (ii) create any third party rights in any current or
former service provider of the Company or its affiliates (or any
beneficiaries or dependents thereof) or (iii) alter or limit the ability of
the Surviving

 



62  Corporation, Parent or any of their respective affiliates to amend, modify
or terminate any Company Benefit Plan or other employee benefit, program,
agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or
maintained by any of them.

(f) No later than thirty (30) days prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall deliver to Parent a list of each "disqualified individual" (as
defined in Section 280G of the Code) of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and (i) the Companys reasonable, good faith estimate of the
maximum amount (separately identifying single and double-trigger amounts and
tax gross-up payments, if any) that could be paid to such disqualified
individual as a result of any of the Transactions (alone or in combination
with any other event), (ii) the "base amount" (as defined in Section
280G(b)(3) of the Code) for each such disqualified individual and (iii)
underlying documentation on which such calculations are based.

(g) The Company shall provide Parent with a copy of any material written
communications intended for broad-based and general distribution to any
current or former employees of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
if such communications relate to any of the Transactions, and will provide
Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
communications prior to distribution.

Section 6.8 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent
shall, as applicable, take all such steps as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable hereto to cause any dispositions of Company equity securities
(including derivative securities) and acquisitions of Parent equity securities
pursuant to the Transactions by each individual who is a director or officer
of the Company subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 6.9 _Security Holder Litigation_. Each Party shall provide the other
Party prompt oral notice (but in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) of
any litigation brought or threatened by any stockholder of that Party against
such Party, any of its Subsidiaries and/or any of their respective directors
or officers relating to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the
Transactions. Unless, in the case of such litigation with respect to the
Company, the Company Board has made a Change of Recommendation, the Company
shall give Parent the opportunity to participate (at Parents expense) in the
defense, prosecution or settlement of any such litigation, and the Company
shall not offer to settle any such litigation, nor shall any such settlement
be agreed to without Parents prior written consent. In the event of, and to
the extent of, any conflict or overlap between the provisions of this _Section
6.9_ and _Section 5.1_ or _Section 6.2_, the provisions of this _Section
6.9_ shall control.

 

Section 6.10 _Delisting_. Each of the Parties agrees to cooperate with the
other Parties in taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary to
delist the Company Common Stock from the NASDAQ and terminate its registration
under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that such delisting and
termination shall not be effective until after the Effective Time.

cash (the " _Termination Fee_ "). Solely for purposes of this _Section

to such term in _Section 5.3(j)(i)_, except that all references to "15%"
therein shall be deemed to be "50%" and all references to "85%" therein shall
be deemed to be "50%".

shall not be or become due unless and until Parent has provided such wire
transfer instructions for such designated account in writing).

(c) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section 8.2_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that neither the
Termination Fee nor any amount payable under _Section 8.2(b)(i)_ is a
penalty, but rather is a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and
Merger Sub in the circumstances in which such payment is payable for the
efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating
this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the Transactions, each of which amounts would otherwise
be impossible to calculate with precision. In addition, if the Company fails
to pay in a timely manner any amount due pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_ then
(i) the Company shall reimburse Parent for all reasonable costs and
expenses (including reasonable disbursements and fees of counsel) incurred in
the collection of such overdue amount, including in connection with any
related claims, actions or proceedings commenced and (ii) the Company shall
pay Parent interest on the amount payable pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_ from

date of actual payment at the prime rate set forth in _The Wall Street
Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required to be made plus 2%.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, upon payment of
the Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 8.2_, none of the Company, any
of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or
future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members,
affiliates or agents shall have any further liability or obligation relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions.

will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
Parties and their respective successors and assigns.

Transactions and each Party hereby waives any objections to any remedy
referred to in this _Section 9.14_ (including any objection on the basis that

at Law for a breach of this Agreement by any Party. In the event any Party

ARTICLE II

MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS

Section 1\. _Place of Meeting_. All meetings of the stockholders of the
Corporation shall be held at such place, either within or without the State
of Delaware, as shall be designated from time to time by the Board of
Directors or stated in the notice of the meeting or duly executed waivers
thereof. The Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, determine that
the meeting shall not be held at any place, but may instead be held by means
of remote communication as authorized by Section 211 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law (" _DGCL_ "), as amended.

 

Section 2\. _Annual Meetings_. If required by applicable law, an annual
meeting of stockholders for the election of directors and the transaction of
other business specified in the notice of meeting shall be held once each year
on any day, and such day shall be designated by the Board of Directors and
stated in the notice of the meeting. Written notice of the annual
meeting stating the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting, and the
means of remote communications, if any, shall be given to each stockholder
entitled to vote at such meeting not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty
(60) days before the date of the meeting.

Section 3\. _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of stockholders, for any
purpose or purposes, unless otherwise prescribed by statute or by the
Certificate of Incorporation, may be called by a majority of the Board of
Directors or at the request in writing of stockholders owning a majority in
amount of the entire capital stock of the Corporation issued and outstanding
and entitled to vote. Such request shall state the purpose or purposes of the
proposed meeting. Upon receipt of such request, it shall be the duty of the
Secretary to fix the date and time of the 

 



A-2  meeting, to be held not more than sixty (60) days following receipt of the
request, and to give notice thereof. If the Secretary shall neglect or refuse
to fix the date and time of the meeting, the person or persons calling the
meeting may do so. Notice of a special meeting stating the place, if any, date
and hour of the meeting, or the means of remote communications, if any, by
which stockholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such
meeting, and the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be
given to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting not less than ten
(10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting. Business
transacted at any special meeting of stockholders shall be limited to the
purposes stated in the notice.

 

Section 4\. _Quorum; Adjourned Meetings_. The holders of a majority of the
stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote, present in person or
represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the
stockholders for the transaction of business except as otherwise provided by
statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation. If, however, such quorum shall
not be present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, the
stockholders entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy,
shall have the power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice
other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present or
represented. At such adjourned meeting, at which a quorum shall be present or
represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted
at the meeting as originally notified. If the adjournment is for more than
thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for
the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to
each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. If the
adjournment is for less than thirty (30) days and if after the adjournment a
new record date is not fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the
adjourned meeting shall not be given, except as required by resolution of the
Board of Directors.

Section 5\. _Required Vote_. When a quorum is present or represented by proxy
at any meeting of stockholders, the vote of the holders of a majority of the
stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy shall
decide any question other than the election of directors brought before such
meeting, unless the question is one upon which by express provision of
statute or of the Certificate of Incorporation a different vote is required,
in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of
such question. Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of
the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at
any meeting at which stockholders may vote for the election of directors.

 

Section 6\. _Voting_. Each stockholder shall at every meeting of the
stockholders be entitled to one vote in person or by proxy for each share of
the capital stock having voting power held by such stockholder, but no proxy
shall be voted or acted upon after three (3) years from its date, unless the
proxy provides for a longer period.

 

Section 7\. _Organization_. Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by
the Chairperson of the Board of Directors, if any, or in the absence of such
Chairperson by a chairperson designated by the Board of Directors, or in the
absence of such designation by a chairperson chosen at the meeting. The
Secretary shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in his or her
absence the chairperson of the meeting may appoint any person to act as
secretary of the meeting.

 



A-3 Section 8\. _Action Without Meeting_. Any action required by law or these
Bylaws to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the
Corporation, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting
of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and
without a vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken,
shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the
minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize such action at a
meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.
Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less
than unanimous written consent shall, to the extent required by law, be given
to those stockholders who have not consented in writing and who, if the
action had been taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to notice of the
meeting if the record date for such meeting had been the date that written
consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take the action were
delivered to the Corporation.

An electronic transmission consenting to an action to be taken and transmitted
by a stockholder, or by a person or persons authorized to act for a
stockholder, shall be deemed to be written, signed and dated for purposes of
this Section 8, provided that any such electronic transmission sets forth or
is delivered with information from which the Corporation can determine (i)
that the electronic transmission was transmitted by the stockholder, or by a
person or persons authorized to act for the stockholder, and (ii) the date on
which such stockholder or authorized person or persons transmitted such
electronic transmission. The date on which such electronic transmission is
transmitted shall be deemed to be the date on which such consent was signed.

 

Any copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a consent in writing may
be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing for any and all
purposes for which the original writing could be used, provided that such
copy, facsimile or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the
entire original writing.

 

Section 9\. _List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote_. The officer of the
Corporation who has charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation shall
prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders,
a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged
in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the
number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall
be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the
meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10)
days prior to the meeting, at the principal place of business of the
Corporation. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of
the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any
stockholder of the Corporation who is present.

Section 10\. _Stock Ledger_. The stock ledger of the Corporation shall be the
only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the stock
ledger, the list required by Section 9 of this Article II or the books of the
Corporation, or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders.

 



A-4 ARTICLE III

 

DIRECTORS

 

Section 1\. _General Authority_. The business and affairs of the Corporation
shall be managed by or under the direction of its Board of Directors which
may exercise all such powers of the Corporation and do such lawful acts and
things as are not by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation or by
these Bylaws directed or required to be exercised or done by the stockholders
or other person or persons.

Section 2\. _Number and Election_. The number of directors which shall
constitute the first Board of Directors shall be the number elected by the
Incorporator. The number of directors which shall constitute all subsequent
Boards of Directors shall be specified by resolution of the Board of
Directors. The directors shall be elected at the annual meeting of the
stockholders, except as provided in Section 3 of this Article III and except
that the first directors of the Corporation shall be elected by the
Incorporator and each director shall hold office until his successor is
elected and qualified or until his earlier resignation or removal. Directors
need not be stockholders.

Section 3\. _Vacancies and Newly Created Directorships_. Vacancies, and newly
created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of
directors, shall be filled by a majority vote of the directors then in office,
though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, and the directors
so chosen shall hold office until the next annual election and until their
successors are duly elected and shall qualify, unless sooner displaced. If
there are no directors in office, then an election of directors may be held
in the manner provided by statute.

Section 4\. _Regular Meetings_. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may
be held at such places within or without the State of Delaware and at such
times as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine.

 

Section 5\. _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may
be held at any time or place within or without the State of Delaware whenever
called by the President, any Vice President, the Secretary, or by any member
of the Board of Directors.

 

Section 6\. _Notice of Meetings_. The Secretary or other person or persons
calling a meeting shall give notice at least two (2) days before the meeting.
Except as otherwise herein provided, neither the business to be transacted at,
nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors
need be specified in this notice of such meeting. A written waiver of notice
signed by the director entitled to notice, whether before or after the time
stated therein, shall be equivalent to notice. Attendance of a director at the
meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when
the director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the
beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the
meeting is not lawfully called or convened.

 

Section 7\. _Quorum; Required Vote; Adjourned Meetings_. At all meetings of
the Board of Directors or any committee thereof, a majority of directors or
committee members shall

 



A-5  constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. The act of a majority
of the directors or committee members present at any meeting at which there is
a quorum shall be the act of the Board of Directors or committee, as the case
may be, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by statute or by the
Certificate of Incorporation. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting
of the Board of Directors or committee thereof, the directors present thereat
may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than
announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present. In the event
that such Board of Directors or committee is composed of an even number
of persons, a majority means one-half of the number of such persons plus one.

Section 8\. _Action Without Meetings; Telephone Meeting_. Unless otherwise
restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, any action
required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or
of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting, if all members of
the Board of Directors or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in
writing or by electronic transmission, and the writing or writings or
electronic transmission or transmissions are filed with the minutes of
proceedings of the Board of Directors or committee.

Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation or these
Bylaws, members of the Board of Directors or any committee designated by such
Board of Directors, may participate in a meeting of such Board of Directors or
committee by means of conference telephone or other communications equipment
by which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other and
participation in a meeting pursuant to this Section 8 shall constitute
presence in person at such meeting.

 

Section 9\. _Committees_. The Board of Directors may designate one or more
committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the
Corporation. The Board of Directors may designate one or more directors as
alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified
member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of
a member of a committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting
and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he or they constitute a
quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board of Directors to
act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member.
Such committee or committees shall have such member or members as may be
determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors.
Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of
Directors and to the extent permitted under applicable statutory provisions,
shall have and may exercise all the power and authority of the Board of
Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation,
and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers
which may require it.

Section 10.  _Committee Minutes_. Each committee shall keep regular minutes
of its meetings and report the same to the Board of Directors when required.

 

Section 11\. _Compensation_. The directors may be paid their expenses, if any,
of attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors and may be paid a
fixed sum for attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors or a stated
salary as director. No such payment shall

 



A-6  preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity and
receiving compensation therefor. Members of special or standing committees may
be allowed like compensation for attending committee meetings.

Section 12\. _Resignation_. Any director of the Corporation may resign at any
time by giving notice in writing or by electronic transmission to the
President or to the Secretary of the Corporation. The resignation of any
director shall take effect at the time specified therein; and, unless
otherwise specified therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be
necessary to make it effective.

Section 13\. _Removal_. Any director or the entire Board of Directors may be
removed, at any time, with or without cause, by the holders of a majority of
the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors, except as may be
provided by statute or the Certificate of Incorporation.

 

ARTICLE IV

NOTICES 

Section 1\. _General_. Whenever, under the provisions of applicable statutory
law or of the Certificate of Incorporation or of these Bylaws, notice is
required to be given to any director or stockholder, it shall not be construed
to mean personal notice, but such notice may be given in writing, by mail,
addressed to such director or stockholder, at his address as it appears on
the records of the Corporation, with postage thereon prepaid, and such notice
shall be deemed to be given at the time when the same shall be deposited in
the United States mail. An affidavit of the Secretary or an Assistant
Secretary or of the transfer agent of the Corporation that the notice has
been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the
facts stated therein. Notice to directors may also be given by email or
facsimile (with confirmation of receipt of such facsimile).

Section 2\. _Waiver of Notice_. Whenever any notice is required to be given
under the provisions of the statutes or of the Certificate of Incorporation
or of these Bylaws, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person or
persons entitled to said notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the
person entitled to such notice, whether before or after the time stated
therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a
meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the
person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at
the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the
meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be
transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the
stockholders, directors or members of a committee of directors need be
specified in any written waiver of notice or any waiver by electronic
transmission unless so required by the Certificate of Incorporation or these
Bylaws.

ARTICLE VI

 

INDEMNIFICATION AND ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES

 

Section 1\. _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_. The Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as
it presently exists or may hereafter be amended, any director or officer of
the Corporation who was or is made or is threatened to be made a party or is
otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a " _Proceeding_ ") by
reason of the fact that he or she, or a person for whom he or she is the legal

was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture,
trust, enterprise or non-profit entity, including service with respect to
employee benefit plans, against all liability and loss suffered and expenses
(including attorneys fees) reasonably incurred by such person in connection
with any such Proceeding. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except as
otherwise provided in Section 4 of Article VI, the Corporation shall be

such person only if the Proceeding was authorized in the specific case by the
Board of Directors.

 



A-8 Section 2\. _Indemnification of Others_. The Corporation shall have the power
to indemnify and hold harmless, to the extent permitted by applicable law as
it presently exists or may hereafter be amended, any employee or agent of the

a person for whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was an employee
or agent of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation
or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or non-profit entity,

in connection with any such Proceeding.

Section 3\. _Prepayment of Expenses_. The Corporation shall to the fullest
extent not prohibited by applicable law pay the expenses (including attorneys
fees) incurred by any officer or director of the Corporation, and may pay the
expenses incurred by any employee or agent of the Corporation, in defending
any Proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that,
to the extent required by law, such payment of expenses in advance of the
final disposition of the Proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an
undertaking by the person to repay all amounts advanced if it should be
ultimately determined that the person is not entitled to be indemnified under
this Article VI or otherwise.

 

Section 4\. _Determination; Claim_. If a claim for indemnification (following
the final disposition of such Proceeding) or advancement of expenses under
this Article VI is not paid in full within sixty (60) days after a written
claim therefor has been received by the Corporation the claimant may file suit
to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in whole or in
part, shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim to
the fullest extent permitted by law. In any such action the Corporation shall
have the burden of proving that the claimant was not entitled to
the requested indemnification or payment of expenses under applicable law.

Section 5\. _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_. The rights conferred on any person
by this Article VI shall not be exclusive of any other rights which such
person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the
Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders
or disinterested directors or otherwise.

on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent
of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as
a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, enterprise or non-profit entity against any liability
asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity,
or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the Corporation
would have the power to indemnify him or her against such liability under the
provisions of the DGCL.

Section 7\. _Other Indemnification_. The Corporations obligation, if any, to
indemnify or advance Expenses to any person who was or is serving at its
request as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or non-profit 

 



A-9  entity shall be reduced by any amount such person may collect as
indemnification or advancement of expenses from such other corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or non-profit enterprise.

Section 8\. _Continuation of Indemnification_. The rights to indemnification
and to prepayment of Expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this
Article VI shall continue notwithstanding that the person has ceased to be a
director or officer of the Corporation and shall inure to the benefit of the
estate, heirs, executors, administrators, legatees and distributees of such
person.

Section 9\. _Amendment or Repeal_. The provisions of this Article VI shall
constitute a contract between the Corporation, on the one hand, and, on the
other hand, each individual who serves or has served as a director or officer
of the Corporation (whether before or after the adoption of these Bylaws), in
consideration of such persons performance of such services, and pursuant to
this Article VI the Corporation intends to be legally bound to each such
current or former director or officer of the Corporation. With respect to
current and former directors and officers of the Corporation, the rights
conferred under this Article VI are present contractual rights and such rights
are fully vested, and shall be deemed to have vested fully, immediately upon
adoption of these Bylaws. With respect to any directors or officers of the
Corporation who commence service following adoption of these Bylaws, the
rights conferred under this provision shall be present contractual rights and
such rights shall fully vest, and be deemed to have vested fully, immediately
upon such director or officer commencing service as a director or officer of
the Corporation. Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of
this Article VI shall not adversely affect any right or protection (i)
hereunder of any person in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to
the time of such repeal or modification or (ii) under any agreement providing
for indemnification or advancement of Expenses to an officer or director of
the Corporation in effect prior to the time of such repeal or modification.

certificates, provided that the Board of Directors may provide by resolution
or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of stock shall

represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to
the Corporation. Every holder of stock represented by certificates shall be
entitled to have a certificate signed by or in the name of the Corporation (i)
by the Chairperson or Vice Chairperson of the Board of Directors, if any, or
the President or a Vice President, and (ii) by the Chief Financial Officer or
an Assistant Financial Officer, or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, of

it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if such person
were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.

 



A-10 Section 2\. _Transfers of Stock_. Upon surrender to the Corporation or the
transfer agent of the Corporation of a certificate for shares in compliance
with the requirements of Section 8-401 of Title 6 of the Delaware Code

Section 3\. _Lost or Destroyed Stock Certificates; Issuance of New
Certificates_. The Corporation may issue a new certificate of stock or
uncertificated shares in the place of any certificate theretofore issued by
it, alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and the Corporation may
require the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or such
owners legal representative, to give the Corporation a bond sufficient to
indemnify it against any claim that may be made against it on account of
the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the
issuance of such new certificate or uncertificated shares.

 

Section 4\. _Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of Record_. In
order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice
of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or to
express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, or entitled
to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any
rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change,
conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action,
the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not
precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted
by the Board of Directors, and which record date: (i) in the case of
determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders
or adjournment thereof, shall, unless otherwise required by law, not be more
than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting;
(ii) in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to express consent
to corporate action in writing without a meeting, shall not precede nor be
more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the
record date is adopted by the Board of Directors; and (iii) in the case of any
other action, shall not be more than sixty (60) days prior to such other
action. If no record date is fixed: (i) the record date for determining
stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders
shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which
notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day
next preceding the day on which the meeting is held; (ii) the record date for
determining stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in
writing without a meeting, when no prior action of the Board of Directors is
required by law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent
setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the
Corporation in accordance with applicable law, or, if prior action by the
Board of Directors is required by law, shall be at the close of business on
the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such
prior action; and (iii) the record date for determining stockholders for any
other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board
of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of
stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of
stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however,
that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned
meeting.

 



A-11 Section 5\. _Registered Stockholders_. The Corporation shall be entitled to
treat the record holder of any shares of the Corporation as the owner thereof
for all purposes, including all rights deriving from such shares, and shall
not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to, or interest in,
such shares or rights deriving from such shares, on the part of any other
person, including, but without limiting the generality thereof, a purchaser,
assignee or transferee of such shares or rights deriving from such shares,
unless and until such purchaser, assignee, transferee or other person becomes
the record holder of such shares, whether or not the Corporation shall have
either actual or constructive notice of the interest of such purchaser,
assignee, transferee or other person. Any such purchaser,
assignee, transferee or other person shall not be entitled to receive notice
of the meetings of stockholders, to vote at such meetings, to examine a
complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at meetings, or to own,
enjoy and exercise any other property or rights deriving from such shares
against the Corporation, until such purchaser, assignee, transferee or other

INTERESTED OFFICERS OR DIRECTORS

 

No contract or transaction between this Corporation and one or more of its
directors or officers, or between this Corporation and any other corporation,
partnership, association or other organization in which one or more of its
directors or officers are directors or officers, or have a financial interest,
shall be void or voidable solely for this reason, or solely because the
director or officer is present at or participates in the meeting of the Board
of Directors or committee thereof which authorizes the contract or
transaction, or solely because any such directors or officers votes are
counted for such purpose, if: 

(a) The material facts as to the directors or officers relationship or
interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to
the Board of Directors or the committee, and the Board of Directors or
committee in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the

the disinterested directors be less than a quorum; or

(b) The material facts as to the directors or officers relationship
or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known
