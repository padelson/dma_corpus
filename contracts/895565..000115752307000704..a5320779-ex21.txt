at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company.
As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall cease and the Company shall continue under the name "Synagro

(the "Surviving Corporation").      SECTION 1.02 Closing. Unless this
Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with Section 8.01, and
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article
VII, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at 11:00 a.m.,
New York time, on a date to be specified by the parties, which shall be not

conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those that by their terms are
to be satisfied or waived at the Closing), at the offices of Locke Liddell and
Sapp LLP, 600 Travis Street, Suite 3400, Houston, Texas 77002, unless another
time, date and/or place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the
Company.   SECTION 1.03 Effective Time. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, simultaneously with the Closing, the
parties hereto shall (i) file a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of
Merger") in such form as is required by, and executed and acknowledged in
accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL, and (ii) make all other
filings or recordings required under the DGCL to effect the Merger. The
Merger shall become effective at such date and time as the Certificate of
Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or
at such subsequent date and time as Parent and the Company shall agree and
specify in the Certificate of Merger. The date and time at which the Merger
becomes effective is referred to in this Agreement as the "Effective
Time".   SECTION 1.04 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the
effect of the Merger shall be as provided in Section 259 of the DGCL.  
SECTION 1.05 Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws.   (a) At the Effective
Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the  Company, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the  Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter  amended in
accordance with the provisions thereof and as provided by Law.   (b) At the
Effective Time, the Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect  immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the  Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended as provided by Law, the  Certificate of Incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation and such Bylaws,  except that the references to
Merger Sub\'s name shall be replaced by  references to Synagro Technologies,
Inc..   SECTION 1.06 Directors and Officers. The directors of Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of
the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, and the
officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until
the earlier of their death, resignation or removal.    2     ARTICLE
II  EFFECT OF MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES   SECTION
2.01 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, the following shall
occur by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the following
securities:   (a) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of Company
Common  Stock (all issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
being  hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Shares") issued and 
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Shares 
to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.01(b), Shares owned by any direct or 
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and not owned on behalf on  a
third person and any Dissenting Shares) shall be canceled and shall be 
converted automatically into the right to receive an amount per Share 
(subject to any applicable withholding Tax specified in Section 2.02(f) 
hereof) equal to $5.76 in cash, without interest (the "Merger 
Consideration"). At the Effective Time, each holder of a certificate 
theretofore representing any such shares of Company Common Stock (other  than
holders of Dissenting Shares), including any shares of restricted  stock of
the Company issued under the Company\'s 2005 Restricted Stock Plan,  whether
or not restrictions have lapsed, shall cease to have any rights  with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration  and any
declared but unpaid dividends, including the Stub Period Dividend,  if
applicable, upon surrender of such certificates in accordance with  Section
2.02, without interest.   (b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-
Owned Stock. Each Share  held in the treasury of the Company and each Share
owned by Merger Sub,  Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent  immediately prior to the Effective Time and not owned
on behalf of a third  person shall automatically be canceled without any
conversion thereof and  no payment or distribution shall be made with respect
thereto.   (c) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of common stock, par
value  $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to  the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly
issued,  fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.002
per  share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only shares
of  capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.   SECTION 2.02 Exchange of
Certificates.   (a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
(i)  appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company
(the  "Paying Agent"), and (ii) enter into a paying agent agreement, in form
and  substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, with such Paying Agent
for  the payment of the (A) aggregate Merger Consideration, (B) the
aggregate  amount of cash dividends, if any, that (x) were declared after the
date  hereof and are expressly permitted hereunder to have been so declared,
(y)  have a record date prior to the Effective Time, and (z) are unpaid at
the  Effective Time (such dividends, including the Stub Period Dividend,
the  "Outstanding Dividends") and (C) Option Payments (as defined below) in 
accordance with this Article II. Parent shall provide the Paying Agent with 
irrevocable instructions and authority to pay each respective holder of 
record (or otherwise pursuant to    3     Section 2.02(b) below) of
certificates evidencing Shares (other than any  Shares cancelled pursuant to
Section 2.01(b), Shares owned by any direct or  indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of the Company and any Dissenting Shares),  as evidenced by a list
of such holders certified by an officer of the  Surviving Corporation or the
Surviving Corporation\'s transfer agent, the  Merger Consideration upon
surrender of certificates that formerly evidenced  Shares and the amount of
Outstanding Dividends due thereon. At or prior to  the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with  the Paying Agent, for the
benefit of the holders of Shares and Company  Stock Options and separate and
apart from its other funds, as a trust fund,  cash in an amount sufficient to
pay the aggregate Merger Consideration and  Outstanding Dividends required to
be paid pursuant to Section 2.01(a) and  the aggregate Option Payments
required to be paid pursuant to Section  2.04(b) (such cash to pay the Merger
Consideration, Outstanding Dividends  and the Option Payments being
hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange  Fund"). The Exchange Fund shall not
be used for any other purpose. The  Exchange Fund shall be invested by the
Paying Agent as directed by Parent;  provided, however, that such investments
shall be in obligations of or  guaranteed by the United States of America or
any agency or instrumentality  thereof and backed by the full faith and
credit of the United States of  America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by  Moody\'s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poor\'s Corporation,  respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or  banker\'s acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $10 billion  (based on the most recent financial statements
of such bank which are then  publicly available). Any net profit resulting
from, or interest or income  produced by, such investments shall be payable
to the Surviving  Corporation.   (b) Exchange Procedures. As promptly as
practicable after the  Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to
mail to each person  who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of
Shares entitled to  receive the Merger Consideration and Outstanding
Dividends pursuant to  Section 2.01(a): (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall be in customary  form and shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss  and title to the certificates evidencing such
Shares (the "Certificates")  shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying  Agent (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof)) and (ii)  instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates (or  effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in exchange
for payment of  the Merger Consideration and Outstanding Dividends. Upon
surrender to the  Paying Agent of a Certificate (or effective affidavits of
loss in lieu  thereof) for cancellation, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly  completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto,  the holder of the Shares represented by such
Certificate (or effective  affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) shall be
entitled to receive in  exchange therefor the Merger Consideration and
Outstanding Dividends  pursuant to Section 2.01(a) in respect of the Shares
formerly represented  by such Certificate (or effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof), and  the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. In the event  of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not
registered in the transfer  records of the Company, payment of the Merger
Consideration and Outstanding  Dividends may be made to a person other than
the person in whose name the  Certificate so surrendered is registered if the
Certificate representing  such Shares shall be properly endorsed or otherwise
be in proper form for  transfer and the person requesting such payment shall
pay any transfer or  other taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration  and Outstanding Dividends to a person other than the
registered holder of  such Certificate or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that  such tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Until surrendered as  contemplated by this Section 2.02, each    4    
Certificate shall be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to 
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger 
Consideration and Outstanding Dividends to which the holder of such 
Certificate is entitled pursuant to this Article II. No interest shall be 
paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant 
to the provisions of this Article II. The method of payment of cash for 
Shares converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration and 
Outstanding Dividends shall be by wire transfer, bank check or other method 
that will provide a holder of Shares not later than second day funds.  Parent
shall instruct the Paying Agent to timely pay the Merger  Consideration and
Outstanding Dividends.   (c) No Further Rights. From and after the Effective
Time, holders of  Certificates shall cease to have any rights as stockholders
of the Company,  except as provided herein or by Law.   (d) Termination of
Exchange Fund. At any time which is more than one  year after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled  to require the Paying
Agent to deliver to it any Exchange Funds which had  been deposited with the
Paying Agent and have not been disbursed in  accordance with this Article II
(including, without limitation, interest  and other income received by the
Paying Agent in respect of the funds made  available to it), and after the
Exchange Funds have been delivered to the  Surviving Corporation, Persons
entitled to payment in accordance with this  Article II shall be entitled to
look solely to the Surviving Corporation  (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Laws) for payment  of the Merger Consideration and
Outstanding Dividends upon surrender of the  Certificates held by them,
without any interest thereon; provided, that  such Person shall have no
greater rights against the Surviving Corporation  than may be accorded to
general creditors of the Surviving Corporation  under applicable Laws. Any
portion of the Exchange Funds deposited with the  Paying Agent remaining
unclaimed as of a date which is immediately prior to  such time as such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of  any government
entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,  become the property
of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any  claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.   (e) No Liability. None of the Paying
Agent, Merger Sub, Parent or the  Surviving Corporation shall be liable to
any holder of Shares for any such  Shares (or dividends or distributions with
respect thereto), or cash  delivered to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat  or similar Law.   (f) Withholding Rights. Each
of the Paying Agent, the Surviving  Corporation and Parent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the  consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any holder of  Shares and Company Stock Options such
amounts as it is required to deduct  and withhold with respect to such
payment under all applicable Tax Laws. To  the extent that amounts are so
withheld by the Paying Agent, the Surviving  Corporation or Parent, as the
case may be, such withheld amounts shall be  treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the  holder of the Shares in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was  made by the Paying Agent, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case  may be.   (g) Lost
Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen  or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person     5    
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required 
by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable and 
customary amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that 
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent 
shall pay in respect of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the 
Merger Consideration and Outstanding Dividends to which the holder thereof 
is entitled pursuant to Section 2.01(a).   SECTION 2.03 Stock Transfer
Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall
be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares
thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of Certificates representing Shares outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Shares, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by Law. At or after
the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Paying Agent or Parent
for any reason shall be canceled against delivery of the Merger Consideration
and Outstanding Dividends to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant
to Section 2.01(a).   SECTION 2.04 Company Stock Options.   (a) As part of
the Transactions (as defined in Section 3.04), the  Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to ensure that (i)  immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each outstanding option to  purchase Company Common Stock
granted under any Company Stock Plan shall  become immediately vested and
exercisable in full, (ii) at the Effective  Time, each option to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock granted under  the Company Stock Plans (each,
a "Company Stock Option") shall be canceled  as of the Effective Time in
exchange for the consideration contemplated by  Section 2.04(b), and (iii) at
the Effective Time, all of the Company Stock  Plans shall be terminated, in
each case, in accordance with and pursuant to  the terms of the Company Stock
Plans and without the creation of additional  liability to the Company or any
Subsidiaries.   (b) Each holder of a Company Stock Option that is
outstanding and  unexercised as of the Effective Time, whether or not
exercisable at the  Effective Time, and has an exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock  that is less than the per share Merger Consideration
shall (subject to the  provisions of this Section 2.04) be paid out of the
Exchange Fund as  promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, in
exchange for the  cancellation of such Company Stock Option, an amount in
cash (subject to  any applicable withholding Taxes) equal to (i) the
difference between the  per share Merger Consideration and the applicable
exercise price of such  Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the
aggregate number of Shares  issuable upon exercise, whether or not
exercisable at the Effective Time,  of such Company Stock Option (the "Option
Payment"). Any such payments  shall be subject to all applicable federal,
state and local Tax withholding  requirements, and shall be by wire transfer,
bank check or other method  that will provide a holder of Shares not later
than second day funds.  Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to timely pay
the Option Payments;  provided, however that Parent may distribute at the
Effective Time, or  cause the Paying Agent to distribute, the Option Payment
to the Surviving  Corporation for distribution by the Surviving Corporation
to holders of  Company Stock Options through the Company\'s normal payroll
procedures.    6     SECTION 2.05 Dissenting Shares.   (a)
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary  and to the
extent available under the DGCL, Shares that are issued and  outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by  any stockholder
who is entitled to demand and properly demands the  appraisal for such Shares
(the "Dissenting Shares") pursuant to, and who  complies in all respects
with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL  ("Section 262") shall not be
converted into, or represent the right to  receive, the Merger Consideration.
Any such stockholder shall instead be  entitled to receive payment of the
fair value of such stockholder\'s  Dissenting Shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262;  provided, however, that all Dissenting Shares
held by any stockholder who  shall have failed to perfect or who otherwise
shall have withdrawn or lost  such stockholder\'s rights to appraisal of such
Shares under Section 262  shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted
into, and to have become  exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the
right to receive the Merger  Consideration and Outstanding Dividends, without
any interest thereon, upon  surrender in the manner provided in Section 2.02
of the Certificate or  Certificates that formerly evidenced such Shares. At
the Effective Time,  any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect  thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of
the DGCL and as  provided in the preceding sentence.   (b) The Company
shall give Parent (i) notice as promptly as  practicable of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of any  Shares and withdrawals of such
demands and (ii) the right to participate in  and direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for  appraisal under the DGCL. The
Company shall not, except with the prior  written consent of Parent, make any
payment or agree to make any payment  with respect to any demands for
appraisal or offer to settle or settle any  such demands, except to the
extent it is expressly required to do so by  court order.   SECTION 2.06
Adjustment of Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the issued and outstanding Shares shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of
any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reclassification,
redenomination, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares
or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration and any other
dependent items shall be appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of
Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such action and as so adjusted shall, from and after the
date of such event, be the Merger Consideration or other dependent item,
subject to further adjustment in accordance with this sentence.   ARTICLE
III  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   Except as otherwise
disclosed to Parent in the schedules attached hereto (the "Company
Schedules") or as disclosed in the SEC Reports publicly available prior to
the date of this Agreement (other than forward looking statements set forth
in the "risk factors" and "management\'s discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations" portions of the SEC Reports),
the Company hereby makes the following representations and warranties to
Parent and Merger Sub. Any disclosures in any section of the Company
Schedules shall    7    qualify any other section in this Article III
to the extent relevant, as long as the applicability of such matter to such
other section is reasonably apparent on its face, and disclosure in any
section of the Company Schedules shall be effectively made whether or not
expressly excepted in the corresponding section of this Agreement.  
SECTION 3.01 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries.   (a) Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries is duly organized,  validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its respective  jurisdiction of organization, and
has the requisite corporate or similar  power and authority and all necessary
governmental approvals to own, lease  and operate its properties and to carry
on its business as it is now being  conducted, except where the failure to be
in good standing would not,  individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect. Each of  the Company and each Subsidiary is duly
qualified or licensed as a foreign  corporation or other entity to do
business, and is in good standing (where  such concept exists), in each
jurisdiction where the character of the  properties owned, leased or operated
by it or the nature of its business  makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except for such failures  to be so qualified or licensed and in
good standing that would not have a  Material Adverse Effect.   (b)
Schedule 3.01(b) sets forth a true and complete list of all the  Company\'s
Subsidiaries and the jurisdiction of organization thereof. All  the
outstanding Equity Interests of each Subsidiary of the Company are  owned,
directly or indirectly, by the Company free and clear of any Liens,  other
than Liens securing Company indebtedness. There are no stockholder 
agreements, voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which  the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them  are
bound relating to the voting of any shares of capital stock of the 
Company\'s Subsidiaries. Except for its interests in its Subsidiaries, the 
Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any Equity Interest in any 
other Person.   SECTION 3.02 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. The
Company has made available to Parent a complete and correct copy of the
Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws, or equivalent organizational
documents, in each case as amended to date ("Organizational Documents"), of
the Company and each Material Subsidiary. Such Organizational Documents are
in full force and effect and no other organizational documents are applicable
or binding upon the Company or any of its Material Subsidiaries. Neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary is, nor has the Company been, in violation of any
of the provisions of its Organizational Documents. No Subsidiary has been in
material violation of any of the provisions of its Organizational Documents.
The Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies of the
minutes of all meetings of the Company Board (and each committee thereof) and
of the stockholders of the Company, in each case since January 1, 2003.

otherwise, that would be  required by GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated
balance sheet (or the  notes thereto) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries.   (d) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.07(d), neither the

connection with the Merger,  will, when filed, comply as to form in all
material respects with the  applicable requirements of the Exchange Act.  
(b) None of the information included or incorporated by reference in  the
Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the Company\'s

each parcel of Material Owned Real Property,  (A) the street address of such
parcel of Material Owned Real Property  and (B) the current owner of such
parcel of Material Owned Real  Property; and   (ii) with respect to each

lease.   (b) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has good fee simple
title  to all of the Material Owned Real Property, free and clear of all
Liens,  except Permitted Liens. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.13(b),
there are  no outstanding options, right of first offer or rights of first
refusal to  purchase the Material Owned Real Property or any portion thereof
or  interest therein. There are no leases, subleases, licenses concessions
or  other agreements (written or oral) granting any person the right to use
or  occupy the Material Owned Real Property except as set forth on Schedule 
3.13(b). The Company has previously made available to Parent a true,  correct
and complete copy of each title insurance policy, title opinion,  survey and
appraisal relating to the Material Owned Real Property which is  in its
possession or reasonably available to it, without representation or  warranty
as to the specific matters set forth therein.   (c) All Material Leased Real
Property is leased by the Company and its  Subsidiaries (as the case may be)
under valid and subsisting leases or  subleases. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has received written  notice of any material breach or default, or
cancellation or termination  thereunder. The Company does not have knowledge
of any condition, event or  circumstance which with notice or lapse of time,
or both, would constitute  a material breach or default under such lease or
sublease.    16     (d) The Company and its Subsidiaries own, lease or
have the right to  use all the Material Real Property and material assets for
the conduct of  their respective business free and clear of all Liens, except
Permitted  Liens. In the case of material leased equipment and other material
tangible  assets, the Company and its Subsidiaries hold valid leasehold
interests in  such assets, free and clear of all Liens, except Permitted
Liens.   (e) Schedule 3.13(e) sets forth an accurate listing of each lease
of  real property pursuant to which the Company or any Subsidiary acts as 
lessor and which has an annual rental amount in excess of $500,000.  
SECTION 3.14 Intellectual Property.   (a) Schedule 3.14(a) sets forth an
accurate and complete description  of all patents and patent applications,
registered trademarks, trade names  and service marks, domain names, and
registered copyrights, together with  applications to register the same, for
each of the foregoing owned by the  Company and material to the business of
the Company and its subsidiaries  taken as a whole ("Registered Intellectual
Property"). Excluding  "shrinkwrap" or "clickwrap" agreements or agreements
contained in or  pertaining to "off-the-shelf" software, the Company has not
entered into  any material agreements relating to Intellectual Property.
Except for such  agreements entered into by the Company in connection with
the sale process  that resulted in the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the Company  has not entered into any nondisclosure or
confidentiality agreements which  remain in effect under which any trade
secrets or other material  confidential or proprietary information of the
Company has been or will be  disclosed to a third party.   (b) Except as
would not constitute a Material Adverse Effect, the  conduct of the business
of the Company and the Subsidiaries as it has been,  or as it currently is
conducted, does not and has not infringed upon,  misappropriated, diluted or
violated the Intellectual Property rights of  any third party. There are no
pending actions against the Company or the  Subsidiaries, and neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has  received any written notice alleging
that the conduct of the business of  the Company and the Subsidiaries, as it
currently is conducted or as it has  been conducted, may or has infringed
upon, misappropriated, diluted or  violated the Intellectual Property rights
of any third party. Since January  1, 2003, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has received any  written communication containing an offer
to license to the Company or any  of its Subsidiaries, or a request that the
Company or any of its  Subsidiaries consider whether it wishes to obtain a
license, under any  patent owned by a third party. With respect to each
material item of  Intellectual Property that is owned by the Company or a
Subsidiary,  including the Registered Intellectual Property ("Owned
Intellectual  Property"), the Company or a Subsidiary is the owner of the
entire right,  title and interest in and to such Owned Intellectual Property
and is  entitled to use such Owned Intellectual Property in the continued
operation  of its respective business in an unrestricted fashion. With
respect to each  material item of Intellectual Property that is licensed to
or otherwise  held or used by the Company or a Subsidiary ("Licensed
Intellectual  Property"), the Company or a Subsidiary has a legally
enforceable right to  use, under valid and subsisting written license
agreements, the Licensed  Intellectual Property in the continued operation of
its respective  business. The Owned Intellectual Property and the Licensed
Intellectual  Property constitute all material Intellectual Property used in
and  necessary for the operation of the businesses of the Company and
the    17     Subsidiaries as currently conducted. The Registered
Intellectual Property  is subsisting and, to the knowledge of the Company,
valid and enforceable.  None of the Owned Intellectual Property has been
adjudged invalid or  unenforceable in whole or in part. To the knowledge of

Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision of its operations.   ARTICLE
VI  ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS   SECTION 6.01 Proxy Statement. As promptly as
reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall prepare and file with the SEC the preliminary Proxy Statement; provided
that Parent shall have the opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy
Statement (and any amendments thereto) before it is filed. Each of the
Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning itself and its
affiliates that is required to be included in the Proxy Statement or that is
customarily included in proxy statements prepared in connection with
transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the Company
and Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as
practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement,
and the Company shall use its reasonable efforts to cause the definitive
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company\'s stockholders as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement. The Company and
Parent shall promptly notify each other upon the receipt of any comments from
the SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC or its staff for amendments
or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall provide each other with
copies of all correspondence between it and its Representatives, on the
one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other hand relating to the
Proxy Statement. If at any time prior to the Company Stockholders\' Meeting,
any information relating to the Company, Parent or any of their
respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by the
Company or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the
party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other
parties, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.   SECTION
6.02 Company Stockholders\' Meeting. As promptly as practicable after the SEC
indicates that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement, the
Company, acting through the Company Board, and in accordance with
applicable Law, shall duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting
of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholders\' Meeting") for the purpose of
obtaining the Stockholder Approval. Unless this Agreement shall have been
terminated in accordance with Section 8.01, the Company shall hold the
Company Stockholders\' Meeting regardless of whether the Company Board has
effected a Change in Board    30    Recommendation. The Company Board
shall (a) recommend to holders of the Shares that they adopt this Agreement,
(b) include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement and (c) use its
reasonable efforts to solicit and obtain the Stockholder Approval (including,
without limitation, if requested by Parent, engaging a proxy solicitation
firm), except to the extent the Company Board determines in its reasonable
judgment that the making of, or failure to withdraw, qualify or modify such
recommendation would violate the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under
applicable Law.   SECTION 6.03 Access to Information; Confidentiality.  
(a) Except as otherwise prohibited by applicable Law, from the date of  this
Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company shall (and shall cause  the
Subsidiaries to): (i) provide to Parent and to the officers, directors, 
employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, financing sources, 
agents and other representatives (collectively, "Representatives") of  Parent
reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable  prior
notice by Parent and without undue disruption of normal business  activity,
to the officers, employees, agents, properties, offices and other  facilities
of the Company and the Subsidiaries and to the books and records  thereof,
and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to furnish promptly  to Parent
such information concerning the business, properties, Contracts,  assets,
liabilities, personnel and other aspects of the Company and the  Subsidiaries
as Parent or its Representatives may reasonably request.   (b) All
information obtained by Parent or its Representatives pursuant  to this
Section 6.03 shall be kept confidential in accordance with the 
confidentiality agreement, dated November 8, 2006 (the "Confidentiality 
Agreement"), between Carlyle Investment Management, L.L.C. and the
Company.   SECTION 6.04 No Solicitation of Transactions.   (a) The Company
agrees that neither it nor any Subsidiary shall, nor  shall it authorize or
permit the Representatives of the Company or the  Subsidiaries to, directly
or indirectly, (i) solicit or initiate or  knowingly encourage or otherwise
knowingly facilitate (including by way of  furnishing information) any
inquiries or the implementation or submission  of any Acquisition Proposal or
(ii) participate in discussions or  negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
person any non-public information  in connection with, any Acquisition
Proposal; provided, however, that,  prior to obtaining the Shareholder
Approval, nothing contained in this  Agreement shall prevent the Company or
the Company Board from furnishing  information to, or engaging in
negotiations or discussions with, any person  in connection with an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal by  such person, if (i)
prior to taking such action the Company Board  determines in good faith
(after consultation with its advisors) that such  Acquisition Proposal is, or
could reasonably be expected to result in, a  Superior Proposal and (ii) such
person executes a confidentiality agreement  that is not less restrictive of
such Person than the Confidentiality  Agreement. The parties agree that the
press release to be issued pursuant  to Section 6.09 upon the execution of
this Agreement shall not be deemed to  be a solicitation of any Acquisition
Proposal or otherwise in violation of  this Agreement, and that any inquiries
or proposals made as a result of or  in connection with such press release
shall not be deemed to have been  solicited by or on behalf of the
Company.   31     (b) The Company shall notify Parent as promptly as
practicable (and in  any event within 48 hours) of the receipt by the Company
or any of the  Subsidiaries, or any of its or their respective
Representatives, of any  bona fide inquiries, proposals or offers, requests
for information or  requests for discussions or negotiations regarding any
Acquisition  Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of
the status  of any such discussions or negotiations. The Company shall, and
shall cause  the Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to,
immediately cease  discussions or negotiations with any parties that may be
ongoing with  respect to any Acquisition Proposal as of the date hereof,
shall take  reasonable steps to inform its and the Subsidiaries\'
Representatives of the  obligations undertaken in this Section 6.04 and shall
request that all  confidential information previously furnished to any such
third parties be  returned promptly.   (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing,
prior to obtaining the Stockholder  Approval, in response to the receipt of
an unsolicited bona fide written  Acquisition Proposal, if the Company Board
determines in good faith (after  consultation with its advisors) that such
Acquisition Proposal is a  Superior Proposal, then the Company Board may
approve and recommend such  Superior Proposal and, in connection with such
Superior Proposal, withdraw  or modify the Company Board Recommendation (a
"Change in Board  Recommendation"), if the Company Board determines in good
faith (after  consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the
Acquisition Proposal  is a Superior Proposal.   (d) Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall prohibit the Company  from taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by  Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act or from making  any disclosure to the Company\'s
stockholders if the Company Board (or any  committee thereof) determines in
good faith (after consultation with its  outside legal counsel) that it is
required to do so under applicable Law;  provided, however, that neither the
Company nor the Company Board (nor any  committee thereof) shall (i)
recommend that the stockholders of the Company  tender their Shares in
connection with any such tender or exchange offer  (or otherwise approve or
recommend any Acquisition Proposal), (ii) withdraw  or modify the Company
Board Recommendation, (iii) waive any standstill  provisions applicable to
any third party or (iv) enter into any definitive  agreement with any third
party with respect to an Acquisition Proposal,  unless, in case of clauses
(i) or (ii), the requirements of Section 6.04(c)  shall have been
satisfied.   (e) The Company shall not take any action to exempt any person
from  the restrictions on "business combinations" contained in Section 203 of
the  DGCL (or any similar provision) or otherwise cause such restrictions not
to  apply, unless the requirements of Section 6.04(c) shall have been 
satisfied.   (f) For purposes of this Agreement:   (i) "Acquisition
Proposal" means any proposal or offer (including  any proposal from or to the
Company\'s stockholders) from any person or  related group other than Parent
or Merger Sub relating to (1) any  direct or indirect acquisition of more
than 20% of the assets of the  Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or (2)  (A) any direct or indirect acquisition by such
person or related group  of over 20% of any class of equity securities of the
Company or (B)  any tender offer, exchange offer, as defined pursuant to the
Exchange    32     Act, merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization or  other similar transaction involving the Company that if
consummated  would result in such person or related group beneficially owning
20%  or more of any class of equity securities of the Company.   (ii)
"Superior Proposal" means any bona fide unsolicited written  Acquisition
Proposal that (1) relates to at least a majority of the  outstanding Shares
or all or substantially all of the assets of the  Company and the
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (2) is on terms that  the Company Board
determines in its good faith judgment (after  consultation with its financial
advisor and after taking into account  all the terms and conditions of the
Acquisition Proposal) are more  favorable to the Company\'s stockholders (in
their capacities as  stockholders) from a financial point of view than this
Agreement  (including any alterations to this Agreement agreed to in writing
by  Parent in response thereto) and (3) which the Company Board determines 
is reasonably capable of being consummated; provided, however, that  for
purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal", the references  to "20%"
in the definitions of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to  be references
to "50%".   SECTION 6.05 Directors\' and Officers\' Indemnification and
Insurance.   (a) The Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation  shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification  than are set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation of
the Company and  set forth in any indemnification agreement currently in
effect between the  Company and any officer, director, employee or former
officer, former  director, or former employee, which provisions shall not be
amended,  repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the
Effective  Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights
thereunder of  individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were
directors,  officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents of the Company or any
of the  Subsidiaries; and provided, that, in the event that any claim for 
indemnification is asserted or made within such six year period, all rights 
to indemnification in respect of such claim shall continue until the final 
disposition of such claim.   (b) After the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation and Parent  shall, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, indemnify and  hold harmless, each present and former
director and officer of the Company  and each Subsidiary (collectively, the
"Indemnified Parties") against all  costs and expenses (including attorneys\'
fees), judgments, fines, losses,  claims, damages, liabilities and settlement
amounts paid in connection with  any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (whether arising  before or after the Effective Time), whether
civil, criminal,  administrative or investigative, arising out of or
pertaining to any action  or omission in their capacity as an officer,
director, employee, fiduciary  or agent, occurring on or before the Effective
Time, to the same extent as  provided in the Certificate of Incorporation of
the Company or any other  applicable contract or agreement in effect on the
date hereof. In the event  of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, (i) the  Surviving Corporation shall pay the reasonable fees
and expenses of counsel  selected by the Indemnified Parties, which counsel
shall be reasonably  satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation, promptly
after statements  therefor are received (provided the applicable Indemnified
Party provides  an undertaking to repay all advanced expenses if it is
finally judicially  determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification)   33     and (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall
cooperate in the defense of any  such matter; provided, however, that the
Surviving Corporation shall not be  liable for any settlement effected
without the Surviving Corporation\'s  written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or  delayed); and provided, further, that the
Surviving Corporation shall not  be obligated pursuant to this Section
6.05(b) to pay the fees and expenses  of more than one counsel (selected by a
plurality of the applicable  Indemnified Parties) for all Indemnified Parties
in any jurisdiction with  respect to any single action except to the extent
that two or more of such  Indemnified Parties shall have conflicting
interests in such action.   (c) The Surviving Corporation shall either (i)
cause to be obtained at  the Effective Time "tail" insurance policies with a
claims period of at  least six years from the Effective Time with respect to
directors\' and  officers\' liability insurance in amount and scope at least
as favorable as  the Company\'s existing policies for claims arising from
facts or events  that occurred on or prior to the Effective Time from an
insurer with an  insurer financial strength rating by A.M. Best Co. of at
least "A"; or (ii)  maintain in effect for six years from the Effective Time,
if available, the  current directors\' and officers\' liability insurance
policies maintained by  the Company (provided that the Surviving Corporation
may substitute  therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing
terms and  conditions that are not less favorable) with respect to matters
occurring  prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that in no event
shall the  Surviving Corporation be required to expend pursuant to this
Section  6.05(c) more than an amount per year equal to 250% of the current
annual  premiums paid by the Company for such insurance; provided, however,
that in  the event of an expiration, termination or cancellation of such
current  policies, the Surviving Corporation shall be required to obtain as
much  coverage as is possible under substantially similar policies for such 
maximum annual amount in aggregate annual premiums.   (d) This Section 6.05
shall survive the consummation of the Merger and  is intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, present  or former directors and,
officers of the Company or its Subsidiaries, their  respective heirs and
personal representatives and shall be binding on the  Surviving Corporation
and its successors and assigns. In the event that the  Parent or Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective successors or  assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not  the continuing
or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or  merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its  properties and assets
to any person (including by dissolution), then, and  in each such case,
Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that  the successors and
assigns of the Parent or Surviving Corporation assume  and honor the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.05. The agreements  and covenants
contained herein shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any  other rights to
which any such present or former director or officer is  entitled, whether
pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise. Nothing in this  Agreement is
intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or  impair any
rights to directors\' and officers\' insurance claims under any  policy that
is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any  of its
Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors and employees,  it being
understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in  this Section
6.05 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims  under any such
policies.   (e) From and after Closing, Parent shall cause the Surviving 
Corporation to perform all of the obligations of the Surviving Corporation 
under this Section 6.05.   34     SECTION 6.06 Notification of Certain
Matters. The Company shall give prompt written notice to Parent, and Parent
shall give prompt written notice to the Company, of (i) any material written
notice or other written communication (A) from any person (and the written
response thereto of the Company or the Subsidiaries or Parent, as the case
may be, or its or their Representatives) alleging that the consent of such
person is or may be required in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions, (B) from any Governmental Authority (and the written response
thereto of the Company or the Subsidiaries or Parent, as the case may be, or
its or their Representatives) in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions, and (C) except in the event the Company Board shall have
effected a Change of Board Recommendation, from or to the SEC, (ii) the
existence of any event or circumstance that would be likely to cause
any condition to the obligations of any Party to effect the Merger and the
other Transactions not to be satisfied and (iii) the failure of the Company,
Merger Sub or Parent, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
pursuant to this Agreement which would reasonably be expected to result in
any condition to the obligations of any Party to effect the Merger and the
other transactions provided for in this Agreement not to be satisfied  
SECTION 6.07 Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts.   (a) Upon the terms
and subject to the conditions of this Agreement,  each of the parties hereto
agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to (i)  take, or cause to be taken,
all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to  be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or  otherwise to
consummate and make effective the Transactions and (ii) obtain  from
Governmental Authorities and third parties any consents, licenses,  permits,
waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders set forth on Schedule  3.05.
Subject to appropriate confidentiality protections, each of Parent  and the
Company shall have the right to review and comment on advance  drafts of all
applications, notices, petitions, filings and other documents  made or
prepared in connection with the items described in clauses (i) and  (ii)
above, shall cooperate with each other in connection with the making  of all
such filings, shall furnish to the other party such necessary  information
and assistance as such other party may reasonably request with  respect to
the foregoing and shall provide the other party with copies of  all filings
made by such party with any applicable Government Authority,  and, upon
request, any other information supplied by such party to a  Governmental
Authority in connection with this Agreement and the  Transactions.   (b)
Merger Sub, the Company and Parent shall use their respective  reasonable
best efforts to obtain any third party consents required to  prevent a
Material Adverse Effect from occurring prior to the Effective  Time. In the
event that the Company shall fail to obtain any third party  consent
described above, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts,  and
shall take such actions as are reasonably requested by Parent, to  minimize
any adverse effect upon the Company and Parent and their  respective
businesses resulting, or which could reasonably be expected to  result, after
the Effective Time from the failure to obtain such consent.   (c) Without
limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and the  Company undertakes and
agrees to file as soon as practicable, and in any  event prior to fifteen
(15) days after the date hereof, a Notification and  Report Form under the
HSR Act with the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC")  and the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice (the "Antitrust   35    
Division"). Each of Parent and the Company shall (i) respond as promptly as 
practicable to any inquiries received from the FTC or the Antitrust  Division
for additional information or documentation and to all inquiries  and
requests received from any State Attorney General or other governmental 
authority in connection with antitrust matters and (ii) not extend any 
waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with the FTC  or
the Antitrust Division not to consummate the transactions contemplated  by
this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the other  parties
hereto. Parent shall take all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate 
impediments under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation law that 
may be asserted by the FTC, the Antitrust Division, any State Attorney 
General or any other Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger so  as
to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible. Without 
limiting the foregoing, Parent shall propose, negotiate, commit to and 
effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, 
divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses of Parent or, 
effective as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation as may be 
required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, 
any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any Action, 
which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying the 
Closing.   (d) In the event that any action, suit, proceeding or
investigation  relating hereto or to the transactions contemplated hereby is
commenced,  whether before or after the date hereof, the parties hereto agree
to  cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to defend vigorously 
against it and respond thereto.   SECTION 6.08 Obligations of Parent and
Merger Sub. Parent shall take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub to
perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
Transactions on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement. If requested by the Company\'s Board, Parent shall, and shall
cause Merger Sub to, use commercially reasonable efforts to change the
structure of the transaction and the Financing to reflect that
the Transactions shall be consummated by a tender offer followed by a
Merger, including, if the structure is so changed, by executing and
delivering an amendment to the Agreement reflecting such changes as may
become reasonably necessary to implement such restructuring.   SECTION 6.09
Public Announcements. The Company and Parent agree that no public release or
announcement concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
be issued by any party without the prior written consent of the Company and
Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except
as such release or announcement may be required by Law or the rules or
regulations of any applicable United States securities exchange or regulatory
or governmental body to which the relevant party is subject or submits,
wherever situated, in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement shall use its reasonable efforts to allow the other party
or parties hereto reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement
in advance of such issuance (it being understood that the final form and
content of any such release or announcement, as well as the timing of any
such release or announcement, shall be at the final discretion of the
disclosing party).   SECTION 6.10 Employee Benefits. After the Effective
Time, Parent shall make or cause the Surviving Corporation to make all
payments due under any and all applicable bonus or other agreements between
the Company and any of its employees, including, without limitation, all
management stability agreements,    36    long-term incentive bonus
agreements and incentive bonus agreements. From and after the Effective Time,
Parent (a) shall, for a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time,
provide the employees of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries with
compensation and benefits substantially comparable in the aggregate to those
provided by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall
credit each employee of the Company or any Subsidiary at the Effective Time
with the portion of such employee\'s service that is recognized as of the
Effective Time under the Company\'s Plans (including for vacation purposes)
for all purposes under Parent\'s plans or programs, except for benefit
accrual service under any defined benefit pension plan or to the extent that
such crediting would result in duplication of benefits, and (b) shall
waive any exclusion or limitation with respect to pre-existing conditions
under Parent\'s group health plan and shall provide that any out-of-pocket
health expenses incurred by an employee of the Company or any Subsidiary or
his or her covered dependents prior to the Effective Time in the plan year in
which the Closing occurs shall be taken into account under Parent\'s group
health plan for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible coinsurance and
maximum covered health benefit claims for services rendered on and after the
Effective Time.   SECTION 6.11 Takeover Statutes. The parties shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts (i) to take all action necessary so
that no Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if any such
Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to any of the foregoing, to take all
action necessary so that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
Takeover Law on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   SECTION 6.12 Financing.   (a) Notwithstanding any other
provision in this Agreement, it is  expressly understood and agreed that
Parent\'s and Merger Sub\'s obligations  to consummate the Merger on the
terms and conditions specified herein are  not subject to a financing
condition or the results of Parent\'s efforts to  obtain the full amount of
the financing required to effect the Closing and  to satisfy their
obligations under Article II hereof, including paying and  depositing (or

transactions contemplated by  this Agreement and constitute liquidated
damages and not a penalty. The  parties further agree that if one party is or
becomes obligated to pay a  fee pursuant to this Section 8.03, the right to
receive such fee shall be  the sole remedy of the other party with respect to
the facts and  circumstances giving rise to such payment obligation.
Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained in this Section 8.03, in
the event that  the Company shall fail to pay the Break-Up Fee or any
Termination Expenses  when due, the Company shall reimburse Parent and Merger
Sub for all  reasonable costs and expenses actually incurred or accrued by
Parent or  Merger Sub (including legal fees and expenses) in connection with

a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, Schedules  or Exhibits,
such reference shall be to a Section, Schedule or Exhibit of  this Agreement,
respectively, unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the  words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they  shall be deemed
to be followed by the words "without limitation". The words  "hereof,"
"herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in  this
Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not any  particular
provision of this Agreement. The definitions contained in this  Agreement are
applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of  such terms.
References to a person are also to its permitted successors and  assigns.
Whenever the context may require, any pronoun shall include the 
corresponding masculine, feminine and neuter forms.   SECTION 9.04
Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or incapable of
being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other conditions and
provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon
such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the
Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.   SECTION 9.05 Disclaimer of Other Representations and Warranties.
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company each acknowledges and agrees that, except
for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement,
(a) no party makes, and has not made, any representations or warranties
relating to itself or its businesses or otherwise in connection with the
Transactions, (b) no person has been authorized by any party to make any
representation or warranty relating itself or its businesses or otherwise in
connection with the Transactions and, if made, such representation or
warranty must not be relied upon as having been authorized by such party, and
(c) any estimates, projections, predictions, data, financial information,
memoranda, presentations or any other materials or information provided or
addressed to any party or any of its Representatives are not and shall not be
deemed to be or to include   50    representations or warranties except
to the extent any such materials are expressly addressed in such
representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement.   SECTION 9.06
Entire Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior
agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto,
or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. This
Agreement shall not be assigned (whether pursuant to a merger, by
operation of law or otherwise), except that Parent and Merger Sub may assign
all or any of their rights and obligations hereunder (but not under the
Confidentiality Agreement) to any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent, provided, however, that no such assignment shall relieve the
assigning party of its obligations hereunder if such assignee does not
perform such obligations.   SECTION 9.07 Parties in Interest. Nothing in
this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any
other person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Agreement other than (a) as specifically provided in
Section 6.05; (b) after the Effective Time, the rights of holders of shares
of the Company Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration specified in
Section 2.01; and (c) after the Effective Time, the rights of holders of
Company Stock Options to receive the Options Payments specified in Section
2.04.   SECTION 9.08 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that,
prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to specific performance of
the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or equity.  
SECTION 9.09 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware
applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed in that State. All
Actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and
determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The parties hereto
hereby (a) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of
Chancery for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement brought by any party hereto and (b) irrevocably waive, and agree
not to assert by way of motion, defense or otherwise, in any such Action, any
claim that any of them is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the
above-named court, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or
execution, that the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the
venue of the Action is improper or that this Agreement or the Transactions
may not be enforced in or by the above-named court.   SECTION 9.10 Waiver
of Jury Trial. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law any right it may have to a trial by jury with
respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions. Each of the parties
hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other
party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party
would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver
and (b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced
to enter   51   into this Agreement and the Transactions, as applicable,
by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section
9.10.   SECTION 9.11 Headings. The descriptive headings contained in this
Agreement are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect
in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.   SECTION 9.12
Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by
facsimile transmission) in one or more counterparts, and by the different
parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be
deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one
and the same agreement.     52        IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company have caused this Agreement to be executed as of
the date first written above by their respective officers thereunto duly
authorized.   SYNAGRO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.    By: /s/ Robert C. Boucher,
