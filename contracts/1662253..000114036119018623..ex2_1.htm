ARTICLE I

 

_MERGER_

 


 

 

1.1 _Merger_. At the Effective  Time, and subject to and upon the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, and in accordance with the applicable provisions
of the Delaware Act, Purchaser and Merger Sub shall consummate the Merger,
pursuant to which Purchaser shall be merged with  and into Merger Sub with
Purchaser being the surviving entity, following which the separate corporate

Merger, is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Surviving Corporation"
(provided, that references to Purchaser for periods after the Effective Time
shall include the Surviving  Corporation).

 


 

 

1.2 _Effective Time_.   Simultaneously with or immediately following the
Share Exchange, Purchaser and Merger Sub shall cause the Merger to be
consummated by filing a Certificate of Merger for the merger of Purchaser with
and into Merger Sub, with Purchaser being the  surviving entity, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and the Company (the "Certificate
of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in
accordance  with the relevant provisions of the Delaware Act (the time of
such filing, or such later time as may be specified in the Certificate of
Merger, being the "Effective Time").

 


 

 

 

2  

1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At  the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the
applicable provisions of the Delaware Act. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the  Effective Time, all the property,
rights, privileges, agreements, powers and franchises, debts, Liabilities,
duties and obligations of Merger Sub and Purchaser shall become the property,
rights, privileges, agreements, powers and franchises, debts,  Liabilities,
duties and obligations of the Surviving Corporation (including all rights and
obligations with respect to the Trust Account), which shall include the
assumption by the Surviving Corporation of any and all agreements, covenants,
duties  and obligations of Merger Sub and Purchaser set forth in this
Agreement to be performed after the Effective Time, and the Surviving
Corporation shall continue its existence as a wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Pubco.

 


 

 

1.4 _Organizational Documents of  Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective
Time, the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Purchaser, each as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended and restated
to read in their entirety in the form of the  Certificate of Incorporation
and Bylaws of Merger Sub, in each case as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, respectively (except that the name of the corporation shall be
updated therein) and, as so amended and restated, shall be the  Certificate
of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter
amended in accordance with the terms thereof and the Delaware Act.

 


 

 

1.5 _Directors and Officers of the  Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective
Time, the board of directors and executive officers of Purchaser shall resign
and the board of directors and executive officers of the Surviving Corporation
shall be as determined by Pubco, each to  hold office in accordance with the
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

 


 

 

1.6 _Effect of Merger on Issued  Securities of Purchaser, Pubco and Merger
Sub_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of any Party or the holders of securities of Purchaser, the Company,
Pubco or Merger Sub:

 


 

 

(a) Purchaser   Units. Each Purchaser Unit outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be automatically detached and the holder thereof
shall be deemed to hold one share of Purchaser Common Stock and one Purchaser
Warrant in accordance with  the terms of the applicable Purchaser Unit, which
underlying Purchaser Securities shall be converted in accordance with the
applicable terms of this _Section 1.6_ below.

 


 

 

(b) Purchaser   Common Stock. Each share of Purchaser Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than those
described in _Section 1.6(d)_ below) shall automatically be converted into the
right to receive one  Pubco Common Share, following which all such shares of
Purchaser Common Stock shall cease to be outstanding and shall automatically
be canceled and shall cease to exist.

 


 

 

(c) Purchaser   Preferred Stock. Each share of Purchaser Preferred Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
those described in _Section 1.6(d)_ below), if any, shall automatically be
converted into the right  to receive one Pubco Preferred Share, following
which, all such shares of Purchaser Preferred Stock shall cease to be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist.

 


 

 

 

3  

(d) Cancellation   of Capital Stock Owned by Purchaser. Each share of
capital stock of Purchaser owned by Purchaser as treasury shares shall be
canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or payment therefor.

 


 

 

(e) Conversion   of Shares of Merger Sub. Each share of Merger Sub Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, and all
such shares of common  stock of the Surviving Corporation shall thereupon
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

 


 

 

(f) Purchaser   Warrants. Pursuant to the terms of the Purchaser Public
Warrants and Purchaser Private Warrants, each (i) Purchaser Public Warrant
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
the right to receive one Pubco  Public Warrant and (ii) each Purchaser
Private Warrant outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one Pubco Private Warrant, and all Purchaser Warrants shall
thereupon cease to be outstanding and shall automatically  be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist. Pursuant to the terms of the Purchaser
Public Warrants and Purchaser Private Warrants, each of the Pubco Public
Warrants shall have, and be subject to, substantially the same terms and
conditions  set forth in the Purchaser Public Warrants, and each of the Pubco
Private Warrants shall have, and be subject to, substantially the same terms
and conditions set forth in the Purchaser Private Warrants, except that in
each case they shall represent  the right to acquire Pubco Common Shares in
lieu of shares of Purchaser Common Stock. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Pubco shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for future
issuance, and shall maintain such reservation for so  long as any of the
Pubco Warrants remain outstanding, a sufficient number of Pubco Common Shares
for delivery upon the exercise of such Pubco Warrants.

 


 

 

(g) Surrender   of Shares of Pubco. The sole holder of shares of Pubco
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall surrender
all such shares to Pubco, which shares shall thereupon be repurchased by Pubco
for cancellation (for de  minimis consideration).

 


 

 

(h) Cancellation   of Shares of Merger Sub. All of the shares of Merger Sub
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into an equal number of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation, with the  same rights, powers and privileges as the
shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 


 

 

1.7 _Exchange Procedures_.

 


 

 

(a) Appointment   of Transfer Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Pubco
shall appoint a transfer agent and registrar, as its agent, for the purpose of
exchanging Pubco Securities for Purchaser Securities. Pubco agrees to issue
Pubco Securities as and to  the extent required by this Agreement to the
holders of Purchaser Common Stock, Purchaser Preferred Stock (if any) and
Purchaser Warrants. Pubco\'s duly appointed transfer agent shall effect the
exchange of Purchaser Securities for substantially  equivalent Pubco
Securities in accordance with customary transfer agent procedures and the
rules and regulations of the Depository Trust Company.

 


 

 

(b) Transfers   of Ownership. Outstanding Purchaser Securities converted
into the right to receive the consideration provided in _Section 1.6_ will be
deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to evidence only the right to
secure the consideration  to which the holder thereof is entitled hereunder.
Holders of certificates previously evidencing shares of Purchaser Preferred
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and considered into
the right to receive the consideration  provided in _Section 1.6_ shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such shares, except as provided herein or
by Law. Each certificate previously evidencing shares of Purchaser Common
Stock or Purchaser Preferred Stock shall be  exchanged for a certificate
representing the same number of Pubco Common Shares or Pubco Preferred Shares,
respectively, upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with this
_Section 1.7(b)_. Each certificate formerly representing  shares of Purchaser
Common Stock or Purchaser Preferred Stock (other those described in _Section
1.6(d)_ above) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the same
number of Pubco Common Shares or Pubco Preferred Shares,  respectively. If
any certificate representing securities of Purchaser is to be issued in a name
other than that in which the certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered, it will be a condition of the issuance thereof that the 
certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an
appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer
and that the person requesting such exchange will have paid to Purchaser or
any agent  designated by it any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of
the issuance of a certificate for securities of Purchaser in any name other
than that of the registered holder of the certificate surrendered, or
established to the satisfaction of  Pubco or any agent designated by it that
such tax has been paid or is not payable.

 


 

 

 

4  

(c) No   Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Section 1.6_ , none of the Surviving Corporation, Pubco, the Sellers or any
other Party hereto shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly paid
to a public  official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar law.

 


 

 

(d) Surrender   of Purchaser Certificates. All securities issued upon the
surrender of Purchaser Securities in accordance with the terms hereof shall be
deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such securities, provided  that any restrictions on the sale and transfer of
Purchaser Securities shall also apply to the Pubco Securities so issued in
exchange.

 


 

 

(e) Lost,   Stolen or Destroyed Purchaser Certificates. In the event any
certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Pubco shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates or securities, as the
case may be, upon the  making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, such securities, as may be required pursuant to _Section 1.6_ ;
_provided_ , however, that Pubco may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the issuance thereof,  require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificates to agree to indemnify Pubco and the Surviving
Corporation, or deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against the  Surviving
Corporation or Pubco with respect to the certificates alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed.

 


 

 

1.8 _Tax Consequences_. The  Parties hereby agree and acknowledge that, for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Merger and the Share Exchange, taken
together, are intended to qualify as exchanges described in Section 351 of the
Code. The Parties hereby agree to file all Tax  and other informational
returns on a basis consistent with such characterization. Each of the Parties
acknowledges and agrees that each (i) has had the opportunity to obtain
independent legal and tax advice with respect to the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) is responsible for paying its own
Taxes, including any Taxes that may arise if the Merger and the Share
Exchange, taken together, do not qualify as exchanges described in Section 351
of the Code.

 


 

 

1.9 _Taking of Necessary Action;  Further Action_. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets,  property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of Purchaser and Merger Sub, the officers and directors
of Purchaser and Merger Sub are fully authorized in the name of their
respective entities to take, and will take, all such lawful and  necessary
action, so long as such action is not inconsistent with this Agreement.

ARTICLE II

 

_SHARE EXCHANGE_

 


 

 

2.1 _Exchange of Company Shares_.   At the Closing, subject to and upon the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Exchange Agreements,
simultaneously or immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger, the
Sellers shall sell, transfer, convey, assign and deliver to  Pubco, and Pubco
shall purchase, acquire and accept from the Sellers, all of the Company Shares
held by the Sellers (collectively, the "Purchased Shares"), free and clear of
all Liens  (other than potential restrictions on resale under applicable
securities Laws). At or prior to the Closing, the Company will terminate any
issued and outstanding Company Convertible Securities (if any), without any
consideration, payment or  Liability therefor.

 


 

 

2.2 _Transaction Consideration_.

 


 

 

(a) At the Closing, subject to and upon  the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Exchange Agreements, in full payment for the Purchased
Shares, Pubco shall deliver to the Sellers a mix of cash and Pubco Common
Shares with a value equal to (subject to adjustment in accordance  with
_Section 2.5_ , the "Transaction Consideration") (i) the sum of (A) the Book
Value (as such amount is determined in accordance with _Section 2.4_ and (B)
the aggregate  amount of out-of-pocket expenses (including all fees and
expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers, financial advisors,
financing sources, experts and consultants to the Company or any of its
Affiliates) incurred by the Company in  connection with or related to the
authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement or any Ancillary Document related hereto and all other matters
related to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by  this
Agreement and which reduced the Book Value from what it would have been if
such expenses had not been incurred (the "Company Transaction Expenses"),
multiplied by (ii) one and  twenty-two hundredths (1.22), multiplied by (iii)
the Shareholder Participation Ratio. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Transaction Consideration shall be subject to adjustment pursuant to _Section
2.5_.

 


 

 

(b) The Transaction Consideration shall  be paid to the Sellers for the
Purchased Shares as follows:

 


 

 

(i) cash in aggregate amount equal to  Eighty Million U.S. Dollars
($80,000,000) (the "Cash Consideration") paid for a portion of the Purchased
Shares based on a value equal to two (2) times Book Value Per Share (the "Cash
Consideration Per Share"). The Purchased Shares paid with the Cash
Consideration shall equal the Cash Consideration allocated among the Sellers
in accordance with _Annex I_ divided  by the Cash Consideration Per Share
(the "Cash Consideration Purchased Shares"); and

 


 

 

(ii) Pubco Common Shares which in the  aggregate have a value equal to the
Transaction Consideration less the Cash Consideration (the "Equity
Consideration"). The aggregate number of Pubco Common Shares issued (the
"Exchange Shares") shall equal the Equity Consideration divided by the
Redemption Price, subject to the withholding of the Escrow Shares in
accordance with _Section 2.3_. The Exchange  Shares shall be allocated among
the Sellers pro rata, with each Seller receiving a portion of the total
Exchange Shares equal to (A) the number of Purchased Shares held by such
Seller less any Cash Consideration Purchased Shares of such Seller,  divided
by (B) the total number of Purchased Shares of all Sellers less the total
number of Cash Consideration Purchased Shares. The allocation of the Cash
Consideration among the Sellers and the number of Exchange Shares issued and
delivered to  the Sellers at the Closing shall be determined in accordance
with _Section 2.4_ , and subject to adjustment after the Closing under
_Section 2.5_.

 


 

 

 

6  

2.3 _Escrow_. At or prior to the  Closing, Pubco, the Purchaser
Representative, the Seller Representative and the Escrow Agent shall enter
into an Escrow Agreement, effective as of the Closing, in form and substance
consistent with the provisions of this Agreement and otherwise  reasonably
acceptable to the parties (the "Escrow Agreement"), pursuant to which Pubco
shall cause to be delivered to the Escrow Agent at the Closing a number of
Exchange Shares (each  valued at the Redemption Price) equal to two and one-
half percent (2.5%) of the Transaction Consideration otherwise deliverable to
the Sellers at the Closing based on the Estimated Closing Statement (including
any equity securities paid as  dividends or distributions with respect to
such shares or into which such shares are exchanged or converted, the "Escrow
Shares"), with the Escrow Shares, along with any dividends,  distributions
and other earnings thereon and other Escrow Property, to be held by the Escrow
Agent in a segregated escrow account ("Escrow Account") and disbursed
therefrom in accordance  with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Shares and other Escrow Property shall serve
as security for the Sellers' obligations after the Closing for the adjustments
under _Section 2.5_. The  portion of the Exchange Shares that shall be
withheld at the Closing for deposit in the Escrow Account shall be allocated
among the Sellers pro rata based on the number of Exchange Shares received by
each Seller as a percentage of the number of  Exchange Shares received by all
Sellers (such percentage being each such Seller's "Escrow Allocation"). Each
Seller shall be deemed to be the owner of its Escrow Allocation of the
Escrow  Shares (and to be entitled to the related dividends, distributions
and other earnings thereon in respect of its Escrow Allocation of such Escrow
Shares upon release from escrow to the Sellers, subject to _Section 2.5(c)_ )
during the time such  Escrow Shares are held in the Escrow Account, subject
to the retention of any dividends, distributions and other earnings thereon in
the Escrow Account until disbursed therefrom in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the  Escrow Agreement. Each Seller shall
have the right to vote its Escrow Allocation of such Escrow Shares during the
time held in the Escrow Account as Escrow Shares.

 


 

 

2.4 _Closing Calculations_. Not later than three (3) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Purchaser a statement (the
"Estimated Closing Statement"),   prepared in good faith, attaching the
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
Reference Time (which may be based on draft financial statements and/or good
faith estimates if the final financial statements for the  month ended as of
the Reference Time have not yet been prepared at such time), and setting forth
the Book Value and Company Transaction Expenses, along with reasonably
detailed calculations thereof, and the resulting Transaction Consideration 
payable to the Sellers using the formula in _Section 2.2_ based on such Book
Value and the allocation of the Cash Consideration and the Exchange Shares
among the Sellers in accordance with _Section 2.2_ and _Annex I_ based on 
Sellers who have provided executed and accepted Exchange Agreements as of such
date, which Estimated Closing Statement shall be subject to the review and the
reasonable approval by Purchaser; provided that Purchaser shall inform the
Company of its  good faith estimate of the Redemption Price in writing,
together with applicable calculations, no later than five (5) days prior to
the Closing, and Purchaser will promptly provide the Company with an update of
such amount upon the final  determination thereof by the Trustee prior to the
Closing. Promptly upon receipt of a written request from Purchaser (which for
the avoidance of doubt may be provided via email in accordance with _Section
12.1_ ) following the delivery by the  Company of the Estimated Closing
Statement to Purchaser, the Company will meet with Purchaser to review and
discuss the Estimated Closing Statement and the Company will consider in good
faith Purchaser's reasonable good faith comments to the  Estimated Closing
Statement and make any appropriate adjustments to the Estimated Closing
Statement prior to the Closing, which adjusted Estimated Closing Statement, as
mutually approved by the Company and Purchaser, shall thereafter become the 
final Estimated Closing Statement for all purposes of this Agreement
(provided, that (i) the Company shall not be obligated to accept Purchaser's
comments if (A) rejected by the Company reasonably and in good faith and (B)
the increase in the  aggregate number of Exchange Shares to be issued at the
Closing as determined based on the good faith comments of Purchaser that are
not accepted by the Company would not be in excess of the total number of
Escrow Shares as determined based on the  good faith comments of Purchaser
that are not accepted by the Company, and (ii) the Company and Purchaser shall
make any appropriate adjustments to the Estimated Closing Statement through
the Closing based on any additional executed and accepted  Exchange
Agreements provided by Sellers after their mutual approval of the Estimated
Closing Statement). The Estimated Closing Statement and the determinations
contained therein shall be prepared in accordance with the Accounting
Principles and  otherwise in accordance with this Agreement.

 


 

 

 

7  

2.5 _Final Post-Closing Adjustments  and Calculations_.

 


 

 

(a) No later than ninety (90) days  after the Closing Date, Pubco's Chief
Financial Officer (the "CFO") shall deliver to the Purchaser Representative
and the Seller Representative (each, a "Representative Party") a statement
(the "Closing Statement") attaching the consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Reference  Time based on the final
financial statements for the month ended as of the Reference Time, and setting
forth the Book Value and the Company Transaction Expenses, along with
reasonably detailed calculations thereof, and the resulting Transaction 
Consideration payable to the Sellers using the formula in _Section 2.2_ based
on such Book Value and the allocation of the Cash Consideration and the
Exchange Shares (which Exchange Shares, for the avoidance of doubt, will each
be valued for  such purposes at the Redemption Price) among the Sellers in
accordance with _Section 2.2_ and _Annex I_. The Closing Statement shall be
prepared, and the Book Value and Company Transaction Expenses and the
resulting Transaction  Consideration shall be determined in accordance with
the Accounting Principles and otherwise in accordance with this Agreement.
After delivery of the Closing Statement, each Representative Party, and its
Representatives on its behalf, shall be  permitted reasonable access at
reasonable times to review the Target Companies' books, records and any
internal working papers to the extent such books, records and working papers
are directly related to the preparation of the Closing Statement.   The
Representative Parties, and their respective Representatives on their
behalves, may make inquiries of the CFO and related Pubco and Company
personnel and advisors regarding questions concerning or disagreements with
the Closing Statement  arising in the course of their review thereof, and
Pubco and the Company shall provide reasonable cooperation in connection
therewith. If either Representative Party has any objections to the Closing
Statement, such Representative Party shall  deliver to the Company (to the
attention of the CFO) and the other Representative Party a statement setting
forth its objections thereto (in reasonable detail) (an "Objection
Statement").   If an Objection Statement is not delivered by a Representative
Party within thirty (30) days following the date of delivery of the Closing
Statement, then such Representative Party will have waived its right to
contest the Closing Statement, and  all determinations and calculations set
forth therein, and the resulting Transaction Consideration set forth therein.
If an Objection Statement is delivered within such thirty (30) day period,
then the Seller Representative and the Purchaser  Representative shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve any such objections for a period of twenty
(20) days thereafter. If the Seller Representative and the Purchaser
Representative do not reach a final resolution within such twenty (20) day 
period, then upon the written request of either Representative Party (the date
of receipt of such notice by the other Representative Party, the "Independent
Expert Notice Date"), the  Representative Parties will refer the dispute to
the Independent Expert for final resolution of the dispute in accordance with
_Section 2.5(b)_. The Parties acknowledge that any information provided
pursuant to this _Section 2.5_ will  be subject to the confidentiality
obligations of _Section 7.12_.

 


 

 

(b) If a dispute with respect to the  Closing Statement is submitted in
accordance with this _Section 2.5_ to the Independent Expert for final
resolution, the Parties will follow the procedures set forth in this _Section
2.5(b)_. Each of the Seller Representative and the  Purchaser Representative
agrees to execute, if requested by the Independent Expert, a reasonable
engagement letter with respect to the determination to be made by the
Independent Expert. All out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by a 
Representative Party in connection with resolving any dispute hereunder before
the Independent Expert, including the fees and expenses of the Independent
Expert, will be borne by Pubco. The Independent Expert will determine only
those issues still  in dispute as of the Independent Expert Notice Date and
the Independent Expert's determination will be based solely upon and
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The determination
by the Independent Expert will be based  solely on presentations with respect
to such disputed items by the Purchaser Representative and the Seller
Representative to the Independent Expert and not on the Independent Expert's
independent review; provided, that such presentations will be  deemed to
include any work papers, records, accounts or similar materials delivered to
the Independent Expert by a Representative Party in connection with such
presentations and any materials delivered to the Independent Expert in
response to  requests by the Independent Expert. Each Representative Party
will use their reasonable efforts to make their respective presentations as
promptly as practicable following submission to the Independent Expert of the
disputed items, and each such  Representative Party will be entitled, as part
of its presentation, to respond to the presentation of the other
Representative Party and any questions and requests of the Independent Expert.
In deciding any matter, the Independent Expert will be  bound by the
provisions of this Agreement, including this _Section 2.5_. It is the intent
of the Parties that the activities of the Independent Expert in connection
herewith are not (and should not be considered to be or treated as) an 
arbitration proceeding or similar arbitral process and that no formal
arbitration rules should be followed (including rules with respect to
procedures and discovery). The Seller Representative and the Purchaser
Representative will request that the  Independent Expert's determination (the
"Expert Determination") be made within forty-five (45) days after its
engagement, or as soon thereafter as  possible, will be set forth in a
written statement delivered to the Purchaser Representative and the Seller
Representative and will be final, conclusive, non-appealable and binding for
all purposes hereunder (other than for fraud or manifest  error). Any dispute
arising from or in connection with (i) the failure of the Parties to comply
with the requirements of this _Section 2.5(b)_ with respect to the engagement
and process for the Expert Determination or (ii) fraud or manifest  error
with respect to the Expert Determination, shall be resolved in arbitration
pursuant to _Section 12.4._

 


 

 

 

8  

(c) For purposes hereof, the term "Adjustment Amount" shall mean (x) the
number of Exchange Shares that should have been issued to the Sellers at the
Closing (including Escrow Shares) as finally determined in accordance with 
this _Section 2.5_ , less (y) the number of Exchange Shares that were issued
to the Sellers at the Closing (including Escrow Shares).

 


 

 

(i) If the Adjustment Amount is a  negative amount, then the Seller
Representative and the Purchaser Representative shall, within three (3)
Business Days after such final determination, provide joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent to distribute to (A) Pubco a number of 
Escrow Shares (and other Escrow Property earned with respect to such Escrow
Shares, with each Escrow Share valued at the Redemption Price) with a value
equal to the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount, and (B) the Sellers the
remaining Escrow  Property, if any, with each Seller receiving its Escrow
Allocation of such remaining Escrow Property (including any remaining Escrow
Shares and all dividends, distributions and other earnings thereon). Pubco
will, subject to applicable Law, acquire  for cancellation any Escrow Shares
distributed to it by the Escrow Agent promptly after its receipt thereof. The
Escrow Account shall be the sole source of recovery for any payments by the
Sellers under this _Section 2.5(c)_ , and the Sellers  shall not be required
under this _Section 2.5(c)_ to pay any amounts (including by delivery of Pubco
Common Shares) in excess of the Escrow Property in the Escrow Account at such
time.

 


 

 

(ii) If the Adjustment Amount is a  positive number or zero, then (A) the
Seller Representative and the Purchaser Representative shall, within three (3)
Business Days after such final determination, provide joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent to distribute to the Sellers  all of the
Escrow Property, with each Seller receiving its Escrow Allocation of such
Escrow Property (including any remaining Escrow Shares and all dividends,
distributions and other earnings thereon), and, only if the Adjustment Amount
is greater  than zero, (B) Pubco shall, within five (5) Business Days after
such final determination of the Adjustment Amount, issue to the Sellers an
additional number of Pubco Common Shares equal to the Adjustment Amount (as
equitably adjusted for share  splits, share dividends, combinations,
recapitalizations and the like after the Closing other than, for the avoidance
of doubt, ordinary cash dividends and distributions)(which shall be considered
additional Exchange Shares under this Agreement,  "Registrable Securities"
under the Registration Rights Agreement and, with respect to Sellers who are
subject to Lock-Up Agreements, "Restricted Securities" under the Lock-Up
Agreements), with each Seller receiving its allocation of the additional 
number of Exchange Shares as determined in accordance with the application of
the formula in _Section 2.2_.

 


 

 

 

9  

2.6 _Surrender of Company Securities  and Disbursement of Transaction
Consideration_.

 


 

 

(a) At the Closing, Purchaser and Pubco  shall cause the Cash Consideration
to be paid and the Exchange Shares to be issued to the Sellers in exchange for
their Company Securities in accordance with _Section 2.2_ and the Estimated
Closing Statement.

 


 

 

(b) The Parties acknowledge that,  simultaneously with the execution of each
Exchange Agreement, and in accordance with the terms and conditions contained
therein, the Seller party thereto will be required to have delivered to the
Company (or, upon execution of a joinder thereto,  Pubco) its Company Shares
(including any certificates representing such Company Shares (the "Company
Certificates")), along with applicable share power or transfer forms
reasonably  acceptable to the Company and Purchaser (or, upon execution of a
joinder thereto, Pubco), or an affidavit of lost certificate together with
applicable indemnity as provided for in the Exchange Agreements. In accordance
with each Exchange Agreement,  following execution of a joinder thereto by
Pubco, the Company shall transfer all Company Shares, Company Certificates (or
affidavits of lost certificate, if applicable) and applicable share power or
transfer forms received from the applicable  Sellers to Pubco to hold in
escrow pending the Closing.

 


 

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the  contrary contained herein, no fraction
of a Pubco Common Share will be issued by Pubco by virtue of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, and each Person who would otherwise be
entitled to a fraction of a Pubco Common Share (after  aggregating all
fractional Pubco Common Shares that would otherwise be received by such
Person) shall instead have the number of Pubco Common Shares issued to such
Person rounded down in the aggregate to the nearest whole Pubco Common Share.

 


 

 

2.7 _Termination of Certain  Agreements_. The Company hereby agrees that,
effective at the Closing, (a) any shareholders, voting or similar agreement
among the Company and any of the Sellers with respect to the Company's capital
shares, and (b) any registration rights  agreement between the Company and
its shareholders, in each case of clauses (a) and (b), shall automatically,
and without any further action by any of the Parties, terminate in full and
become null and void and of no further force and effect.   Further, the
Company hereby waives any obligations of the Parties under the Company's
Organizational Documents or any agreement described in clause (a) above with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary 
Documents, and any failure of the Parties to comply with the terms thereof in
connection with the Transactions.

ARTICLE IV

 

_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PURCHASER_

 


 

 

Except as set forth in (i) the disclosure schedules delivered by Purchaser to
the Company, Pubco and the Seller Representative on the date hereof (the
"Purchaser Disclosure Schedules"), the Section numbers of which are numbered
to correspond to the Section numbers of this Agreement to which they refer, or
(ii) the SEC Reports that are available on the SEC's  website through EDGAR,
Purchaser represents and warrants to the Company and Pubco, as of the date
hereof and as of the Closing, as follows:

 


 

 

4.1 _Organization and Standing_.   Purchaser is a corporation duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
State of Delaware. Purchaser has all requisite corporate power and authority
to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its  business as now
being conducted. Purchaser is duly qualified or licensed and in good standing
to do business in each jurisdiction in which the character of the property
owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by
it  makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure
to be so qualified or licensed or in good standing can be cured without
material cost or expense. Purchaser has heretofore made available to the
Company accurate and  complete copies of its Organizational Documents, each
as currently in effect. Purchaser is not in violation of any provision of its
Organizational Documents in any material respect.

 


 

 

4.2 _Authorization; Binding Agreement_.    Purchaser has all requisite
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and each
Ancillary Document to which it is a party, to perform its obligations
hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated

6.21 _Insurance Company Matters_.

 


 

 

(a) Each Target Company that is engaged  in the business of insurance and
subject to regulation by a Governmental Authority in connection therewith is
set forth on _Schedule 6.21(a)_ (each, a "Target Insurer").

 


 

 

(b) Each Target Insurer holds all  material Permits which are necessary for
the conduct or operation of its business as an insurance company ("Insurance
Authorizations"). Each Target Insurer is in compliance in all  material
respects with the terms of such Insurance Authorizations and all applicable
insurance Laws and other Laws relating to the conduct or operation of an
insurance company ("Insurance Laws").    To the Knowledge of the Company, no
event has occurred since January 1, 2016 that reasonably would be expected to
constitute a material default or material violation of any Insurance
Authorizations. All of the material Insurance Authorizations are  in full
force and effect, and there are no Actions pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened that assert any material violation of any Insurance
Authorizations or Insurance Laws or seek revocation, cancellation, suspension,
limitation  or adverse modification of any Insurance Authorizations and no
written or, to the Knowledge of the Company, oral notice has been received by
any Target Company that a Target Insurer is not in material compliance with,
or has materially violated,  any Insurance Authorizations or Insurance Laws
or imposing any condition, limitation, modification, cancellation or
termination of any Insurance Authorizations. Each Target Insurer transacts the
businesses of insurance and reinsurance only in those  jurisdictions where it
is authorized by the Laws of the relevant jurisdiction or where such
authorization is not required.

 


 

 

 

35  

(c) Each Target Insurer has adopted and  implemented, in accordance with
local law and practice, policies, procedures, trainings and programs
reasonably designed to ensure that their respective directors, officers or
employees are in material compliance with all applicable Insurance Laws.

 


 

 

(d) Each Target Insurer has filed all  material reports, statements,
registrations, filings or submissions required to be filed with any
Governmental Authority since January 1, 2018 and no material deficiencies have
been asserted in writing by any Governmental Authority since January 1,  2018
with respect to any such reports, statements, registrations, filings and
submissions that have not been cured or otherwise resolved or are no longer
being pursued by such Governmental Authority. No Target Insurer is subject to
a pending or,  to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened financial or
market conduct examination or investigation by any Governmental Authority.
Since January 1, 2018, no material fine or penalty has been imposed on any
Target Insurer by any Governmental  Authority.

 


 

 

(e) Each Target Insurer has filed all  annual and quarterly statements,
together with all exhibits, interrogatories, notes, schedules and any
actuarial opinions, affirmations or certifications or other supporting
documents in connection therewith, required to be filed with or submitted  to
the appropriate Governmental Authority of the jurisdiction in which it is
domiciled and which is required by any Governmental Authority on forms
prescribed and permitted by such authority (the foregoing, collectively,
"Target Insurer Financials"). The Company has provided to Purchaser true and
complete copies of (i) all such Target Insurer Financials as filed with a
Governmental Authority for each Target Insurer for the periods  beginning
January 1, 2018, each in the form (including exhibits, annexes and any
amendments thereto) filed with the applicable Governmental Authority, and (ii)
all examination reports of any Governmental Authority received by a Target
Insurer on or  after January 1, 2018 in connection with any Target Insurer
Financials. Each of the Target Insurer Financials, including the notes
thereto, was prepared in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or
permitted by the applicable Governmental  Authority, in each case,
consistently applied for the periods covered thereby and present fairly
financial position of the relevant Target Insurer as at the respective dates
thereof in the operation of such Target Insurer for the respective periods 
then ended. All such Target Insurer Financials complied in all material
respects with all applicable Laws when filed, and no material deficiency has
been asserted in writing by any Governmental Authority with respect to any
Target Insurer  Financials.

 


 

 

(f) All policies, binders, slips,  certificates and other agreements of
insurance, whether individual or group, in effect as of the date hereof
(including all applications, supplements, endorsements, riders and ancillary
documents in connection therewith) that are issued by a Target  Insurer and
any and all marketing materials are, to the extent required under applicable
Insurance Laws, on forms and rates approved by the Governmental Authority of
the jurisdiction where issued or, to the extent required by applicable
Insurance  Laws, have been filed with and not objected to by such
Governmental Authority within the period provided for objection.

 


 

 

6.22 _Business Insurance_.

 


 

 

(a) _Schedule 6.22(a)_ lists all  material insurance policies (by policy
number, insurer, coverage period, coverage amount, annual premium and type of
policy) in favor of a Target Company relating to a Target Company or its
business, properties, assets, directors, officers and  employees, copies of
which have been provided to Purchaser. All premiums due and payable under all
such insurance policies have been timely paid and the Target Companies are
otherwise in material compliance with the terms of such insurance  policies.
To the Company's Knowledge, each such insurance policy (i) is legal, valid,
binding, enforceable and in full force and effect and (ii) will continue to be
legal, valid, binding, enforceable, and in full force and effect on identical
terms  following the Closing. To the Knowledge of the Company, there is no
threatened termination of, or material premium increase with respect to, any
of such insurance policies. No Target Company has any self-insurance or co-
insurance programs.

 


 

 

 

36  

(b) _Schedule 6.22(b)_ identifies  each individual insurance claim in excess
of $500,000 made by a Target Company (as beneficiary) since January 1, 2018.
Each Target Company has reported to its insurers all claims and pending
circumstances that would reasonably be expected to  result in a claim, except
where such failure to report such a claim would not be reasonably likely to be
material to the Target Companies. To the Knowledge of the Company, except as
set forth on _Schedule 6.22(b)_ , no event has occurred, and  no condition or
circumstance exists, that would reasonably be expected to (with or without
notice or lapse of time) give rise to or serve as a basis for the denial of
any such insurance claim. No Target Company has made any claim against an 
insurance policy as to which the insurer is denying coverage.

 


 

 

6.23 _Top Customers and Vendors_.   _Schedule 6.23_ lists, by dollar volume
received or paid, as applicable, for each of (a) the twelve (12) months ended
on December 31, 2018 and (b) the period from January 1, 2019 through the
Interim Balance Sheet Date, the ten (10) largest  customers of the Target
Companies, including insurance brokers (the "Top Customers") and the ten
largest vendors of goods or services to the Target Companies, including
reinsurers (the "Top Vendors"), along with the amounts of such dollar volumes.
No Top Vendor or Top Customer within the last twelve (12) months has cancelled
or otherwise terminated, or has notified the  Company in writing that it
intends to cancel or otherwise terminate, any material relationships of such
Person with a Target Company, (ii) no Top Vendor or Top Customer has during
the last twelve (12) months decreased materially or, to the  Company's
Knowledge, threatened to stop or materially decrease, limit, or modify its
material relationships with a Target Company other than in the ordinary course
of business, and (iii) no Target Company has within the past two (2) years
been  engaged in any material dispute with any Top Vendor or Top Customer.

 


 

 

6.24 _Certain Business Practices_.

 


 

 

(a) In the last five (5) years, no  Target Company, nor any of their
respective Representatives acting on their behalf, has in material violation
of applicable Law (i) used any funds for unlawful contributions, gifts,
entertainment or other unlawful expenses relating to political  activity,
(ii) made any unlawful payment to foreign or domestic government officials or
employees, to foreign or domestic political parties or campaigns or violated

Law or (iii) directly or indirectly, given or agreed to give any unlawful gift
or similar benefit in any material amount to any customer, supplier,
governmental employee or other  Person who is or may be in a position to help
or hinder any Target Company or assist any Target Company in connection with
any actual or proposed transaction.

 


 

 

(b) The operations of each Target  Company are and have been conducted at all
times in material compliance with money laundering statutes in all applicable
jurisdictions, the rules and regulations thereunder and any related or similar
rules, regulations or guidelines, issued,  administered or enforced by any
Governmental Authority, and no Action involving a Target Company with respect
to any of the foregoing is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened.

 


 

 

(c) No Target Company or any of their  respective directors or officers, or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, any other Representative acting on behalf of
a Target Company is currently identified on the specially designated nationals
or other blocked person list or otherwise currently  the subject of any U.S.
sanctions administered by OFAC, and no Target Company has in the last five (5)
fiscal years, directly or indirectly, used any funds, or loaned, contributed

partner or other Person, in connection with any sales or operations in any

and Syria)  or for the purpose of financing the activities of any Person the
subject of, or otherwise in violation of, any U.S. sanctions administered by
OFAC, in each case in violation of applicable sanctions.

6.26 _Finders and Brokers_.   Except as set forth in _Schedule 6.26_ , no

its Representatives of (i) any bona fide inquiries, proposals or offers,
requests for information or requests for discussions or  negotiations

party making such inquiry, proposal, offer or request for information. Each
Party shall keep the others promptly informed of the status of any such
inquiries, proposals, offers or requests  for information. During the Interim
Period, each Party shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, immediately

company. The Company, Pubco and Merger Sub each hereby agree that, while it is
in possession of such material nonpublic  information, it shall not purchase
or sell any securities of Purchaser, communicate such information to any third
party, take any other action with respect to Purchaser in violation of such
Laws, or cause or encourage any third party to do any of  the foregoing.

have been satisfied or in determining whether or not any of the
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement have been
breached.

 


 

 

7.8 _Efforts_.

 


 

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions  of this Agreement, each Party shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts, and shall cooperate fully with the

hearing or meeting be held in connection with its approval of the transactions
contemplated hereby prior to the Closing, each of  Purchaser and the Company
shall, if requested by such Governmental Authority or by the other Party,
arrange for its Representatives to be present for such hearing or meeting. If

shall use their  commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any such
objections or Actions so as to timely permit consummation of the transactions

the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. In the
event any Action is instituted (or threatened to be  instituted) by a
Governmental Authority or private Person challenging the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or any Ancillary Document, the Parties shall,
and shall cause their respective Representatives to, reasonably cooperate with
each  other and use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
contest and resist any such Action and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any Order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in
effect and that prohibits,  prevents or restricts consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents.

 


 

 

(c) Prior to the Closing, each Party  shall use its commercially reasonable

(a) As promptly as practicable after  the date hereof, Purchaser and Pubco
shall prepare with the reasonable assistance of the Company, and file with the
SEC, a registration statement on Form F-4 (as amended or supplemented from
time to time, and including the Proxy Statement contained  therein, the
"Registration Statement") in connection with the registration under the
Securities Act of the Pubco Securities to be issued under this Agreement to
the holders of Purchaser  Securities prior to the Effective Time, which
Registration Statement will also contain a proxy statement of Purchaser (as
amended, the "Proxy Statement") for the purpose of soliciting  proxies from
Purchaser stockholders for the matters to be acted upon at the Special Meeting
and providing the Public Stockholders an opportunity in accordance with
Purchaser's Organizational Documents and the IPO Prospectus to have their
Purchaser  Common Stock redeemed (the "Redemption") in conjunction with the
stockholder vote on the Stockholder Approval Matters. The Proxy Statement
shall include proxy materials for the purpose of  soliciting proxies from
Purchaser stockholders to vote, at a special meeting of Purchaser stockholders
to be called and held for such purpose (the "Special Meeting"), in favor of 
resolutions approving (A) the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the
Transactions (including to the extent required, the issuance of any shares in
connection with the PIPE Investment), by the holders of Purchaser Common Stock
in accordance  with Purchaser's Organizational Documents, the Delaware Act
and the rules and regulations of the SEC and Nasdaq, and (B) such other
matters as the Company, Pubco and Purchaser shall hereafter mutually determine
to be necessary or appropriate in  order to effect the Transactions (the
approvals described in foregoing clauses (A) and (B), collectively, the

Meeting, if necessary or desirable in the reasonable determination of
Purchaser.

regulations of the SEC and Nasdaq. Purchaser and Pubco shall cooperate and
provide the Company (and its counsel) with a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment  on the Registration Statement and any amendment or supplement
thereto prior to filing the same with the SEC and shall give due consideration
to comments provided by the Company (and its counsel). Neither the
Registration Statement nor the Proxy  Statement, nor any amendment or
supplement to the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement, shall be
filed without the approval (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned) of both Purchaser and the Company. The Company shall  provide
Purchaser with such information concerning the Target Companies and their
equity holders, officers, directors, employees, assets, Liabilities, condition
(financial or otherwise), business and operations that may be required or
appropriate  for inclusion in the Registration Statement, or in any
amendments or supplements thereto, which information provided by the Company
shall be true and correct and not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact  necessary in order to make the
statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
materially misleading.

 


 

 

(c) Purchaser and Pubco shall take any  and all reasonable and necessary
actions required to satisfy the requirements of the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act and other applicable Laws in connection with the Registration
Statement, the Special Meeting and the Redemption. Each of  Purchaser, Pubco
and the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, make their
respective officers and employees, upon reasonable advance notice, available
to the Company, Pubco, Purchaser and their respective Representatives in 
connection with the drafting of the public filings with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Registration
Statement, and responding in a timely manner to comments from the SEC. Each
Party shall promptly correct  any information provided by it for use in the
Registration Statement (and other related materials) if and to the extent that
such information is determined to have become false or misleading in any
material respect or as otherwise required by  applicable Laws. Purchaser and
Pubco shall amend or supplement the Registration Statement and cause the
Registration Statement, as so amended or supplemented, to be filed with the
SEC and to be disseminated to Purchaser's stockholders, in each  case as and
to the extent required by applicable Laws and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and Purchaser's Organizational Documents.

 


 

 

 

48  

(d) Purchaser and Pubco, with the  assistance of the other Parties, shall
promptly respond to any SEC comments on the Registration Statement and shall
otherwise use their commercially reasonable efforts to (i) "clear" comments
from the SEC, (ii) cause the Registration Statement to  become effective and
(iii) keep the Registration Statement effective for as long as necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Purchaser and Pubco shall
provide the Company with copies of any written comments, and shall inform 
the Company of any material oral comments, that Purchaser, Pubco or their
respective Representatives receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Registration Statement, the Special Meeting and the Redemption promptly
after the receipt of  such comments and shall give the Company a reasonable
opportunity under the circumstances to review and comment on any proposed
written or oral responses to such comments. Purchaser and Pubco shall not file
any comment response letters with the  SEC without the approval (not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) of both Purchaser and the
Company.

 


 

 

(e) As soon as practicable after the  SEC declares the Registration Statement
effective, Purchaser and Pubco shall distribute the Proxy Statement contained
in the Registration Statement to Purchaser's stockholders and, pursuant
thereto, shall duly call, give notice of, convene and hold  (subject to the
last sentence of this _Section 7.10(e)_ ) the Special Meeting in accordance
with the Delaware Act for a date no later than thirty (30) days following the
date on which the SEC declared the Registration Statement effective and 
shall solicit proxies from the holders of Purchaser securities to vote in
favor of the Stockholder Approval Matters. Purchaser, acting through its board
of directors, shall include in the Proxy Statement the recommendation of its
board of  directors that the holders of Purchaser Common Stock vote in favor
of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Transactions, and
shall otherwise use its best efforts to obtain the Required Shareholder
Approval. Purchaser shall  provide the Company with (i) updates with respect
to the tabulated vote counts received by Purchaser, (ii) the right to demand
postponement or adjournment of the Special Meeting if, based on the tabulated
vote count, Purchaser will not receive the  required approval of its
stockholders to adopt this Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated
hereby and the other Stockholder Approval Matters, and (iii) the right to
review and comment on all communication sent to Purchaser's  stockholders,
holders of Purchaser Warrants and/or proxy solicitation firms. Neither
Purchaser's board of directors nor any committee or agent or representative
thereof shall (i) withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to the Company),
or  propose to withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to the Company),
Purchaser board's recommendation that Purchaser's stockholders vote in favor
of the adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
(ii) approve, recommend  or declare advisable, or propose publicly to
approve, recommend or declare advisable, any Alternative Transaction, (iii)
approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose to approve, recommend or
declare advisable, or allow Purchaser to execute  or enter into, any
agreement related to an Alternative Transaction, (iv) enter into any
agreement, letter of intent, or agreement in principle requiring Purchaser to
abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
or  breach its obligations hereunder, (v) fail to recommend against any
Alternative Transaction, (vi) fail to re-affirm the aforementioned Purchaser
board recommendation at the written request of the Company within five (5)
Business Days of such  request or (vii) resolve or agree in writing to do any
of the foregoing (any of the actions listed in sub-clauses (i) through (vii)
of this sentence, a "Change of Recommendation"). If on  the date for which
the Special Meeting is scheduled, Purchaser has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of shares to obtain the Required Shareholder
Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, Purchaser may make one or more 
successive postponements or adjournments of the Special Meeting, and shall
hold the Special Meeting as soon as reasonably practicable upon Purchaser's
determination that it has received a sufficient number of Purchaser Securities
to obtain the  Required Shareholder Approval.

 


 

 

 

49  

(f) Purchaser and Pubco shall comply  with all applicable Laws, any
applicable rules and regulations of Nasdaq, Purchaser's and Pubco's
Organizational Documents, respectively, and this Agreement in the preparation,

proxies thereunder, the calling and holding of the Special Meeting and the
Redemption.

the SEC in order for the SEC to accept and review such filing, September 30,
2019) and the related consolidated income statement, changes in shareholder
equity and statement of cash flows for the six (6) months (or if  applicable,

(a) The Parties agree that, during the  Interim Period, no public release,

the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be issued by any Party
or any of their Affiliates without the prior written  consent (not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) of Purchaser, Pubco and the
Company, except as such release or announcement may be required by applicable
Law or the rules or regulations of any securities exchange, in which case

other Parties reasonable time to comment on, and arrange for any required
filing with respect to, such release or announcement in advance of such

50  

(c) With respect to Purchaser's  periodic filings with the SEC (excluding for
the avoidance of doubt, the Proxy Statement), to the extent Purchaser receives
any written comments (or other comments, which the failure to include would
reasonably be expected to material delay the  filing of the Registration
Statement) from the SEC on any documents it has submitted, furnished or filed
with the SEC following the date hereof through the Closing Date, or any
written request (or other request, with which the failure to comply  would
reasonably be expected to materially delay the filing of the Registration
Statement) by the SEC for amendments or supplements to any such documents,
Purchaser shall notify the Company as promptly as practicable of the receipt
of such comments  or request, shall promptly supply the Company with copies

7.13 _Post-Closing Board of Directors_.    The Parties shall take all

and officers of Purchaser and each Person who served as a director, officer,
member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation,  partnership, joint
venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise at the
request of Purchaser (the "DandO Indemnified Persons") as provided in
Purchaser's  Organizational Documents or under any indemnification,
employment or other similar agreements between any DandO Indemnified Person and
Purchaser, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall
survive the Closing and continue in  full force and effect in accordance with
their respective terms to the extent permitted by applicable Law. For a period
of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Pubco shall cause the
Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation to  contain provisions
no less favorable with respect to exculpation and indemnification of and
advancement of expenses to DandO Indemnified Persons than are set forth as of
the date of this Agreement in the Organizational Documents of Purchaser to 
the extent permitted by applicable Law. The provisions of this _Section 7.14_
shall survive the Closing and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by, each of the DandO Indemnified Persons and their respective 
heirs and representatives.

 


 

 

(b) For the benefit of Purchaser's  directors and officers, Purchaser, in
coordination with Pubco and the Company, shall be permitted prior to the
Effective Time to obtain and fully pay the premium for a "tail" insurance
policy that provides coverage for up to a six-year period from  and after the
Effective Time for events occurring prior to the Effective Time (the "DandO Tail
Insurance") that is substantially equivalent to and in any event not less
favorable in the  aggregate than Purchaser's existing policy or, if
substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available
coverage. If obtained, Pubco and Purchaser shall maintain the DandO Tail
Insurance in full force and effect, and  continue to honor the obligations
thereunder, and Pubco and Purchaser shall timely pay or cause to be paid all
premiums with respect to the DandO Tail Insurance; _provided_ , _however_ , that
in no event shall Pubco or Purchaser be  required to expend for such policies
premium amounts in excess of 250% of the premium currently paid by Purchaser
for such insurance, and if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed such amount, Purchaser shall be permitted to obtain a  policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that Purchaser may obtain a policy with a premium higher than 250%
of the current premium if Sponsor, at its sole election, pays  the portion of
the premium above 250%.

the funds in the Trust Account, after taking into account payments for the

Consideration, (ii) Purchaser's accrued Expenses, including Purchaser's
deferred Expenses of the IPO and (iii) any loans owed by Purchaser to Sponsor
for Expenses (including deferred Expenses), other administrative costs and 
expenses incurred by or on behalf of Purchaser or Extension Expenses. Such

general corporate purposes.

 


 

 

7.16 _Commitment Agreements_.   Purchaser shall use its reasonable best
efforts to satisfy the conditions of the investors closing obligations
contained in the Commitment Agreements and the Warrant Purchase Agreement, and
consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.   Purchaser shall not
terminate, amend or waive in any manner adverse to the Company or Pubco, the
Commitment Agreements or the Warrant Purchase Agreement without the Company's
prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or 
conditioned) and Purchaser shall, except with the Company's prior written
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned with respect
to any Commitment Agreement if the condition set forth in _Section 9.2(d)_
will otherwise  be satisfied without the closing under such Commitment
Agreement), use its best efforts to enforce each of the Commitment Agreements
or Warrant Purchase Agreement in accordance with its terms. In the event that
there is an actual or threatened  material breach or default by an investor
under Commitment Agreement, or Purchaser reasonably believes in good faith
that such investor otherwise is not willing or able to consummate the
transactions contemplated thereby upon the satisfaction of  the conditions of
such investor's closing obligations thereunder, then notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, except with the Company's prior written consent, or if
Purchaser has evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company that the 
condition set forth in _Section 9.2(d)_ will otherwise be satisfied based on
the deadline for the Redemption having passed, Purchaser shall be required to
use its reasonable best efforts to enter into and consummate replacement
agreements for  the PIPE Investment, which agreements shall become Commitment
Agreements for purposes of this Agreement and included as part of the PIPE
Investment, and Pubco and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective
Representatives to, reasonably  cooperate with Purchaser and its
Representatives in connection with such replacement PIPE Investment and use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause such replacement
PIPE Investment to occur (including having the Company's senior  management
participate in any investor meetings and roadshows as reasonably requested by
Purchaser); _provided_ , that if the terms of such replacement Commitment
Agreement are adverse to Purchaser, Pubco or the Company as compared to the 
Commitment Agreement that it replaced, including without limitation as to
conditionality and amount, Purchaser may not enter into such replacement
Commitment Agreement without the prior written consent of the Company (not to
be unreasonably  withheld, delayed or conditioned).

 


 

 

 

53  

7.17 _Exchange Agreements_. The  Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to deliver to Purchaser and the Purchaser Representative an
Exchange Agreement for each shareholder of the Company that did not execute
and deliver an Exchange Agreement simultaneously with the  execution and
delivery of this Agreement, completed and duly executed by such shareholder,
the Company, Pubco (upon its formation) and the Seller Representative;
provided, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary, nothing herein shall
obligate  the Company to obtain, and the Closing shall not be conditioned on
the Company's obtaining of, executed Exchange Agreements from 100% of the
Company's shareholders.

 


 

 

7.18 _Delisting and Deregistration_.    The Parties shall take all actions
necessary or reasonably requested another Party to cause the Purchaser Units,
Purchaser Common Stock and Purchaser Warrants to be delisted from Nasdaq (or
be succeeded by the Pubco Securities) and to terminate its  registration with
the SEC pursuant to Sections 12(b), 12(g) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act (or be
succeeded by Pubco) as of the Closing Date or as soon as practicable
thereafter.

 


 

 

7.19 _Pubco Listing_. Purchaser  and Pubco shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Pubco Common Shares to be approved for listing on Nasdaq
by no later than the Closing Date, and to remain listed as a public company on
Nasdaq through the Closing Date, including by  using commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure that Pubco has at least three hundred (300) round-lot
holders of its Pubco Common Shares (in each case, at least fifty percent (50%)
of which hold unrestricted securities with a value of at least  Two-Thousand
Five Hundred U.S. Dollars ($2,500)).

 


 

 

7.20 _Employment Agreements_. The  Company and Pubco will use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the senior management of the Target
Companies, as identified on _Schedule 7.20_ hereof, to enter into new
employment agreements with Pubco or a Target Company on  commercially
reasonable terms.

 


 

 

7.21 _Pubco Equity Plan_. In  connection with the Transactions, Pubco shall
adopt a new Equity Incentive Plan in a form to be agreed upon prior to the
Closing by Purchaser and the Company, each acting reasonably and in good
faith, based on the form attached as Exhibit E hereto  (the "Pubco Equity
Plan"), which will provide that the total awards under such Pubco Equity Plan
will be a number of Pubco Common Shares equal to ten percent (10%) of the
aggregate number  of Pubco Common Shares issued and outstanding immediately
after the Closing.

of such Party or its Affiliates (or with  respect to the Company, any Target
Company, Pubco or Merger Sub) to comply with or perform any of its covenants
or obligations set forth in this Agreement.

 


 

 

ARTICLE X

 

_TERMINATION AND EXPENSES_

 


 

 

10.1 _Termination_. This  Agreement may be terminated and the transactions
contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time prior to the Closing as
follows:

 


 

 

(a) by mutual written consent of  Purchaser and the Company;

 


 

 

(b) by written notice by Purchaser or  the Company if the Closing shall not
have occurred by March 15, 2020 (the "Outside Date") (provided, that if
Purchaser seeks and obtains an Extension, Purchaser shall have the right by 
providing written notice thereof to the Company to extend the Outside Date for
an additional period equal to the shorter of (i) three (3) additional months
and (ii) the period ending on the last date for Purchaser to consummate its
Business  Combination pursuant to such Extension); provided, however, that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 10.1(b)_ shall not
be available to a Party if the breach or violation by such Party or its
Affiliates (or with respect  to the Company, Pubco or Merger Sub) of any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation under this Agreement was the
cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before the
Outside Date;

 


 

 

 

59  

(c) by written notice by either  Purchaser or the Company if a Governmental
Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have issued an Order or taken any
other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and  such Order or other action
has become final and non-appealable; provided, however, that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.1(c)_ shall not be
available to a Party if the failure by such Party or its Affiliates  (or with
respect to the Company, Pubco or Merger Sub) to comply with any provision of
this Agreement has been a substantial cause of, or substantially resulted in,
such action by such Governmental Authority;

 


 

 

(d) by written notice by the Company to  Purchaser, if (i) there has been a
breach by Purchaser of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty
of Purchaser shall have become untrue or inaccurate, in any  case, which
would result in a failure of a condition set forth in _Section 9.2(a)_ or
_Section 9.2(b)_ to be satisfied (treating the Closing Date for such purposes
as the date of this Agreement or, if later, the date of such breach),  and
(ii) the breach or inaccuracy is incapable of being cured or is not cured
within the earlier of (A) twenty (20) days after written notice of such breach
or inaccuracy is provided to Purchaser by the Company or (B) the Outside Date;
provided,  that the Company shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.1(d)_ if at such time the Company,
Pubco or Merger Sub is in material uncured breach of this Agreement;

 


 

 

(e) by written notice by Purchaser to  the Company, if (i) there has been a
breach by the Company, Pubco, or Merger Sub of any of their respective
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of such Parties shall  have
become untrue or inaccurate, in any case, which would result in a failure of a
condition set forth in _Section 9.3(a)_ or _Section 9.3(b)_ to be satisfied
(treating the Closing Date for such purposes as the date of this Agreement 
or, if later, the date of such breach), and (ii) the breach or inaccuracy is
incapable of being cured or is not cured within the earlier of (A) twenty (20)
days after written notice of such breach or inaccuracy is provided to the
Company by  Purchaser or (B) the Outside Date; provided, that Purchaser shall
not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
10.1(e)_ if at such time Purchaser is in material uncured breach of this
Agreement;

 


 

 

(f) by written notice by Purchaser to  the Company, if there shall have been
a Material Adverse Effect on Pubco and the Target Companies, taken as a whole,
following the date of this Agreement which is uncured and continuing;

 


 

 

(g) by written notice by either  Purchaser or the Company to the other if the
Special Meeting is held (including any adjournment or postponement thereof)
and has concluded, Purchaser's stockholders have duly voted, and the Required
Shareholder Approval was not obtained; or

 


 

 

(h) by the Company if Purchaser makes  any Change of Recommendation.

 


 

 

 

60  

10.2 _Effect of Termination_.   This Agreement may only be terminated in the
circumstances described in _Section 10.1_ and pursuant to a written notice
delivered by the applicable Party to the other applicable Parties, which sets
forth the basis for such termination,  including the provision of _Section
10.1_ under which such termination is made. In the event of the valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1_ , this Agreement
shall forthwith become void, and there shall be no  Liability on the part of
any Party or any of their respective Representatives, and all rights and
obligations of each Party shall cease, except: (i) _Sections 7.11_ , _7.12_ ,
_10.3_ , _Article XI_ , _Article XII_ and this  _Section 10.2_ shall survive
the termination of this Agreement, and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any
Party from Liability for any willful breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation under this Agreement or any Fraud  Claim against such
Party, in either case, prior to termination of this Agreement (in each case of
clauses (i) and (ii) above, subject to _Section 11.1_ ). Without limiting the
foregoing, and except as provided in _Section 10.3_ and this  _Section 10.2_
(but subject to _Section 11.1_ , and subject to the right to seek injunctions,
specific performance or other equitable relief in accordance with _Section
12.7_ ), the Parties' sole right prior to the Closing with  respect to any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained
in this Agreement by another Party or with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be the right, if applicable, to terminate
this  Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1_.

 


 

 

10.3 _Fees and Expenses_. Subject  to _Section 11.1_ , all Expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be paid by the Party incurring such expenses. As used in this Agreement,
"Expenses" shall include all out-of-pocket expenses (including all fees and
expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers, financial advisors,
financing sources, experts and consultants to a Party hereto or any of its 
Affiliates) incurred by a Party or on its behalf in connection with or related
to the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution or performance of
this Agreement or any Ancillary Document related hereto and all other matters
related to the  consummation of this Agreement. With respect to Purchaser,
Expenses shall include any and all deferred expenses (including fees or
commissions payable to the underwriters and any legal fees) of the IPO upon
consummation of a Business Combination  and any Extension Expenses.

 


 

 

ARTICLE XI

 

_WAIVERS AND RELEASES_

 


 

 

11.1 _Waiver of Claims Against Trust_.    Reference is made to the IPO
Prospectus. The Company, Pubco and Merger Sub hereby represent and warrant
that they have read the IPO Prospectus and understand that Purchaser has
established the Trust Account containing the proceeds of the IPO and  the
overallotment shares acquired by Purchaser's underwriters and from certain
private placements occurring simultaneously with the IPO (including interest
accrued from time to time thereon) for the benefit of Purchaser's public
stockholders  (including overallotment shares acquired by Purchaser's
underwriters) (the "Public Stockholders") and that, except as otherwise
described in the IPO Prospectus, Purchaser may disburse  monies from the
Trust Account only: (a) to the Public Stockholders in the event they elect to
redeem their shares of Purchaser Common Stock (or Pubco Common Shares upon the
Merger) in connection with the consummation of its initial business 
combination (as such term is used in the IPO Prospectus) ("Business
Combination") or in connection with an amendment to Purchaser's Organizational
Documents to extend Purchaser's deadline  to consummate a Business
Combination, (b) to the Public Stockholders if Purchaser fails to consummate a
Business Combination within twenty-four (24) months after the closing of the
IPO (or prior to any other deadline to consummate a Business  Combination
established pursuant to an amendment to Purchaser's Organizational Documents),
(c) with respect to any interest earned on the amounts held in the Trust
Account, amounts necessary to pay for any franchise or income taxes, and (d)
to  Purchaser after or concurrently with the consummation of a Business
Combination. For and in consideration of Purchaser entering into this
Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby  acknowledged, each of the Company, Pubco and
Merger Sub hereby agrees on behalf of itself and its Affiliates that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the
Company, Pubco or Merger Sub nor any of their respective  Affiliates do now
or shall at any time hereafter have any right, title, interest or claim of any
kind in or to any monies in the Trust Account or distributions therefrom, or
make any claim against the Trust Account (including any distributions 
therefrom), regardless of whether such claim arises as a result of, in
connection with or relating in any way to, this Agreement or any proposed or
actual business relationship between Purchaser or any of its Representatives,
on the one hand, and  the Company, Pubco, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Representatives, on the other hand, or any other matter, and
regardless of whether such claim arises based on contract, tort, equity or any
other theory of legal liability (collectively, the  "Released Claims"). Each
of the Company, Pubco and Merger Sub on behalf of itself and its Affiliates
hereby irrevocably waives any Released Claims that any such Party or any of
its  Affiliates may have against the Trust Account (including any
distributions therefrom) now or in the future as a result of, or arising out
of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with Purchaser or its
Representatives and will not seek recourse  against the Trust Account
(including any distributions therefrom) for any reason whatsoever (including
for an alleged breach of this Agreement or any other agreement with Purchaser
or its Affiliates). The Company, Pubco and Merger Sub each agrees  and
acknowledges that such irrevocable waiver is material to this Agreement and
specifically relied upon by Purchaser and its Affiliates to induce Purchaser
to enter in this Agreement, and each of the Company, Pubco and Merger Sub
further intends  and understands such waiver to be valid, binding and
enforceable against such Party and each of its Affiliates under applicable
Law. To the extent that the Company, Pubco, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates commences any Action based  upon, in connection with,
relating to or arising out of any matter relating to Purchaser or its
Representatives, which proceeding seeks, in whole or in part, monetary relief
against Purchaser or its Representatives, each of the Company, Pubco and 
Merger Sub hereby acknowledges and agrees that its and its Affiliates' sole
remedy shall be against funds held outside of the Trust Account and that such
claim shall not permit such Party or any of its Affiliates (or any Person
claiming on any of  their behalves or in lieu of them) to have any claim
against the Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom) or any
amounts contained therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to any of _Section   10.1(b)_ (but only if
the transactions contemplated hereby have failed to close by the Outside Date
because of Purchaser's breach of an obligation herein), _10.1(d)_ or _10.1(h)_
), and Purchaser completes a Business Combination  with another company, the
Company shall not be prohibited by this _Section 11.1_ from filing and
pursuing a claim for damages in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated herein following consummation by Purchaser of an 
alternative Business Combination, in each case against Purchaser or any other
entity that is party to such alternative Business Combination or any Affiliate
thereof; provided, that no such claims shall be made against Public
Stockholders with  respect to funds from the Trust Account that were
distributed to them. Furthermore, in the event of any such termination of this
Agreement under such provisions, Purchaser shall not execute any definitive
agreement related to such alternative  Business Combination that (i) attempts
to prevent the Company from so filing or pursuing any such claim, or (ii)
permits the entity that survives such combination to not assume Purchaser's
obligation for damages in connection with this Agreement  and the
transactions contemplated herein. This _Section 11.1_ shall survive
termination of this Agreement for any reason and continue indefinitely.

 


 

 

 

61  

11.2 _No Recourse_. Except as  expressly set forth in this Agreement, and
other than in the case of fraud or willful and intentional breach of this
Agreement, notwithstanding any rights of a Party at law or in equity, in the
event of any default or breach by another Party under  this Agreement, such
Party's remedies shall be restricted to enforcement of its rights against the
property and assets of (i) the Company, (ii) Purchaser and (iii) Pubco (the
"Liable Parties"),   and no liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed
on or otherwise be incurred by, any former, current or future director,
officer, employee, agent, general or limited partner, manager, member,
shareholder, stockholder or Affiliate of a Party  (other than the Liable
Parties), any stockholder, or any former, current or future director, officer,
employee, agent, general or limited partner, manager, member, shareholder,
stockholder or Affiliate (other than a Liable Party) of any of the 
foregoing, whether by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or
equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any statute, regulation or other
applicable Law, for any obligations or Liabilities of the parties to this
Agreement or for any claim  based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the
transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each Party hereto agrees that it shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, not file, or threaten to file, any claim,  suit, action or
proceeding in violation of this _Section 11.2_. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing herein will relinquish the rights of a Party to specifically enforce
the terms of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 12.7_   hereof.

12.2 _Binding Effect; Assignment_.    This Agreement and all of the
provisions hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. This
Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of Law or otherwise  without the
prior written consent of Purchaser, Pubco and the Company (and after the
Closing, the Purchaser Representative and the Seller Representative), and any
assignment without such consent shall be null and void; _provided_ that no
such  assignment shall relieve the assigning Party of its obligations
hereunder.

 


 

 

12.3 _Third Parties_. Except for  the rights of the DandO Indemnified Persons
set forth in _Section 7.14_ and of the Sponsor under _Section 12.14_ , which
the Parties acknowledge and agree are express third party beneficiaries of
this Agreement, nothing contained in  this Agreement or in any instrument or
document executed by any party in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby shall create any rights in, or be deemed to have been
executed for the benefit of, any Person that is not a Party hereto  or
thereto or a successor or permitted assign of such a Party.

 


 

 

12.4 _Arbitration_. Any and all  disputes, controversies or claims arising
out of, relating to, or in connection with this Agreement or the breach,
termination or validity hereof, or the transactions contemplated hereby (a
"Dispute")   shall be finally resolved by arbitration under the Rules of
Arbitration of the ICC (the "ICC Rules"). To the extent that the ICC Rules and
this Agreement are in conflict, the terms of  this Agreement shall control.
The seat of arbitration shall be in New York County, State of New York. The
language of the arbitration shall be English. The tribunal shall consist of
three arbitrators. The parties to the Dispute shall each be  entitled to
nominate one arbitrator, provided that where there are multiple claimants or
multiple respondents, the multiple claimants jointly and the multiple
respondents jointly shall nominate an arbitrator. The third arbitrator, who
shall be the  presiding arbitrator on the tribunal, shall be nominated by the
agreement of the two party-nominated arbitrators or, if they fail to agree on
a nomination within fifteen (15) days of the nomination date of the second
arbitrator, the third  arbitrator shall be promptly selected and appointed by
the ICC. The arbitrators shall decide the Dispute in accordance with the
substantive law of the state of New York. The proceedings shall be streamlined
and efficient, and time is of the  essence. An arbitration award rendered by
the tribunal shall be final and binding on the parties to the Dispute.
Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, applications for a  temporary restraining
order, preliminary injunction, permanent injunction or other equitable relief
or application for enforcement of a resolution under this _Section 12.4_ may
be made in the Specified Courts.

 


 

 

12.5 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.    This Agreement shall be governed by,
construed and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the State of New York
without regard to the conflict of laws principles thereof. Without derogating
from the agreement to arbitrate in _Section 12.4_ ,  each Party hereto hereby
(a) submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court
located in the County of New York in the State of New York (or in any
appellate court thereof) (the "Specified Courts") for the purpose of any
claim, action, litigation or other legal proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and permitted by
_Section 12.4_ (a "Proceeding"), and (b) irrevocably waives, and agrees not to
assert by way of motion, defense or otherwise, in any such Proceeding, any
claim that it is not subject personally to the  jurisdiction of the above-
named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or
execution, that the Proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the
venue of the Proceeding is improper, or that this Agreement or the 
transactions contemplated hereby may not be enforced in or by any Specified
Court. Each Party agrees that a final judgment in any Proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other  manner provided by Law. Each Party irrevocably consents to
the service of the summons and complaint and any other process in any
Proceeding, on behalf of itself, or its property, by personal delivery of
copies of such process to such Party at the  applicable address set forth in
_Section 12.1_. Nothing in this _Section 12.5_ shall affect the right of any
Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law.

 


 

 

 

65  

12.6 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. WITHOUT DEROGATING FROM THE AGREEMENT TO
ARBITRATE IN _SECTION 12.4_ , EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER
OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS  AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY. EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SEEK TO ENFORCE  THAT FOREGOING WAIVER AND
(B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION   12.6_.

 


 

 

12.7 _Specific Performance_. Each  Party acknowledges that the rights of each
Party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are unique,
recognizes and affirms that in the event of a breach of this Agreement by any
Party, money damages may be inadequate and the  non-breaching Parties may
have no adequate remedy at law, and agree that irreparable damage would occur
in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed
by an applicable Party in accordance with their specific terms or  were
otherwise breached. Accordingly, each Party shall be entitled to seek an
injunction or restraining order to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
seek to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, including the
obligation to  effect the Closing, without the requirement to post any bond
or other security or to prove that money damages would be inadequate, this
being in addition to any other right or remedy to which such Party may be
entitled under this Agreement, at law  or in equity.

 


 

 

12.8 _Severability_. In case any  provision in this Agreement shall be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in a jurisdiction, such provision shall be
modified or deleted, as to the jurisdiction involved, only to the extent
necessary to render the same valid, legal and  enforceable, and the validity,
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof shall not in
any way be affected or impaired thereby nor shall the validity, legality or
enforceability of such provision be affected thereby in any other 
jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties will substitute
for any invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision a suitable and equitable
provision that  carries out, so far as may be valid, legal and enforceable,
the intent and purpose of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision.

 


 

 

12.9 _Amendment_. This Agreement  may be amended, supplemented or modified
only by execution of a written instrument signed by Purchaser, Pubco, the
Company, the Purchaser Representative and the Seller Representative.

 


 

 

12.10 _Waiver_. Each of  Purchaser, Pubco and the Company on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates, and the Seller Representative on behalf of itself and, if
applicable, the Sellers, may in its sole discretion (i) extend the time for
the performance of any obligation or  other act of any other non-Affiliated
Party hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties
by such other non-Affiliated Party contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance by such  other non-
Affiliated Party with any covenant or condition contained herein. Any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the Party or Parties to be bound thereby (including by the
Purchaser  Representative or the Seller Representative in lieu of such Party
to the extent provided in this Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
failure or delay by a Party in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as
a waiver thereof nor  shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude
any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, any waiver of any provision of this Agreement after the Closing
by Pubco or Purchaser shall also  require the prior written consent of the
Purchaser Representative.

 


 

 

 

66  

12.11 _Entire Agreement_. This  Agreement and the documents or instruments
referred to herein, including any exhibits, annexes and schedules attached
hereto, which exhibits, annexes and schedules are incorporated herein by
reference, together with the Ancillary Documents, embody  the entire
agreement and understanding of the Parties hereto in respect of the subject
matter contained herein. There are no restrictions, promises, representations,
warranties, covenants or undertakings, other than those expressly set forth
or  referred to herein or the documents or instruments referred to herein,
which collectively supersede all prior agreements and the understandings among
the Parties with respect to the subject matter contained herein (it being
understood that the  letter of intent between Purchaser and the Company is
hereby terminated in its entirety and shall be of no further force and effect,
except with respect to the waiver against the Trust Account set forth
therein).

 


 

 

12.12 _Interpretation_. The table  of contents and the Article and Section
headings contained in this Agreement are solely for the purpose of reference,
are not part of the agreement of the Parties and shall not in any way affect
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. In  this Agreement, unless
the context otherwise requires: (a) any pronoun used in this Agreement shall
include the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and words in
the singular form, including any defined terms, include the plural and  vice
versa; (b) reference to any Person includes such Person's successors and
assigns but, if applicable, only if such successors and assigns are permitted
by this Agreement, and reference to a Person in a particular capacity excludes
such Person  in any other capacity; (c) any accounting term used and not
