_ARTICLE  II_

 

 

 

_Effect  of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Entities; _

 

_Exchange  of Certificates; Company Stock Options_

 

 

2.1. _Effect  on Capital Stock_.  At the  Effective Time, as a result of
the Merger and without any action on the part  of  Merger Sub or the Company
or the holder of any capital stock of Merger Sub  or  the Company or any
other person:

 

 

(a) _Merger  Consideration_.  Each  share of the common stock, par value
$0.005 per share, of the Company (a " _Share_ " or,  collectively, the "
_Shares_ ")  issued  and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Excluded  Shares) shall automatically, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action  on  the part of the holder thereof, be converted
into the right to receive $43.50  in  cash (the " _Per  Share Merger
Consideration_ ").  At  the Effective Time, all of the Shares shall cease to
be outstanding, shall  be  cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate (a " _Certificate_ ")  formerly representing any of
the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall  cease  to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per  Share Merger
Consideration, without interest.

 

 

(b) _Cancellation  of Excluded Shares_.  Each  issued and outstanding Share
that immediately prior to the Effective Time is  owned by Parent or Merger
Sub and not held on behalf of third parties (each  an " _Excluded  Share_
" and  collectively, " _Excluded  Shares_ ")  shall  automatically, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of  the  holder of
the Excluded Share, cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and  shall
cease to exist without payment of any consideration therefor.

 

 

(c) _Merger  Sub_.  At the  Effective Time, each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger  Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall  automatically be converted into one share
of common stock, par value $0.005  per  share, of the Surviving Entity.

 

 

2.2. _Exchange  of Certificates_. 

 

 

(a) _Paying  Agent_.  Prior  to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit
with a paying agent selected by  Parent with the Company's prior approval,
which shall not  be  unreasonably withheld (the " _Paying  Agent_ "), 
an  amount of cash equal to the product of (i) the number of Shares
outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded
Shares)  _multiplied_ _by_   (ii) the  Per Share Merger Consideration (such
cash being hereinafter referred to as  the " _Exchange  Fund_ ").  The 
Exchange Fund will be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; 
_provided_ ,  that  such investments will be (A) in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United  States of America or of any agency thereof and
backed by the full faith and  credit of the United States of America, (B) in
commercial paper obligations  rated A-1 or P-1 or better by either Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation or (C) in deposit
accounts, certificates of deposit or  banker's acceptances of, repurchase or
reverse repurchase agreements with, or  Eurodollar time deposits purchased
from, commercial banks, each of which has  capital, surplus and undivided
profits aggregating more than $1.0 billion (based  on the most recent
financial statements of such bank which are then publicly  available at the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ")  or  otherwise). Any
interest and other income resulting from such investment shall  become a part
of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the aggregate  Per Share
Merger Consideration payable under this Agreement shall be promptly  returned
to Parent. Any losses resulting from such investments shall not in  any  way
diminish Parent's and Merger Sub's obligation to pay the Per Share Merger 
Consideration payable under this Agreement, and Parent shall promptly
provide  additional funds to the Paying Agent in the amount of any such 
losses.

 

 

(b) _Exchange  Procedures_.  As soon  as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (and in any event within  three business days), the Surviving
Entity shall cause the Paying Agent to  mail  to each holder of record of
Shares (other than Excluded Shares) entitled to  receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a) (i) a  letter of transmittal in
customary form specifying that delivery shall be  effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon  delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates  as provided
in Section 2.2(e)) to the Paying Agent, such letter of  transmittal to be in
such form and have such other provisions as Parent and  the  Company may
reasonably agree prior to the Closing, and (ii) instructions  for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss  in  lieu
of the Certificates as provided in Section 2.2(e)) in exchange for the  Per
Share Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit 
of  loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in Section 2.2(e)) to the 
Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal,
duly  executed, Paying Agent shall (and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent
to) as  soon as reasonably practicable pay from the Exchange Fund to the
holder of  such  Certificate a cash amount in immediately available funds
(after giving effect  to  any required tax withholdings as provided in
Section 2.2(g)) equal to  (x) the number of Shares represented by such
Certificate (or affidavit of  loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in
Section 2.2(e)) multiplied  by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and
the Certificate so  surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest
will be paid or accrued  on  any amount payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates. In the event of  a  transfer of ownership of Shares that is
not registered in the transfer  records of the Company, a check for any cash
to be exchanged upon due surrender  of the Certificate may be issued to such
transferee if the Certificate formerly  representing such Shares that is
presented to the Paying Agent shall be properly  endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and is accompanied by  all  documents required to
reasonably evidence that any applicable stock transfer  taxes have been paid,
are not applicable or will be paid by such  transferee.

 

 

(c) _Transfers_.  From  and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer  books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior  to  the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, any Certificate is presented  to the Paying Agent, it shall
be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount  in  immediately available
funds to which the holder of the Certificate is entitled  pursuant to this
Article II.

 

 

(d) _Termination  of Exchange Fund_.  Any  portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments of  the  Exchange Fund) that
remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for  one  year after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Entity. Any  holder of
Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied  with
this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Entity for 
payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any 
required tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.2(g)) upon due surrender 
of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates),
without  any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the
Surviving  Entity, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other person shall be
liable to any  former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a
public official  pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws. 

 

 

(e) _Lost,  Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_.  In the  event any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making  of an
affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be  lost, 
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such person 
of a  bond in customary and reasonable amount and upon such terms as may
reasonably  be  required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against  it or  the Surviving Entity with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will  issue a check in the amount (after giving
effect to any required tax  withholdings as provided in Section 2.2(g)) equal
to the number of Shares  represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate multiplied by the  Per  Share Merger Consideration.

entitled to deduct and withhold from  the  consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of  Shares such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to  the  making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as

 

amended,  or any other applicable state, local or foreign tax law. To the
extent that  amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Entity or Parent, as
the case may  be,  such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent or
the Surviving  Entity, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental
Authority, and  (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been  paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction
and withholding  was made by the Surviving Entity or Parent, as the case may
be.

 

 

2.3. _Company  Equity Awards_.

 

 

(a) All  stock  options (the " _Company  Stock Options_ ")  and  Company
Awards (as described in (ii) below, and collectively with the Company  Stock

(i) At  the  Effective Time, each outstanding Company Stock Option under the
Company Stock  Plans, vested or unvested, shall be cancelled and shall only
entitle the holder  thereof to receive from the Surviving Entity, as soon as
reasonably practicable  after the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to
the product of (x) the  total number of Shares subject to the Company Stock
Option times (y) the  excess, if any, of the value of the Per Share Merger
Consideration over the  exercise price per Share under such Company Stock
Option less applicable Taxes  required to be withheld with respect to such
payment.

 

 

(ii) At  the  Effective Time, each right of any kind, contingent or accrued,

issuance under the  Company Stock Plans and any other Company Plan, including
restricted stock  units  under the Company Stock Plans (" _Company  RSU_
"),  other  than Company Stock Options (the " _Company  Awards_ "), 
shall  be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder thereof to receive from
the  Surviving Entity, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time,  an  amount in cash equal to (x) the number of Shares subject to such
Company  Award immediately prior to the Effective Time times (y) the value of
the  Per Share Merger Consideration (or, if the Company Award provides for
payments  to the extent the value of the Shares exceed a specified reference
price, the  amount, if any, by which the value of the Per Share Merger
Consideration exceeds  such reference price), less applicable Taxes required
to be withheld with  respect to such payment.

 

 

(b)  The  current offering in process as of the date hereof under the
Company's Amended  and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_
")  shall  continue and the Company may, consistent with past practice and
in accordance  with the terms of the ESPP, commence new offering periods
under the ESPP on  or  after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time
at an exercise price  for  each such offering not less than as is provided
under the ESPP; _provided_ ,  that on  each Exercise Date (as defined in the
ESPP) occurring prior to the Effective  Time, and immediately prior to the
Effective Time (as long as such date is  not  otherwise an Exercise Date),
each participant shall promptly receive, in lieu  of  whole Shares that
would otherwise be purchased under the ESPP in respect of  his  or her
account, a cash payment equal to the product of (x) such number of whole 
Shares and (y) the Fair Market Value (as defined in the ESPP) of a Share  (
_provided_ ,  that  with respect to the deemed purchase immediately prior to
the Effective Time,  the  Fair Market Value of a Share shall be deemed to be
the Merger Consideration),  _plus_   a cash  payment equal to the balance,
if any, of accumulated payroll deductions  remaining after such deemed
purchase. Effective as of the date hereof, the  Company shall amend the ESPP
or take any other action necessary to effectuate  the foregoing.

 

 

(c) At  or  prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board of Directors
of the Company  (the " _Company  Board_ ")  and  the compensation

and take any actions which are necessary to effectuate the  provisions of

modify or change the terms, of any  Company Equity Award or other equity or
equity-based awards.

 

 

2.4. _Adjustments  to Prevent Dilution_.  In the  event that the Company
changes the number of Shares or securities convertible  or  exchangeable
into or exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding prior to  the 
Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a 
reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization,
merger,  issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the
Per Share  Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted.


 

_ARTICLE  III_

 

 

_Representations  and Warranties of the Company_

 

 

Except  as  set forth in the disclosure letter (with specific reference to
the Section  or  Subsection of this Agreement to which the information
stated in such disclosure  relates; _provided_   that any  fact or
condition disclosed in any section of such disclosure letter in such  a  way
as to make its relevance to a representation or representations made 
elsewhere in this Agreement or information called for by another section of 
such  disclosure letter reasonably apparent shall be deemed to be an
exception to  such  representation or representations or to be disclosed on
such other section  of  such disclosure letter notwithstanding the omission
of a reference or cross  reference thereto) delivered by the Company to
Parent prior to the execution  of  this Agreement (the " _Company 
Disclosure Letter_ "),  the  Company represents and warrants to Parent and
Merger Sub as  follows:

 

 

3.1. _Organization,  Standing and Corporate Power_.  The  Company and each
of its Subsidiaries is an entity duly organized, validly  existing and in
good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction in which it  is  formed and
has all requisite power and authority to carry on its business as  now 
being conducted. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified 
or  licensed to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which  the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of
its  properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other than
in such  jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in
good  standing, individually or in the aggregate has not had, and would not
reasonably  be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has
made available  to Parent complete and correct copies of its Articles of
Incorporation (the  " _Company  Articles_ ")  and  By-laws (the "
_Company  By-laws_ ")  and  the articles of incorporation and by-laws (or
comparable organizational  documents) of each of its Subsidiaries, in each
case as amended to the date  of  this Agreement.

 

 

3.2. _Subsidiaries_.  _Section 3.2_  of the  Company Disclosure Letter
lists all of the Subsidiaries of the Company and,  for  each such
Subsidiary, the state of formation and each jurisdiction in which  such 
Subsidiary is qualified or licensed to do business. All the outstanding
shares  of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each such
Subsidiary have  been validly issued and, to the extent applicable, are fully
paid and  nonassessable and are owned directly or indirectly by the Company
free and  clear  of all pledges, **** liens, **** charges, **** title 
defects, easements, encumbrances, rights of first offer or refusal or
security  interests of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, " _Liens_
"),  and  free of any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise
dispose of  such  capital stock or other equity interests. Except for (i)
the capital stock or  other equity or voting interests of its Subsidiaries,
(ii) publicly traded  securities held for investment that do not exceed 5% of
the outstanding  securities of any entity and (iii) as set  forth  on
_Section  3.2_   of the  Company Disclosure Letter, the Company does not
own, directly or indirectly,  any  capital stock or other equity or voting
interests in any person.

 

 

3.3. _Capital  Structure_.

 

 

(a) The  authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 120,000,000
Shares and  1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share ("
_Company  Preferred Stock_ ").  At  the close of business on March 7, 2007,
(i) 55,226,395 Shares were outstanding  (which number does not include

outstanding Company Stock Options and 648,500 Shares were subject  to 
outstanding Company RSUs), (iv) no shares of Company Preferred Stock were
issued  or outstanding, and (v) 7,534,158 Shares were reserved for issuance
upon  conversion of the Company's 2.25% Senior Convertible Debentures due

an Indenture, dated as of March 3, 2003, between the Company and  Wells Fargo
Bank Minnesota, N.A. (a complete and correct copy of which has  been 
delivered or made available to Parent) of which 2,381,630 shares are subject 
to  outstanding Convertible Debentures.

 

 

(b) _Section 3.3(b)_  of the  Company Disclosure Letter contains a correct
and complete list (as of March  7,  2007) of Company Equity Awards including
Company Stock Options, and Company  RSUs  under the Company Stock Plans,
including the holder, date of grant, term, number  of Shares and, where
applicable, exercise price and vesting schedule. Other  than  the Company
Stock Options and Company RSUs there are no other outstanding equity  awards
under the Stock Plan. Except as otherwise set forth in this Section  3.3  or
on _Section  3.3(b)_   of the  Company Disclosure Letter, at the close of
business on March 7, 2007, no shares  of capital stock or other voting
securities of the Company were issued, reserved  for issuance or outstanding.
Except as otherwise set forth in this Section  3.3  or on _Section  3.3(b)_
  of the  Company Disclosure Letter, there are no outstanding stock
appreciation rights,  rights to receive Shares on a deferred basis or other
rights that are linked  to  the value of Shares granted under the Company

Company are, and all shares that  may  be issued pursuant to the Company
Stock Plans will be, when issued in accordance  with the terms thereof, duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and  nonassessable and not subject to
preemptive rights. Each Company Equity Award  granted after January 1, 2000
was granted in all material respects in compliance  with (i) all applicable
Laws and (ii) all of the material terms and conditions  of the Company Plans
pursuant to which it was issued.

 

 

(c) Other  than the Convertible Debentures, there are no bonds, debentures,
notes or other  indebtedness of the Company conferring on the holders the
right to vote (or  convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having
the right to vote)  on  any matters on which stockholders of the Company may
vote. Except for the Convertible  Debentures or as otherwise set forth in
this Section 3.3 or on _Section  3.3(b)_   of the  Company Disclosure
Letter, (i) there are not issued, reserved for issuance  or outstanding (A)
any securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries  convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for shares of capital stock  or  voting
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (B) any  warrants,
calls, options or other rights to acquire from the Company or any  of  its
Subsidiaries, or any obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries 
to  issue, any capital stock, voting securities or securities convertible
into  or  exchangeable or exercisable for capital stock or voting securities
of the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) there are not any
outstanding  obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem  or  otherwise acquire any such securities or to issue,
deliver or sell, or cause  to  be issued, delivered or sold, any such
securities. Neither the Company nor  any  of its Subsidiaries is a party to
any voting agreement with respect to the  voting of any such securities.

complete and correct list of the  following information, as of the close of
business on March 7, 2007, with  respect to the Convertible Debentures: (i)

3.4. _Authority;  Noncontravention_.

 

 

(a) The  Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter
into this  Agreement and, subject to the adoption of this Agreement and the
Merger by  the  affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding Shares (the  " _Company  Stockholder Approval_ "),  to 
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.  The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and
the consummation  by the Company of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this  Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the  part of the Company, and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the  Company are necessary to authorize this
Agreement or to consummate the  transactions contemplated hereby, subject, in
the case of the Merger, to receipt  of the Company Stockholder Approval. This
Agreement has been duly executed  and  delivered by the Company and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and  delivery by each of the other
parties hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and  binding obligation of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance  with its terms
(subject to applicable bankruptcy, solvency, fraudulent transfer, 
reorganization, moratorium and other Laws affecting creditors' rights
generally  from time to time in effect and by general principles of equity).
The Company  Board, at a meeting duly called and held at which all the
directors of the  Company were present in person or by telephone, duly and
unanimously adopted  resolutions (i) declaring that this Agreement, the
Merger and the other  transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
advisable and in the best  interests of the Company and the Company's
stockholders, (ii) approving and  adopting this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated  by  this Agreement, (iii) directing that
the adoption of this Agreement be submitted  to a vote at a meeting of the
stockholders of the Company and  (iv) recommending that the stockholders of
the Company adopt this  Agreement. The Company Board has taken all action
necessary to render the  provisions of Sections 78.378 to 78.3793, inclusive,
and 78.411 to 78.444,  inclusive, of the NRS inapplicable to this Agreement,
the Merger, and the other  transactions contemplated by this Agreement, 
including the Voting Agreement. Except for Section 78.438 of the NRS (which 
has been rendered inapplicable by action of the Company Board), no
"moratorium," "control share," "fair price," or other antitakeover laws or
regulations  (together, " _Takeover  Laws_ ")  are  applicable to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this  Agreement and the
Voting Agreement.

 

 

(b) The  execution and delivery of this Agreement do not, and the
consummation of the  Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and compliance  with the provisions of this Agreement will not,
conflict with, or result in  any  violation or breach of, or default (with
or without notice or lapse of time  or  both) under, or give rise to a right
of termination, cancellation or  acceleration of any obligation or to the
loss of a benefit under, or result  in  the creation of any Lien in or upon
any of the properties or other assets of  the  Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under, (i) the Company Articles or the  Company By-laws or the
comparable organizational documents of any of its  Subsidiaries, (ii) any
written loan or credit agreement, bond, debenture,  note, mortgage, policy,
certificate of coverage, indenture, lease or other  contract, agreement,
obligation, commitment, arrangement, binding understanding,  instrument,
permit or license (each, a " _Contract_ "),  to  which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party or any of their  respective properties or other
assets is subject or (iii) subject to the  governmental filings and other
matters referred to in Section 3.5, any Law  applicable to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or their respective  properties or other assets, other
than, in the case of clauses (ii) and  (iii), any such conflicts, violations,
breaches, defaults, rights, losses or  Liens that individually or in the
aggregate (A) have not had and would not  reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, (B) would not  reasonably be expected to impair in
any material respect the ability of the  Company to perform its obligations
hereunder and (C) would not reasonably be  expected to prevent or materially
delay the consummation of any of the  transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

 

(c) For  purposes of this Agreement, " _Material  Adverse Effect_ " shall 
mean any change, effect, event, circumstance, occurrence or state of facts 
that  is materially adverse to the business, financial condition or results
of  operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other
than  any  change, effect, event, circumstance, occurrence or state of facts
relating  to or  arising from (either alone or in combination) (i) the
economy or the  financial markets in general, (ii) either of the health care
or managed  care industries, (iii) changes in applicable Laws or regulations
after the  date  hereof; _provided_   that the  exclusion set forth in
this clause (iii) shall not apply to Section 3.4(b)  hereof, (iv) changes in
GAAP, SAP or regulatory accounting principles after  the date hereof, (v)
changes proximately  caused by the announcement or performance of this

consent of Parent or Merger Sub), (vi) the  matters set forth on _Section 
3.4(c)_   of the  Company Disclosure Letter, (vii) any natural disasters or
acts of war, sabotage  or terrorism involving the United States of America or
its interests, or an  escalation or worsening thereof, (viii) any changes in
the price or trading  volume of the Shares ( _provided_   that any  change,
effect, event or occurrence that may have caused or contributed to  such 
change in market price or trading volume shall not be excluded), (ix) any 
failure by the Company to meet revenue or earnings projections, in and of
itself  (provided that any change, effect, event or occurrence that may have
caused  or  contributed to such failure to meet published revenue or
earnings projections  shall not be excluded) and (x) any breach by the Buyer
or Merger Sub of this  Agreement; _provided_   that  with respect to
clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (vii), such change,  effect, event,
circumstance, occurrence or state of facts does not  disproportionately
affect in any material respect the Company and its  Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, as compared to the majority of persons engaged  in the same businesses
as the Company that is affected by such change, effect,  event, circumstance,
occurrence or state of facts.

 

 

3.5. _Governmental  Approvals_.  No  consent, approval, order or
authorization of, action by or in respect of, or  registration, declaration
or filing with, any Federal, state, local or foreign  government, any court,
administrative, regulatory or other governmental agency,  commission or
authority or any non-governmental self-regulatory agency,  commission or
authority (each, a " _Governmental  Authority_ ")  is  required by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the  execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company or the consummation  by  the
Company of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this 
Agreement, except for those required under or in relation to (a) the

filings the failure of which  to  be obtained or made individually or in the
aggregate would not reasonably be  expected to (x) have a Material Adverse
Effect,  (y)  impair in any material respect the ability of the Company to
perform its  obligations hereunder or  (z) prevent or materially delay the
consummation of any of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

3.6. _Company  SEC Documents; No Undisclosed Liabilities_.

 

 

(a) The  Company has filed or furnished all reports, schedules, forms,

incorporated therein)  with the SEC required to be filed by the Company since
December 31, 2003 (such  documents, the " _Company  SEC Documents_ "). 
No  Subsidiary of the Company is required to file, or files, any form, report

light of the  circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,
unless such  information contained in any Company SEC Document has been
corrected, revised  or  superceded by a later-filed Company SEC Document.
The financial statements  of  the Company included in the Company SEC
Documents, at the time of their filing,  complied as to form in all material

be  indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly presented in all material
respects  the financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as  of  the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations and cash  flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case
of unaudited statements,  to the absence of footnote disclosure and to normal

reference in the proxy statement relating to  the  Company Stockholders
Meeting (together with any amendments thereof or  supplements thereto, in
each case in the form or forms distributed to  the  Company's stockholders,
the " _Proxy  Statement_ ")  will,  at the date the Proxy Statement is
first distributed to the stockholders of  the  Company and at the time of
the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue  statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to  be  stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light  of  the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement 
will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the 
Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation or warranty 
is  made by the Company with respect to statements made or incorporated by
reference  in the Proxy Statement based on information supplied by Parent or
Merger Sub  specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Proxy Statement  or portions thereof that relate only to Parent and its

making any written communications or public  announcements to the directors,
officers or employees of the Company or any  of  its Subsidiaries pertaining
to compensation or benefit matters that are affected  by the transactions

of the intended communication, Parent shall have a reasonable  period of time
to review and comment on the communication, and Parent and the  Company shall
cooperate in providing any such mutually agreeable  communication.

 

 

(c) _Other  Actions_.  Except  as otherwise contemplated or permitted by
this Agreement, the Company and Parent  shall not, and shall not permit any

(d) _Advice  of Changes; Filings_.  Each of  the Company and Parent shall
as promptly as practicable advise the other party  in writing upon obtaining
Knowledge of (i) any representation or warranty  made by it (and, in the case
of Parent, made by Merger Sub) contained in this  Agreement that is qualified
as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect, as  the  case may be, becoming
untrue or inaccurate in any respect or any representation  or warranty that
is not so qualified becoming untrue or inaccurate in any  material respect or
(ii) the failure of it (and, in the case of Parent, of  Merger Sub) to comply
with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,  condition or agreement
to be complied with or satisfied by it under this  Agreement; _provided_ , 
_however_ ,  that no  such notification shall affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or  agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect

provide the other copies of all  filings made by such party with any

Parent to comply with this Section 5.1(d) shall not, in and of  itself,
result in a failure by Parent or Merger Sub to satisfy the conditions  set

5.2. _No  Solicitation by the Company_.

 

 

(a) From  the  date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time and the
termination of  this  Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, the Company agrees
that, neither it nor  any  of its Subsidiaries shall, nor shall it authorize
or permit any of its or their  respective directors, officers, employees or
any investment banker, financial  advisor, attorney, accountant or other
advisor, agent or representative of  the  Company or any Subsidiary
(collectively, " _Representatives_ ")  to,  directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate, cause, knowingly encourage  or knowingly facilitate, any
inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer  that constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Company Takeover Proposal  or (ii) participate
in any discussions  or negotiations regarding any Company Takeover Proposal,
or furnish to any  person any information in connection with or in
furtherance of, any Company  Takeover Proposal (it being understood that
providing non-public information  in  the ordinary course of business will
not, in and of itself, constitute a  violation of this Section 5.2(a)).
Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed  that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence  by  any Representative of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be a breach  of this Section
5.2(a) by the Company. The Company shall, and shall cause its  Subsidiaries
and instruct its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause  to  be
terminated all then-existing discussions or negotiations with any person 
conducted with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal and request the
prompt  return or destruction of all confidential information previously
furnished.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the
Company  Stockholder Approval (and in no event after obtaining such Company
Stockholder  Approval), in response to an unsolicited _bona  fide_  
written  Company Takeover Proposal made after the date hereof that the
Company Board  determines in good faith (after receiving the advice of a
financial advisor  of  nationally recognized reputation and its outside
counsel) constitutes or is  reasonably likely to constitute or result in a
Company Superior Proposal, the  Company may, if the Company Board determines
in good faith (after receiving  the  advice of its outside counsel) that
there is a reasonable probability that  the  failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties  to  the Company under
applicable Law, and subject to compliance with  Section 5.2(c) ****
(provided  that the Company shall be required to give **** Parent  at 
least 12 hours prior written notice of such determination), (A) furnish 
information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the person 
making such Company Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to 
an  Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_   that,  subject  to
the right of the Company to withhold information where such disclosure would 
contravene any applicable Law, all  such  information (to the extent that
such information has not been previously  provided or made available to
Parent) is provided or made available to Parent,  as the case may be, prior
to or substantially concurrently with or promptly  after the time it is
provided or made available to such person, as the case  may  be, and (B)
participate in discussions or negotiations with the person  making such
Company Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such  Company
Takeover Proposal.

 

 

For  the  purposes of this agreement, " _Acceptable  Confidentiality
Agreement_ " means  a  confidentiality agreement that contains provisions
that are no less favorable  in  the aggregate to the Company than those
contained in the Confidentiality  Agreement, provided, however, that an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement  may  include provisions that are less
favorable in the aggregate to the Company  than  those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, so long as the Company offers  to amend the
Confidentiality Agreements concurrently with execution of such  Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement to include substantially similar provisions  for
the benefit of the parties thereto.

 

 

For  purposes of this  Agreement, " _Company  Takeover Proposal_ " shall 
mean any inquiry, proposal or offer, whether or not conditional and whether 
or  not withdrawn, (a) for a merger, consolidation, dissolution, 
recapitalization or other business combination involving the Company,  (b)
for the issuance, in a single transaction or series of related  transactions,
of 20% or more of the equity securities of the Company as  consideration for
the assets or securities of another person or (c) to  acquire in any manner,
directly or indirectly, in a single transaction or series  of related
transactions, 20% or more of the equity securities of the Company  or 
assets (including equity securities of any Subsidiary of the Company) that 
represent 20% or more of the total consolidated assets of the Company, other 
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

For  purposes of this Agreement, " _Company  Superior Proposal_ " shall 
mean any _bona  fide_   written  offer made by a third party, that if
consummated would result in such person  (or  its stockholders) owning,
directly or indirectly, greater than 50% of the Shares  then outstanding (or
of the surviving entity in a merger or the direct or  indirect parent of the
surviving entity in a merger) or all or substantially  all  of the total
consolidated assets of the Company (i) on terms that the  Company Board
determines in good faith (after receiving the advice of a  financial advisor
of nationally recognized reputation and its outside counsel  and in light of
all relevant circumstances, including all the terms and  conditions of such
proposal and this Agreement) to be more favorable to the  Company or its
stockholders than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement  and (ii)
that is reasonably likely to be completed, taking into account any  financing
and approval requirements and all other legal, regulatory and other  aspects
of such proposal.

 

 

(b) Neither  the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A)
withdraw (or  modify in a manner materially adverse to Parent), or propose
publicly to  withdraw (or modify in a manner materially adverse to Parent),
the approval,  recommendation or declaration of advisability by such Company
Board or any  such  committee thereof of this Agreement or the Merger, (B)
fail to publicly confirm  its approval, recommendation and declaration of
advisability of this Agreement  and the Merger after receiving a request from
Parent to do so or  (C) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to
recommend, adopt or  approve, any Company Takeover Proposal (any action
described in this clause  (i) being referred to as a " _Company  Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ")  or  (ii) approve or recommend, or propose
publicly to approve or recommend, or  allow the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any  letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger  agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,  partnership agreement
or other similar agreement constituting a Company Takeover  Proposal (other
than (x) an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement pursuant to  Section 5.2(a)
or (y) concurrently with taking such action the Company  terminates this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e) and, at the time of such  termination,
pays the Termination Fee). Notwithstanding the foregoing,  the Company Board
may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and cancel  the Company
Stockholders Meeting:

 

 

(x)  if,  not  in connection with a Company Takeover Proposal, the Company
Board determines  in  good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside
counsel) that there is  a  reasonable probability that the failure to take
such action would be  inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company
under applicable Law;  or 

 

 

(y)  if  in  connection with a Company Takeover Proposal that the Company
Board determines  in  good faith (after receiving the advice of a financial
advisor of nationally  recognized reputation and of its and outside counsel)
constitutes a Company  Superior Proposal and the Company Board determines in
good faith (after  receiving the advice of its outside counsel) that there is
a reasonable  probability that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with  its  fiduciary duties to the Company under applicable
Law;

 

 

_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that no  Company Adverse Recommendation Change
may be made until three (3) business  days  after Parent's receipt of
written notice from the Company (an " _Adverse  Recommendation Notice_ ") 
advising Parent that the Company Board has determined:

 

 

(A) in  the  case of clause (x) of this Section 5.2(b), that the Company
Board intends to  make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change and
containing details of the  facts and conclusions that led the Company Board
to conclude that there is  a  reasonable probability that the failure to
take such action would be  inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
Company under applicable Law  together with copies of any relevant written
analyses or materials (it being  understood and agreed that any change to
such facts and conclusions shall  require a new Adverse Recommendation Notice
and a new three (3) business day  notice period). During such three (3)
business day period, the Company shall,  if  so requested by Parent,
negotiate in good faith with Parent with respect to  any  revised proposal
from Parent; provided that a determination by the Company  Board  that,
after taking into account any such changes, there continues to be a 
reasonable probability that the failure to make such Company Adverse 
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the 
Company under applicable Law shall not require a new Adverse Recommendation 
Notice or a new three (3) business day notice period; and

 

 

(B) in  the  case of clause (y) of this Section 5.2(b), that such Company
Takeover Proposal  constitutes a Company Superior Proposal, that the Company
Board intends to  make  such Company Adverse Recommendation Change and
containing all information  required by Section 5.2(c), together with copies
of any written offer or  proposal in respect of such Company Superior
Proposal (it being understood  and  agreed that any amendment to the
financial terms or other material terms of  such  Company Superior Proposal
shall require a new Adverse Recommendation Notice  and  a new three (3)
business day notice period). During  such three (3) business day period, the
Company  shall, if so requested by Parent, negotiate in good faith with
Parent with  respect to any revised proposal from Parent in respect of the
terms of the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In making a
determination that  a  Company Takeover Proposal constitutes a Company
Superior Proposal, the Company  Board shall take into account any changes to
the terms of this Agreement  proposed by Parent (in response to an Adverse
Recommendation Notice or  otherwise); _provided_   that a  determination by
the Company Board that, after taking into account any such  changes, a
Company Takeover Proposal continues to constitute a Company Superior 
Proposal shall not require a new Adverse Recommendation Notice or a new
three  (3) business day notice period.

 

 

(c) In  addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs
(a) and  (b) of this Section 5.2, the Company shall promptly, and in no event
later  than 48 hours after receipt, advise Parent in writing of any request
for  information or other inquiry that the Company reasonably believes could
lead  to  any Company Takeover Proposal, the terms and conditions of any
such request,  Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry (including any changes
thereto) and the  identity of the person making any such request, Company
Takeover Proposal or  inquiry. The Company shall (i) promptly keep Parent
reasonably informed of  the status and details (including any change to the
terms thereof) of any such  request, Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry and
(ii) provide Parent as  soon as practicable after receipt of delivery thereof
copies of any written  offer and any other material written material received
from the person making  such request (or its representatives) that describes
any of the terms or  conditions of any such request, in either case sent or
provided to the Company  or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to a Company
Takeover  Proposal.

 

 

(d) Nothing  contained in this Section 5.2  shall  prohibit the Company
from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a  position contemplated
by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of  Regulation M-A promulgated
under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any  required disclosure to the
stockholders of the Company if, in the good faith  judgment of the Company
Board (after receiving the advice of its outside  counsel), failure to so
disclose would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent  with its
obligations under applicable Law.

 

 

(e) Without  limiting any other rights of Parent under this Agreement,
neither any Company  Adverse Recommendation Change nor any termination of
this Agreement shall have  any effect on any of the approvals or other
actions referred to herein for  the  purpose of causing the Takeover Laws to
be inapplicable to this Agreement and  the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 

 

_ARTICLE  VI_

 

 

_Additional  Agreements_

(a) As  soon  as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company  shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy
Statement. The Company shall  respond promptly to any comments from the SEC
or the staff of the SEC on the  Proxy Statement. The Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts  to  cause the Proxy Statement to be
distributed to the stockholders of the Company  as promptly as reasonably
practicable. No filing of, or amendment or supplement  to, the Proxy
Statement will be made by the Company, without providing Parent  and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. If  at  any
time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the Company 
or  Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers,
should  be  discovered by the Company or Parent that should be set forth in
an amendment  or  supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that it would not
include any misstatement  of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the  statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made,  not misleading, the party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify  the other parties hereto and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing  such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent  required by Law, disseminated
to the stockholders of the Company. The Company  shall notify Parent promptly
of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or  the  staff of the SEC and of
any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for  amendments or supplements
to the Proxy Statement for additional information  and  shall supply Parent
with copies of all correspondence between the Company or  any  of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC,  on 
the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Merger. Parent
and  Merger Sub shall cooperate with the Company in connection with the
preparation  of the Proxy Statement, including promptly furnishing the
Company upon request  with any and all information as may be required to be
set forth in the Proxy  Statement under applicable Law.

 

 

(b) The  Company shall, as soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement,  establish a record date for and promptly take any and all actions
in connection  therewith, and duly call, give notice of, (subject to Section
5.2(d)) convene  and hold, a meeting of its stockholders (the " _Company 
Stockholders Meeting_ ")  solely  for the purpose of obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval. Except to the  extent that the Company has effected a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change  in  accordance with Section 5.2, the
Company shall, through the Company Board,  recommend to its stockholders
adoption of this Agreement, the Merger and the  other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

6.2. _Access  to Information; Confidentiality._

 

 

(a) The  Company shall afford to Parent, and its Representatives, reasonable
access  during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective
Time  or  the termination of this Agreement to all its and its Subsidiaries'
properties,  books, tax returns, contracts, commitments, personnel, records
and statutory  filings and, during such period, the Company shall furnish
promptly to Parent  (a) a copy of each report, schedule, registration
statement and other  document filed by the Company during such period
pursuant to the requirements  of  Federal or state securities and insurance
Laws and (b) consistent with its  legal obligations all other information
concerning the Company and its  Subsidiaries' business, properties and
personnel as Parent may reasonably  request; _provided_ ,  _however_ , 
that  (i) the Company may restrict the foregoing access to the extent that
any law,  treaty, rule or regulation of any Governmental Authority applicable
to the  Company requires the Company or its Subsidiaries to restrict access
to any  properties or information and (ii) the Buyer will not have access to
individual  performance or evaluation records, medical histories or other
information that  in the reasonable opinion of the Company is sensitive or
the disclosure of  which  could reasonably be expected to subject the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries  to risk of liability or information that
is subject to attorney-client privilege  or other privilege; _provided_ , 
_further_ ,  that  such access will be conducted at the Buyer's expense.
Except for disclosures  expressly permitted by the terms of the
confidentiality agreement, dated as  of  December 20, 2006, between Parent
and the Company (as it may be amended from  time to time, the "
_Confidentiality  Agreement_ "),  each  party shall hold, and shall cause
its Representatives to hold, all information  received from the other party,
directly or indirectly, in confidence in  accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement.  The  parties hereby agree that, notwithstanding anything the
contrary in the  Confidentiality Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement
shall survive the  execution of this Agreement.

 

 

(b) In  addition to and without limiting the foregoing, from the date hereof
until  the  Effective Time the Company shall furnish to Parent, within 20
business days  after the end of each month, the standard monthly reporting
package set forth  in  _Section 6.2(b)_  of the  Company Disclosure
Letter. The Company shall promptly notify Parent of any  written
communication received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from  a 
party to one of the customer Contracts required to be disclosed pursuant to 
Section 3.10(b) relating to any of the matters set forth in the last
sentence  of  Section 3.10(c).

 

 

6.3. _Reasonable  Best Efforts_. 

 

 

(a) Upon  the  terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, each of the  parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken,  all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with  the other parties in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to  consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable,  the  Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including  using reasonable best efforts to
accomplish  the following: (i) the taking of all acts necessary to cause the
conditions  to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable, (ii) the
obtaining  of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and
approvals from  Governmental Authorities and the making of all necessary
registrations and  filings (including filings with Governmental Authorities
and the Necessary  Consents) and the taking of all steps as may be necessary
to obtain an approval  or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by
any Governmental  Authority, (iii) the obtaining of all necessary consents,
approvals or  waivers from third parties and (iv) the execution and delivery
of any  additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated  by,  and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement.
In connection with  and  without limiting the first sentence of this Section
6.3(a), each of the  Company and the Company Board and Parent and the Parent
Board shall  (A) take all action reasonably necessary to ensure that no state
takeover  statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable
to this  Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
by this  Agreement and (B) if any state takeover statute or similar statute
becomes  applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, take all action reasonably
necessary to ensure  that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement may  be  consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated by this  Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of
such statute or regulation  on  this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this  Agreement.

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding  the foregoing or anything else to the contrary in this
Agreement:

 

 

(i) nothing  shall be deemed to require Parent to (1) agree to, or proffer
to, divest or  hold  separate any assets or any portion of any business of
Parent or any of its  Subsidiaries or, assuming the consummation of the
Merger, the Company or any  of  its Subsidiaries, (2) not compete in any
geographic area or line of business,  (3) restrict the manner in which, or
whether, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries  or, assuming the consummation of
the Merger, the Company, the Surviving Entity  or any of their respective
Affiliates may carry on business in any part of  the  world or restrict the
exercise of the full rights of ownership, (4) agree to  any  terms or
conditions that would impose any obligations on Parent or any of its 
Subsidiaries or, assuming the consummation of the Merger, the Company or any 
of  its Subsidiaries, to maintain facilities, operations, places of
business,  employment levels, products or businesses or any other
restriction, limitation  or qualification or (5) make any payments that, in
the case of any of clauses  (1) through (5), that, if implemented, would, or
would reasonably be expected  to, individually or when taken together with
any other actions of the type  described in clauses (1) through (5) above
imposed on the Company, Parent or  any  of their respective Subsidiaries,
have a Material Adverse Effect regardless  of  whether any such action would
individually have a Material Adverse Effect (each,  subject to Schedule
6.3(b), a " _Negative  Regulatory Action_ ");  provided that any actions of
the type described in clauses (1) through (5)  above  imposed on Parent or
its Subsidiaries  shall constitute a Negative Regulatory Action if such
action would, or would  reasonably be expected to, individually or when taken
together with any other  actions of the type described in clauses (1) through
(5) above imposed on the  Company, Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, have constituted a  Material Adverse Effect by reference to the
business, financial condition or  results of operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole;  and 

 

 

(ii) Parent  and Merger Sub shall be required to consent to any divestiture
or other  structural or conduct relief in order to obtain clearance from any
Governmental  Authority or to address any legal action brought by any third
party in  connection with the transaction relating to this Agreement to the
extent that  such divestiture or other structural or conduct relief or other
legal action,  if  implemented, would not, or would not reasonably be
expected to, individually  or  in the aggregate, result in a Negative
Regulatory Action.

 

 

(c) Each  of  the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to
(i) cooperate  in all respects with each other in connection with any filing
or submission  with  a Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger
and in connection with  any investigation, approval process or other inquiry
by or before a Governmental  Authority relating to the Merger, including any
proceeding initiated by a  private party, and (ii) keep the other party
informed in all material  respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any
material communication received  by such party from, or given by such party
to, the Federal Trade Commission,  the  Antitrust Division of the Department
of Justice or any other Governmental  Authority and of any material
communication received or given in connection  with  any proceeding by a
private party, in each case regarding the Merger. 

 

 

6.4. _Indemnification,  Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

 

(a) Without  limiting any additional rights that any Person may have under
any agreement  or  Company Plan, from and after the Effective Time, Parent
and the Surviving Entity  shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold
harmless each present (as of  the  Effective Time) and former officer,
director or employee of the Company and  its  Subsidiaries (the "
_Indemnified  Parties_ "),  against all claims, losses, liabilities,
damages, judgments, inquiries, fines  and reasonable fees, costs and
expenses, including attorneys' fees and  disbursements (collectively, "
_Costs_ "),  incurred in connection with any suits, claims, actions,
proceedings,  arbitrations, mediations or investigations, whether civil,
criminal,  administrative or investigative (each a " _Proceeding_ "), 
arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Party is or
was  an  officer, director, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or
its  Subsidiaries, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective  Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and the
Company's  Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws as at the date hereof. In the
event of  any  such Proceeding, each Indemnified Party will be entitled to
advancement of  expenses incurred in the defense of any Proceeding from
Parent or the Surviving  Entity within ten business  days of receipt by
Parent or the Surviving Entity from the Indemnified Party  of  a request
therefor to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 

 

(b) All  rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts
or omissions  occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (and rights for
advancement of  expenses) now existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as
provided in the  articles of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable
organizational documents)  of  the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in
each case, as in effect on the date  hereof) and any indemnification or other
agreements of the Company and its  Subsidiaries as in effect on the date
hereof shall be assumed by the Surviving  Entity in the Merger, without
further action, as of the Effective Time and  shall  survive the Merger and
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance  with their terms.
Further, the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the  Surviving Entity
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to  indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present  directors and
officers than are presently set forth in the Company's Articles of 
Incorporation and Bylaws, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or 
otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any 
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such
individuals  except as amendments may be required by applicable Law during
such  period.

 

 

(c) Promptly  after the Closing (and in any event within 30 days thereof),
Parent shall obtain  a six year "tail" insurance policy (the " _D andO  Tail
Policy_")  that  provides coverage on terms no less favorable than the
coverage provided under  the Company's directors' and officers' insurance
policy in effect on the date of  this Agreement for the Persons who are
covered by such policy on the date of  this Agreement for events occurring
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_   that  during the period from the
Closing to the time that the DandO Tail Policy is  in effect, Parent shall be
required to (or cause the Surviving Entity to)  maintain (without amendment
or modification) the Company's directors' and  officers' insurance policy in
effect as of the Closing Date (including, if  necessary, renewing such policy
and paying any premiums due under such  policy).

 

 

(d) The  covenants contained in this Section 6.4 are intended to be for the
benefit  of,  and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties
and their  respective heirs and legal representatives, and shall not be
deemed exclusive  of  any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is
entitled, whether pursuant  to  Law, contract or otherwise.

 

 

(e) In  the  event that Parent, the Surviving Entity or its successors or
assigns (i)  consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the  continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger  or  (ii) transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties
and assets to  any  Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision
shall be made so that  the  successors and assigns of Parent and/or the
Surviving Entity shall succeed  to  the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.4.

 

 

(f) Parent  shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, that  may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing
the indemnity and other  obligations provided in this Section 6.4.

 

 

6.5. _Fees  and Expenses_.  All  fees and expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement, the Merger and  the  other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be paid by the party  incurring such fees or expenses,
whether or not the Merger is consummated,  except that each of the Company
and Parent shall bear and pay one-half of the  filing fees for the premerger
notification and report forms under the HSR Act  and of all filing and
counsel fees relating to obtaining clearances from any  other Governmental
Authority.

 

 

6.6. _Stock  Exchange De-listing_.  Prior  to the Closing Date, the Company
shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable  best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to  be  done all things,
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under  applicable Laws
and rules and policies of the NYSE to enable the de-listing  by  the
Surviving Entity of the Shares from the NYSE and the deregistration of  the 
Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective 
Time.

 

 

6.7. _Public  Announcements_.  Parent  and the Company shall consult with
each other before issuing, and give each  other the reasonable opportunity to
review and comment upon, any press release  or other public statements with
respect to the transactions contemplated by  this  Agreement, including the
Merger, and shall not issue any such press release  or  make any such public
statement prior to such consultation, except as may be  required by
applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any  listing
agreement with any national securities exchange or national securities 
quotation system. The parties agree that the initial press release to be
issued  with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
be in  the  form heretofore agreed to by the parties.

 

 

6.8. _Stockholder  Litigation_.  The  Company shall promptly advise Parent
in writing of any stockholder litigation  against the Company and/or its
directors relating to this Agreement, the Merger  and/or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and shall keep Parent  reasonably informed
regarding any such stockholder litigation. The Company  shall  give Parent
the opportunity to consult with the Company regarding the defense  or 
settlement of any such stockholder litigation, shall give due consideration 
to  Parent's advice with respect to such stockholder litigation and shall not
settle  any such litigation prior to such consultation and consideration;
_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  the Company further will not, without
Parent's prior written consent (which  consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), settle any stockholder  litigation.

 

 

6.9. _Employee  Matters_.

 

 

(a) Until  the  first anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
to be provided  to  individuals who are employed by the Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately  prior to the Effective Time and who remain employed
with the Surviving Entity  or  any of Parent's Subsidiaries (the "
_Affected  Employees_ "),  compensation and employee benefits (other than
accruals of supplemental  executive retirement plan benefits for service
after the Effective Time), that  are, in the aggregate, no less favorable to
than the compensation and employee  benefits provided to such persons
immediately prior to the Effective Time.  Thereafter, Parent shall cause to
be provided to the Affected Employees (and  their dependents) compensation
and employee benefits that are no less favorable,  in the aggregate, than the
compensation and employee benefits provided  to similarly situated employees
of Parent and its  Subsidiaries.

 

 

(b) For  all  purposes, with respect to any benefit plan, program,
arrangement (including  any "employee benefit plan" (as defined in Section
3(3) of ERISA) and any  vacation program), other than under Parent's 2002
Stock Incentive Plan (or any  successor plan thereto), Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Entity  to,  recognize the service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the  Effective Time of the Affected
Employees for purposes of such plan, program  or  arrangement; _provided_
,  _however_ ,  that  such recognition shall not result in a duplication of
benefits.

 

 

(c) With  respect to any welfare plan in which employees of the Company and
its  Subsidiaries are eligible to participate after the Effective Time,
Parent shall,  and shall cause the Surviving Entity (i) to waive all
limitations as to  preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods
with respect to  participation and coverage requirements applicable to such
employees to the  extent such conditions were satisfied under the welfare
plans of the Company  and  its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and
(ii) provide each such employee  with credit for any co-payments and
deductibles paid prior to the Effective  Time  in satisfying any analogous
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements to the  extent applicable under any
such plan.

 

 

(d) Effective  on the business day immediately prior to the Closing Date (but
contingent on  the  occurrence of the Closing), the Company shall, if
requested to do so by Parent,  terminate its defined contribution 401(k)
plans. Parent shall provide, or cause  the Surviving Entity to provide, that
the Affected Employees are eligible to  participate in a tax-qualified,
defined contribution 401(k) plan immediately  following the Effective Time
and that such defined contribution plan shall  accept "eligible rollover
distributions" for Affected Employees from a  terminated Company defined
contribution 401(k) plan.

 

 

(e) Notwithstanding  anything in this Section 6.9 to the contrary, Parent
agrees that it shall,  or  shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i)
continue the Company's current  severance plans and policies without adverse
amendment or termination during  the  12 month period following the
Effective Time and (ii) pay the bonuses required  to be paid pursuant to the
bonus plan set forth on _Section  6.9(e)_   of the  Company Disclosure
Letter, in accordance with the terms of such  plan.

 

 

(f) Notwithstanding  the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall (1) be
treated as an  amendment of any particular Company Plan, (2) give any third
party any  right to enforce the provisions of this Section 6.9 or (3)
obligate  Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of their Affiliates to (i)
maintain any  particular Company Plan (other than as provided in Section
6.9(e)) or  (ii) retain the employment of any particular employee.

 

 

6.10. _Section  16 Matters_.  Prior  to the Effective Time, the Company
will take all such steps as may be required  to cause to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act any  dispositions of Shares
(including derivative securities with respect to Shares)  that are treated as
dispositions under such rule and result from the  transactions contemplated
by this Agreement by each director or officer of  the  Company who is
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the  Exchange Act
with respect to the Company.

 

 

6.11. _Standstill  Agreements, Confidentiality Agreements, Anti-takeover
Provisions_.  During  the period from the date of this Agreement through the
Effective Time, unless  the Company Board determines in good faith (after
receiving the advice of its  outside counsel) that there is a reasonable
probability that the failure to  take  such action would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties to the Company  under  applicable Law, the Company
(i) shall not terminate, amend, modify or waive  any  provision of any
standstill or similar agreement requiring a person not to  acquire the
Company's assets or securities to which it or any of its  Subsidiaries is a
party, other than the Confidentiality Agreement pursuant  to  its terms or
by written agreement of the parties thereto and (ii) shall enforce,  to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the provisions of any  such 
agreement, including by obtaining injunctions to prevent any material
breaches  of such agreements and to enforce specifically the material terms
and provisions  thereof in any court of the United States of America or of
any state having  jurisdiction; _provided_   that  this Section 6.11 shall
only apply with respect to agreements that were entered  into in respect of a
potential acquisition of the Company or any Subsidiary  thereof or a
potential business combination transaction between the Company  or  any
Subsidiary thereof and another Person.

 

 

6.12. _Cooperation_.  Each of  the Company and its Subsidiaries will, and
will cause each of its  Representatives to, use its commercially reasonable
efforts, subject to  applicable Laws, to cooperate with and assist Parent and
Merger Sub in  connection with planning the integration of the Company and
its Subsidiaries  and  their respective employees with the business
operations of Parent and its  Subsidiaries.

 

 

6.13. _Credit  Agreement_.

 

 

(a) The  Company shall terminate (which termination will be effective as of
the  Effective Time) the Credit Agreement, dated as of March 3, 2003 (as it
may  have  been amended or modified from time to time), among the Company,
Bank of America  N.A., the other lenders party thereto, Credit Lyonnais New
York Branch (as  syndication agent), U.S. Bank National Association (as
documentation agent)  and  Banc of  America Securities LLC (as sole lead
arranger and sole book manager) (the " _Credit  Agreement_ ")  (or to 
such other person as such lender shall designate to Parent and the Company 
in  writing), without penalty or expense to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries  other than those penalties or expenses expressly provided for
in the Credit  Agreement, if any, and shall pay to the lender under the
Credit Agreement any  and all amounts then due and payable by the Company or
any  of its Subsidiaries under the Credit Agreement (such amounts in  the
aggregate, the " _Payoff  Amount_ ").  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event that the amount of cash and cash  equivalents held by the Company and
its Subsidiaries, in the aggregate,  immediately prior to the Closing that
are reasonably available (as reasonably  determined by the Company's
management) to pay the Payoff Amount are less than  the Payoff Amount, then
(i) immediately prior to the Closing, the Company will  pay any portion of
the Payoff Amount for which it has available cash and (ii)  simultaneously
with the Closing, Parent will pay (on behalf of the Company  and  its
Subsidiaries) any portion of the Payoff Amount that was not paid by the 
Company. No later than two business days prior to the Closing, the Company 
shall  provide Parent with written notice of any amounts it expects that
Parent will  need to pay pursuant to the preceding sentence.

 

 

(b) In  connection with the termination of the Credit Agreement and the
payment by  the Company or its designee contemplated by Section 6.13(a), the
Company shall  obtain from the lender under the Credit Agreement evidence in
writing that  the  Credit Agreement has been terminated and that there are
then and thereafter  will  be no amounts due and payable under the Credit
Agreement.

aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect  and (ii) set forth in Section 3.3(a),
the first four sentences of Section  3.3(b), the first two sentences of

shall have received  a certificate signed on behalf of Parent by an executive
officer of Parent  to  such effect.

 

 

(b) _Performance  of Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub_.  Parent  and

7.1(b),  (c) or (d) shall not have been satisfied because of action by a
Governmental  Authority seeking to restrain, enjoin or prohibit the Merger
but all other  conditions to Closing shall have been satisfied (or in the
case of conditions  that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing,
shall be capable of  being satisfied on such date), then the Termination Date
shall automatically  be  extended to March 11, 2008; _provided_ , 
_further_ ,  that  the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
8.1(b)(i) shall  not be available to any party whose action not in accordance
with the terms  of  this Agreement or failure to act in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement  has been a principal cause of or resulted in the
failure of the Merger to be  consummated on or before such date;

 

 

(ii) if  any  Restraint having the effect of permanently restraining,
enjoining, or otherwise  prohibiting the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement  shall  be in effect and shall have become
final and nonappealable; or

 

 

(iii) if  the  Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at
the Company  Stockholders Meeting duly convened therefor or at any
adjournment or  postponement thereof;

 

 

(c) by  Parent, if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any
of its  representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in
this  Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to
the  failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) or (b) and (B) is 
incapable of being cured, or is not cured, by the Company within 30 calendar 
days following receipt of written notice from Parent of such breach or
failure  to perform;

 

 

(d) by  the  Company, if Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed
to perform any  of  their respective representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements set forth  in this Agreement, which breach or failure to

by Parent or Merger Sub  within 30 calendar days following receipt of written
notice from the Company  of  such breach or failure to perform; or

 

 

(e) by  Parent  or the Company, if a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
shall have  occurred.

 

 

Notwithstanding  the foregoing, (x) Parent may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section  8.1, if, at the time of such termination, Parent and
Merger Sub shall be in  breach or shall have failed to perform any of their
respective representations,  warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement, which breach  or  failure to perform would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth  in  Section 7.3(a) or (b) and (y) the
Company may not terminate this Agreement  pursuant to Section 8.1, if, at the
time of such termination, the Company shall  be in breach or shall have
failed to perform any of its representations,  warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach  or  failure to perform
would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth  in  Section 7.2(a)
or (b).

satisfied;

 

 

then  Parent shall pay the Company, within ten business days after the date
of such  termination, a fee equal to $25,000,000 (the " _Parent  Termination
Fee_ ")  by  wire transfer of same-day funds. The payment by Parent of a
Parent Termination  Fee, if applicable, will be considered liquidated damages
for any breach by  Parent or Merger Sub of this Agreement and in the event of
such payment none  of  Parent any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates

Agreement by either the Company or Parent as  provided in Section 8.1, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and  have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of Parent,  Merger Sub or the Company,
other than the provisions of the last two sentences  of Section 6.2(a),
Sections 6.5 and 8.2, this Section 8.3 and Article  IX,  which  provisions
shall survive such termination; _provided_   that,  except as provided in
the last sentence of Section 8.2(a), nothing herein shall  relieve any party
from any liability for any willful breach of this  Agreement.

 

 

8.4. _Amendment_.  This  Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at
any time before or after  receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval;

signed on behalf of each of the parties  hereto.

 

 

8.5. _Extension;  Waiver_.  At any  time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties may (a) extend the time for  the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties,  (b) waive any inaccuracies
in the representations and warranties contained  herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto or (c) subject to the  proviso to the first
sentence of Section 8.4, waive compliance with any of  the agreements or

Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise 
shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

assigns.

 

 

9.9. _Specific  Enforcement; Consent to Jurisdiction_.  The  parties agree

otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled  to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to  enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this

for  the Southern District of New York or any state court in New York County,
New  York.

 

 

9.10. _Severability_.  If any  term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable  of  being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other conditions and  provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect.  Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal  or  incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith  to  modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as  closely as
possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an  acceptable
manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are  fulfilled to
the extent possible.

 

 

 

IN  WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have caused this
Agreement  to be signed by their respective officers thereunto duly
authorized, all as  of  the date first written above.
