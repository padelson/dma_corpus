Unaffiliated Firm or otherwise communicate with the Unaffiliated Firm, and in no event will either Party (i)&nbsp;communicate (or permit any of its Affiliates or Representatives to communicate) with the Unaffiliated Firm without providing the other

provided to the other Party. Either Party may make a written request for a hearing with the Unaffiliated Firm by delivering notice to the other Party and the Unaffiliated Firm within 15&nbsp;days after the submission of rebuttals by the Parties.
Within 30&nbsp;days of such written request, the Unaffiliated Firm shall hold a joint hearing, in person or by teleconference, at which each Party shall be entitled to make an oral presentation and rebuttal. The Unaffiliated Firm shall have

whether the statements of Proposed Adjusted Net Working Capital Amount were prepared in accordance with the terms of Section&nbsp;3.04(b) with respect to the individual items on the statements of Proposed Adjusted Net Working Capital Amount in
dispute (it being understood that the Unaffiliated Firm will have no authority to make any adjustments to any SG Financial Statements or amounts other than the statements of Proposed Adjusted Net Working Capital Amount and/or Proposed Adjusted Net
Debt Amount and amounts set forth therein that are in dispute). In resolving any disputed item with a positive value, the Unaffiliated Firm may not assign a value to such item greater than the greatest value for such item asserted by either Party
or, in respect of items with a negative value, less than the smallest value for such item asserted by either Party. The determination of the Unaffiliated Firm in respect of the correctness of each matter remaining in dispute in accordance with this
