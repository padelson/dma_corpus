DEFINITIONS

Section 1.01  _Definitions_. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall
have the meanings specified in _Exhibit A_ or elsewhere in this Agreement.

PRE-CLOSING TRANSACTIONS

Section 2.01 _Purchase and Sale_. On the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date, Saint-Gobain shall (or shall
cause the applicable Subsidiary Transferor to) sell, convey, assign, transfer
and deliver to the applicable Purchasing Company, and Owens Corning shall (or

transfers shall occur in the order as specified on _Exhibit B_ attached
hereto.

Section 2.02 _Purchase Price; Allocation of Purchase Price_.

(a) The aggregate purchase price (the " _Purchase Price_ ") for the Purchased
Assets and for the covenant respecting non-competition set forth in Section

Purchase Price (as adjusted pursuant to paragraph (b) above, if applicable)
shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Johnson Matthey Value of platinum
and/or rhodium (as applicable) on the second Business Day prior to the
Closing Date multiplied by the shortfall of platinum and/or rhodium (as
applicable); _provided_ , that in lieu of a cash adjustment, Saint-Gobain and
its Affiliates may physically deliver at Closing to Owens Corning or its
Subsidiaries additional platinum or rhodium to cover any shortfall of the
other Metal using the Johnson Matthey Value of platinum and/or rhodium (as
applicable) on the second Business Day prior to the Closing Date. 

Section 2.03 _Saint-Gobain Pre-Closing Reorganization_.

(a) Saint-Gobain shall take or cause to be taken all actions necessary to

in Saint-Gobains Business and all SG Employees and all SG Acquired Assets and
related SG Assumed Liabilities will be held (or employed, as applicable) by
SG Acquired Subsidiaries. In connection with the foregoing, with respect to SG
Acquired Assets, prior to the Closing Date, Saint-Gobain shall, and shall
cause its Asset Transferors to contribute all SG Acquired Assets located
outside the United States (if any) to newly formed or existing, direct or
indirect, Subsidiaries of Saint-Gobain which are or shall be SG Acquired
Subsidiaries organized in the jurisdiction of the location of such assets and
which are or shall be engaged exclusively in Saint-Gobains Business (each
such Subsidiary to be a partnership or disregarded entity for United States
federal income tax purposes, except any such Subsidiary for which an election
to be so treated is not then permitted and which is subject to the procedures
provided in the last sentence of Section 6.05(c) of this Agreement). In no
event shall Saint-Gobain deviate from the steps outlined on _Exhibit C_ 
part II to the extent that the aggregate affect of all such deviations shall
have an adverse impact which is material on Owens Corning.

(b) In connection with the contribution of SG Acquired Assets described in
clause (a), the applicable Subsidiaries receiving such contributions (the "
_SG Reorganized Subsidiaries_ ") shall assume and agree to pay, satisfy and
discharge the SG Assumed Liabilities exclusively related to the SG Acquired
Assets it received pursuant to clause (a).

Section 2.04 _Reorganization of SG Excluded Assets_. Notwithstanding any other
provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the Parties expressly understand
and agree that the  



 

3  SG Excluded Assets shall be retained by Saint-Gobain (and/or its Affiliates
other than the SG Acquired Subsidiaries), as applicable, and, as applicable,
shall be excluded from the SG Acquired Assets and transferred out of the SG
Acquired Subsidiaries prior to the Closing.

Section 3.03 [Intentionally Omitted.]

 

Section 3.04 _Net Working Capital/Net Debt Amounts_.

(a) Promptly following the Closing Date, but in no event later than 90 days
after the Closing Date, Saint-Gobain shall at its expense, and with the
reasonable assistance and cooperation of the SG Acquired Subsidiaries
(including reasonable access to the relevant information where such
information is located) during normal business hours without unreasonably
interfering with the operations of the SG Acquired Subsidiaries, prepare and
submit to Owens Corning and the Review Firm (i) the unaudited consolidating
balance sheet of its Business being acquired pursuant to this Agreement as of
the close of business on the day prior to the Closing Date (prepared in all
material respects in accordance with IFRS, presenting fairly, in all material
respects, the assets, liabilities, financial condition and the results of
operation of such Business and, to the extent not in conflict with IFRS,
prepared in accordance with the accounting principles, policies, practices,
methods and procedures (including any procedures relating to applicable
exchange rates) used in calculating Saint-Gobains SG Reference Date Balance
Sheet) and applied on a consistent basis and (ii) a statement setting forth,
in reasonable detail, Saint-Gobains calculation of (x) its Net Working
Capital (the  



 

4  " _Proposed Adjusted Net Working Capital Amount_ ") and (y) its Net Debt
(the " _Proposed Adjusted Net Debt Amount_ "), in each case as of the close
of business on the day prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that for the purpose of calculating the Proposed Adjusted Net Debt Amount, the
proceeds to be received by Saint-Gobain Vetrotex France and Saint-Gobain
Vetrotex International in accordance with _Exhibit B_ for the sale of the SG
Acquired Intellectual Property and the SG Acquired Subsidiaries listed in
_Schedule 3.04(a)_ shall be taken into account in the calculation of the
Adjusted Net Debt Amount without giving effect to the reduction of any
indebtedness for borrowed money resulting from the use of such proceeds and
only to the extent such proceeds are not distributed to any Saint Gobain
Affiliate that is not a SG Acquired Subsidiary other than in connection with
the repayment of indebtedness for borrowed money. Owens Corning shall make
available to Saint-Gobain all books, records, documents and other papers of
Saint-Gobains Business where located as reasonably required by Saint-Gobain
to prepare its calculation of the Proposed Adjusted Net Working Capital Amount
and the Proposed Adjusted Net Debt Amount. The Review Firm shall have 45 days
following such submission to review the consolidating balance sheet solely
for the purpose of providing an "agreed upon procedures opinion" in respect of
the Proposed Adjusted Net Working Capital Amount and the proposed Adjusted Net
Debt Amount, which procedures shall be agreed by the Parties in respect of
the Proposed Adjusted Net Working Capital Amount and the Proposed Adjusted Net
Debt Amount, which shall be submitted to the Parties on the 45th day following
submission to the Review Firm. In the event Owens Corning disputes
the correctness of the Proposed Adjusted Net Working Capital Amount and/or
Proposed Adjusted Net Debt Amount, Owens Corning shall notify Saint-Gobain in
writing of its objections within 30 days after receipt of the Review Firms
opinion and shall set forth, in writing and in reasonable detail, the reasons
for its objections. To be assertable, an objection by Owens Corning with
respect to any individual item in respect of the Proposed Adjusted Net Working
Capital Amount (it being understood that, for purposes of clarification and
not by way of limitation, a method of valuation or the application of an
accounting principle used in the preparation of the Proposed Adjusted Net
Working Capital Amount shall be deemed a separate "item" for purposes of this
Section 3.04(a)) (i) must assert that the item was not prepared in accordance
with Section 3.04(b); (ii) must set forth Owens Cornings determination of the
value for such item (provided that Saint-Gobain shall have made available
sufficient information to make such determination of value), and (iii) the
difference in Owens Cornings determination of all items disputed must exceed
USD 100,000 in the aggregate. To the extent Owens Corning does not so object,
in writing and in reasonable detail as required and within the time period
contemplated by this Section 3.04(a), Owens Corning shall be deemed to have
accepted Saint-Gobains calculation and presentation in respect of the
matters not subject to objection and such matters shall not be considered to
be in dispute. The Parties shall endeavor in good faith to resolve any
disputed matters within 15 days after the date on which the notice of
objections was delivered. If the Parties are unable to resolve the disputed
matters, they shall engage Grant Thornton LLP, London office or, in the event
Grant Thornton LLP is conflicted, an internationally known independent
accounting firm reasonably acceptable to each Party (Grant Thornton LLP or
such other accounting firm, as the case may be, the " _Unaffiliated Firm_ "),
to resolve the matters in dispute (in accordance with Section 3.04(b) and
consistent, to the extent possible, with any matters not in dispute). The
Parties shall jointly engage the Unaffiliated Firm. Promptly after such
engagement of the Unaffiliated Firm, the Parties will provide the
Unaffiliated Firm with a copy of this Agreement, the SG Financial Statements,
the statements of Proposed Adjusted Net Working Capital Amount and/or Proposed
 



 

5  Adjusted Net Debt Amount, as applicable, and any written notices of
objections related thereto. Each Party shall deliver to the Unaffiliated Firm
a written submission of its position with respect to the matters in dispute,
which submissions shall be delivered by each Party to the Unaffiliated Firm
and to the other Party simultaneously within 15 days of the engagement of such
Unaffiliated Firm. Each Party shall thereafter be entitled to submit a
rebuttal to the other Partys submission, which rebuttals shall be delivered
to the Unaffiliated Firm and to the other Party simultaneously within 30 days
of the delivery of the Parties initial submissions. The Unaffiliated Firm
may request additional information from either Party, but absent such a
request neither Party may make (nor permit any of its Affiliates or
Representatives to make) any additional submission to the Unaffiliated Firm
or otherwise communicate with the Unaffiliated Firm, and in no event will
either Party (i) communicate (or permit any of its Affiliates or
Representatives to communicate) with the Unaffiliated Firm without providing
the other Party a reasonable opportunity to participate in such communication
or (ii) make (or permit any of its Affiliates or Representatives to make) a
written submission to the Unaffiliated Firm unless a copy of such submission
is simultaneously provided to the other Party. Either Party may make a
written request for a hearing with the Unaffiliated Firm by delivering notice
to the other Party and the Unaffiliated Firm within 15 days after the
submission of rebuttals by the Parties. Within 30 days of such written
request, the Unaffiliated Firm shall hold a joint hearing, in person or by
teleconference, at which each Party shall be entitled to make an oral
presentation and rebuttal. The Unaffiliated Firm shall have 30 days from the
date of such hearing (or, if no such hearing is requested, from the date of
submission of written rebuttals) to review the documents provided to it
pursuant to this Section 3.04(a) and deliver its written determination with
respect to each of the adjustments in dispute submitted to it for resolution.
The Unaffiliated Firm shall resolve the differences regarding the statement of
Proposed Adjusted Net Working Capital Amount and/or Proposed Adjusted Net Debt
Amount based solely on the information provided to the Unaffiliated Firm by
the Parties pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (and not by independent
review). The Unaffiliated Firms authority will be limited to resolving
disputes with respect to whether the statements of Proposed Adjusted Net
Working Capital Amount were prepared in accordance with the terms of Section
3.04(b) with respect to the individual items on the statements of Proposed
Adjusted Net Working Capital Amount in dispute (it being understood that the
Unaffiliated Firm will have no authority to make any adjustments to any SG
Financial Statements or amounts other than the statements of Proposed Adjusted
Net Working Capital Amount and/or Proposed Adjusted Net Debt Amount and
amounts set forth therein that are in dispute). In resolving any disputed item
with a positive value, the Unaffiliated Firm may not assign a value to such
item greater than the greatest value for such item asserted by either
Party or, in respect of items with a negative value, less than the smallest
value for such item asserted by either Party. The determination of the
Unaffiliated Firm in respect of the correctness of each matter remaining in
dispute in accordance with this Section 3.04(a) shall be conclusive and
binding, in the absence of fraud or manifest error, on the Parties and
judgment may be entered thereon as an arbitration award in any court of
competent jurisdiction. The Net Working Capital as of the close of business
on the day prior to the Closing Date, as finally determined pursuant to this
Section 3.04(a), is referred to herein as the " _Adjusted Net Working Capital
Amount_ ". The Net Debt as of the close of business on the day prior to the
Closing Date (but taking into account the proceeds to be received by Saint-
Gobain Vetrotex France and Saint-Gobain Vetrotex International in accordance
with _Exhibit B_ for the sale of the SG Acquired Intellectual Property and
the SG Acquired Subsidiaries listed on _Schedule 3.04(a))_ without giving
effect to the  



 

6  reduction of any indebtedness for borrowed money resulting from the use of
such proceeds and only to the extent such proceeds are not distributed to
any Saint Gobain Affiliate that is not a SG Acquired Subsidiary other than in
connection with the repayment of indebtedness for borrowed money, as finally
determined pursuant to this Section 3.04(a), is referred to herein as the "
_Adjusted Net Debt Amount_ ".

(b) The Adjusted Net Working Capital Amount and the Adjusted Net Debt Amount
shall be expressed in USD, using the USD/EUR European Central Bank rate as of
the Closing Date.

(c) The Proposed Adjusted Net Working Capital Amount shall be determined
in accordance with the accounting principles, policies, practices, methods
and procedures used in calculating the Working Capital Threshold Amount.

(d) Subject to any applicable privileges (including the attorney-client
privilege), Saint-Gobain shall make available to Owens Corning and, upon
reasonable request, to the Unaffiliated Firm, the books, records, documents
and work papers underlying the preparation of the SG Financial Statements and
the calculations of the Proposed Adjusted Net Working Capital Amount and
Proposed Adjusted Net Debt Amount and the relevant personnel of Saint-Gobain
or its Affiliates.

(e) The fees and expenses, if any, of the Unaffiliated Firm shall be shared by
the Parties in inverse proportion to their respective success on the merits
and such allocation of fees and expenses shall be calculated by the
Unaffiliated Firm and shall be conclusive and binding on the Parties.

Section 3.05 _Adjustment to Purchase Price_.

(a) If the SG Total Adjustment, as finally determined, is negative, then
on the Adjustment Closing Date Saint-Gobain shall pay to European Owens
Corning Fiberglass S.P.R.L. the amount of the SG Total Adjustment as if such
amount was a positive number together with interest from the date of the
Closing Date until payment in full at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 30 basis
points.

(b) If the SG Total Adjustment, as finally determined, is positive, then on
the Adjustment Closing Date Owens Corning shall cause European Owens Corning
Fiberglass S.P.R.L. to pay to Saint-Gobain the amount of the SG Total
Adjustment together with interest from the date of the Closing Date until
payment in full at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 30 basis points.

(c) All amounts to be paid pursuant to this Section 3.05 shall be paid on the
Adjustment Closing Date in immediately available funds by wire transfer to a
bank account designated in writing by the payee to the payor at least three
Business Days prior to the Adjustment Closing Date.

Section 3.06 _Assignment of Contracts and Rights_. Anything in this Agreement
to the contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement (including the reorganization
contemplated in Article II) shall not constitute an agreement to contribute or
otherwise sell, convey, transfer,  



 

7  assign or sublicense any Contract, license or permit constituting an SG
Acquired Asset, or any claim, right or benefit arising thereunder or
resulting therefrom, or to enter into any other agreement or arrangement with
respect thereto, if an attempted assignment, sale, conveyance, sublicense or
transfer thereof, or entering into any such agreement or arrangement, without
the consent of a third party, would constitute a breach of, or other
contravention under, any agreement to which Saint-Gobain, or its Asset
Transferors, is a party, be ineffective with respect to any party thereto or
in any way adversely affect the rights of either Party, an Asset Transferor,
or the transferee thereunder. With respect to any such Contract, license or
permit or any claim, right or benefit arising thereunder or resulting
therefrom, promptly after the date hereof, the Parties will use
reasonable commercial efforts (but without any payment of money or other
transfer of value by either Party or any of their respective Affiliates to any
third party) to obtain any required consent for the assignment, transfer or
sublicense of any such Contract, license or permit to Owens Corning or the
applicable Acquired Subsidiary, or written confirmation reasonably
satisfactory in form and substance to the Parties confirming that such consent
is not required. Except with respect to the leases of Metal used in Saint-
Gobains Business, if a required consent is not obtained with respect to any
such Contract, license or permit (a "Consent Failure"), Saint-Gobain and its
Asset Transferors will cooperate in a mutually agreeable arrangement under
which Owens Corning would obtain the benefits thereunder in accordance with
this Agreement, including subcontracting or subleasing to Owens Corning or to
its applicable Affiliate, subject to Applicable Law and the terms of any
such Contract, license or permit, with Owens Corning or its applicable
Affiliate obtaining the claims, rights and benefits of Saint-Gobain, or its
Asset Transferors, and assuming the obligations under such Contract, license
or permit in accordance with this Agreement, and Saint-Gobain, or its Asset
Transferors, will enforce at the request of and for the benefit of Owens
Corning or its applicable Affiliate, with Owens Corning or its applicable
Affiliate assuming Saint-Gobains, or its Asset Transferors, obligations, any
and all claims, rights and benefits of Saint-Gobain, or its Asset Transferors,
against any third party thereto arising from any such Contract, license or
permit (including the right to elect to terminate such Contract in accordance
with the terms thereof upon the request of Owens Corning). If any Consent
Failure occurs and Saint-Gobain, or its Asset Transferors, and Owens Corning
or its applicable Affiliate have failed to have entered into an arrangement
to provide to Owens Corning or its applicable Affiliate the benefits under
the relevant Contract, license or permit, Saint-Gobain and Owens Corning shall
cooperate following the Closing to obtain such consent or enter into an
agreement with respect thereto as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter.

34 (b) Owens Corning undertakes that, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Closing Date and in any event within six (6) months afterwards, the name of
any SG Acquired Subsidiaries which consists of or incorporates any of the
Saint-Gobain or Vetrotex names, or anything that is substantially or
confusingly similar to any of these names, is changed to a name which does
not include any of these names.

(c) For a maximum of twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, Saint-
Gobain and its Affiliates shall redirect internet traffic relating to the
Business from their websites to websites of Owens Corning by (i) maintaining a
reasonable number of existing links on mutually agreed pages of the
website(s) of Saint-Gobain and its Affiliates to website(s) of SG Acquired
Subsidiaries and (ii) redirecting mutually agreed links to such mutually
agreed URL(s) within the website(s) of Owens Corning.

(d) Within three (3) months after the Closing Date, Saint-Gobain shall deliver
to the SG Acquired Subsidiaries all the Know How included in the SG RandC
Intellectual Property (for purposes of this Section 5.10, " _Know How
Material_ ") which is not in place on the Closing Date at the facilities to be
acquired by Owens Corning pursuant to this Agreement (for purposes of
this Section 5.10, " _Acquired Manufacturing Facilities_ "). Should Owens
Corning, or Saint-Gobain subsequently determine that the SG Acquired
Subsidiaries have not received any Know How Material, Saint-Gobain shall
promptly deliver to Owens Corning such Know How Material.

(e) Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, Saint-Gobain shall transfer, or
cause to be transferred, promptly after Closing, to Owens Corning or its
designee, the documents (including but not limited to patent and trademark
files and agreements) that are not held by an SG Acquired Subsidiary,
associated with the SG Third Party Intellectual Property or the SG Acquired
Intellectual Property.

(f) Saint-Gobain and/or any of its Affiliates shall take all necessary steps
to remove, and Owens Corning and/or its Affiliates shall take the steps set
forth in (g) and (h) to permit to be removed, from the Acquired Manufacturing
Facilities any materials or part of materials relating to the
Intellectual Property of Saint-Gobain or its Affiliates other than the SG RandC
Intellectual Property, the SG Third Party Intellectual Property and the SG
Licensed Intellectual Property (" _Excluded Technology_ ") in tangible form,
including any materials prepared by hand, with all copies of the above, and
all physical assets or part of physical assets in the possession or control of
Owens Corning and/or its Affiliates that describe, discuss, incorporate,
embody or reveal any, but only, Excluded Technology (" _Excluded Materials_
"). Excluded Materials shall include, but shall not be limited to, research
reports, engineering reports, manufacturing reports, research or development
documents of any kind, market studies, batch books, files, notes, letters,
studies, computer data or backups and other documents and equipment.

(g) In relation to Saint-Gobain Vetrotex International (Chambery, France),
Vado Ligure (Italy), Changzhou (Peoples Republic of China) and Gunsan (Korea)
(collectively " _Carve-out Facilities_ "), Saint-Gobain or its Affiliates
shall use best efforts to remove all Excluded Material from such Carve-out
Facilities prior to Closing; provided, however, that for a period of six (6)
months from the Closing Date, Saint-Gobain or its Affiliates may, in  



 

35  collaboration with Owens Corning and/or its Affiliates, conduct one
inspection of each such Carve-out Facility, of reasonable scope and duration,
for Excluded Materials to identify any such Excluded Materials and thereafter
to remove from the Carve-out Facilities any such Excluded Materials remaining
in such Carve-out Facilities. Owens Corning and its Affiliates shall permit
Saint-Gobain reasonable access to such facilities, during normal business
hours, to conduct such inspections and removal.

(h) In relation to the Acquired Manufacturing Facilities pursuant to this
Agreement other than the Carve-out Facilities, as and when Owens Corning,
and/or its Affiliates discover any Excluded Materials at any such facility,
such entity shall promptly notify Saint-Gobain of such Excluded Materials and
shall make reasonable arrangements for Saint-Gobain to remove such Excluded
Materials.

(i) For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that indemnification
provisions in this Agreement shall not be limited by any disclaimers or
limitations of liability in the SG Intellectual Property License Agreements.

(j) Owens Corning acknowledges (i) that some of the SG RandC Intellectual
Property and SG Licensed Intellectual Property has been licensed to Saint-
Gobain Vetrotex America, Inc. for use in its Wichita Falls facility; (ii) that
if Saint-Gobain Vetrotex America, Inc. were to sell its Wichita Falls
facility, such licenses may be assigned to the purchaser of the Wichita Falls
facility without the consent of Owens Corning; (iii) to have been provided
with copies of the execution versions of any such license agreements; and (iv)
any such license agreement that licenses rights in the SG RandC Intellectual
Property shall be assigned to US IP Holdco and/or Non-US IP Holdco, as
appropriate.

(k) Saint-Gobain hereby covenants, for a period of four years following the
Closing Date, to use its best efforts to convince its then current Affiliates
to enter into a good faith negotiation with Owens Corning, and reasonably
facilitate such negotiation, for the grant of a license on royalty-bearing
and commercially reasonable terms in respect of any Intellectual Property of
the Affiliates that may be necessary to develop, manufacture, use, market,
distribute and sell Business Products.

(l) Attached in _Exhibit H-2A_ are lists of Saint-Gobains invention
disclosure records,  _enveloppes Soleau_  and unpublished patent
applications. Saint-Gobain shall provide electronic copies of the items listed

(5) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, for reference by such
Owens Corning legal and technical personnel as agreed by the Parties. Prior to
Closing, the Parties shall discuss in good faith the appropriate allocation of
the items on these Exhibits between SG RandC Intellectual Property and
SG Licensed Intellectual Property. The Parties shall also discuss in good
faith the appropriate allocation of the patents listed in _Exhibit H-2B_
between SG RandC Intellectual Property and SG Licensed Intellectual Property.
Owens Corning shall reimburse Saint-Gobain for the annuity and late payment
fees specified in _Exhibit H-2B_ for patents listed in _Exhibit F-2B_ that are
agreed to be SG RandC Intellectual Property. Owens Corning shall also reimburse
Saint-Gobain for the annuity and late payment fees identified in _Exhibit
H-2C_.



 

36 (m) Attached in _Exhibit H-3_ is a list of Saint-Gobains joint development
agreements. Attached in _Exhibit H-4_ are lists of Saint-Gobains legal
opinions. Saint-Gobain shall provide electronic copies of the items listed on

five (5) Business Days after the date of this Agreement for reference by such
Owens Corning legal personnel, and in the case of the items listed in _Exhibit
H-3_ , by such Owens Corning technical personnel, as agreed by the Parties.
Prior to Closing, the Parties shall discuss in good faith how to address (i)
any limitations on the rights of Owens Corning to the SG RandC Intellectual
Property, the SG Third Party Intellectual Property, and/or the SG Licensed
Intellectual Property that are imposed by Saint-Gobains joint development
agreements and/or (ii) any risks posed by any third party Intellectual
Property that is the subject of any legal opinion listed in _Exhibit H-4_
that may arise from the manufacture, use, or sale of Business Products as
manufactured, used, or sold in Saint-Gobains Business as conducted on or
before the Closing Date.

(n) For each patent and patent application listed on _Schedule A-4_ and
listed on the lists attached to _Exhibits T-1 and T-2_ for which the deadline
for claiming filing priority under the Paris Convention occurs between the
date of this Agreement and Closing, (i) Saint-Gobain shall file an application
under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (" _PCT_ ") without limit on designated
countries, and (ii) at least five (5) Business Days before any such final
deadline, Owens Corning shall notify Saint-Gobain of the non-PCT country(ies)
and/or region(s), if any, where it reasonably wishes counterpart
application(s) claiming filing priority from each such application to be
filed.

(o) For each patent and patent application listed on _Schedule A-4_ and
listed on the lists attached to  _Exhibits T-1 and T-2_ for which the
deadline for filing national stage applications based on any application under
the PCT occurs between the date of this Agreement and Closing, Owens Corning
shall, at least five (5) Business Days before any such final deadline, notify
Saint-Gobain of the PCT country(ies) where it reasonably wishes national stage
applications based on such PCT application to be filed.

(p) Saint-Gobain undertakes to, or cause its Affiliates to, file the patent
applications in the country(ies) or region(s) indicated by Owens
Corning pursuant to (n) and (o) above, with Saint-Gobain bearing its own
costs.

(q) Owens Corning, at its option, may undertake to apply for trademark
registrations for (1) an "OCV" word mark, (2) an OCV logo, and (3) a suitable
slogan Owens Corning desires.

(r) Saint-Gobain hereby covenants, for itself and its Affiliates, that neither
Saint-Gobain nor any of its Affiliates will, or will grant to any third party
any right to, make, have made, use, have used, develop, have developed,
improve, have improved, import, have imported, export, have exported, lease,
distribute, have distributed, sell, or have sold any pipes for water adduction
under the patents identified in _Exhibit H-5_. To avoid any doubt, Owens
Corning and its Affiliates hereby acknowledge that Saint-Gobain and its
Affiliates shall have the right to pursue and prosecute any action to defend
such patents in the field of pipes for water adduction.



 

37 (s) Neither Owens Corning nor any of its Affiliates shall be entitled, except
pursuant to the provisions of the SG Intellectual Property License
Agreements, to file a patent application on any item of Know How of Saint-
Gobain that is included in a category of Know How identified on _Exhibit H-6_
as "RandC/TS" (i.e. as being applicable both to the "reinforcements and
composites" business and to the SG Textiles Solutions Business of Saint-
Gobain). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Owens Corning or any of its Affiliates
may file a patent application on any such item of Know How that: (i) Owens
Corning and Saint-Gobain agree is included in SG RandC Intellectual Property;
(ii) is an improvement to, or an invention independently of, any SG RandC
Intellectual Property, SG Third Party Intellectual Property, or SG Licensed
Intellectual Property, developed by Owens Corning or its Affiliates, or (iii)
is Intellectual Property owned or licensed by Owens Corning or its Affiliates,
from any third party. For the avoidance of doubt, it is specified that the
designation of a category of Know How as "RandC/TS" in _Exhibit H-6_ shall not
be construed as a presumption that every item of Know How in that category
constitutes SG Licensed Intellectual Property rather than SG RandC Intellectual
Property.

(t) Prior to Closing, Saint-Gobain shall arrange for a joint training program
between personnel of Saint-Gobain Vetrotex International (" _SGVI_ ") who are
technically expert in the LINCC furnace modeling software of SGVI and
personnel of Saint-Gobain Conception Verriere (" _SGCV_ ") who are
technically expert in the CONVEC furnace modeling software of SGCV. Such
training program shall be for the purpose of training the technical experts of
each company on software of the other company sufficient to enable the
technical experts to independently use, maintain, and support the software,
including its source code, and shall take place over a period of at least
three (3) months. The technical experts shall identify any known difficulties
in operating the current software, and any new difficulties encountered
during the training, and shall document all such difficulties. Thereafter, the
technical experts from the cognizant company shall provide training and
assistance to the other companys technical experts on ways to resolve any
such documented difficulties. If any such documented difficulties remain
unresolved at the conclusion of the training program, or recur thereafter,
then such assistance shall continue for up to six (6) months after
Closing. The Parties acknowledge that, other than as provided in this Section
5.10(t), neither Party shall provide any technical support, maintenance,
upgrades, or assistance in addressing difficulties arising from changes made
after Closing, for the LINCC or CONVEC software.

(u) Saint-Gobain shall ensure that, prior to Closing, SGVI and SGCV shall
enter into license agreements for the CONVEC and LINCC software, such
agreements to include provision for the supply of source code for the software
and to terminate and supersede existing license agreements for the software
and to be in the forms set forth respectively in _Exhibit H-1_ and _Exhibit
I-2_. Saint-Gobain shall also ensure that, prior to the Closing, SGCV shall
license to SGVI the Glass CAD software, such license to be on the same basis
on which SGVI, on or prior to the date of this Agreement, has access to the
Glass CAD software (i.e. to executable code but not source code) and in the
form set forth on _Exhibit I-3_ . Prior to Closing, Saint-Gobain and Owens
Corning shall agree on the terms of a maintenance support agreement of the
CAD software, which shall include upgrades to the CAD software to work with
newer version(s) of the Microstation software, on a fee-bearing basis for up
to two years, at Owens Cornings option. Such assistance may be renewed,
provided that the parties to the maintenance agreement agree  



 

38  on the fee and the conditions of the maintenance for the following year; it
being understood that such assistance shall be granted to the licensee of the
CAD software only.

(v) Deloitte and Touche and Owens Corning shall mutually define and agree on a
scope of work, in consultation with Saint-Gobain, for Deloitte and Touche to
prepare and provide for an independent valuation of the SG Acquired
Intellectual Property for the purpose of Section 2.01. Saint-Gobain shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives to, provide Deloite and Touche,
Owens Corning and its Representatives with such reasonable assistance and
cooperation as Owens Corning shall require (including access to the relevant
facilities and offices, information, books, records, documents and other
papers of Saint-Gobain and Saint-Gobains Business where located) during
normal business hours without unreasonably interfering with the operations of
Saint-Gobain to assist in the preparation of such valuation. To the extent
possible, such valuation shall utilize the analysis concluded by Deloitte and
Touche on November 29, 2006 and if the preliminary valuation is materially
different from the November 29, 2006 valuation, Owens Corning shall provide
Saint-Gobain an opportunity to furnish further information and consult with
Deloitte and Touche prior to the final determination of the valuation. Owens
Corning shall coordinate and supervise Deloitte and Touche during the valuation
process in consultation with Saint-Gobain and Owens Corning shall be
responsible for the cost of such valuation.

Section 5.11 _Financial Statements_. From the date of this Agreement until the
Closing Date, Saint-Gobain shall provide to Owens Corning, within 45 days of
the end of its fiscal quarters, the unaudited consolidating balance sheet of
Saint-Gobains Business as of the close of such fiscal quarter and the
unaudited consolidating income statement of Saint-Gobains Business for such
fiscal quarter. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.11, Saint-Gobain
agrees that the deliverables provided by Saint-Gobain under this Section 5.11
will be prepared in all material respects in accordance with IFRS (as
applicable) and will present fairly, in all material respects, the assets,
liabilities, financial condition, the results of operations of Saint-Gobains
Business at, and for the applicable fiscal quarter then ended (as the case may
be).

Section 5.12 _Non-compete_.

(a) Until the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date, (the " _Non-Compete
Period_ ", Saint-Gobain shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to,
directly or indirectly, for their own account or otherwise, in any country of
the world: (i) own, operate, manage or control; (ii) serve as an officer,
director, shareholder, partner, member, employee, agent, consultant, advisor
or developer or in any similar capacity; or (iii) have any financial interest
in, in each of (i), (ii) or (iii), any person, business or enterprise that
competes directly or indirectly with the Business; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that Saint-Gobain or its Affiliates may (A) own and operate the business
conducted by Saint-Gobain Vetrotex America, Inc. as conducted from its Wichita
Falls facility, (B) own an interest of not more than five percent (5%) of any
class of security of a Person engaged in a competing business, which
securities of such Person are traded on a securities exchange and (C) operate
the single texturised product machine at Litomysl for supplies to Valeo. 

(b) Section 5.12(a) shall not apply to any business owned as of the date
hereof by either Saint-Gobain or any of its Affiliates, that the Parties have
agreed shall not be an  



 

39  Acquired Asset (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the business
conducted by Saint-Gobain Vetrotrex America, Inc. at its Wichita Falls
facility (including the sales offices, warehouses and the glass mat
operations), the SG Textile Solutions Business and the single texturised
product machine at Litomysl for supplies to Valeo), provided, however, that
except for the business conducted at Saint-Gobain Vetrotex America, Inc.s
Wichita Falls facility (including the sales offices, warehouses and the glass
mat operations), any such business shall not manufacture or sell any Business
Products except pursuant to a written supply, license, and/or tolling
agreement with Owens Corning or its Affiliates.

(c) Section 5.12(a) shall not prohibit the acquisition, directly or
indirectly, by Saint-Gobain or any of its Affiliates, of any business assets
or shares which cause it to be in breach of Section 5.12(a) (the " _Prohibited
Asset_ ") as the result of the consummation of any merger, acquisition or
similar transaction for so long as and provided that (i) the annual sales
revenue generated by the Prohibited Asset represents less than ten (10)
percent of the total annual sales revenue generated by such acquired
business assets or shares, or (ii) the annual sales revenue generated by the
Prohibited Asset is less than USD20 million, in each case calculated based on
the relevant annual financial statements for the most recent complete
financial year. 

(d) If Saint-Gobain or any of its Affiliates becomes the owner of any
Prohibited Asset at any time during a Non-Compete Period, Saint-Gobain shall
transfer or cause its Affiliate to transfer such Prohibited Asset to a third
party for cash consideration only and shall use its reasonable efforts to
effect such transfer within twelve (12) months after its acquisition (and if
such Transfer does not occur within such twelve (12) month period, Saint-
Gobain shall continue to use its reasonable efforts to effect such transfer as
soon as practically possible), which transfer will be subject, however, to a
right of first offer in favor of Owens Corning or an Affiliate thereof
designated by Owens Corning, which right of first offer shall be exercised in
accordance with Section 5.12(e).

(e) Promptly but no later than twenty (20) Business Days following the
acquisition of the Prohibited Asset by Saint-Gobain or any of its
Affiliates, Saint-Gobain shall give written notice (a " _ROFO Transferor s
Notice_") to Owens Corning of its intention, or that of its applicable
Affiliate, to sell the Prohibited Asset, which notice shall (i) identify
the Prohibited Asset, (ii) indicate the expected purchase price of the
Prohibited Asset and any other material items and conditions of the proposed
transfer and (iii) attach a copy of any due diligence report prepared by the
ROFO Transferor or its applicable Affiliate and its legal and financial
advisors (but only to the extent permitted by such legal and financial
advisors) for the purpose of the transaction comprising the Prohibited Asset.
The date on which such ROFO Transferors Notice is actually received by Owens
Corning is referred to hereinafter as the " _ROFO Notice Date_." Owens Corning
shall have sixty (60) days following the ROFO Notice Date to notify Saint-
Gobain in writing whether Owens Corning wishes to buy such Prohibited Asset
on the same terms as set forth in the ROFO Transferors Notice (the " _ROFO
Notice_ "). If Owens Corning either fails to give the ROFO Notice within such
sixty (60) day period or notifies Saint-Gobain that it does not wish to
purchase the Prohibited Asset, Owens Corning shall be deemed to have declined
to purchase such Prohibited Asset and Saint-Gobain or its applicable Affiliate
may thereafter transfer the Prohibited Asset to any third party at a price
and on terms and conditions which are not more favorable to the proposed
transferee than those set forth in the ROFO Transferors Notice; _provided_
that if the Prohibited Asset is not transferred for any reason  



 

40  before the end of a one hundred and eighty (180) day period following the
expiry of the above-mentioned sixty (60) day period (or, if
applicable, within thirty (30) days after receipt of all necessary approvals
from any Governmental Authority, provided a binding agreement (subject only to
customary conditions, including regulatory approvals) shall have been entered
into between Saint-Gobain or its applicable Affiliate and the relevant third
party purchaser before the end of the above-mentioned one hundred and eighty
(180) day period), then such Prohibited Asset may be transferred only by again
complying with all of the terms and procedures set forth in this Section
5.12(e). If Owens Corning does provide a ROFO Notice to Saint-Gobain within
such sixty (60) day period, such ROFO Notice shall be deemed to create a
binding agreement between Saint-Gobain or its applicable Affiliate and Owens
Corning (or the Affiliate designated by Owens Corning in the ROFO Notice) to
transfer, subject to the receipt of the purchase price, all and not less than
all of the Prohibited Asset at the price and on the other terms and
conditions set forth in the ROFO Transferors Notice. Saint-Gobain or its
applicable Affiliate shall be liable for the transfer of full and unencumbered
legal title to the Prohibited Asset. The closing for the transfer to Owens
Corning or its designated Affiliate shall take place at a time and place
reasonably acceptable to Saint-Gobain or its applicable Affiliate and Owens
Corning or its designated Affiliate; _provided_ that such closing shall occur
on the later of (i) thirty (30) days after the receipt of all necessary
approvals from any Governmental Authority and (ii) one hundred and eighty
(180) days after receipt by Saint-Gobain of the ROFO Notice. Each of Saint-
Gobain or its applicable Affiliate, on the one hand, and Owens-Corning or its
designated Affiliate, on the other hand, shall pay its own costs and expenses
in connection with the transaction.

Section 5.13 _Confidentiality_. For a period commencing on the Closing Date
and ending on the ten year anniversary thereof, Saint-Gobain shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, treat and hold as confidential, any and all
technical, economic, financial, or marketing information or other proprietary
or confidential information concerning the Business. In the event Saint-Gobain
or any of its Affiliates is requested or required (by oral or written request
for information or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena,
civil investigative demand or similar process or by applicable Law) to
disclose any such confidential or proprietary information, then Saint-Gobain
shall notify Owens Corning promptly of the request or requirement so that
Owens Corning, at its own expense, may seek an appropriate protective order or
waive compliance with this Section 5.13. If, in the absence of a protective
order or receipt of a waiver hereunder, Saint-Gobain is, on the advice of
counsel, compelled to disclose such confidential information, Saint-Gobain may
so disclose the confidential or proprietary information; _provided_ that
Saint-Gobain shall use reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that
confidential treatment shall be accorded to such confidential or proprietary
information. The provisions of this Section 5.13 shall not be deemed to
prohibit the disclosure by Saint-Gobain of confidential or proprietary
information relating to the operations or affairs of the Business to the
extent reasonably required (i) to prepare or complete any required Tax
returns or financial statements, (ii) in connection with audits or other
proceedings by or on behalf of a Governmental Authority, (iii) in connection
with any insurance or benefits claims, (iv) to the extent necessary to comply
with any applicable Laws, (v) to provide services to Owens Corning in
accordance with the terms and conditions of any of the Transaction Documents,
(vi) in connection with asserting any rights or remedies or performing
any obligations under the Transaction Documents, or (vii) in connection with
any other similar administrative functions in the ordinary course of business;
_provided_ that in each such case Saint-Gobain shall use reasonable efforts to
obtain  



 

41  reliable assurance that confidential treatment shall be accorded to such
confidential or proprietary information. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the provisions of this Section 5.13 shall not apply to information that (x)
is or becomes publicly available other than as a result of a disclosure by
Saint-Gobain, (y) is or becomes available to Saint-Gobain on a non-
confidential basis from a source that, to the knowledge of Saint-Gobain, is
not prohibited from disclosing such information by a legal, contractual or
fiduciary obligation, or (z) is or has been independently developed by Saint-
Gobain other than through the use of information available to Saint-Gobain
prior to the Closing.

Arrangements in order to obtain any consents or approvals necessary
or desirable in connection with the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions.

Section 6.02 _Certain Filings; Consents_. The Parties shall cooperate with
each other (a) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or

Agreement or any of the Contemplated Transactions, except as may be required
by Applicable Law or any listing agreement with any securities exchange on

complying with Applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no  



 

42  provision of this Agreement shall (a) relieve either Party from any of its
obligations under the Non-Disclosure Agreement or (b) terminate any of the
restrictions imposed upon the Parties by Section 5.03.

Section 6.04 _Antitrust or Competition Law Matters_.

 

(a) The Parties shall, as promptly as practicable and in any event no later

reports, information and documentation required for the transactions
contemplated hereby pursuant to any Antitrust or Competition Law as set forth
in _Schedule 6.04(a)_ as far as such filings are required despite the
authorizations already received from such Governmental Authorities for the
Joint Venture. The Parties shall, as promptly as practicable respond, to any
request for information and documents or compulsory process from any
Governmental Authority. The Parties shall furnish to each others counsel
such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request
in connection with its preparation of any filing or submission that is
necessary under any Antitrust or Competition Law or requested by any
Governmental Authority. The Parties shall share equally in all filing and
other similar fees payable in connection with such filings, including local

the fees allocated by Saint-Gobain for in-house legal support as previously
agreed in writing between the Parties.

(b) The Parties shall take all commercially reasonable steps to (i) obtain
promptly, and in any event no later than October 31, 2007, any clearance or
approval required under any Antitrust or Competition Law for the consummation
of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) close or
have closed any investigation by any Governmental Authority relating to the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement. The Parties shall keep each other
apprised of the status of any communications with, and any inquiries or
requests for additional information from, any Governmental Authority and shall
comply promptly with any such inquiry or request. For the avoidance of doubt,
and notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement, it is understood that in
order to prevent a negative decision of and/or the institution of proceedings
by a competent Governmental Authority, Owens Corning shall be required to
offer as a remedy, or to agree with any competent Governmental Authority, to
sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of the Businesses and assets set forth
on _Schedule 6.04(b)(1)_. For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding any
provision in this Agreement, it is understood that Owens Corning shall be
required to take all commercially reasonable steps to reach an agreement with
any competent Governmental Authority in Brazil permitting the Parties to
consummate this Agreement with effect in Brazil. For the avoidance of doubt,
and notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement, it is understood that in
order to prevent a negative decision of and/or the institution of proceedings
by a competent Governmental Authority, Saint-Gobain shall be required to offer
as a remedy, or to agree with any competent Governmental Authority, to
retain, sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of the Businesses and assets set
forth on _Schedule 6.04(b)(2)_. Except as provided in the immediately
preceding sentence, in no event shall Saint-Gobain be required to offer as
a remedy, or to agree with any competent Governmental Authority, to sell or
otherwise transfer or dispose of any assets or businesses of Saint-Gobain or
its Affiliates. The Parties shall consult with each other on whether to
contest together, administratively or in court, any ruling, order or other
action of any Governmental Authority in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that one Party decides to contest
such ruling, order or action on its own, the other Party  



 

43  shall be obligated to provide the Party initiating the contest with all
reasonable assistance in the conduct of such contest.

(c) The Parties commit to instruct their respective counsel to cooperate with
each other and use commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate and expedite
the identification and resolution of any issues and, consequently, the
expiration of the applicable waiting period and the waiting periods, approvals
or clearances under any Antitrust or Competition Law or the conclusion of
any investigation by any Governmental Authority at the earliest practicable
dates. Said commercially reasonable efforts include, but are not limited to,
exchanging information and proving such other assistance reasonably necessary
to obtain approvals and clearances under any Antitrust or Competition Law.
Furthermore, each Party to this Agreement shall promptly notify the other
Party of any oral or written communication it receives from any Governmental
Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement,
permit the other Party to review in advance any communications proposed to be
made by such other Party to any Governmental Authority and shall provide the
other party with copies of all correspondence, filings or
other communications to and from any Governmental Authority. Each Party to
this Agreement shall not agree to participate in any meeting with any
Governmental Authority in respect to any such filings, investigations or other
inquiry unless it consults with the other Party in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other Party the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings. It is nevertheless
understood that Owens Corning and its counsel will take the lead on all
communications with any Governmental Authority.

Section 6.05 _Agreements Regarding Tax Matters_.

(a) Each Party shall (i) provide the other with such assistance as may be
reasonably requested in connection with the preparation of any Tax
Return relating to an SG Acquired Subsidiary or the SG Acquired Assets or any
audit or other examination by any Tax Authority or proceeding involving any
Governmental Authority relating to liability for Taxes, (ii) retain for a
period of six years following the end of the calendar year in which the
Closing occurs, or if longer, the period required by applicable Tax law, and
upon reasonable request provide to the other all records and other information
that may be relevant to any such Tax Return, audit or examination, proceeding
or determination, and (iii) provide the other with a copy of any final
determination of any such audit or examination, proceeding or determination
that affects any amount required to be shown on any Tax Return of an SG
Acquired Subsidiary or with respect to the SG Acquired Assets for any period.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Party shall retain,
until the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitation (including any
extensions thereof), or if longer, the period required by applicable Tax law,
copies of all Tax Returns, supporting work schedules and other records
(including any other documents or information required to be retained in
accordance with applicable Tax law) relating to Tax periods or portions
thereof ending on or prior to the Closing Date that concern the SG Acquired
Assets, the SG Acquired Subsidiaries or the SG Assumed Liabilities.

(b) The Parties agree that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
constitute a disposition of a trade or business within the meaning of Section
41(f)(3) of the Code. The Parties will provide to each other upon request all
information necessary to permit Owens Corning to apply the provisions of
Section 41(f)(3)(A) of the Code.



 

44 (c) Owens Corning shall timely prepare all Tax Returns with respect to the SG
Acquired Subsidiaries for any Tax period beginning before and ending after
the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ ") and all Tax Returns for any Tax
period ending on or before the Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Period_ ") that
is to be filed after the Closing Date and, with the prior written consent of
Saint-Gobain (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
shall file or cause to be filed such Tax Returns. Saint-Gobain acknowledges
and agrees that Tax Returns prepared by Owens Corning pursuant to this
Section 6.05(c) may include, at the discretion of Owens Corning, United States
federal (and applicable state and local) Tax Returns of non-U.S. SG Acquired
Subsidiaries for Pre-Closing Periods reflecting the election of a tax year
for United States federal (and applicable state and local) Tax purposes that
ends on the day prior to the Closing Date; provided (i) such elections do not
require any such SG Acquired Subsidiaries to change their reporting period
for any purposes other than United States tax purposes (including financial
accounting and non-US tax purposes), (ii) Owens Corning has reasonably
determined that such elections are permitted under applicable law and (iii)
such elections are not reasonably expected to materially increase the United
States tax liability of any of the SG Acquired Subsidiaries or of Saint-Gobain
or of any of their Affiliates. 

(d) Owens Corning shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes with respect to the
SG Acquired Assets and the SG Acquired Subsidiaries shown as due on the Tax
Returns filed for a Straddle Period or a Pre-Closing Period pursuant to
Section 6.05(c); _provided_ , that Saint-Gobain shall be liable for and shall
reimburse Owens Corning for any such Taxes attributable to the portion of
such Straddle Period beginning before and ending as of the Closing Date or to
a Pre-Closing Period (including Taxes resulting from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and attributable to the SG Acquired
Subsidiaries (except to the extent that such Taxes were taking into account as
a liability in calculating the Adjusted Net Working Capital, the Adjusted Net
Debt, or as provided in Section 6.05(k))). Any Taxes arising from or with
respect to the SG Acquired Subsidiaries or the Business for a Straddle Period
shall be apportioned between the Parties by allocating real and personal
property taxes and any other ad valorem taxes between Parties based on the
ratio of the number of days in the Straddle Period occurring before the
Closing Date to the number of days in the Straddle Period occurring on or
after the Closing Date and by assuming, with respect to all other Taxes, that
SG Acquired Subsidiary or Business had a tax period that ended at the close
of business on the day immediately prior to the Closing Date and closed its
books as of that time. Owens Corning shall reimburse Saint-Gobain for any such
Taxes paid by Saint-Gobain for which Owens Corning is liable pursuant to this
Section 6.05(d).

(e) Saint-Gobain shall be liable for, and shall hold harmless and indemnify
Owens Corning and its Subsidiaries (including the SG Acquired Subsidiaries)
against, Taxes (and related Damages) imposed on Owens Corning any of its
Subsidiaries or the SG Acquired Assets that are attributable to the portion
of a Straddle Period beginning before or on and ending as of the Closing Date
or to a Pre-Closing Period (excluding Taxes taken into account as a liability
in calculating Adjusted Net Working Capital and Adjusted Net Debt and taking
into account any resulting actual refund or reduction in liability for Taxes
imposed on Owens Corning or any of its Subsidiaries attributable to the
portion of the Straddle Period beginning before and ending as of the Closing
Date or to a Pre-Closing Period, and except as provided in Section 6.05(k)
and excluding Taxes (or increased amount of Taxes) which would not have arisen
but for any change of methods of tax accounting, elections or other
calculation  



 

45  principles effected after the Closing Date and effective for Tax period or
portions thereof ending on or before the Closing Date (other than any such
changes that are required by law)). For the avoidance of doubt, Saint-
Gobains indemnification obligation under this Section 6.05(e) shall include
any Taxes imposed as a result of a later audit or examination or required by
law and shall not be subject to the Indemnity Caps or the Indemnity
Threshold.

(f) The following procedures shall apply with respect to any written claim
with respect to Taxes made by any Governmental Authority or other Person
that, if pursued successfully, could serve as the basis for a claim for
indemnification of Owens Corning or the SG Acquired Subsidiaries under this
Agreement (a " _Tax Claim_ "):

(i) If any Governmental Authority or other Person asserts a Tax Claim, if the
party hereto first receiving notice of such Tax Claim is Owens Corning or the
SG Acquired Subsidiaries, then Owens Corning shall within 10 days of receipt
provide written notice of such Tax Claim to the party hereunder that would be
required to indemnify Owens Corning hereunder in respect of such Tax (the "
_Tax Indemnifying Party_ "), and if the party hereto first receiving notice of
such Tax Claim is the Tax Indemnifying Party, then such Tax Indemnifying Party
shall promptly provide written notice of such Tax Claim to Owens Corning.
Such notice in each case shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for such
Tax Claim and shall include a copy of any relevant correspondence received
from the Governmental Authority or other Person.

(ii) Owens Corning shall control the defense and prosecution of all Tax
Claims. The Tax Indemnifying Party shall cooperate in good faith with Owens
Corning and its authorized representatives in order to contest effectively
such Tax Claim. Owens Corning shall inform the Tax Indemnifying Party of all
developments and events relating to such Tax Claim (including providing to
Tax Indemnifying Party copies of all written materials relating to such Tax
Claim), and Tax Indemnifying Party or its authorized representatives shall be
entitled, at the expense of Tax Indemnifying Party, to attend and participate
in, but not control, all conferences, meetings and proceedings relating to
such Tax Claim. Owens Corning shall provide the Tax Indemnifying Party drafts
of all written submissions relating to such Tax Claims in advance for
comment and review.

(iii) Owens Corning shall not enter into any compromise or settlement of such
Tax Claim that would result in any Tax detriment to the Tax Indemnifying
Party without the consent of such party, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed; provided however that if in any case such consent is not
granted, Owens Corning may elect to enter into such compromise or settlement
of such Tax Claim notwithstanding, if it obtains advice from an expert on
taxation for the jurisdiction in question of national standing in the relevant
jurisdiction to the effect that the compromise or settlement is in the best
interests of both Owens Corning and the Tax Indemnifying Party.

(g) Owens Corning may at its own discretion make one or more elections under
Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to the direct or indirect acquisition
of any non-U.S. SG Acquired Subsidiaries.



 

46 (h) Any refund of Income Taxes of any SG Acquired Subsidiary or the SG
Acquired Assets for any period or portion thereof ending on or before the
Closing Date, to the extent not included in the calculation of the Saint-
Gobain Adjusted Net Working Capital Amount and not reflecting a Tax for which
Owens Corning is indemnifying Saint-Gobain pursuant to Section 6.05(k), shall
be for the account of Saint-Gobain. Owens Corning shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates to, forward to Saint-Gobain any such refund within 10 days after
such refund is received or applied against other Income Tax liability. Except
as otherwise required by applicable law, the parties shall treat any payments
under the preceding sentence as an adjustment to the price paid for the
relevant SG Acquired Subsidiary or SG Acquired Asset. Owens Corning
shall promptly notify Saint-Gobain of any entitlement to any such refund or
credit referred to above, and shall, if Saint-Gobain so requests and at Saint-
Gobains expense, cause the relevant SG Acquired Subsidiary to file for and
obtain any refund determined by Saint-Gobain to be due to Saint-Gobain. Owens
Corning shall permit Saint-Gobain to control at Saint-Gobains expense the
prosecution of any such refund claimed, following procedures consistent with
those provided for Tax Claims in Section 6.05(f).

(i) Owens Corning and Saint-Gobain agree to report all transactions regarding
the SG Acquired Subsidiaries not in the ordinary course of business occurring
on the Closing Date after Owens Cornings acquisition of the SG Acquired
Subsidiaries on Owens Cornings or a Subsidiarys federal income Tax return to
the extent permitted by United States Treasury regulation Section
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B).

(j) The Parties agree, to the extent permitted by law, to treat
all indemnification payments made pursuant to this Agreement as adjustments
to the Purchase Price for United States federal income and other applicable
Tax purposes.

(k) Notwithstanding the proviso to Section 6.05 (d) or Section 6.05 (e),
Saint-Gobain and its Affiliates shall not be liable for, and Owens Corning
shall hold harmless and indemnify Saint-Gobain and its Affiliates on an
after-Tax basis against, any Taxes and related Damages imposed on Vetrotex
France SA or Vetrotex International SA that are attributable to the sale
pursuant to Section 2.01 of this Agreement of (i) SG RandC Intellectual
Property by Vetrotex France SA to a Purchasing Company and (ii) SG Acquired
Subsidiaries by Vetrotex France SA and Vetrotex International SA as Subsidiary
Transferors. In addition, Owens Corning shall hold harmless and
indemnify Saint-Gobain and its Affiliates, on an after-Tax basis, against any
Incremental Taxes and related Damages; _provided_ , in order to avoid double
recovery, that Owens Cornings indemnification obligation under this sentence
shall exclude any Taxes and related Damages indemnified by Owens Corning
pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 6.05 (k). For the avoidance of
doubt, Owens Cornings indemnification obligations under this Section 6.05 (k)
shall include any Taxes or Incremental Taxes (and related Damages) arising as
a result of a later audit or examination or required by law and shall not be
subject to (nor taken into account for the calculation of) the Indemnity Caps
or the Indemnity Threshold.

(l) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if there shall be
any dispute, controversy or claim (a " _Tax Dispute_ ") between the Parties
arising out of, relating to, or connected with this Section 6.05, the Parties
shall use their best efforts to resolve the matter on an amicable basis and in
a manner fair and equitable to the Parties. If one Party notifies another
Party that a Tax Dispute has arisen and the Parties are unable to resolve the
Tax  



 

47  Dispute within thirty (30) days from such notice, then the matter shall be
referred to Deloitte and Touche for resolution. Thereafter, such Tax Dispute
shall be resolved by Deloitte and Touche following procedures consistent with
those set forth in Section 3.04(a).

Section 6.06 _Administration of Accounts_. All payments and reimbursements
received by Saint-Gobain or its respective Affiliates after the Closing Date
that would have been payable to an SG Acquired Subsidiary prior to the
Closing Date shall be promptly paid over to Owens Corning without right of
set-off. All payments and reimbursements that constitute SG Excluded Assets or
relate to an SG Excluded Liability received by Owens Corning or its respective
Affiliates after the Closing Date shall be promptly paid over to Saint-Gobain
without right of set-off.

Section 6.07 _Undisclosed Contracts_. Promptly after the date hereof, subject
to Applicable Law, Saint-Gobain shall, with respect to each of the Contracts
of its Business that contain confidentiality or non-disclosure provisions
requiring the specific approval of customers or other Persons for disclosure
of the terms thereof (the " _Undisclosed Contracts_ "), use reasonable
commercial efforts to obtain the approval of customers or other Persons as
necessary to enable (i) Owens Corning and its Representatives to conduct a
review of the Undisclosed Contracts of Saint-Gobains Business to which Owens
Corning shall have been denied access prior to the date hereof, and (ii) Owens
Corning to conduct the Business from and after the Closing Date. Upon
receiving the approvals of customers or other Persons, as the case may be, as
contemplated by the preceding clause (i), Saint-Gobain shall permit Owens
Cornings Representatives to conduct a review of such Undisclosed Contracts,
subject to the terms and conditions of the approvals, the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement and the provisions of Applicable Law.

Section 6.08 _No Transfer or Assumption of Asbestos Liabilities_. Owens
Corning, nor any SG Acquired Subsidiary or Existing JV, is (as result of this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby) assuming or
responsible for any liabilities or obligations (under any legal theory or
cause of action, including without limitation, based on theories of fraudulent
conveyance, successor liability or piercing the corporate veil) arising out
of, resulting from or related to, any Asbestos Materials or Asbestos Laws,
arising out of or relating in any manner to, Saint-Gobain and/or any of its
current or former divisions or Affiliates (or any of their respective
predecessors) or any of their respective current or former operations,
transactions, activities, conditions, occurrences, acts or omissions.

Section 6.09 _Affiliate Agreements_. Except as expressly contemplated by the
Transaction Documents or in Schedule 6.09, Saint-Gobain shall cause all
agreements between an SG Acquired Subsidiary and any Affiliate thereof (other
than another SG Acquired Subsidiary) to be terminated prior to the Closing.

Section 6.10 [Intentionally Omitted.]

Section 6.11 _Termination of Positions_. Until the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, Owens Corning shall not (a) terminate the employment of the
persons set forth in _Schedule 6.11_ (other than for cause) or (b) adversely
change in any material respect the position, title, reporting
responsibilities, compensation, benefits and other terms and conditions of
employment of the  



 

48  persons set forth on _Schedule 6.11_ offered to such persons on the Closing
Date without the prior written agreement of Saint-Gobain.

Section 6.12 _Financial Statements Cooperation_. Saint-Gobain shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates and Representatives to and shall direct its auditors to,
provide Owens Corning and its Representatives with such reasonable assistance
and cooperation as Owens Corning shall require (including access to the
relevant information, books, records, documents and other papers of Saint-
Gobain and Saint-Gobains Business where located ) during normal business
hours without unreasonably interfering with the operations of Saint-Gobain to
assist in the preparation of such financial statements concerning Saint-
Gobains Business as may be required to be included in any filing by Owens
Corning under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Section 6.13 _Indebtedness and Cash Maintenance_.

(a) Subject to Section 3.04, prior to, or simultaneously with, Closing,
Saint-Gobain shall cause all outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money
(including any prepayment, change of control or other similar penalties and
related costs and expenses) of all SG Acquired Subsidiaries (other than
indebtedness for borrowed money of one SG Acquired Subsidiary to another SG
Acquired Subsidiary) to be paid off such that all obligations related to such
indebtedness shall be fully discharged. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Saint-
Gobain shall not be obligated to discharge indebtedness for borrowed money:



     | (i) | in respect of the SG Acquired Subsidiaries listed on
_Schedule 6.13(a)_ (the " _Specified Subsidiaries_ "), up to an aggregate of
EUR15,000,000 of outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money (" _Developing
Country Debt_ ") using applicable exchange rates as of 5:00 p.m. Central
European time on the Business day prior to the Closing in accordance with the
procedures used in calculating the SG Reference Date Balance Sheet; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | in respect of SG Acquired Subsidiaries which are not
Specified Subsidiaries, up to an aggregate amount equal to the net cash
position (cash or cash equivalents _minus_  outstanding indebtedness for
borrowed money as of the Closing) of the Specified Subsidiaries (" _Developed
Country Debt_ "), subject to the limitations on cash and cash equivalents set
forth in Section 6.13(b).  
---|---|--- 

(b) Subject to Section 3.04, prior to Closing, Saint-Gobain shall take, and
shall cause its Affiliates to take, all necessary action to ensure that
immediately prior to Closing, the Specified Subsidiaries shall not have cash
in excess EUR40,000,000 in the aggregate using applicable exchange rates as of
5:00 p.m. Central European time on the Business day prior to the Closing in
accordance with the procedures used in calculating the SG Reference Date
Balance Sheet. For purposes of this Agreement, any amount of cash held by the
Specified Subsidiaries in excess of EUR 40,000,000 in the aggregate, shall be
referred to herein as " _Excess Cash_ ".

(c) Except as set forth in _Schedule 6.13(c)_ and subject to Section 3.04,
Owens Corning shall cause all Developed Country Debt to be paid off on the
Closing Date.  



 

49  Except (i) as set forth in _Schedule 6.13(c)_ and (ii) as the borrower may
be prohibited by Applicable Law and subject to Section 3.04, Owens Corning
shall cause to be paid off at Closing all Developing Country Debt (other than
Developing Country Debt that is owed to third parties not Affiliates of Saint-
Gobain except as provided herein); provided that Saint-Gobain shall have
first delivered to Owens Corning no later than September 15, 2007, a list of
all such Developing Country Debt setting forth the maximum amounts thereof for
each Specified Subsidiary to be paid off at Closing (the " _Developing
Country Debt List_ "), failing which Owens Corning shall not be obligated to
pay off such Developing Country Debt at Closing. Owens Corning and Saint-
Gobain shall promptly following the date hereof together advise all third-
party lenders of Developing Country Debt who are not Affiliates of Saint-
Gobain of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the change of
control of any of such lenders borrower. Should any such lender request that
its Developing Country Debt be repaid at or prior to the Closing, Saint-
Gobain may at its option repay such Developing Country Debt at or prior to the
Closing. To the extent that the existing terms of any such Developing Country
Debt shall entitle the lender to require the borrower to repay such loan upon
a change of control event and such lender so requires, Owens Corning shall
cause such Developing Country Debt to be paid off at Closing subject to
Section 3.04. Any tax liability associated with the payment of any
indebtedness (including the payment of any accrued interest thereon) pursuant
to this Section 6.13(c) will be paid by the lender of such indebtedness.
Saint-Gobain shall provide Owens Corning no later than seven days prior to
the Closing Date a written statement of the amount of Developed Country Debt
and no later than fifteen days prior to the Closing Date a written statement
of Developing County Debt to be repaid at Closing by the relevant SG Acquired
Subsidiaries.

INTENTIONALLY OMITTED

ARTICLE VIII

EMPLOYEE AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT MATTERS

Section 8.01 _Employee and Employee Benefit Matters_. The Parties agree as to
employee and employee benefit matters as set forth below:

(a) _Employment of Business Employees_. As of the Closing Date, Owens Corning
shall, or cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) continue to employ (where employment
continues automatically by operation of law) on the Closing Date, or (ii)
offer employment (where employment does not continue automatically by
operation of law) as of the Closing Date to, each Business Employee who is
actively employed immediately prior to the Closing Date (the employees
described in clauses (i) and (ii) who continue employment with Owens Corning
or its Subsidiaries or accept such offers of employment with Owens Corning or
its Subsidiaries will be referred to as the " _Transferred Employees_ ").
Owens Corning also shall, or shall cause its  



 

50  Subsidiaries to, continue to employ (where employment continues
automatically by operation of law) or offer re-instatement or employment
(where employment does not continue automatically by operation of law), as
the case may be, to each Business Employee who is not actively employed
immediately prior to the Closing Date and who has a right of re-instatement
(collectively, " _Inactive Employees_ "), in each case on return from any
leave or other absence to the extent Saint-Gobain or its Affiliates would have
been required immediately prior to the Closing Date to reinstate such Inactive
Employee pursuant to Applicable Law or any applicable Saint-Gobain policy
(pursuant to the terms of such policy as in effect as of the date hereof). A
list of Inactive Employees as of July 10, 2007 is set forth on _Schedule
8.01(a)_. Such list shall be updated by Saint-Gobain as of the Closing Date.
Any Inactive Employee who returns to active employment or becomes actively
employed by Owens Corning or its Subsidiaries upon conclusion of his or her
leave or absence as set forth in this Section 8.01(a) shall be treated as a
Transferred Employee upon his or her return to active employment with Owens
Corning or its Subsidiaries. Business Employees who do not become actively
employed by Owens Corning or its Subsidiaries shall not be considered
Transferred Employees under this Agreement, and Owens Corning and its
Subsidiaries shall have no obligations or liability with respect to such
employees except for any benefits payable under any Transferred DB Plans
as described in this Article VIII. For such employees, any and all
employment-related obligations and liabilities (except for any benefits
payable under any Transferred DB Plans as described in this Article VIII)
shall remain with Saint-Gobain or its Affiliates.

(b) _Terms and Conditions of Employment_. For all hourly and salaried
Transferred Employees who are not covered by a collective bargaining
agreement that covers the terms and conditions of employment and that will be
assumed by Owens Corning or its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date, except
where Applicable Law provides otherwise, Owens Corning shall, or shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, initially offer wages (including participation in
variable compensation plans), hours, benefits and other terms and conditions
of employment that are comparable in the aggregate (except for equity
compensation) to the wages, hours, benefits and other terms and conditions of
employment that were provided to such employees by Saint-Gobain and/or its
Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, the base
salary, work location, and any other applicable benefits to be offered to
Transferred Employees shall be such that the transfer of employment to Owens
Corning or any of its Subsidiaries should not result in the entitlement to
severance benefits under any plan of Saint-Gobain or its Affiliates or
Applicable Law. Subject to the requirement in the preceding sentence regarding
the avoidance of triggering severance payments, Owens Corning shall have the
sole discretion to determine the wages, employee benefits and terms of
employment to be provided to Transferred Employees; provided, however, the
intended employee benefits to be initially provided to the Transferred
Employees shall include those provided through: the Transferred DB Plans,
Transferred DC Plans, existing Owens Corning benefit plans, Risk Plans and new
stand-alone plans as set out in _Schedule 8.01(b)_ (collectively, the "
_Benefit Schedules_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the Benefit
Schedules specifically state that a "Special Treatment/Exception" shall apply,
the terms of such schedule shall control. In the event that Owens Corning
offers to enter into an individual arrangement with a Transferred Employee,
then the Transferred Employee may choose to enter into such arrangement in
lieu of receiving the compensation and benefits specified above.



 

51 (c) _Employees Representative Agreements_. As of the Closing Date, Owens
Corning shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries, consistent with Applicable
Law, to (i) continue to give effect to any collective bargaining agreement or
similar agreement (where the agreement continues automatically by operation of
law) that covers Transferred Employees to the extent required by Applicable
Law and to the same extent Saint-Gobain and its Affiliates were required to do
so, or (ii) except as otherwise determined by Owens Corning, initially assume
all rights, obligations and liabilities under any collective bargaining
agreement or similar agreement (where the agreement does not continue
automatically by operation of law) that covers Transferred Employees, and to
recognize and bargain in good faith with any union that has been certified or
recognized as the collective bargaining representative of Transferred
Employees who are employed by Owens Corning and/or its Subsidiaries. Saint-
Gobain and its Affiliates and Owens Corning and its Subsidiaries
shall cooperate and take all necessary steps and fulfill all of their
respective obligations under Applicable Law and the terms of any applicable
agreement, including obtaining any prior approvals or consents, or engaging in
any prior discussions or consultations, on a timely basis, as may be legally
required in order to effectuate the foregoing.

(d) _Credit for Service_. Owens Corning shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, credit Transferred Employees for service earned prior to the
Closing Date with Saint-Gobain and its Affiliates, or any of its predecessor
members of the Saint-Gobain group of companies, (i) to the extent that
service is relevant for purposes of eligibility, vesting or the calculation of
vacation, sick days, severance, layoff and similar benefits under any
retirement (other than benefit accrual purposes with respect to Transferred
DB Plans) or other employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of Owens
Corning or any of its Subsidiaries for the benefit of the Transferred
Employees on or after the Closing Date, and (ii) for such additional purposes
as may be required by Applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) the
service that is credited pursuant to this Section 8.01(d) may not be greater
than the service credited for the applicable purpose by Saint-Gobain and
its Affiliates immediately prior to Closing Date, and (B) Transferred
Employees shall not receive any such service credit (1) where it would result
in duplication of benefits, or (2) in excess of the amount permitted under
Applicable Law. 

(e) _Pre-existing Conditions; Coordination_. Where applicable, Owens Corning
shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, waive limitations on benefits
relating to any pre-existing conditions of the Transferred Employees and their
eligible dependents to the extent that such limitations were waived under the
applicable SG Benefit Plan. Where applicable, Owens Corning shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, recognize for purposes of annual deductible and
out-of-pocket limits under their health plans applicable to Transferred
Employees, deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid by Transferred Employees
and their respective dependents under Saint-Gobains or any of its
Affiliates health plans in the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs
to the extent that Saint-Gobain provides Owens-Corning as of the Closing Date
with detailed information as to the amount of such deductible and out-of-
pocket expenses paid by the Transferred Employees.

Section 8.02  _Allocation of Pre-Closing Employment Liability_. Saint-Gobain
or its Affiliates shall, other than in relation to (i) Retirement Benefits and
Risk Benefits provided in Section 8.04 and Section 8.05 and (ii) any
employment or benefit litigation arising out of claims alleging
discrimination, be responsible for any and all employment-related obligations
and  



 

52  liabilities (including but not limited to wages, bonuses, commissions,
vacation, leave, employee benefits, severance, and other compensation),
for Transferred Employees incurred prior to the Closing Date, or arising out
of conduct by Saint-Gobain or its Affiliates first occurring prior to the
Closing Date, to the extent it is related to the period up to the Closing
Date, under any Applicable Laws, regulations, collective bargaining
agreements, or other agreements, or imposed by any administrative, judicial,
or governmental body.

Section 8.03 _Allocation of Post-Closing Employment Liability_. Owens Corning
or its Subsidiaries shall be responsible for any and all employment-related
obligations and liabilities for Transferred Employees not covered by (i)
Section 8.02 or (ii) the Retirement Benefits and Risk Benefits provided in
Section 8.04 and Section 8.05, provided, however, that Owens Corning shall not
be responsible for any strike or strike-related conduct by employees of the
Business prior to the Closing Date.

Section 8.04 _Allocation of Retirement Benefit Liabilities_.

(a) Liabilities for Transferred DB Plans.

(i) The Parties agree that the sponsorship, obligations, and liabilities in
respect of the Transferred DB Plans will be transferred to and assumed by
Owens Corning or any of its Subsidiaries with effect on and from the Closing
Date by operation of Applicable Law or by the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

(ii)

(A) For each pension benefit plan that was sponsored by Owens Corning or its
Affiliates immediately prior to Closing that is set forth in
_Schedule 8.04(a)(ii)(A)_ (the " _OC DB Plans_ "), the Owens Corning Actuary
and the Saint-Gobain Actuary (together with the Owens Corning Actuary, the "
_Actuaries_ ") shall determine within 60 days of the Closing Date the
value of the projected benefit obligation (based on census data as of the
Closing) of such OC DB Plan based on a FAS/IAS methodology and on the
actuarial assumptions set forth on the applicable Benefit Schedule using
discount rates based on applicable local bond yields at Closing in accordance
with applicable FAS/IAS methodology, the market value of the assets of each
such OC DB Plan as of the Closing Date and using applicable exchange rates as
of the Closing Date in accordance with the procedures used by Owens Corning
in applying exchange rates in its financial statements (excluding from such
calculation any contributions made following the date hereof by Owens Corning
or its Affiliates in excess of the minimum funding requirements under
Applicable Law, except with respect to contributions made to the funded OC DB
Plan in Japan up to the amount of the OC Pre-Close Unfunded Liabilities and
Ongoing Service Cost with respect to such plan). For each Transferred DB Plan
that was sponsored by Saint-Gobain or its Affiliates immediately prior to
Closing (the " _SG Transferred DB Plans_ "), the Actuaries shall determine
within 60 days of the Closing Date the value of the projected
benefit obligation (based on census data as of the Closing) of such SG
Transferred DB Plan based on a FAS/IAS methodology and on the actuarial
assumptions set forth on the applicable Benefit Schedule using discount rates
based on applicable local bond yields at Closing in accordance with
applicable FAS/IAS methodology, the market value of the assets of each such
Transferred DB Plan as of the Closing Date and using applicable exchange rates
as of the Closing Date in accordance with  



 

53  the procedures used in calculating the SG Reference Date Balance Sheet. The
excess of the value of the projected benefit obligation of an OC DB Plan over
the current assets of such OC DB Plan as of the Closing Date constitutes the
" _OC Unfunded Liabilities_ " of such OC DB Plan. Within 60 days after the
Closing Date, the Actuaries shall determine the aggregate OC Unfunded
Liabilities for all the OC DB Plans (the " _OC Pre-Close Unfunded
Liabilities_ "). The excess of the value of the projected benefit obligation
of an SG Transferred DB Plan over the current value of the assets of such SG
Transferred DB Plan as of the Closing Date constitutes the " _SG Unfunded
Liabilities_ " of such SG Transferred DB Plan. Within 60 days after the
Closing Date, the Actuaries shall determine the aggregate SG Unfunded
Liabilities for all the SG Transferred DB Plans (the " _SG Pre-Close Unfunded
Liabilities_ ").

(B) The Parties shall instruct the Actuaries to use all reasonable efforts
to reach mutual agreement as to the determination that is to be made. Saint-
Gobain shall make available to the Owens Corning Actuary all information
reasonably required by the Owens Corning Actuary to verify the Saint-Gobain
Actuarys calculations. Owens Corning shall make available to the Saint-
Gobain Actuary all information reasonably required by the Saint-Gobain Actuary
to verify the Owens Corning Actuarys calculations. The fees and expenses of
Saint-Gobain Actuary shall be paid by Saint-Gobain and those of Owens Corning
Actuary shall be paid by Owens Corning. If the Actuaries are not able to reach
mutual agreement with respect to any calculation required to be made hereunder
by the Actuaries, then the determination of such calculation shall be
referred for a final decision to an independent actuary to be nominated
jointly by Saint-Gobain and Owens Corning. The Parties shall request that the
actuary so appointed use all reasonable efforts to make its determination
within 10 business days. The person so appointed shall act as an expert and
not as an arbitrator, such persons decision shall be final and binding, and
such persons fees and expenses shall be shared equally by Saint-Gobain and
Owens Corning.

(iii)

(A) In the event that (I) the amount by which the SG Pre-Close Unfunded
Liabilities (as finalized in accordance with this Section 8.04) exceed two-
thirds of the OC Pre-Close Unfunded Liabilities (as finalized in accordance
with this Section 8.04) exceeds (II) the SG Unfunded Base Amount, Saint-Gobain
shall pay to Owens Corning, in USD, on the fifth Business Day after the
calculation of such amounts are finalized in accordance with this Section
8.04, an amount equal to such excess amount, with interest from the Closing
Date until payment in full at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 30 basis points in
immediately available funds by wire transfer to a bank account designated in
writing by Owens Corning.

(B) In the event that (I) the amount by which the SG Pre-Close Unfunded
Liabilities (as finalized in accordance with this Section 8.04) exceed two-
thirds of the OC Pre-Close Unfunded Liabilities (as finalized in accordance
with this Section 8.04) is less than (II) the SG Unfunded Base Amount, Owens
Corning shall pay to Saint-Gobain, in USD, on the fifth Business Day after the
calculation of such amounts are finalized in accordance with this Section
8.04, an amount equal to such difference, with interest from the Closing
Date until payment in full at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 30 basis points in
immediately available funds by wire transfer to a bank account designated in
writing by Saint-Gobain.



 

54 (b) _Liabilities for Transferred DC Plans_. The Parties agree that the
sponsorship, obligations, and liabilities in respect of the Transferred DC
Plans will be transferred to and assumed by Owens Corning or any of its
Subsidiaries with effect on and from the Closing Date by operation of
Applicable Law or by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) _Consents for Transferred Plans_. The Parties shall use their best
reasonable efforts to obtain as soon as practicable and any applicable
consents, consultations and approvals required by Applicable Law to transfer
or caused to be transferred to Owens Corning or any of its Affiliates the
liabilities and assets of the Transferred Plans, including but not limited to
the consent, consultation and approval of any applicable works council,
Transferred Employee, Governmental Authority, trustee, insurer, or other
entity involved in the management of such plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in the event that Applicable Law expressly prohibits the transfer of plan
assets for the benefit of any Transferred Employee, even with appropriate
consents, consultations, and approvals like those described above, the parties
agree that they shall in good faith cooperate and work with each other to
take such actions as are permissible under such Applicable Law or practice to
carry out to the fullest extent possible the spirit and purposes of such
provision.

(d) _Liabilities for SG Benefit Plans Other than Transferred Plans._ The
Parties agree that the sponsorship, obligations, and liabilities
(including any withdrawal liability/debt on employer in respect of the
Retained DB Plan in the UK, even if assessed after the Closing Date, but in
respect of the period ending on or prior to the Closing Date, and any
liability of any member of the Owens Corning group in respect of the Retained
DB Plan in the UK as a result of a contribution notice or a financial support
direction issued by the pension regulator under the Pension Act 2004) in
respect of SG Benefit Plans other than the Transferred DB Plans and
Transferred DC Plans will be retained, reimbursed or assumed solely by Saint-
Gobain or any of its Affiliates. Saint-Gobain shall take all appropriate and
necessary actions to effectuate the foregoing.

Section 8.05 _Allocation of Risk Benefit Liabilities_. The Parties agree that
with respect to a Transferred Employee if a liability or cost attributable to
a Risk Plan or a workers compensation claim is attributable to a single event,
a series of events, or a prolonged event that occurs only prior to the Closing
Date, then Saint-Gobain or any of its Affiliates shall be responsible
for that liability or cost even if the claim is filed post-Closing. The
Parties agree that if a liability or cost attributable to a Risk Plan or a
workers compensation claim is attributable to a series of events or a
prolonged event covering both the pre-Closing and post-Closing period, Owens
Corning and any of its Subsidiaries shall be responsible for such liability or
cost. Moreover, Owens Corning and any of its Subsidiaries shall be responsible
for the liabilities or costs in respect of the Risk Plans and workers
compensation claims attributable to a single event that occurs on or after the
Closing Date.

Section 8.06 _Employees Consultation and Notification_. Prior to the Closing
Date, Saint-Gobain and its Subsidiaries shall, and shall cause their
respective managers, agents and representatives to, comply with all
requirements under applicable labor and employment Laws of the applicable
jurisdictions and any collective bargaining agreements applicable to employees
of Saint-Gobains Business to inform, and/or consult with, the relevant unions
and local works councils of Saint-Gobain and its Subsidiaries and to satisfy
other employees or employee  



 

55  representatives consultation or notification requirements, in each case in
connection with the transaction contemplated hereby. Prior to the
Closing Date, Owens Corning and Saint-Gobain and their respective
Subsidiaries shall reasonably cooperate with each other with respect to the
provision of information required or desired to be provided in connection with
such information and consultation formalities, and the Parties shall provide
each other with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any proposed
information supplied. With respect to any notices, consultations, and payments
relating to events occurring prior to the Closing Date, the respective
Parties shall be responsible for and assume all liability for any and all
notices, consultations, payments, fines or assessments due to any Governmental
Authority, employees or otherwise, relating to the employment, discharge, or
layoff of employees of the respective Parties before the Closing Date.
Likewise, with respect to any notices, consultations, and payments related to
events occurring on or after the Closing Date, Owens Corning and
its Subsidiaries shall be responsible for and assume all liability for any
and all notices, consultations, payments, fines or assessments due to any
Governmental Authority, employees or otherwise, relating to the employment,
discharge, or layoff of Transferred Employees on or after the Closing Date.

Section 8.07 _Cooperation and Assistance_.

(a) _Cooperation of the Parties_. On and after the Closing Date, Saint-Gobain
shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, cooperate with Owens Corning and
its Subsidiaries to provide, to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws, such

and former SG Employees on an ongoing basis as may be reasonably necessary to
facilitate determinations of eligibility for, and payments of benefits to, the
Transferred Employees under the employee benefit plans of Owens Corning and
its Subsidiaries.

(b) _Consultation with Employee Representative Bodies_. The Parties hereto
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, mutually cooperate in
undertaking all reasonably necessary or legally required provision of

representative bodies (including any unions or works councils) which represent
employees affected by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 8.08 _Seconded Employees_. Saint-Gobain shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, take all necessary steps to ensure that the secondment
agreements or arrangements in respect of any employees seconded to either or
both of them and assigned to the Business, can lawfully, and without violating
such secondment agreements or arrangements, be transferred or assigned to
Owens Corning or its Subsidiaries. In the event that the consent of a third
party shall be necessary for the transfer or assignment of any such secondment
agreement or arrangement to Owens Corning or its Subsidiaries, Saint-Gobain
or its Affiliates shall secure such consent or obtain a waiver of the
requirement for such consent. Saint-Gobain shall, and shall cause its
respective Affiliates to ensure that no secondment agreement or arrangement
transferred to Owens Corning or its Subsidiaries shall be terminated or
cancelled by Saint-Gobain or its Affiliates, unless otherwise expressly agreed
to in writing by Owens Corning or its Subsidiaries.

 

Section 8.09 _Layoffs_. From the date of this Agreement until the Closing
Date, Saint-Gobain shall not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates not
to, take any action affecting  



 

56  more than fifty employees engaged in the Business, respectively, that would
constitute a mass layoff, a mass termination, or a plant closing and which
would trigger notice requirements or liability under any Applicable Law
concerning reductions in force or any similar law, in any of the applicable
jurisdictions.

Section 8.10 _Key Employees_.

(a) [Intentionally Omitted.]

(b) Prior to or on the Closing Date, Saint-Gobain shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, cause (or, where employee consent is required under Applicable
Law, use its best efforts to cause) each of its employees who are essential to
the effective operation of the Business to be transferred to or become
employed by Owens Corning or its Subsidiaries unless otherwise expressly
agreed to in writing by both Parties. Each essential SG employee shall be
referred to as a " _Key SG Employee_ " and shall be listed in _Schedule
8.10(b)_ under the subheading "Key SG Employees".

(c) _Schedule 8.10(c)_ contains a list of those Key SG Employees, if any, for

and 8.10(c)_ shall be updated as of the Closing Date, subject to the express
written agreement by the Parties.

Section 8.11 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. The provisions of this Article
VIII are solely for the purposes of the respective Parties to this Agreement
and nothing in this Agreement expressed or implied shall confer upon any
current or former Transferred Employee or SG Employee or upon any
representative of any such person, or upon any collective bargaining agent,
any rights or remedies, including any third party beneficiary rights or any
right to employment or continued employment for any specified period, of any
nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

60 The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements referenced in the
preceding clauses (a), (b) and (c) as surviving the Closing are referred to
herein as the " _Surviving Representations or Covenants_ ". It is understood
and agreed that (x) after the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to any breach of any Surviving Representation or Covenant shall be a
claim for Damages (whether by contract, in tort or otherwise, and whether in
law, in equity or both) made pursuant to this Article XI; _provided_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Article XI shall limit the
right of any Party (A) to pursue an action for or to seek remedies with
respect to claims for fraud or (B) to seek specific performance or other
equitable relief; and (y) before the Closing, the Parties shall be entitled
to the termination and other remedies set forth in Article XII and
indemnification under this Article XI shall not apply.

Section 11.02 _Indemnification_.

(a) Effective as of the Closing and subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 11.04(a), Owens Corning hereby indemnifies each of Saint-Gobain, its
Affiliates and its Representatives (together with their respective successors
and permitted assigns) (the " _SG Indemnified Parties_") against, and agrees
to defend and hold them harmless from, any and all Damages incurred or
suffered by any of them arising out of, resulting from or related to any
breach of any Surviving Representation or Covenant made or to be performed by
Owens Corning or its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement.

(b) Effective as of the Closing and subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 11.04(b), Saint-Gobain hereby indemnifies each of Owens Corning, its
Affiliates and its Representatives (together with their respective successors
and permitted assigns) (the " _OC Indemnified Parties_ ") against, and agrees
to defend and hold them harmless from, any and all Damages incurred or
suffered by any of them arising out of, resulting from or related to (1) any
breach of any Surviving Representation or Covenant made or to be performed by
Saint-Gobain or its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement, (2) any SG Excluded
Liabilities (including Saint-Gobains or any of its Subsidiaries failure to
perform or in due course pay or discharge any Saint-Gobain Excluded
Liability), or (3) any matters for which indemnification is provided by Saint-
Gobain under Article VIII (it being understood that the terms of such
indemnification shall be governed by and subject to the terms of Article VIII
to the extent such terms differ from the provisions of this Article XI), (4)
any SG Indemnified Environmental Matters, (5) any SG Indemnified Excluded
Environmental Matters, or (6) any breach of the covenant set forth in Section
5.10 (k) and (7) any willful act of fraud, misfeasance or malfeasance taken
prior to Closing by an employee or agent of Saint-Gobain or any of its
Subsidiaries.

Section 11.03 _Procedures_.

(a) If any Party or any of the Parties respective Affiliates or
Representatives shall seek indemnification pursuant to Section 11.02, the
Person seeking indemnification (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall give
written notice to the Party from whom such indemnification is sought (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") promptly (and in any event within 30 days) after the
Indemnified Party (or, if the Indemnified Party is a corporation, any officer
or director of the Indemnified Party) becomes aware of the facts giving rise
to such claim for indemnification (an " _Indemnified Claim_ ") specifying in
reasonable detail the factual basis of the Indemnified Claim, stating the
amount of the Damages, if known, the method of computation thereof,
containing a  



 

61  reference to the provision of this Agreement in respect of which such
Indemnified Claim arises and demanding indemnification therefor. The failure
of an Indemnified Party to provide notice in accordance with this Section
11.03, or any delay in providing such notice, shall not constitute a waiver of
that Partys claims to indemnification pursuant to Section 11.02, except to
the extent that (i) any such failure or delay in giving notice causes the
amounts paid or to be paid by the Indemnifying Party to be greater than they
otherwise would have been or otherwise results in prejudice to the
Indemnifying Party or (ii) such notice is not delivered to the Indemnifying
Party prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period set forth in
Section 11.01. If the Indemnified Claim arises from the assertion of any
claim, or the commencement of any suit, action, proceeding or Remedial Action
brought by a Person that is not a Party hereto (a " _Third Party Claim_ "),
any such notice to the Indemnifying Party shall be accompanied by a copy of
any papers theretofore served on or delivered to the Indemnified Party in
connection with such Third Party Claim.

(b) Upon receipt of notice of a Third Party Claim from an Indemnified
Party pursuant to Section 11.03(a), the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled
to assume the defense and control of such Third Party Claim subject to the
provisions of this Section 11.03 by providing notice of such election to the
Indemnified Party within 30 days of its receipt of notice of such Third Party
Claim; _provided_ , that any such assumption of the defense and control of a
Third Party Claim shall constitute an acknowledgement and acceptance by the
Indemnifying Party of its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party for
all Damages arising out of such Third Party Claim under this Article XI. If
the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party will not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any
legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in
connection with the defense thereof as long as the Indemnifying Party is
conducting its defense in accordance with this Section 11.03(b);  _provided_
, that if in the written opinion of counsel to any Indemnified Party a
conflict of interest exists in respect of such claim, such Indemnified Party
will have the right to employ separate counsel reasonably satisfactory to
the Indemnifying Party to represent such Indemnified Party and in that event
the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel will be paid by the
Indemnifying Party; _provided_ that in the event there are multiple
Indemnified Parties, the Indemnifying Party shall only have an obligation to
pay the fees and expenses of one separate counsel for all Indemnified Parties.
If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense and control of a Third
Party Claim within such 30 day period, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to defend such Third Party Claim in such manner as it may deem
appropriate and the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for all Damages arising
out of such Third Party Claim, to the extent that such Damages are subject to
indemnification by the Indemnifying Party hereunder, and shall promptly pay or
reimburse the Indemnified Party for all reasonable fees and expenses incurred
in the defense by the Indemnified Party of such Third Party Claim.
Whether the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party is defending and
controlling any such Third Party Claim, it shall select counsel, contractors,
experts and consultants of recognized standing and competence, shall take all
steps necessary in the investigation, defense or settlement thereof, and
shall at all times diligently and promptly pursue the resolution thereof. The
Party conducting the defense thereof shall at all times act as if all Damages
relating to the Third Party Claim were for its own account and shall act in
good faith and with reasonable prudence to minimize Damages therefrom. Each of
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall, and shall cause each
of its respective Affiliates and Representatives to, reasonably cooperate
with the other in connection with any Third Party Claim at the request of the
other and at the expense of the  



 

62  Indemnifying Party. In addition, the Party not conducting the defense shall
have the right to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim at its
own expense.

(c) The Indemnifying Party shall be authorized to consent to a settlement of,
or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party Claims, and the
Indemnified Party shall consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any
judgment arising from, such Third Party Claims if (i) the Indemnifying Party
shall pay or cause to be paid all amounts arising out of such settlement or
judgment concurrently with the effectiveness thereof, (ii) such settlement
shall not encumber any of the assets of the Indemnified Party or contain any
restriction or condition that would apply to such Indemnified Party or to
the conduct of that Partys business, (iii) such settlement contains as a
condition thereto a complete and unconditional release of the Indemnified
Party, and (iv) such settlement does not contain any admission of wrongdoing
by the Indemnified Party. Except for the foregoing, no settlement or entry of
judgment in respect of any Third Party Claim shall be consented to by any
Indemnifying Party without the express written consent of the Indemnified
Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Whether
or not the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party will not consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any
judgment arising from, a Third Party Claim without the express written
consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.

(d) If an Indemnifying Party makes any payment on an Indemnified Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all
rights and remedies of the Indemnified Party to any insurance benefits or
other claims or benefits of the Indemnified Party with respect to such claim.
Such Indemnified Party will cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in a
reasonable manner, at the cost and expense of such Indemnifying Party, in
prosecuting any subrogated right or claim.

Section 11.04 _Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement or in any of the Transaction Documents (with the exception of the
obligations of Owens Corning set forth in Section 6.05(k) which shall not be
subject in any respect to the provisions set forth in this Section 11.04):

(a) Owens Corning shall have no liability to the SG Indemnified Parties in
respect of indemnification claims pursuant to breaches of representations
or warranties (as distinguished from breaches of covenants and agreements)
under Section 11.02(a)(1) unless and until:

(i) such Damages are Recoverable Damages; and

(ii) such Recoverable Damages in the aggregate exceed USD 5,000,000 (the "
_Indemnity Threshold_ "); _provided_ , that if the Indemnity Threshold is
reached, the entire amount of all such Damages shall be subject to
indemnification under this Section 11.04(a) up to a total of USD600,000,000
(the " _OC Indemnity Cap_ ").

(b) Owens Corning shall have no obligation to an SG Indemnified Party pursuant

TERMINATION 

Section 12.01 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Closing:

(a) by mutual written agreement of the Parties;

(b) by either Party if the Closing shall not have been consummated by May 31,
2008; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Party may terminate this Agreement

Affiliates to perform, in all material respects any of its or their respective
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement;

(c) by either Party if there shall be any Applicable Law that makes
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions illegal or otherwise prohibited,

has filed suit to enjoin or otherwise prohibit the Contemplated Transactions;
and

(d) by either Party in the event of a breach by the other Party of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement under this Agreement,

obligation to consummate the Closing of the terminating Party not to be
capable of being satisfied, and such breach is not cured by the breaching
Party within 30 days of receiving written notice from the terminating Party of
the breach or alleged breach, which written notice shall state that unless
such breach is cured in accordance with this Section 12.01(d) the terminating
Party intends to terminate this Agreement  



 

65  (it being understood that such 30 day cure period shall not under any
circumstances extend the date set forth in Section 12.01(b));

12.01 shall give written notice of such termination to the other Party.

permitted by Section 12.01:

(a) this Agreement shall forthwith become void and of no further force or
effect, except for the following provisions, which shall remain in full
force and effect: (i) the representations and warranties set forth in
Sections 4.01(f) and 4.02(m) (relating to finders fees), (ii) Section 5.03

(b) such termination shall be without liability of any Party (or any
Affiliate, stockholder, consultant or Representative of such Party) to the
other Party to this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the
Contemplated Transactions fail to close as a result of a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement under this Agreement by any
Party, such Party shall be fully liable for any and all damages or losses
incurred or suffered by the other Party as a result of all such breaches if
the other Party is ready, willing and able to otherwise satisfy its
obligations under this Agreement.

Section 12.03  _Non-Exclusive Remedies_. Notwithstanding any provision in
this Article XII or elsewhere in this Agreement to the contrary, the rights
and remedies provided in Section 12.02 shall be in addition to, and not
exclusive of, any rights or remedies to which the Parties may be entitled
under Applicable Law as a result of a termination of this Agreement.

accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of New York (without
regard to the choice of law provisions thereof).

Section 13.09 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed in

other jurisdiction. To the extent any provision of this Agreement is
determined to be prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the Parties
agree to use reasonable efforts, and agree to cause their Subsidiaries to use
reasonable efforts, to substitute one or more valid, legal and enforceable

same may be in effect on the Closing Date. Saint-Gobain shall indemnify and
hold Owens Corning harmless against any and all liabilities (other than in
respect of SG Assumed Liabilities) that may be asserted by third parties
against Owens Corning as a result of noncompliance with any such bulk sales
law.

Party have the right or authority to assume, create or incur any liability or
any obligation of any kind, expressed or implied, against or in the name or on
behalf of any other Party, unless otherwise expressly permitted pursuant to
an agreement in writing between or among any of the Parties.

Section 13.14 _Dispute Resolution_

(a) If there shall be any dispute, controversy or claim (" _Dispute_ ")
between the Parties arising out of, relating to, or connected with this
Agreement, the breach, termination or  



 

70  invalidity hereof, or the provisions contained herein or omitted herefrom,
the Parties shall use their best efforts to resolve the matter on an
amicable basis and in a manner fair and equitable to the Parties. If one
Party notifies another Party that a Dispute has arisen and the Parties are
unable to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days from such notice, then
the matter shall be referred to the chief executive officers of the Parties
(as applicable), who shall act by mutual agreement on all such matters. No
recourse to arbitration under this Agreement shall take place unless and until
the chief executive officers of the Parties (as applicable) have been unable
to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the expiration of the
thirty (30) day period referred to above.

(b) The Parties irrevocably agree that any Disputes that are not resolved in
accordance with paragraph (a) within the two abovementioned thirty (30) day
periods shall be finally settled by arbitration in Brussels, by three
arbitrators appointed and proceeding in accordance with the Rules of
Arbitration (the " _ICC Rules_ ") of the International Chamber of Commerce
(the " _ICC_ ") as the exclusive means of resolving such Disputes. For
purposes of appointing such arbitrators, each Party to the Dispute shall
appoint one arbitrator and either the third arbitrator shall be selected by
the two Party-appointed arbitrators or, failing agreement within thirty (30)
days after the Party-appointed arbitrators have been confirmed, by the ICC in
accordance with the ICC Rules. All submissions and awards in relation to
arbitration under this Agreement shall be made in English and all arbitration
proceedings and all pleadings shall be in English. For purposes of this
Section 13.14(b), the term "Party to a Dispute" may include groups of aligned
Parties.

(c) Except as may be required by applicable law, stock exchange rules,
Governmental Authorities, or in connection with the ordinary course operation
of the Business, the Parties agree to maintain confidentiality as to all
aspects of the arbitration, including its existence and results, except that
nothing herein shall prevent any Party from disclosing information regarding
the arbitration for purposes of enforcing the judgment of the arbitral
tribunal or the expert arbitrator or in any court proceedings involving the
Parties. The Parties further agree to obtain the arbitral tribunals agreement
to preserve the confidentiality of the arbitration.

Section 13.15 _Consequential Damages_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement or any other Transaction Document to the contrary, no Party
shall be liable to any other Party (or its Affiliates) for special, indirect,
punitive or consequential damages, including lost profits and opportunity
costs (except in each case to the extent assessed in connection with claims by
other Persons), resulting from or arising out of a breach of this Agreement
or any other Transaction Document (except where such breach is a result of
fraud or gross negligence of such Party).

Section 13.16 _Performance_. Each Party will cause to be performed and hereby
guarantees the performance of all actions, agreements and obligations set
forth herein to be performed by any Subsidiary of such Party.

Section 13.17 _Currency_. Except as otherwise specifically stated herein, all
monetary calculations hereunder shall be made in USD (utilizing the Conversion
Rate to the extent necessary and applicable).
