At the Closing, Buyer shall deposit $5,000,000 of the Net Cash Purchase Price

indemnification escrow fund (the " _Indemnification_   _Escrow Fund_ ") in
accordance with the escrow agreement substantially in the form attached hereto
as Exhibit 1.2.2 (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "), as a partial mechanism to
satisfy the obligations of the Shareholders and certain other Persons set

anniversary of the Closing, the Shareholders and other Persons specified on
the Final Closing Consideration Spreadsheet under the heading "Escrow
Amounts," in the proportions specified in the Escrow Agreement, shall receive
from the Indemnification Escrow Fund the Indemnification Escrow _less_  (i)
any amounts paid to Buyer from the Indemnification Escrow Fund prior to the
18-month anniversary of the Closing and (ii) any additional amounts then
claimed by Buyer under the terms of this Agreement. Each such distribution

terms of the Escrow Agreement will control.

statement (the " _Estimated Net Working Capital Statement_ ") of its estimate
of the Net Working Capital of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of
the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Net Working Capital_ "). The Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet and the Estimated Net Working Capital Statement shall be
prepared in good faith in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
(including calculated as set forth on Exhibit 1.2.3) and with GAAP, applied on
a consistent basis with the Company Balance Sheet. Buyer and its accountants
and advisors shall be given reasonable access to the books and records of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries during normal business hours solely for
purposes of evaluating the accuracy and completeness of the Estimated Closing
Balance Sheet and the Estimated Net Working Capital Statement. If the
Estimated Net Working Capital of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries on
the Estimated Net Working Capital Statement is more than $5,000,000 less than
the Working Capital Target Amount, then Buyer shall have the rights specified
in Section 7.1(h).

(b) Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date,
Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Shareholder Representative a
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of
the Closing Date (the " _Final Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and a statement (the
" _Final Net Working Capital Statement_ ") of the Net Working Capital of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date (the " _Final Net
Working Capital_ "). The Final Closing Balance Sheet and the Final Net
Working Capital Statement shall be prepared in good faith in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement (including calculated as set forth on Exhibit
1.2.3) and with GAAP, applied on a consistent basis with the Company Balance
Sheet. The Shareholder Representative and his accountants and advisors shall
be given reasonable access to the books and records of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries during normal business hours solely for purposes of
evaluating the accuracy and completeness of the Final Closing Balance Sheet
and the Final Net Working Capital Statement. If Buyer asserts that the
Final Net Working Capital as set forth on the Final Net Working Capital
Statement is more than $2,000,000 less than the Working Capital Target Amount
for reasons other than those set forth in subsection 1.2.3(f), then the Final
Net Working Capital Statement shall also state the amount by which the Final
Net Working Capital is less than the Working Capital Target Amount. If Buyer
asserts that the Final Net Working Capital as set forth on the Final Net
Working Capital Statement is less than the Working Capital Target Amount for
any of the reasons set forth in subsection 1.2.3(f) (a " _Working Capital
Deficiency Claim_ "), then the Final Net Working Capital Statement shall also
state the amount by which the Final Net Working Capital is less than the
Working Capital Target Amount and shall describe in reasonable detail the
basis for such Working Capital Deficiency Claim.

  



  

(c) If (A) the Shareholder Representative agrees in writing to the
Final Closing Balance Sheet and the Final Net Working Capital Statement (and,
if applicable, the assertions set forth in any Working Capital Deficiency
Claim) or (B) within thirty (30) days following the delivery of the Final
Closing Balance Sheet and the Final Net Working Capital Statement, the
Shareholder Representative does not give Buyer written notice of his
objection to the Final Closing Balance Sheet or the Final Net Working Capital
Statement (which notice shall describe the basis of the Shareholder
Representative's objection), then, in either such case, the Final Net Working
Capital shall be finalized for purposes of this Section 1.2.3 and any such
Working Capital Deficiency Claim shall be resolved.

  



  

(d) If the Shareholder Representative gives Buyer a timely written
notice of his objection to either the Final Closing Balance Sheet or the
Final Net Working Capital Statement (including any Working Capital Deficiency
Claim), then the Shareholder Representative and Buyer shall use their
reasonable best efforts to agree upon the Final Net Working Capital and
resolve any Working Capital Deficiency Claim. If the Shareholder
Representative and Buyer have not agreed upon the Final Net Working Capital
within thirty (30) days after Buyer has received the Shareholder
Representative's written notice of objection to the Final Closing Balance
Sheet or the Final Net Working Capital Statement, the issue(s) in dispute
(other than any disputed Working Capital Deficiency Claim) will be submitted
to an independent public accounting firm of national standing mutually agreed
upon by Buyer and the Shareholder Representative (the " _Auditor_ ") for
resolution. The determination by the Auditor of the Final Net Working Capital,
calculated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (including
calculated as set forth on Exhibit 1.2.3) and with GAAP, applied on a
consistent basis with the Company Balance Sheet, shall be set forth in a
written notice delivered to Buyer and the Shareholder Representative by the
Auditor within thirty (30) days thereafter and will be binding and conclusive
on Buyer and the Shareholders. Buyer and the Shareholders will each bear
fifty percent (50%) of the fees and expenses of the Auditor for such
determination.

(e) Subject to subsection 1.2.3(f), at such time as the Final Net
Working Capital is finalized, if (i) the Final Net Working Capital is
more than $2,000,000 less than the Working Capital Target Amount, then (A)

the amount by which the Final Net Working Capital is more than $2,000,000 less
than the Working Capital Target Amount and (B) the Shareholder Representative
shall pay (and may seek reimbursement from the other Shareholders therefor)
such amount to Buyer within three (3) Business Days after such time as the
Final Net Working Capital is finalized by wire transfer of immediately
available funds and (ii) the Final Net Working Capital exceeds $2,000,000 more
than the Working Capital Target Amount, then Buyer shall promptly (but in no
event later than three (3) Business Days after the Final Net Working Capital
is finalized) pay the amount by which the Final Net Working Capital exceeds
$2,000,000 more than the Working Capital Target Amount to the
Shareholder Representative, by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

(f) Notwithstanding subsection 1.2.3(e), if, at such time as the

negligence, intentional misconduct, omission, inaccuracy or inconsistency
with the books and records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, (ii)

U.S. GAAP, applied on a consistent basis with the Company Balance Sheet, or

the amount by which the Net Working Capital is less than the Working Capital
Target Amount and (B) the Shareholder Representative shall pay (and may seek
reimbursement from the Shareholders therefor) such amount to Buyer within
three (3) Business Days after such time as the Final Net Working Capital is
finalized by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

  



  

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.2.3,
Buyer shall not be entitled to any payment pursuant to this Section 1.2.3 due
to any difference between the Working Capital Target Amount and the Final Net
Working Capital resulting solely from the application by the Company of the
accounting methodologies or practices, internal accounting controls or
inventory, investment, credit or allowance procedures used in the preparation
of the Company Balance Sheet, and such application shall not form the basis
for a Working Capital Deficiency Claim.

the extent reasonably possible, allocate amounts to the tangible assets of
the Company based on their book values and allocate any amounts in excess of

to, goodwill and going concern. Upon receipt of the Section 338
Allocation, the Shareholders shall, for a period of twenty (20) days, have
the right to review and comment on the schedule, and Buyer shall make such
revisions as are reasonably requested by the Shareholders. If the Shareholders
and Buyer cannot reach agreement on the Section 338 Allocation, the
unresolved issues shall be submitted to a mutually acceptable national
accounting firm for resolution. The decision of the accounting firm shall be
final and binding and shall be the exclusive remedy for any disputes arising
as to the Section 338 Allocation. The fees, costs and expenses of the
accounting firm shall be borne by the Shareholders, on the one hand, and
Buyer, on the other hand, in the same proportion that the aggregate dollar
amount of the disputed items or amounts that are not resolved in favor of the
Shareholders and Buyer, respectively, bears to the total aggregate dollar
amount of items or amounts in dispute resolved by the accounting firm.

Shareholder as fully as if such Person had taken such Authorized Action. Each
Shareholder acknowledges and agrees that any payment made by Buyer on behalf
of such Shareholder to the Shareholder Representative pursuant to this
Agreement shall constitute full and complete payment to such Shareholder and
Buyer shall have no further liability therefor. No Shareholder shall bring
any Claim against Buyer as a result of any actions or inactions of the
Shareholder Representative.

6.11 Noncompetition and Nonsolicitation

  



  

(a) The Restricted Parties hereby acknowledge that the covenants and
agreements in this Section 6.11 are in consideration of Buyer's consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that Buyer would not
purchase the Stock but for each of the Restricted Parties' agreements herein.
Each of the Restricted Parties and Buyer acknowledges that from and after the
date hereof, Buyer (and its Affiliates) will engage in the acquisition of
Distribution Rights and the Exploitation of Distribution Rights (the "
_Designated Industry_ ") worldwide, and that engagement by the Restricted
Parties in the Designated Industry in the Territory could cause Buyer (and
its Affiliates) irreparable damage. To induce Buyer to enter into the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Restricted Parties
hereby agrees that, from the date of this Agreement through the second
anniversary of the date of this Agreement (the " _Specified Period_ "), such
Restricted Party will not, and will cause its Affiliates to not, without the
prior written consent of Buyer, (i) directly or indirectly, engage anywhere
in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, Channel Islands, Isle
of Man, New Zealand, and Bermuda, (collectively, the " _Territory_ "), as
agent, employee, consultant, representative, stockholder, manager, member,
partner or in any other capacity, own, operate, manage, control, engage in,
invest in or participate in any manner in, act as a consultant or advisor to,
render professional services for (alone or in association with any other
Person) any Person that engages in or owns, invests in, operates, manages or
controls any venture or enterprise that directly or indirectly engages or
proposes to engage in the Designated Industry anywhere in the Territory, (ii)
directly or indirectly, as agent, employee, consultant,
representative, stockholder, manager, member, partner, or in any other
capacity, employ or engage, or recruit or solicit the services of, or
otherwise contact for the purpose of offering employment or engagement to,
any person who is employed or engaged by either Buyer or its Affiliates or
any of their subsidiaries, at any time during the Specified Period, or to
otherwise encourage or induce any such person to leave the employment of
either Buyer or its Affiliates or any of their subsidiaries for the purpose of
engaging in the Designated Industry in the Territory, or (iii) directly or
indirectly solicit or take away, on behalf of himself or any other person or
entity, the business of any customer, merchant, licensor, vendor or supplier,
whether present or prospective, of Buyer or its Affiliates or any of their
subsidiaries for the purpose of engaging in the Designated Industry in the
Territory.

(b) Each of the Restricted Parties acknowledges that the duration
and geographical areas set forth in this Section 6.11 are reasonable in
scope; _provided_ , _however_ , if at any time the provisions of this Section
6.11 shall be finally determined to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of
competent jurisdiction, the parties hereto agree that the court making the
determination of invalidity or unenforceability will have the power to reduce
the scope, duration or area of the term or provision to delete specific words
or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with
a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision,
and this Agreement will be enforceable as so modified after the expiration of
the time within which the judgment may be appealed. The Restricted Parties
expressly acknowledge that it would be extremely difficult to measure the
damages that might result from any breach of this Section 6.11 and that any
breach of this Section 6.11 will result in irreparable injury to Buyer and its
business, for which money damages could not adequately compensate. Buyer
shall be entitled, in addition to all other rights and remedies that they may
have at law or in equity, to have an injunction issued by any competent court
enjoining and restraining the Restricted Parties from continuing any breach
of this Section 6.11.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding the covenants set out in this Section 6.11 to
the contrary, the Restricted Parties shall not be in default of their
obligations (i) by virtue of passively owning shares constituting less than
one percent (1%) of the voting power of a publicly-traded corporation or (ii)
with respect to any Restricted Party who is an attorney, by representing or
seeking to represent any Person in such professional capacity.

  



  

6.12 Release of Claims

  



  

Each Shareholder, on such Shareholder's behalf and on behalf of any such
Shareholder's heirs or assigns and all Persons or entities that might allege a
Claim through such Shareholder or on such Shareholder's behalf, hereby

contingent or noncontingent, past or present, arising or resulting from or
relating, directly or indirectly, to any act, omission, event, condition or
occurrence prior to the Closing relating to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary in any manner. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
Section 6.12 will be deemed to constitute a release by such Shareholder of

Document or any release of any workers' compensation claim or Claim for
benefits under any Employee Benefit Plan.

relationship between any of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or the

the aggregate liability of the Shareholders pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i)
shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to $9,000,000, of which
aggregate amount each Shareholder may be required to reimburse the Buyer
Indemnified Parties for Losses up to an amount equal to such Shareholder's
Pro Rata Share thereof.

  



  

(b) The aggregate liability of Buyer to all Shareholder Indemnified
Parties shall be limited to an amount equal to $9,000,000.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article VIII,
the Shareholders shall have no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless
any Buyer Indemnified Party with respect to any Losses arising in connection
with any Indemnification Claims pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i) unless the
aggregate Losses incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties for which they are
entitled to indemnification collectively equal or exceed the sum of $375,000
(" _Basket_ "). If such Losses exceed the Basket, then the Shareholders shall
be responsible to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties for all Losses in
excess of $200,000. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 8.4(c) shall
in no way limit, and the Basket shall not apply to, Buyer's right to
indemnification for Losses arising in connection with any Indemnification
Claim based on a Breach of any of the Fundamental Representations, other than
Losses arising in connection with the representations set forth in Section
2.10.3(a), which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be subject to the Basket.

  



  

(d) Any Person against whom an Indemnification Claim is being
asserted (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") shall not be obligated to indemnify or
hold harmless any Person claiming indemnification under this Article VIII (an
" _Indemnified Party_ ") after the expiration of any applicable Survival
Period unless a Claim Notice with respect to such Indemnification Claim shall
have been given by the Indemnified Party prior to the expiration of the
applicable Survival Period.

(e) The obligations of the Shareholders under Section 8.2(a) shall
be satisfied, first, from the Indemnification Escrow Fund. If there are no
funds remaining in the Indemnification Escrow Fund to satisfy Indemnification
Claims, any additional liability of the Shareholders under Section 8.2(a)
shall be satisfied from other assets of the Shareholders and each Shareholder
shall be liable only for such Shareholder's Pro Rata Share of any such
liability of the Shareholders.

  



  

(f) For purposes of determining the amount of Losses under Sections
8.2 and 8.3, all qualifications and limitations as to materiality, Company
Material Adverse Effect and words of similar import set forth in this
Agreement or in any other Operative Document (including in any
representations, warranties or covenants), shall be disregarded.

  



  

(g) Subject to Section 8.4(m), the right to indemnification, payment
of Losses or other remedy under Article VIII based on any Breach of
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations will
not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or knowledge
acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after
the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance
with any such representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or other
obligation. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any
representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any
covenant, agreement or other obligation, will not affect the right to
indemnification, payment of Losses or other remedy under Article VIII based
on any such representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or other obligation.

  



  

(h) Any Indemnified Party that becomes aware of a Loss for which it
seeks indemnification under this Article VIII shall be required to use
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the Loss, including taking any
actions reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party, and an Indemnifying
Party shall not be liable for any Loss to the extent that it is attributable
to the Indemnified Party's failure to mitigate.

  



  

(i) No Person shall have any liability to indemnify any Person for
any Loss that would not have arisen but for any alteration or
repeal, enactment or adoption of any Law or accounting standard after the
Closing Date.

  



  

(j) Losses suffered by any Indemnified Party shall be calculated
after giving effect to any amounts covered by insurance proceeds collected by
Buyer, the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries pursuant to any policy
of insurance for which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries paid
the premiums prior to Closing for the time period in which the insurable Loss
occurred; _provided_ ,  _however_ , any increase in premiums resulting from
collection under any such policy and any deductible paid regarding any such
collection shall be deemed Losses and shall be indemnifiable. If any such
insurance proceeds are actually realized by an Indemnified Party subsequent
to the receipt by such Indemnified Party of an indemnification payment
hereunder in respect of the claims to which such insurance proceeds relate,
appropriate refunds shall be made promptly to the Indemnifying Party regarding
the amount of such indemnification payment consistent with the first sentence
of this Section 8.4(j).

  



  

(k) The value of any tax benefits to an Indemnified Party (net of
any tax detriment to the Indemnified Party as a result of receiving
the indemnification payment) as a result of any Loss suffered by such
Indemnified Party shall be taken into account in the calculation of the
amount of any Loss, if and to the extent that the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party can reasonably determine the value of such tax benefits at
the time that the right to indemnification, payment of losses or other remedy
under this Article VIII is otherwise determined.

  



   

\- 74 - 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(l) Any amounts of liability for indemnification under this Article
VIII will be determined without duplication for recovery because of the state
of facts giving rise to the Losses constitute a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement hereunder or give rise to any
payment pursuant to Section 1.2.3.

  



  

(m) Buyer shall not be entitled to any indemnification, payment of
Losses or other remedy arising in connection with the representations set
forth in Sections 2.6.1(a), 2.6.2, 2.6.3 and 2.23 under Article VIII solely
resulting from the use by the Company of the accounting methodologies or
practices, internal accounting controls or inventory, investment, credit or
allowance procedures specifically set forth on Exhibit 1.2.3 in the
preparation of the Company Balance Sheet; _provided, however_ , this Section
8.4(l) shall not apply to any indemnification, payment of Losses or other
remedy under Article VIII relating to Third Party Claims.

  



  

8.5 Procedure for Indemnification

  



  

(a) An Indemnified Party shall give written notice (the " _Claim
Notice_ ") of any Indemnification Claim (i) in the case of an Indemnification
Claim against Buyer, to Buyer, and (ii) in the case of an Indemnification
Claim against any Shareholder, to the Shareholder Representative, reasonably
promptly, but in any event (A) prior to expiration of any applicable Survival
Period, and (B) if such Indemnification Claim relates to the assertion against
an Indemnified Party of any Claim by a third party (a " _Third Party Claim_
"), within 45 days after receipt by the Indemnified Party of written notice
of a legal process relating to such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_
, that the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party within such time
period shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any obligation or liability
to the Indemnified Party, except to the extent that the ability of the
Indemnifying Party to resolve such Indemnification Claim is materially and
adversely affected thereby.

  



  

(b) Unless the Shareholder Representative (in the case of any
Indemnification Claim against any Shareholder) or Buyer (in the case of
any Indemnification Claim against Buyer) contests the Indemnification Claim
in a writing given to the Indemnified Party within 20 days after receipt of a
Claim Notice, describing in reasonable detail the basis for contesting the
Indemnification Claim, the Indemnified Party shall, subject to the other
terms of this Article VIII, be paid the amount of Losses related to such
Indemnification Claim or the uncontested portion thereof. An Indemnifying
Party shall not contest any Indemnification Claim (or any portion
thereof) unless it believes in good faith that the Indemnified Party is not
entitled to be indemnified with respect to the Losses specified in such
claim. Any disputed Indemnification Claim shall be resolved either (i) in a
written agreement signed by Buyer (and Buyer Indemnified Party, if not Buyer)
and the Shareholder Representative or (ii) by the final decision of a court or
other trier of fact.

  



   

\- 75 - 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(c) With regard to a Third Party Claim, if the Shareholder
Representative acknowledges in writing its obligation to indemnify Buyer
(in the case of any Indemnification Claim against Buyer) hereunder against
any Losses that may result from such Third Party Claim, then the Shareholder
Representative will have the right to conduct and control, at its own expense
(subject to its rights to reimbursement expressly provided for in this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement) through counsel of its own choosing, any
Third Party Claim and will keep Buyer (and Buyer Indemnified Party, if not
Buyer) thoroughly informed as to the status thereof. Buyer (and Buyer
Indemnified Party, if not Buyer) may, at its election, participate in the
defense of any such Third Party Claim, with counsel of its own choosing, but
(except as provided below) will be required to bear the fees and expenses of
such counsel. The Shareholder Representative will not settle or compromise
any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of Buyer (and Buyer
Indemnified Party, if not Buyer), which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer may object to a settlement or
compromise that includes any provision that in Buyer's judgment may have a
material and adverse impact on or establish an adverse precedent for the
business condition or operations of, Buyer or any of its subsidiaries;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Shareholder Representative shall not
consent without prior written consent of Buyer to a settlement or a compromise
that does not include a release from all liability in respect of such Third
Party Claim for Buyer and any Buyer Indemnified Party. If in the judgment of
Buyer (and in the case of (iii) herein, and Buyer Indemnified Party, if not
Buyer) after consultation with outside counsel (i) there is a reasonable
likelihood that the amount payable in respect of a Claim will exceed the then
remaining Indemnification Escrow Fund, (ii) the outcome of a Claim could have
a material and adverse impact on the business condition or operations of
Buyer or any of its subsidiaries, and would thereby require or cause Buyer to
defend or respond in a manner different from that recommended by the
Shareholder Representative or (iii) there has been determined by Buyer or such
Buyer Indemnified Party, in the exercise of reasonable judgment, that there
is a conflict of interest that makes separate counsel for Buyer or such Buyer
Indemnified Party advisable, Buyer or such Buyer Indemnified Party will have
the right to undertake the defense or settlement thereof, at the
Shareholders' expense, and the Shareholder Representative will be entitled to
participate in the defense of such Claim at the expense of the Shareholders.
If the Shareholder Representative fails to defend diligently any Third
Party Claim, or if the Shareholder Representative fails to give written
notice to Buyer and any such Buyer Indemnified Party of its intention to
defend any Third Party Claim within 20 days after Buyer or such Buyer
Indemnified Party has notified the Shareholder Representative that any such
Third Party Claim has been made in writing and received by Buyer or such Buyer
Indemnified Party, then Buyer or such Buyer Indemnified Party may undertake
and assume the defense of such Third Party Claim with counsel of its own
choosing and recover from the Shareholders its Losses (including the amount
of any settlement or judgment of such Third Party Claim and the costs
and expenses of such defense); _provided_ , _however_ that Buyer or such
Buyer Indemnified Party shall not settle any such Third Party Claim without
the prior written consent of the Shareholder Representative, which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld.

  



  

(d) The Shareholder Representative, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, the Shareholders, Buyer and any Indemnified Parties
shall cooperate with each other, as applicable, with respect to resolving any
Claim or liability under this Article VIII. Such cooperation shall include,
but not be limited to, providing any additional information that may be
reasonably requested by a party to allow such party to assess the validity of
any Indemnification Claim.

8.6 Adjustments to Purchase Price

  



  

The parties hereto shall treat each indemnification payment pursuant to this
Article VIII as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for the Stock hereunder
for all Tax reporting purposes, upon examination of any Tax Return, in any
refund claim, or in any litigation, investigation or otherwise, unless
otherwise required by a determination (within the meaning of Section 1313(a)
of the Code or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or
foreign Law).

Company Subsidiaries, or any of the Company's or the Company Subsidiaries'
respective businesses, assets, liabilities, operations, prospects or
condition (financial or otherwise), including with respect to merchantability
or fitness for any particular purpose of any assets, the nature or extent of
any liabilities, the prospects of such business, the effectiveness or the
success of any operations, or the accuracy or completeness of any confidential
information memoranda, documents, projections, material or other information
(financial or otherwise) regarding the Company or any Company Subsidiary
furnished to Buyer or its Representatives or made available to Buyer and its
Representatives in any "data rooms," "virtual data rooms," management
presentations or in any other form in expectation of, or in connection with,
the transactions contemplated hereby, or in respect of any other matter or
thing whatsoever, and

  



  

(ii) no officer, agent, representative or employee of the Company,
any Company Subsidiary, or any Shareholder has any authority, express or
implied, to make any representations, warranties or agreements not
specifically set forth in this Agreement or in the other Operative Documents
and subject to the limited remedies herein provided;

  



  

(b) Except for the specific representations and warranties expressly
made in this Agreement and the other Operative Documents, Buyer
specifically disclaims that it is relying upon or has relied upon any such
other representations or warranties that may have been made by any Person,
and acknowledges and agrees that the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, and
the Shareholders have specifically disclaimed and do hereby specifically
disclaim any such other representation or warranty made by any Person; and

  



  

(c) Buyer specifically disclaims any obligation or duty by the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries, or the Shareholders to make any
disclosures of fact not required to be disclosed pursuant to the specific
representations and warranties set forth in Articles II and IIA and Exhibits
II and III of this Agreement or in any other Operative Document.

remedies, entitlements and recourse are expressly waived and released by the
parties hereto to the fullest extent permitted by Law.

of Articles II, IIA and III and Exhibits II and III of this Agreement and the
remedies provided in this Article VIII and Sections 1.2.3, 1.5(b), 6.11,

the Shareholders and were taken into account by Buyer, the Company and the
Shareholders in arriving at the Purchase Price.

  



  

(c) Buyer, the Company and the Shareholders have specifically relied
upon the provisions of this Section 8.8, together with the provisions of
Articles II and IIA and Exhibits II and III of this Agreement and the remedies
provided in this Article VIII, in agreeing to the Purchase Price and in
agreeing to provide the representations and warranties set forth herein.

ordinary seller in an arm's-length transaction.

9.10 Headings; Construction

  



  

The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement are included for
convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. The parties have participated jointly in
the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity
or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be
construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden
of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the
authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. Any reference to any
federal, state, local or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to refer
to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context
requires otherwise. Words used in this Agreement, regardless of the gender and
number specifically used, shall be deemed and construed to include any other
gender, masculine, feminine or neuter, and any other number, singular or
plural, as the context requires. The word " _including_ " or derivation
thereof shall mean including without limitation. Unless otherwise indicated
to the contrary herein by the context or use thereof, the words " _herein_
," " _hereto_ ," " _hereof_ " and words of similar import refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular section or paragraph hereof.
The parties intend that each representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement and other obligation contained herein shall have independent
significance. If any party has Breached any representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement or other obligation contained herein in any
respect, the fact that there exists another representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement or other obligation relating to the same
subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity) that the
party has not Breached shall not detract from or mitigate the fact that the
party is in Breach of the first representation, warranty, covenant, agreement
or obligation.

  



  

9.11 Counterparts

  



  

(a) This Agreement may be executed and delivered in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all
of which together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an
executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile, .pdf
or other electronic means shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart to the Agreement.

without further action by the parties hereto, become a party to this Agreement
as a Shareholder (and to any other applicable Operative Document in the

of any such Option shall constitute Stock under this Agreement. Any such
Optionee, upon exercise of an Option and execution (and delivery to Buyer) of
a counterpart signature page to this Agreement (and any other applicable
Operative Document), shall be treated as if he, she or it had been an
original party hereto as a Shareholder (and thereto in the applicable
capacity), including with respect to the representations and warranties set
forth in Article II and Article IIA and Exhibits II and III, the covenants in
Article VI, the appointment of the Shareholder Representative and the
indemnification obligations in Article VIII. No consent of the original
parties hereto shall be required to carry the foregoing into effect. Each time
an Optionee exercises an Option, the Company shall update Exhibit A and
_Schedule 1.2.4 to the Disclosure Memorandum_ to reflect the addition of
such Optionee as a Shareholder and the exercise of such Option. All
representations made hereunder with respect to Schedule 1.2.4 shall be deemed

third parties or by any loss arising by error, failure or delay in making of
an investment or reinvestment, and the Escrow Agent shall not be liable for

portion thereof is to be released under this Escrow Agreement, the Escrow
Agent shall cause the Permitted Investments to be converted into cash,
