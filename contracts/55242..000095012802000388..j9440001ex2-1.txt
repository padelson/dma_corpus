reasonable opportunity to inquire as to Seller's preparation of the Statement.
After the Closing Date, at Seller's request, Purchaser shall assist, and shall
cause the

                                                                               4


Acquired Companies and their respective subsidiaries (as defined in Section
10.05(b)) to assist Seller and its representatives in the preparation of the
Statement and shall provide Seller and its representatives any information
reasonably requested and shall provide them access at all reasonable times to
the personnel, properties, books and records of the Acquired Companies and their
respective subsidiaries for such purpose.

     (b) OBJECTIONS; RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES. (1) Unless Purchaser notifies
Seller in writing within 30 days after Seller's delivery of the Statement of any
objection to any component of the computation of Closing Net Assets set forth
therein (the "NOTICE OF OBJECTION"), such computation shall be final and
binding. During such 30-day period Purchaser and its representatives shall be
permitted to review the working papers of Seller relating to the Statement. Any
Notice of Objection shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for the
objections set forth therein. Any Notice of Objection shall include only
objections based on (i) mathematical errors in the computation of Closing Net
Assets or (ii) Closing Net Assets not having been calculated in accordance with
the consistent application of the accounting principles, practices,
methodologies and policies used in the preparation of the Reference Statement
(after taking into consideration the provisions of Schedule 1.04(a)). Seller and
Purchaser acknowledge that (i) the sole purpose of the determination of Closing
Net Assets is to adjust the Purchase Price so as to reflect the change in Net
Assets from December 31, 2001, to the Closing Date and (ii) such change is to be
measured on a totally consistent basis so that the calculation is to be done
using the same accounting principles, practices, methodologies and policies used
in the preparation of the Reference Statement, except as provided in Schedule
1.04(a).

     (2) If Purchaser provides the Notice of Objection to Seller within such
30-day period, Purchaser and Seller shall, during the 30-day period following
Seller's receipt of the Notice of Objection, attempt in good faith to resolve
Purchaser's objections. During the 30-day period following Seller's receipt of
the Notice of Objection, Seller and its representatives shall be permitted to
review the working papers of Purchaser and its representatives relating to the
Notice of Objection and the basis therefor. If Purchaser and Seller are unable
to resolve all such objections within such 30-day period, the matters remaining
in dispute shall

                                                                               5


be submitted to an internationally recognized public accounting firm mutually
agreed upon by Purchaser and Seller (or, if Purchaser and Seller are unable to
so agree within 10 days after the end of such 30-day period or the firm so
selected declines to act, then Purchaser and Seller shall each select an
internationally recognized public accounting firm and such firms shall jointly
select a third internationally recognized firm to resolve the disputed matters
(such determining firm being the "INDEPENDENT EXPERT")). The parties shall
instruct the Independent Expert to render its reasoned written decision as
promptly as practicable but in no event later than 60 days after its selection.
The resolution of disputed items by the Independent Expert shall be final and
binding, and the determination of the Independent Expert shall constitute an
arbitral award that is final, binding and non-appealable and upon which a
judgment may be entered by a court having jurisdiction thereover. The fees and
expenses of the Independent Expert shall be borne 50% by Purchaser and 50% by
Seller. After final determination of Closing Net Assets, Purchaser shall have no
further right to make any claims against Seller in respect of any post-Closing
Purchase Price adjustment hereunder.

     (c) ADJUSTMENT PAYMENT. The Purchase Price shall be increased by the amount
by which Closing Net Assets exceed (euro)126,865,000 (the "REFERENCE NET
ASSETS"), and the Purchase Price shall be decreased by the amount by which
Closing Net Assets are less than the Reference Net Assets (the Purchase Price,
as so increased or decreased, being hereinafter called the "ADJUSTED PURCHASE
PRICE"). Within 10 days after Closing Net Assets have been finally determined in
accordance with Section 1.04(b), (i) if the Purchase Price is less than the
Adjusted Purchase Price, Purchaser shall pay to Seller an amount equal to such
difference, together with interest thereon at a rate of 3% per annum from the
Closing Date to the date of payment, and (ii) if the Purchase Price is greater
than the Adjusted Purchase Price, Seller shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal
to such difference, together with interest thereon at a rate of 3% per annum
from the Closing Date to the date of payment. Any such payment hereunder shall
be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
in writing by Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be.

     (d) NET ASSETS. The term "NET ASSETS" means Total Assets minus Total
Liabilities. The terms "TOTAL ASSETS" and "TOTAL LIABILITIES" mean the total
assets and total liabilities, respectively, of the Acquired Companies and their
respective subsidiaries, calculated in the same way, using the same accounting
principles, practices, methodologies and policies, as the line items comprising
total assets and total liabilities, respectively, on the Reference Statement
(except as provided in Schedule 1.04(a)); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Total Assets
and Total Liabilities shall be adjusted to the extent necessary so as to exclude
any purchase accounting adjustments to the accounting books and records for
financial reporting purposes which may be recorded by the Acquired Companies or
any of their respective subsidiaries as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of the preparation of the
Statement, Total Assets and Total Liabilities that are denominated in currencies
other than the euro shall be translated into euro using (i) for the currencies
set forth in Schedule 1.04(d), the applicable exchange rates set forth therein
and (ii) for all other currencies, the exchange rates for the applicable
currencies as of December 20, 2001, as reflected in the Financial Statements for
December 31, 2001.

     (e) POST-CLOSING BOOKS AND RECORDS. Except for the consummation of the
Closing, Purchaser and Seller agree that on the Closing Date itself the Acquired
Companies shall, and shall cause their respective subsidiaries to, conduct their
respective businesses in the ordinary course in a manner substantially
consistent with past practice. Following the Closing, Purchaser shall not take
any action with respect to the accounting books and records of any Acquired
Company or any of its subsidiaries on which the Statement is to be based that is
not consistent with the past practices of such Acquired Company and its
subsidiaries and which would affect the Reference Statement or the Statement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no changes shall be made in
any reserve or other account existing as of the date of the Reference Statement,
except as a result of events occurring after the date of the Reference Statement
and, in such event, only in a manner consistent with the past practices of the
Acquired Companies and their respective subsidiaries.

     SECTION 5.04. REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS. (a) On the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, each party shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Closing to occur, including taking all actions and doing all things
necessary to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on
it or any of its affiliates with respect to the Closing and cooperating with the

permit any of their respective affiliates to, take any actions that would, or
that could reasonably be expected to, result in any of the conditions set forth

use reasonable best efforts to prepare all documentation, to effect all filings
and to obtain all Consents and Permits of all Governmental Entities necessary to

it will consult with the other with respect to obtaining the Consents and
Permits referred to in the immediately preceding sentence and will keep each
other apprised of the status of material matters relating to the consummation of
the Acquisition. For purposes of this Section 5.04, the

"reasonable best efforts" of Purchaser shall include promptly opposing any
motion or action for a temporary, preliminary or permanent injunction against
the Acquisition, but shall not require Purchaser or its affiliates to (x) enter
into a consent decree or (y) commit, in each case, to hold separate or divest
any products and assets of any of the Acquired Companies and any of their
respective subsidiaries or Purchaser and its affiliates, as the case may be, as

     (c) Purchaser acknowledges that certain consents and waivers with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be required from parties
to Contracts to which an Acquired Company or a subsidiary of an Acquired Company
is a party and that such consents and waivers have not been obtained. Purchaser
agrees that Seller and its affiliates shall not have any liability whatsoever to
Purchaser arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any consents or
waivers that may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or because of the termination of any Contract as a result
thereof. Purchaser further agrees that no representation, warranty or covenant
of Seller contained herein shall be breached or deemed breached, and no
condition shall be deemed not satisfied, as a result of (i) the failure to
obtain any such consent or waiver, (ii) any such termination or (iii) any
lawsuit, action, proceeding or investigation commenced or threatened by or on
behalf of any person arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any
such consent or any such termination. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and
shall cause each of the Acquired Companies and each subsidiary of an Acquired
Company to, cooperate with Purchaser, upon the request of Purchaser, in any
reasonable manner in connection with Purchaser obtaining any such consents and
waivers; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such cooperation shall not include any
requirement of Seller or any of its affiliates (including the Acquired Companies
and their respective subsidiaries) to expend money, commence, defend or
participate in any litigation or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or
otherwise) to any third party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 5.04(c), on or prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall have caused to be
terminated all obligations of Milacron Germany under the Credit Agreement (as
defined in Schedule 2.04 hereto).

workers councils or similar bodies, collective bargaining and collective labor
agreements and any other contractual commitments relating to any Affected
Employee (collectively, the "EMPLOYMENT REGULATIONS") to which an Acquired
Company or a subsidiary of an Acquired Company is a party or by which it is
bound. In addition, on and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause each of
the Acquired Companies and their respective subsidiaries to comply with all

long-term disability, military leave, jury duty and death leave).

          (b) CONTINUATION OF BENEFITS. For the twelve-month period immediately
following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause each of the Acquired Companies
and their respective subsidiaries to continue to provide to the Affected
Employees benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those
benefits provided to such employees under the Employment Regulations in effect
immediately prior to the Closing Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing in this
Agreement shall be deemed to obligate Purchaser to continue the employment of
any Affected Employee following the Closing Date, except as required by any
Employment Regulation or Applicable Law.

                                                                              43


          (c) SEVERANCE. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Purchaser shall cause each of the Acquired Companies and their

          (e) ADMINISTRATION. Following the date of this Agreement, Seller,
Parent and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate in all matters reasonably
necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this Section 5.06,

          (iii) As to Tax Returns (other than Income Tax Returns) of the

          (b) STRADDLE PERIOD TAX RETURNS. (i) As to any Tax Return of the
Acquired Companies and their respective subsidiaries for a tax period that
begins before and ends after the Closing Date (a "STRADDLE PERIOD"), Purchaser
shall cause any applicable Acquired Company and its subsidiaries to prepare and
timely file such Return and pay all Taxes due with respect thereto; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that (1) Purchaser shall deliver any such Return to Seller at least 20
business days before it is due, except for any such Return due within 30
business days after the Closing Date, which shall be delivered to Seller as soon
as commercially practicable prior to the date such Return is due, (2) Seller

                                                                              46

apply), unless such a Tax Return would be clearly contrary to Applicable Law.

          (iii) Any dispute between the parties under this Section 5.07(b) shall
be resolved by the Independent Expert under the principles of Section
1.04(b)(2), except that every effort shall be made by the parties and the

          (c) TRANSFER TAX RETURNS. Purchaser shall pay all Transfer Taxes;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that each of Seller, the Acquired Companies and Purchaser

exemption.

          (d) AMENDED TAX RETURNS. After the Closing Date, the Acquired

shall cause their respective affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors
and representatives reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax
Returns of the Acquired Companies and their respective subsidiaries, including
maintaining and making available to each other all records necessary in

all taxable periods relating to Taxes. Seller and its affiliates will need
access, from time to time after the Closing Date, to certain accounting and Tax
records and information held by the Acquired Companies and their respective
subsidiaries to the extent such records and information pertain to events
occurring prior to the Closing Date; therefore, Purchaser shall, and shall cause
each Acquired Company and each subsidiary of an Acquired Company to, (i) use its
reasonable best efforts to properly retain and maintain such records until such
time as Seller agrees that such retention and maintenance is no longer
necessary, and (ii) allow Seller and its agents and representatives (and agents
or representatives of any of its affiliates), at times and dates mutually
acceptable to the parties, to

<PAGE>

                                                                              47

inspect, review and make copies of such records as Seller may deem necessary or
appropriate from time to time, such activities to be conducted during normal
business hours and at Seller's expense.

          (f) REFUNDS AND CREDITS. Any refund or credit of Income Taxes of any
of the Acquired Companies or any of their respective subsidiaries for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be for the account of Seller (excluding refunds or
credits arising as a result of the carryback of losses generated from any
Post-Closing Tax Period (as defined below)). Any refund or credit of Income
Taxes of any of the Acquired Companies or any of their respective subsidiaries
for any taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date (a
"POST-CLOSING TAX PERIOD") shall be for the account of Purchaser. Purchaser
shall, if Seller so requests and at Seller's expense, cause any of the Acquired
Companies or any of their respective subsidiaries to file for and obtain any
refunds or credits to which Seller is entitled under this Section 5.07(f).
Purchaser and the Acquired Companies shall permit Seller to control the
prosecution of any such refund claim. If Seller pays (or causes any of the
Acquired Companies or any of their respective subsidiaries to pay prior to the
Closing Date) estimated Income Taxes for any Straddle Period in excess of the
amount ultimately determined to be due for the portion of such Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date and Purchaser obtains the benefit of such excess
payment, Purchaser shall promptly refund such excess to Seller.

          (g) TAX SHARING AGREEMENTS. Seller shall cause the provisions of any
Tax sharing agreement (or any equivalent thereof, including profit and loss
sharing agreements) between Seller or any of its affiliates (other than the
Acquired Companies and any of their respective subsidiaries), and any of the
Acquired Companies or any of their respective subsidiaries, to be terminated on
or before the Closing Date. After the Closing Date, no party shall have any
rights or obligations under any such Tax sharing agreement.

          (h) CLOSING DATE. On the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause each
Acquired Company and each subsidiary of an Acquired Company to conduct its
business in the ordinary course in substantially the same manner as currently
conducted and on the Closing Date shall not permit any of the Acquired Companies
or any of their respective

                                                                              48

subsidiaries to effect any extraordinary transactions (other than any such
transactions expressly required by Applicable Law or by this Agreement) that
could result in (a) any Tax liability to Seller or any of its affiliates or any
indemnification obligation of Seller for the payment of Taxes under Section
8.01(a) or Section 8.02 or (b) any Tax liability to any of the Acquired
Companies or any of their respective subsidiaries in excess of Tax liability
associated with the conduct of their respective business in the ordinary course.

          SECTION 5.08. PUBLICITY. From the date hereof through the Closing
Date, no public release or announcement concerning the transactions contemplated
hereby (other than the transactions contemplated in Schedule 5.15) shall be
issued by any party without the prior consent of the other parties (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as such release
or announcement may be required by Applicable Law or the rules or regulations of
any U.S. or non-U.S. securities exchange, in which case the party required to
make the release or announcement shall allow the other parties reasonable time
to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that each of the parties may make internal announcements to
their respective employees that are consistent with the parties' prior public
disclosures regarding the transactions contemplated hereby.

          SECTION 5.09. RESIGNATIONS. On the Closing Date, Seller shall cause to
be delivered to Purchaser duly signed resignations (from the applicable board of
directors or supervisory board), effective immediately after the Closing, of all
directors and supervisory board members (other than any directors or supervisory
board members that were appointed on such boards as representatives of the
employees of an Acquired Company or a subsidiary of an Acquired Company) of each
of the Acquired Companies and each of their respective subsidiaries who are not
employees of any of the Acquired Companies or their respective subsidiaries and
shall take such other action as is necessary to accomplish the foregoing;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that this covenant shall not apply to the directors of Widia
India.

         SECTION 5.10. NO USE OF CERTAIN NAMES. (a) Purchaser shall cause each
Acquired Company and each subsidiary of an Acquired Company promptly, and in any
event (i) within 90 days after the Closing, to revise print

(as defined below), except to the extent such use is permitted under the License
Agreement and (ii) within 60 days after the Closing, to change Internet domain

will not order any new print advertising, product labeling, signage or
stationery, or create any new information or other materials, which uses the
Milacron Names after the Closing, except with respect to the use of Milacron
Names permitted under the License Agreement. Except as otherwise provided in the
License Agreement, in no event shall Purchaser, the Acquired Companies or their
respective subsidiaries use any Milacron Names after the Closing in any manner
or for any purpose different from the use of such Milacron Names by the Acquired
Companies and their respective subsidiaries, as the case may be, during the
90-day period preceding the Closing. Within 60 days after the Closing, Purchaser
shall cause each Acquired Company and each subsidiary of an Acquired Company to
file applications to amend or terminate any certificate of assumed name or d/b/a
or non-U.S. filings so as to eliminate the right of the Acquired Companies and
their respective subsidiaries to use the Milacron Names for corporate
identification purposes. Immediately prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause
the names of each Acquired Company and each subsidiary of an Acquired Company
(in each case, to the extent they make use of the Milacron Names) to be changed
to names (that do not include the Milacron Names) selected by Purchaser.
"MILACRON NAMES" means "Milacron", "Valenite", "Modco" or any name, symbol, logo
or trademark that includes "Milacron", "Valenite" or "Modco", any variations and
derivatives thereof and any other names, logos, symbols or trademarks of Parent,
Seller or their respective affiliates not included in Schedule 2.08.

          (b) Parent and Seller shall, or shall cause their respective
subsidiaries to, promptly, and in any event (i) within 90 days after the
Closing, revise print advertising and product labeling to delete all references
to the Widia Names (as defined below), except to the extent such use is
permitted under the License Agreement and (ii) within 60 days after the Closing,

discontinue use of the Widia Names for corporate identification purposes. Parent
and Seller agree that

<PAGE>

                                                                              50

neither they nor their respective subsidiaries will order any new print
advertising, product labeling, signage or stationery, or create any new
information or other materials, which uses the Widia Names after the Closing,
except with respect to the use of Widia Names permitted under the License
Agreement. Except as otherwise provided in the License Agreement, in no event
shall Parent, Seller or their respective subsidiaries use any Widia Names after
the Closing in any manner or for any purpose different from the use of such
Widia Names by Parent, Seller and their respective subsidiaries, as the case may
be, during the 90-day period preceding the Closing. Within 60 days after the
Closing, Parent and Seller shall, or shall cause their respective subsidiaries
to, file applications to amend or terminate any certificate of assumed name or
d/b/a or non-U.S. filings so as to eliminate the right of Parent, Seller and
their respective subsidiaries to use the Widia Names for corporate
identification purposes. "WIDIA NAMES" means "Widia", "Heinlein", "Werko" or any
name, symbol, logo or trademark that includes "Widia", "Heinlein" or "Werko",
any variations and derivatives thereof and any other names, logos, symbols or
trademarks of the Acquired Companies and their respective subsidiaries,
including those set forth in Schedule 2.08.

          SECTION 5.11. NO FURTHER FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS. Purchaser acknowledges
that in the course of conduct by the Acquired Companies and their respective
subsidiaries of their respective businesses, Parent, Seller and their respective
affiliates (collectively, but excluding the Acquired Companies and their
respective subsidiaries, the "SELLER ENTITIES") entered into various
arrangements (i) in which guarantees were issued by the Seller Entities or (ii)
in which the Seller Entities are the primary obligors on other agreements, in
any such case to support or facilitate business transactions or programs of the
Acquired Companies and their respective subsidiaries. The financing or other
arrangements referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) are hereinafter
referred to as the "GUARANTEES". The Guarantees are set forth in Schedule 5.11.
It is understood that the Guarantees shall not continue after the Closing.
Purchaser agrees that Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
replacement Guarantees which will be in effect at the Closing or, in the case of
Guarantees described in the foregoing clause (ii), will either terminate the
business transactions or programs of the Acquired Companies and their

<PAGE>

                                                                              51

respective subsidiaries supported or facilitated by such Guarantees or arrange
for itself or one of its subsidiaries to be substituted as the primary obligor
thereon as of the Closing Date. In the event that Purchaser is unable to satisfy
the terms of the immediately preceding sentence, Purchaser and its affiliates
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller Entities from and against
any and all Losses (as defined in Section 8.02) incurred by the Seller Entities
relating to the Guarantees.

          SECTION 5.12. SUPPORT SERVICES. Purchaser acknowledges that as of the
Closing Date, Parent and Seller shall have no obligation to provide any support
or other services to any of the Acquired Companies or any of their respective
subsidiaries (including any of the services for which allocations were
previously paid by the Acquired Companies or their respective subsidiaries).

          SECTION 5.13. POST-CLOSING INFORMATION. Following the Closing, upon
reasonable written notice to Purchaser, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the
Acquired Companies and their respective subsidiaries to, afford to Seller and
its affiliates reasonable access to the personnel, properties, books, contracts,
commitments and records of the Acquired Companies and their respective
subsidiaries for any reasonable business purpose, including in respect of
litigation, insurance matters and financial reporting of Seller and its
affiliates; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such access does not unreasonably disrupt
the normal operations of the Acquired Companies and their respective
subsidiaries.

          SECTION 5.14. LITIGATION MATTERS. With respect to any Proceeding or
arbitration by or against an Acquired Company or a subsidiary of an Acquired
Company (excluding any such Proceeding or arbitration between Parent or any of
its affiliates, on the one hand, and Purchaser or any of its affiliates, on the
other hand) (collectively, the "ACTIONS"), to the extent relating to the period
prior to the Closing, Purchaser, on the one hand, and Parent and Seller, on the
other hand, shall, upon the reasonable request of the other, provide reasonable
cooperation and assistance to the other at the requesting party's sole expense
in connection therewith. Prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser and Seller shall

Seller shall (x) promptly deliver to Widia Italy the case files relating to the
Italian Actions and (y) provide reasonable cooperation and assistance to Widia
Italy at Widia Italy's sole expense in connection with the assumption by Widia
Italy of the Italian Actions. Neither Parent nor Seller shall be required by
this Section 5.14 to take any action that would interfere with the conduct of
their business or disrupt their normal operations. In the event that Parent,
Seller or one of their respective affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies
and any of their respective subsidiaries) is a party to or affected by any
Action, Parent or Seller, as the case may be, may, at its own cost and expense,
continue to control the prosecution, defense and/or settlement and all other
aspects of the administration of that portion of such Action that relates to or
affects Parent, Seller or any of their respective affiliates (other than the
Acquired Companies and any of their respective subsidiaries), as applicable.

assertion of any claim by a third party or the imposition of any penalty or
assessment (in each case other than with respect to Taxes) for which indemnity
may be sought under Section 8.02 or 8.03 (a "THIRD PARTY CLAIM"), and such
Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnity pursuant to this Article VIII, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly provide the other party (the "INDEMNIFYING
PARTY") with written notice of such Third Party Claim, stating the nature, basis
and the amount thereof, to the extent known, along with copies of the relevant
documents evidencing such Third Party Claim and the basis for indemnification
sought. Failure of the Indemnified Party to give such notice will not relieve
the Indemnifying Party from liability on account

<PAGE>

                                                                              65

of this indemnification, except if and to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
is actually prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party will have 30 days from
receipt of any such notice of a Third Party Claim to give notice to assume the
defense thereof. If notice to the effect set forth in the immediately preceding
sentence is given by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party will have
the right to assume the defense of the Indemnified Party against the Third Party
Claim with counsel of its choice. So long as the Indemnifying Party has assumed
the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance herewith, (A) the Indemnified
Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and
participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim, (B) the Indemnified Party
will not file any papers or consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into
any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party and (C) the Indemnifying Party will not (i)
admit to any wrongdoing or (ii) consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim to the extent such
judgment or settlement provides for equitable relief, in each case, without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (such written consent will not be
withheld or delayed unreasonably). The parties will use reasonable best efforts
to minimize Losses from Third Party Claims and will act in good faith in
responding to, defending against, settling or otherwise dealing with such
claims. The parties will also cooperate in any such defense and give each other
reasonable access to all information relevant thereto. Whether or not the
Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense, such Indemnifying Party will not be
obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder for any settlement
entered into or any judgment that was consented to without the Indemnifying
Party's prior written consent.

          (ii) PROCEDURES FOR NON-THIRD PARTY CLAIMS. The Indemnified Party will
notify the Indemnifying Party in writing promptly of its discovery of any matter
that does not involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be
collected from the Indemnified Party, giving rise to the claim of indemnity
pursuant hereto. The failure so to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability on account of this
indemnification, except only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
actually prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party will have 30 days from
receipt of any

                                                                              66

such notice to give notice of dispute of the claim to the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate and assist the Indemnifying Party in
determining the validity of any claim for indemnity by the Indemnified Party and
in otherwise resolving such matters. Such assistance and cooperation will
include providing reasonable access to and copies of information, records and
documents relating to such matters, furnishing employees to assist in the
investigation, defense and resolution of such matters and providing legal and
business assistance with respect to such matters.

          (b) PROCEDURES RELATING TO INDEMNIFICATION OF TAX CLAIMS. (i) If one
party is responsible for the payment of Taxes pursuant to Section 8.01 or
Section 8.02 of this Agreement (the "TAX INDEMNIFYING PARTY"), and another party
to this Agreement (the "TAX INDEMNIFIED PARTY") receives a notice of deficiency,
proposed adjustment, adjustment, assessment, audit, examination, suit, dispute
or other claim (a "TAX CLAIM") with respect (in whole or in part) to such Taxes,
the Tax Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Tax Indemnifying Party in
writing of such Tax Claim. The Tax Indemnifying Party shall assume and control
the applicable audit or examination and the defense of a Tax Claim involving any
Taxes for which it has an obligation to indemnify the Tax Indemnified Party
pursuant to Section 8.01 or Section 8.02 of this Agreement, and the Tax
Indemnified Party and its affiliates agree to cooperate with the Tax
Indemnifying Party in pursuing such contest, including execution of any powers
of attorney in favor of the Tax Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, the Tax Indemnifying Party shall keep the Tax
Indemnified Party informed of all material developments and events relating to
such Tax Claim and the Tax Indemnified Party, at its own cost and expense and
with its own counsel, shall have the right to participate in (but not control)
the applicable audit or examination and defense of such Tax Claim.

          (ii) In no case shall any Tax Indemnified Party settle or otherwise
compromise any Tax Claim without the Tax Indemnifying Party's prior written
consent. None of the parties hereto shall settle a Tax Claim relating solely to
Income Taxes of any of the Acquired Companies or any of their respective
subsidiaries for a Straddle Period without the other party's prior written
consent.

          SECTION 8.05. LIMITATIONS ON TAX INDEMNIFICATION. Seller shall not
have an obligation to indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser or its affiliates
for the payment of Taxes pursuant to Section 8.01(a) or Section 8.02 unless
Seller receives a written notice of a claim for indemnification prior to the
time the applicable statute of limitation with respect to the liability for
Taxes in question expires. Seller shall be liable for Taxes pursuant to Section
8.01 or Section 8.02 or for a breach of Section 2.11 for Losses relating to the
payment of Taxes when and only to the extent Taxes have become due and payable
by any of the Purchaser Indemnitees and would not have been payable but for the
fact that causes a Loss under Section 8.01 or Section 8.02. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller's indemnification obligations
for a breach of Section 2.11(h) shall survive indefinitely.

          SECTION 8.06. LIMITATIONS ON INDEMNIFICATION. (a) Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Article VIII:

          (i) Seller shall not be responsible, pursuant to Section 8.02(i), for
     any indemnifiable Losses suffered by any Purchaser Indemnitee arising out
     of a breach of any representation or warranty of Parent or Seller included
     herein unless a claim therefor is asserted in writing prior to the close of
     business on the eighteenth month anniversary of the Closing Date, failing
     which such claim shall be waived and extinguished; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
     a claim with respect to a breach of (A) the representations and warranties
     of Seller set forth in Sections 2.02 or 2.05 to the extent it relates to
     title to the Shares may be made if asserted in writing at any time after
     the Closing Date, (B) the representations and warranties of Seller set
     forth in Sections 2.11(a) through (g) may be made if asserted in writing at
     any time after the Closing Date until 30 days following the applicable
     statute of limitations and (C) the representations and warranties of Seller
     set forth in Sections 2.14(b) or 2.14(c) may be made if asserted in writing
     prior to the close of business on the fourth-year anniversary of the
     Closing Date, in each case failing which such claims shall be waived and
     extinguished;

                                                                              68

          (ii) Seller shall not be liable, pursuant to Section 8.02(i) or
     Section 8.02(xi), for (w) any Losses suffered by any Purchaser Indemnitee
     arising out of any breach of the representations and warranties of Parent
     or Seller (other than the representations and warranties of Seller set
     forth in Sections 2.14(b) or 2.14(c)) or pursuant to Section 8.02(xi)
     unless the aggregate of all such Losses suffered by the Purchaser
     Indemnitees exceeds, on a cumulative basis, an amount equal to
     (euro)2,500,000, and then only to the extent of any such excess, (x) any
     Losses suffered by any Purchaser Indemnitee arising out of any breach of
     the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in Sections 2.14(b)
     or 2.14(c) unless the aggregate of all such Losses suffered by the
     Purchaser Indemnitees exceeds, on a cumulative basis, an amount equal to
     (euro)7,199,025 or (y) any individual items where the Loss relating thereto
     is less than (euro)7,500 and such items shall not be aggregated for
     purposes of the immediately preceding clauses (w) and (x); PROVIDED,
     HOWEVER, that this clause (ii) shall not be applicable to any Losses
     suffered by the Purchaser Indemnitees as a result of any breach of the
     representations and warranties of Seller set forth in Sections 2.02 or 2.05
     to the extent it relates to title to the Shares;

          (iii) the aggregate liability of Seller hereunder, pursuant to Section
     8.02(i) (except for any breach of the representations and warranties of
     Seller set forth in Sections 2.02 or 2.05 to the extent it relates to title
     to the Shares) and pursuant to Section 8.02(xi), for Losses suffered by the
     Purchaser Indemnitees shall in no event exceed (euro)84,726,990;

          (iv) the aggregate liability of Seller hereunder, pursuant to Section
     8.02(i) solely with respect to any breach of the representations and
     warranties of Seller set forth in Sections 2.02 or 2.05 to the extent it
     relates to title to the Shares for Losses suffered by the Purchaser
     Indemnitees shall in no event exceed (euro)188,282,202;

          (v) Seller shall have liability pursuant to Section 8.02(i) for Losses
     arising from any breach of the representations and warranties contained in
     Sections 2.14(b) or 2.14(c) only to the extent such Losses were incurred to
     comply with any applicable

<PAGE>

                                                                              69

     Environmental Laws or any order or directive arising thereunder; PROVIDED,
     HOWEVER, that Seller shall not have liability for such Losses to the extent
     Purchaser or any other party after Closing contributed to the condition or
     circumstance forming the basis of such Losses; and

          (vi) no party hereto shall be liable to the others for indirect,
     special, incidental, consequential or punitive damages claimed by such
     other parties under the terms of this Agreement.

          In no event shall Seller be obligated to indemnify Purchaser or any
other person with respect to any matter to the extent that Purchaser received a
benefit from the reflection of such matter in the result of the calculation of
the adjustment to the Purchase Price, if any, pursuant to Section 1.04(c).

          (b) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, (i) other than the
representations and warranties of Seller specifically contained in this
Agreement, none of Seller, the Acquired Companies, the subsidiaries of any of
the Acquired Companies or any other person has made any representation or
warranty either expressed or implied (A) with respect to the Acquired Companies
and their respective subsidiaries or their respective assets and liabilities,
the transactions contemplated hereby or the Shares or (B) as to the accuracy or
completeness of any information regarding the Acquired Companies and their
respective subsidiaries furnished or made available to Purchaser and its
representatives and (ii) Purchaser shall have no claim or right to
indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII and none of Parent, Seller, the
Acquired Companies, the subsidiaries of the Acquired Companies or any other
person shall have or be subject to any liability to Purchaser or any other
person with respect to any information, documents or materials furnished by
Parent, Seller, any of the Acquired Companies or any of their respective
affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents or advisors to Purchaser,
including the Confidential Information Memorandum relating to the Metalcutting
Tools Business of Parent dated February 2001 and the Confidential Information
Memorandum relating to the Metalworking Technologies Group of Parent dated
February 2001, both of which were prepared by Credit Suisse First Boston
Corporation, and any information, documents or material made

                                                                              70

available to Purchaser in certain "data rooms", management presentations or any
other form in expectation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

          (c) Purchaser further acknowledges and agrees that, should the Closing
occur, its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims relating
to this Agreement, the Acquired Companies and their respective subsidiaries or
their respective assets and liabilities, the transactions contemplated hereby
and the Shares (other than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud)
shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article
VIII. In furtherance of the foregoing, Purchaser (on behalf of itself and its
affiliates (including the Acquired Companies)) hereby waives, from and after the
Closing, any and all rights, claims and causes of action (other than claims of,
or causes of action arising from, fraud) Purchaser, any of the Acquired
Companies or any of their respective subsidiaries or any other Purchaser
Indemnitee may have against Seller or any of its affiliates arising under or
based upon any Federal, state, local or foreign statute, law, ordinance, rule or
regulation or otherwise (except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set
forth in this Article VIII).

          SECTION 8.07. CALCULATION OF INDEMNITY PAYMENTS. The amount of any
Loss for which indemnification is provided under this Article VIII shall be net
of any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under insurance
policies or under any underground storage tank or similar environmental
reimbursement program with respect to such Loss. The Indemnified Party agrees to
use its reasonable best efforts to pursue and collect on any recovery available
from any insurance policy available to it and to net any such recovery against
any claim for indemnification hereunder or, if an indemnification claim has
already been resolved, against the amount paid pursuant to such resolution. The
amount of any Loss with respect to Widia India for which indemnification is
provided under this Article VIII to the Purchaser Indemnitees shall be
calculated based on the percentage of the share capital of Widia India held,
directly or indirectly, by Purchaser as of the date such Loss is incurred.

          SECTION 8.08. TAX TREATMENT OF INDEMNIFICATION. For all Tax purposes,
Purchaser and Seller agree to treat

<PAGE>

                                                                              71

any indemnity payment under this Agreement as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price.

          SECTION 8.09. AUDIT ADJUSTMENTS RELATING TO INCOME TAXES. If as a
result of an Income Tax audit that involves any of the Acquired Companies or
their respective subsidiaries there is an adjustment to an item which results in
the Purchaser or Seller incurring a Tax detriment and the other party realizing
a corresponding Tax benefit, then the party receiving such Tax benefit will pay
to the other party the amount of such Tax benefit actually realized within 30
days, but only to the extent of such Tax detriment.

          SECTION 8.10. PARENT'S GUARANTEE OF INDEMNITY. (a) In order to induce
Purchaser to enter into this Agreement, Parent hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably guarantees to Purchaser and the other Purchaser Indemnitees the full
performance by Seller of its indemnification obligations, including the prompt
and complete payment by Seller when due, and at all times thereafter, of all
amounts payable by Seller, under Article VIII of this Agreement (the "GUARANTEED
OBLIGATIONS").

          (b) Parent waives any and all notice of the creation, renewal,
extension or accrual of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and notice of or proof
of reliance by Purchaser upon the provisions of this Section 8.10; and all
dealings between Seller or Parent, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other
hand, shall likewise conclusively be presumed to have been had or consummated in
reliance upon the provisions of this Section 8.10. Parent waives diligence,
presentment, protest, demand for payment and notice of default or nonpayment to
or upon Seller, any other guarantor or itself with respect to the Guaranteed
Obligations. The obligations of Parent under this Section 8.10 shall be
construed as a continuing, absolute and unconditional guaranty of payment (and
not of collection).

          (c) Purchaser agrees that notwithstanding anything contained herein to
the contrary, except as provided in the last sentence of this Section 8.10(c),
Parent shall not be obligated to pay any Guaranteed Obligations to the extent
that Seller is not required to pay its indemnification obligations to which such
Guaranteed Obligation relates as a result of any claim of offset, counterclaim
or other defense available to Seller with respect to its indemnification
obligations under this

<PAGE>

                                                                              72

Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements (collectively, "SELLER DEFENSES").
In furtherance thereof, Parent shall be entitled to assert as a valid defense to
payment of the Guaranteed Obligations by Parent hereunder, any Seller Defense to
the same extent that any such Seller Defense could be asserted by Seller in any
action brought by Purchaser to enforce its rights to indemnification under this
Article VIII against Seller. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Section 8.10(c), in no event shall any stay or discharge of the Guaranteed
Obligations as a result of any insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation
or reorganization of Seller or the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or
conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, Seller give rise to any
defense to payment by Parent under this Section 8.10.

          (d) The obligations of Parent under this Section 8.10 shall continue
to be effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time the
payment or any part thereof, of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded
or must otherwise be restored or returned by Purchaser upon the insolvency,
bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of Seller, or upon or as
a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or
trustee or similar officer for, Seller, all as though such payments had not been
made.

          (e) No failure or delay on the part of Purchaser in the exercise of
any power, right or privilege under this Section 8.10 shall impair such power,
right or privilege by being construed to be a waiver of any default or
acquiescence therein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such
power, right or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any
other right, power or privilege.

                                   ARTICLE IX

Acquired Company or any of the other employees of the Acquired Companies and
their respective subsidiaries set forth in Schedule 9.01 (such directors,
officers and other employees, collectively, the "COVERED PERSONS"); PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that the foregoing provisions shall not apply to (i) a general
advertisement or solicitation program that is not specifically targeted at the
Covered Persons, (ii) the solicitation of any Covered Person whose employment by
the applicable Acquired Company or subsidiary of an Acquired Company has been
terminated or (iii) in the case of Covered Persons who are non-employee
directors of an Acquired Company or a subsidiary of an Acquired Company, the
solicitation of such persons who no longer hold such directorship.

          SECTION 9.02. COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE. Except as provided in Section
9.03, for a period of three years from and after the Closing Date, each of
Seller and Parent shall not, and shall cause its subsidiaries not to, engage,
directly or indirectly, in the business of manufacturing, marketing or selling
of inserts, tool holders, tungsten carbide powder, carbide wear products
(including rods, dies, paper knives and seal rings), high speed steel and
carbide drills and taps, and other metalworking round tools (the "BUSINESS")
within Europe and India (the "GEOGRAPHIC AREA"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i)
Seller, Parent or their respective subsidiaries may own as a passive investment,
directly or indirectly, equity or equity-linked securities of any corporation or
other entity engaged in the Business if Seller, Parent or their respective
subsidiaries do not, directly or indirectly, beneficially own in the aggregate
more than 5% of the outstanding shares of such entity; (ii) Seller, Parent or
their respective subsidiaries may own as an investment, directly or indirectly,
any instrument of indebtedness of any corporation or other entity engaged in the
Business; and (iii) Seller, Parent or their respective subsidiaries may own any
corporation or other entity engaged in the Business within the Geographic Area
if such Business within the Geographic Area accounts for less than 20% of such
entity's consolidated annual revenues or assets; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Seller
shall dispose of any such corporation's or other entity's Business within the
Geographic Area within one year after the acquisition by Seller of such
corporation or other entity.

          SECTION 9.03. PERMITTED ACTIVITIES OF SELLER AND PARENT.

that supplies goods or services primarily to Seller, Parent or any of their
respective affiliates and (B) the provisions of Section 9.02 shall not apply to
the Valenite metalcutting tools business of Parent and its subsidiaries, which
is subject to the Widia Distribution Agreement and the Valenite Distribution
