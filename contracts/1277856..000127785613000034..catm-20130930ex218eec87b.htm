terms of the Group Covenant Deed by entering into an adherence agreement in an
appropriate form. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t8.6Each of the restrictions in each paragraph or sub-clause above

shall not be affected if any of the others is invalid. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t8.7If any of those restrictions is void but would be valid if some
part of the restriction were deleted, the restriction in question shall apply
with such modification as may be necessary to make it valid. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t8.8The Seller acknowledges that the above provisions of this clause

existing business to the extent it competes with the Business and none of the
Seller nor any of the Seller's Covenantors shall be required to procure
compliance by such person with any provision of this clause 8. For the
purposes of this clause 8.10, a third party shall be any person who is not at

Group. For the avoidance of doubt the restrictions as set out in this clause
8 shall continue to apply to the Seller's Covenantors notwithstanding such
acquisition. \t\t

guarantees, claims, securities, indemnities or other similar obligations
within a reasonable period of the Buyer becoming aware of such obligation
existing at Completion and given in respect of the liabilities or obligations
of any of the Group Companies (whether arising in respect of the period before
or after Completion) and the Buyer agrees with the Seller for itself and on
behalf of each of the Group Companies that pending such release and / or to

date of this Agreement under an insurance policy maintained by the Seller or
any other member of the Seller's Group in respect of any event which caused
loss or damage to a Group Company, the Seller shall or shall procure that the
applicable member of the Seller's Group shall remit any proceeds which it
receives during the period from 12 months prior to the date of this Agreement
up to Completion in respect of such a claim (less any deduction and
withholdings required by law) to the relevant Group Company within 30 days
after the Seller or such applicable member of the Seller's Group receives the
insurance proceeds. For the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer acknowledges and
