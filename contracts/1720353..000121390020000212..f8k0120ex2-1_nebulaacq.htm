7

 



    

  



  

(b) If any of the Share Targets set forth in _Section 2.03(a)_ shall have
been achieved, within five (5) Business Days following the achievement of the

(c) If a Change of Control of the ParentCo occurs prior to the second

unissued as of immediately prior to the consummation of such Change of
Control shall immediately vest and the Company Unitholders and the Blocker
Holder shall be entitled to receive such applicable Contingency Consideration
prior to the consummation of such Change of Control (payable to the Company
Unitholders and the Blocker Holder as specified on the Payment Spreadsheet).
For the purposes of this Agreement, a " _Change of Control_ " shall have been
deemed to occur with respect to ParentCo upon:

(50%) of the voting power of the capital stock of ParentCo entitled to vote
for the election of directors of ParentCo.

  



  

(d) The Contingency Consideration and the Share Targets shall be adjusted to
reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,

convertible into ParentCo Common Shares), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to ParentCo Common Shares, occurring on or after the

Consideration for each Company Unitholder and the breakdown of the Blocker

SECTION 2.05 _NAC Warrants_. At the First Effective Time, each NAC Warrant
that is outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time
after giving effect to the consummation of the Tender Offer shall, pursuant
to the NAC Warrant Instrument, cease to represent a right to acquire one
share of NAC Class A Common Stock and shall be converted in accordance with
the terms of such NAC Warrant, at the First Effective Time, into a right to
acquire one ParentCo Common Share (a " _ParentCo Warrant_ " and
collectively, the " _ParentCo Warrants_ ") on substantially the same terms as
were in effect immediately prior to the First Effective Time under the terms
of the NAC Warrant Instrument. The parties shall take all lawful action to
effect the aforesaid provisions of this _Section 2.05_ , including causing

the contrary, the Company and ParentCo shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any person pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with

ParentCo or the Company so withholds amounts and remits such amounts to the
applicable Governmental Authority, such amounts so withheld and remitted shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such
person. At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, ParentCo
and NAC shall (a) notify the Company or the Blocker, as applicable, of any
anticipated withholding with respect to the Company Merger Consideration or
the Blocker Consideration (other than from the failure of any Company
Unitholder to deliver to ParentCo or the Company an IRS Form W-9 with respect
to such Company Unitholder), (b) consult with the Company or the Blocker, as
applicable, in good faith to determine whether such deduction and withholding
is required under applicable Tax Law and (c) cooperate with the Company or
the Blocker, as applicable, in good faith to minimize the amount of any
applicable withholding.

  



  

SECTION 2.07 _Surrender and Payment_.

  



  

(a) Prior to the First Effective Time, NAC and ParentCo shall appoint an
exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") reasonably satisfactory to the

(collectively, the " _Certificates_ "), if any, representing NAC Class A
Common Stock, NAC Class B Common Stock, the remaining Blocker Shares after
giving effect to the Blocker Redemption and Company Membership Units, as

Consideration payable and issuable pursuant to the First Merger, the
Blocker Redemption, the Blocker Contribution and the Second Merger. All cash
and book-entry shares representing ParentCo Common Shares deposited by
ParentCo with the Exchange Agent for distribution pursuant to this _Article
II_ and the Payment Spreadsheet are referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Exchange Fund_." The Exchange Agent will, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions to be delivered to the Exchange Agent by NAC and ParentCo,
deliver the appropriate cash amount, if any, and ParentCo Common Shares out
of the Exchange Fund to Holders pursuant to the provisions of this _Article
II_ and, if applicable, the Payment Spreadsheet. The Exchange Fund will not
be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Agent will invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by ParentCo; _provided_ , that no
such investment or losses thereon will affect the consideration payable to
the Holders and ParentCo will promptly cause to be provided additional funds
to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the Holders in the amount of any
such losses. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
will be the property of, and shall be paid to, ParentCo.

(c) Each Holder, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), if any, together with a
properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, will be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the consideration payable pursuant to the provisions of
this _Article II_ and, if applicable, the Payment Spreadsheet in respect of
the shares of NAC Class A Common Stock, shares of NAC Class B Common Stock,
the remaining Blocker Shares after giving effect to the Blocker
Redemption and the Company Membership Units held by such Holder as of

Merger, as applicable. No interest will be paid or accrued on any
consideration payable to the Holders hereunder.

  



  

(d) After the First Effective Time, there will be no further registration of
transfers of NAC Class A Common Stock or NAC Class B Common Stock. From and
after the First Effective Time, the holders of shares of NAC Class A Common
Stock and NAC Class B Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the First
Effective Time will cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of
NAC Class A Common Stock or NAC Class B Common stock, as applicable, except
as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law. If, after the
First Effective Time, Certificates representing shares of NAC Class A Common
Stock or NAC Class B Common Stock are presented to the Exchange Agent or
ParentCo, they will be cancelled and exchanged for the consideration provided
for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth in this _Article II_.

  



  

(e) After the Second Effective Time, there will be no further registration of
transfers of Company Membership Units. From and after the Second
Effective Time, the Company Unitholders will cease to have any rights with
respect to the Company Membership Units, except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement or by applicable Law. If, after the Second Effective Time,
Certificates representing Company Membership Units are presented to the
Exchange Agent or ParentCo, they will be cancelled and exchanged for the
consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth
in this _Article II_ and the Payment Spreadsheet.

  



  

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the Holders
one year after the First Effective Time will be returned by the Exchange
Agent to ParentCo, upon demand, and any such Holder who has not exchanged
such Holder's NAC Class A Common Stock, NAC Class B Common Stock, the Blocker
Shares after giving effect to the Blocker Redemption or Company Membership
Units for the consideration payable pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article II_ and, if applicable, the Payment Spreadsheet prior to that time
will thereafter look only to ParentCo for delivery of such consideration.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither ParentCo nor any of its
Affiliates will be liable to any Holders for any consideration payable
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_ delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property Laws.

  



    

11

 



    



  

(g) No fractional shares of ParentCo Common Shares shall be issued by virtue
of the First Merger, the Blocker Contribution or the Second Merger. Each
Holder who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of
ParentCo Common Shares (after aggregating all fractional shares of ParentCo
Common shares issuable to such Holder) shall, in lieu of such fractional
share, be paid in cash the dollar amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent),
without interest, determined by multiplying such fraction by $10.00.

  



  

(h) If payment is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name
any Certificate surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition of
payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise in proper form for transfer and delivered to the Exchange Agent
with all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and that the
person requesting such payment pay any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered or establish to the satisfaction of the ParentCo that
such tax has been paid or is not applicable.

  



  

(i) In the event any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof, such consideration as may be required pursuant to this
_Article II_ and the Payment Spreadsheet; _provided_ , however, that ParentCo
may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof,
require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver an
agreement of indemnification in form reasonably satisfactory to ParentCo
(without the requirement of posting a bond).

time they were filed, or, if amended, as of the date of such amendment,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the

were made, not misleading. Each director and executive officer of NAC has
filed with the SEC on a timely basis all statements required with respect to
NAC by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations

respective dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein,

Effect). NAC has no off-balance sheet arrangements that are not disclosed in
the NAC SEC Reports. No financial statements other than those of NAC are
required by U.S. GAAP to be included in the consolidated financial statements
of NAC.

  



  

(c) NAC does not have any liabilities or obligations of a nature (whether

Closing, payments required to be paid to Redeeming Stockholders) invested in
the Trust Fund, pursuant to the Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated
as of January 9, 2018, between American Stock Transfer and Trust Company and
NAC (the " _Trust Agreement_ "). The Trust Agreement is valid and in full
force and effect and enforceable in accordance with its terms and has not
been amended or modified. There are no separate agreements, side letters or
other agreements or understandings (whether written or unwritten, express or
implied) that would cause the description of the Trust Agreement in the NAC
SEC Reports to be inaccurate in any material respect and/or that would entitle
any person (other than stockholders of NAC holding shares of NAC Class A
Common Stock sold in NAC's initial public offering who shall have elected to
redeem their shares of NAC Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Organizational
Documents of NAC and the Trust Agreement) to any portion of the proceeds in
the Trust Fund. Prior to the Closing, none of the funds held in the Trust Fund
may be released except in accordance with the Trust Agreement and NAC's
Organizational Documents. Amounts in the Trust Fund are invested in
United States "government securities" within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16)
of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 180 days or less or in
money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated
under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government
treasury obligations. NAC has performed all material obligations required to
be performed by it under, and is not in material default or delinquent in
performance or any other respect (claimed or actual) in connection with, the
Trust Agreement, and, to the knowledge of NAC, no event has occurred which,
with due notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default
thereunder. There are no claims or proceedings pending with respect to the
Trust Fund. Since January 9, 2018, NAC has not released any money from the
Trust Fund (other than interest income earned on the principal held in the
Trust Fund as permitted by the Trust Agreement). As of the First Effective
Time, the obligations of NAC to dissolve or liquidate pursuant to NAC's
Organizational Documents shall terminate, and as of the First Effective Time,
NAC shall have no obligation whatsoever pursuant to NAC's Organizational
Documents to dissolve and liquidate the assets of NAC by reason of the
consummation of the Transactions, and following the First Effective Time, no
NAC stockholder shall be entitled to receive any amount from the Trust Fund
except to the extent such NAC stockholder is a Redeeming Stockholder. NAC has
no reason to believe that, as of the First Effective Time, any of the
conditions to the use of funds in the Trust Fund will not be satisfied or
funds available in the Trust Fund will not be available to ParentCo or any of
its Affiliates on the Closing Date, other than with respect to satisfy any
redemption payments owed to Redeeming Stockholders.

SECTION 6.04 _Claims Against Trust Fund_.

  



  

(a) The Company, Blocker and the Blocker Holder understands that, except for
a portion of the interest earned on the amounts held in the trust fund
established by NAC for the benefit of its stockholders (the " _Trust Fund_
"), NAC may disburse or cause to be disbursed monies from the Trust Fund
only: (i) to Redeeming Stockholders who exercise their Redemption Rights or in
the event of the dissolution and liquidation of NAC; (ii) to NAC (less NAC's
deferred underwriting compensation only) after NAC consummates a
business combination; or (iii) as consideration to the sellers of a target
business with which NAC completes a business combination.

  



  

(b) The Company, Blocker and the Blocker Holder agree that, notwithstanding
any other provision contained in this Agreement, the Company, Blocker and
the Blocker Holder do not now have, and shall not at any time prior to the
Second Effective Time have, any claim to, or make any claim against, the
Trust Fund, regardless of whether such claim arises as a result of, in
connection with or relating in any way to, the business relationship between
the Company on the one hand, and NAC on the other hand, this Agreement, or any
other agreement or any other matter, and regardless of whether such claim
arises based on contract, tort, equity or any other theory of legal
liability (any and all such claims are collectively referred to in this
_Section 6.04(b)_ as the " _Claims_ "). Notwithstanding any other provision
contained in this Agreement, the Company, Blocker and the Blocker Holder
hereby irrevocably waive any Claim it may have, now or in the future (in each
case, however, prior to the consummation of a business combination), and will
not seek recourse against the Trust Fund for any reason whatsoever in respect
thereof; _provided_ , however, that the foregoing waiver will not limit or
prohibit or limit the Company, Blocker and the Blocker Holder from (i)
pursuing a claim against NAC or the stockholders of NAC pursuant to this
Agreement for specific performance or other equitable relief in connection
with the Transactions or (ii) pursuing any claims that the Company, Blocker
and the Blocker Holder may have against NAC's assets or funds that are
not held in the Trust Fund. In the event that the Company, Blocker or the
Blocker Holder commences any action or proceeding based upon, in connection
with, relating to or arising out of any matter relating to NAC which
proceeding seeks, in whole or in part, relief against the Trust Fund in
violation of the foregoing, NAC shall be entitled to recover from the Company,
Blocker or the Blocker Holder the associated legal fees and costs in
connection with any such action, in the event NAC prevails in such action or
proceeding.

SECTION 7.08 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

  



  

(a) With respect to each person who is an employee of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Closing (a " _Continuing Employee_
"), for the period beginning on the Closing Date, and ending on the six month
anniversary of the date of this Agreement, or, in each case, if earlier, on
the date of the termination of employment of the relevant Continuing Employee
(the " _Continuation Period_ "), the Company or such Company Subsidiary, as
applicable, shall provide each such Continuing Employee with (i) a base
salary or base wage rate and cash incentive compensation and commission
opportunities (excluding equity compensation opportunities) that are no less
favorable to the Continuing Employee's base salary or base wage rate and cash
incentive compensation and commission opportunities (excluding equity
compensation opportunities) in effect for such Continuing Employee as of
immediately prior to the Closing, and (ii) with employee retirement, health,
welfare and other material fringe benefits (excluding any defined benefit
pension plans and equity compensation plans) that are substantially similar,
in the aggregate, to those being provided or made available to such
Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing under the Company
Employee Benefit Plans.

  



    

51

 



    



  

(b) For purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting and, with respect
to the determination of the level or amount of benefits for the Continuation
Period and, benefit accrual under the benefit and compensation plans,
programs, agreements and arrangements of ParentCo, NAC, the Company or any of
their respective Affiliates (the " _NAC Plans_ ") in which Continuing
Employees are eligible to participate following the Closing, other than any
retiree medical plan, equity compensation plan and/or defined benefit plan,
ParentCo, NAC, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries shall credit each
Continuing Employee with his or her years of service with the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries and any predecessor entities, to the same extent as such
Continuing Employee was entitled immediately prior to the Closing to credit
for such service under any similar Company Employee Benefit Plan, except where
such credit would result in a duplication of benefits. ParentCo shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
each Continuing Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without
any waiting time, in any and all NAC Plans that are group health plans to the
extent coverage under such NAC Plan replaces coverage under a substantially
similar Company Employee Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participated immediately before such replacement to the extent such waiting
time was met under such Company Employee Benefit Plan. For purposes of each
NAC Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to
any Continuing Employee, ParentCo shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such NAC Plan to be waived for
such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents to the extent such
requirements were met or not applicable under the corresponding
Company Employee Benefit Plan, and ParentCo shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any eligible
expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents under a Company Employee Benefit Plan during the portion of the
plan year prior to the Closing Date to be taken into account under such NAC
Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-insurance, co-payment and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such NAC Plan.

  



  

(c) The provisions of this _Section 7.08_ are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no provision of this _Section 7.08_  shall
constitute or be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for any period of time
for, or preclude the ability of ParentCo, NAC or the Company (or any of their
Affiliates) to terminate, any Continuing Employee, other employee or other
service provider for any reason, (ii) confer upon any person (including any
current or former director, officer or employee of, or consultant or
independent contractor to, ParentCo, NAC or the Company) any third party
beneficiary or other rights or remedies, (iii) establish, amend or modify any
NAC Plan, Company Employee Benefit Plan, or any or any other "employee benefit
plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any other benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by the ParentCo,
Company, the NAC, or any of their respective Affiliates, or (iv) alter or
limit the ability of the ParentCo or its Subsidiaries (including, after the
Closing Date, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) to amend, modify or
terminate any NAC Plan, Company Employee Benefit Plan or any other benefit or
employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date.

  



    

52

 



    



  

(d) As promptly as practicable after the Closing Date, the ParentCo Board
shall adopt the New Stock Incentive Plan.

  



  

SECTION 7.09 _Section 280G_. No later than ten (10) Business Days prior to
the Closing, the Company shall request from each person (each, a "
_Disqualified Individual_ ") to whom any payment or benefit is required or
proposed to be made in connection with the Transactions that could constitute
"parachute payments" under Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code (" _Section 280G
Payments_") execute a waiver agreement providing that such Disqualified
Individual has waived his or her right to receive some or all of such payment
or benefit (the " _Waived Benefits_ "), to the extent necessary so that all
remaining payments and benefits applicable to such Disqualified Individual
shall not be deemed a parachute payment, and accepting in substitution for the
Waived Benefits the right to receive the Waived Benefits if and only if
approved by the stockholders of the Company in a manner that complies with
Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code. No later than three (3) Business Days prior
to the Closing, the Company shall submit the Waived Benefits of each
Disqualified Individual who has executed a waiver in accordance with this
_Section 7.09_ for approval of the Company's stockholders and such
Disqualified Individual's right to receive the Waived Benefits shall be
conditioned upon receipt of the requisite approval by the Company's
stockholders in a manner that complies with Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the
Code. The Company shall provide NAC and its counsel with a copy of the Section
280G calculations, as well as any waiver agreement, the disclosure statement
and the stockholder consent contemplated by this _Section 7.09_ within a
reasonable time prior to delivery to each Disqualified Individual and the
stockholders of the Company of such waiver agreement, disclosure statement
and stockholder consent, respectively, and the Company shall consider in good
faith any changes reasonably requested by NAC or its counsel. Prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to NAC and its counsel evidence

State of Delaware without proof of actual damages or otherwise, in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the

of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from
attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum,
that the venue of the Action is improper, or that this Agreement or the
Transactions may not be enforced in or by any of the above-named courts.

  



  

SECTION 10.09 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the parties hereto hereby
waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law any right it
may have to a trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or
indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the

negotiate and enter into amendments to this Agreement for and on behalf of the
Securityholders, (ii) give and receive notices and other communications
relating to this Agreement and the Transactions on behalf of the
Securityholder, (iii) take or refrain from taking any actions (whether by
negotiation, settlement, litigation or otherwise) to resolve or settle all
matters and disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement and the
Transactions and (iv) take all actions necessary or appropriate in the
judgment of the Securityholder Representative for the accomplishment of the
foregoing, including with respect to any determination or dispute related to
the Contingency Consideration.

The Securityholder Representative shall have no liability to NAC, ParentCo,
Blocker, Merger Sub Corp, Merger Sub LLC, the Company or the Surviving Company
or any Securityholder with respect to actions taken or omitted to be taken,
except to the extent directly arising out of the Securityholder
Representative's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Securityholder
Representative shall be entitled to engage such counsel, experts and other
agents and consultants as it shall deem necessary in connection with
exercising its powers and performing its function hereunder and shall be
entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions and advice of such persons and
shall have no liability for such reliance. The Securityholder Representative
shall be entitled to reimbursement solely from the Securityholders (pro rata
in proportion to Cash Consideration and ParentCo Common Shares issuable to
such Securityholder at the Closing as set forth on the Payment
Spreadsheet) for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances
(including fees and disbursements of its counsel, experts and other
agents and consultants) incurred by the Securityholder Representative. The
Securityholders will (pro rata in proportion to Cash Consideration and
ParentCo Common Shares issuable to such Securityholder at the Closing as set
forth on the Payment Spreadsheet) indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Securityholder Representative from and against any and all losses,
liabilities, damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees,
costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and
their staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and shipment)
(collectively, " _Representative Losses_ ") arising out of or in connection
with the Securityholder Representative's execution and performance of this
Agreement, in each case as such Representative Loss is suffered or incurred;
_provided_ , that in the event that any such Representative Loss is
finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Securityholder Representative, the Securityholder
Representative will reimburse each Securityholder (pro rata in proportion to
Cash Consideration and ParentCo Common Shares issuable to such Securityholder
at the Closing as set forth on the Payment Spreadsheet) the amount of such
indemnified Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such gross
negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the Securityholder
Representative by the Securityholders, any such Representative Losses may be
recovered by the Securityholder Representative from the funds in the Expense
Fund; _provided_ , that while this section allows the Securityholder
Representative to be paid from the aforementioned sources of funds, this does
not relieve the Securityholders from their obligation to promptly pay such
Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent
the Securityholder Representative from seeking any remedies available to
it at law or otherwise. In no event will the Securityholder Representative be
required to advance its own funds on behalf of the Securityholders or
otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any
restrictions or limitations on liability or indemnification obligations of
the Securityholders set forth elsewhere in this Agreement are not intended to
be applicable to the indemnities provided to the Securityholder
Representative under this section. The Securityholders acknowledge and agree
that the foregoing indemnities will survive the Closing, the resignation or
removal of the Securityholder Representative or the termination of this
Agreement. Upon the Closing, the Company will wire an amount of $200,000 (the
" _Expense Fund_ ") to the Securityholder Representative, which will be used
for the purposes of paying directly, or reimbursing the Securityholder
Representative for, any third party expenses pursuant to this Agreement and
the agreements ancillary hereto. The Securityholders will not receive any
interest or earnings on the Expense Fund and irrevocably transfer and assign
to the Securityholder Representative any ownership right that they may
otherwise have had in any such interest or earnings. The Securityholder
Representative will not be liable for any loss of principal of the Expense
Fund other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Securityholder Representative will hold these funds separate from its
corporate funds, will not use these funds for its operating expenses or any
other corporate purposes and will not voluntarily make these funds available
to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. As soon as practicable
following the completion of the Securityholder Representative's
responsibilities, the Securityholder Representative will deliver
any remaining balance of the Expense Fund to the Exchange Agent for further
distribution to the Securityholders. For tax purposes, the Expense Fund will
be treated as having been received and voluntarily set aside by the
Securityholders at the time of Closing.

Material Adverse Effect or establish any standard of materiality to define
further the meaning of such terms for purposes of this Agreement.

EXHIBIT A

  



  

Subscription Agreement

  



    

  

Nebula Acquisition Corporation

  

Four Embarcadero Center, Suite 2350

  

San Francisco, California 94111

  



  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  



  

In connection with the proposed business combination (the " _Transaction_ ")
pursuant to the terms of that certain Business Combination Agreement, dated
as of the date hereof, as may be amended from time to time, by and among
Nebula Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "),
Open Lending, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (" _Open Lending_ "),
BRP Hold 11, Inc., a Delaware corporation, Nebula Parent Corp., a Delaware
corporation (" _Pubco_ "), NBLA Merger Sub LLC, a Texas limited liability
company, NBLA Merger Sub Corp., a Delaware corporation, and a Securityholder
Representative, which is expected to result in the mergers of each of the
Company and Open Lending into subsidiaries of Pubco, the undersigned desires
to subscribe for and purchase from the Company, and the Company desires to
sell to the undersigned, that number of shares of the Company's Class A
common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the " _Common Stock_ "), which will
convert into shares of common stock of Pubco (the " _Pubco Shares_ ") upon
consummation of the Transaction, set forth on the signature page hereof for a
purchase price of $10.00 per share (the " _Purchase Price_ "), on the terms
and subject to the conditions contained herein. In connection therewith, the
undersigned and the Company agree as follows:

  



  

1.  _Subscription_. The undersigned hereby irrevocably subscribes for and
agrees to purchase from the Company such number of shares of Common Stock as
is set forth on the signature page of this Subscription Agreement on the terms
and subject to the conditions provided for herein (the " _Shares_ "). The
undersigned understands and agrees that the Company reserves the right to
accept or reject the undersigned's subscription for the Shares for any reason
or for no reason, in whole or in part, at any time prior to its acceptance by
the Company, and the same shall be deemed to be accepted by the Company only
when this Subscription Agreement is signed by a duly authorized person by or
on behalf of the Company; the Company may do so in counterpart form. In the
event of rejection of the entire subscription by the Company or the
termination of this subscription in accordance with the terms hereof, the
undersigned's payment hereunder will be returned promptly (but not later than
two (2) business days thereafter) to the undersigned along with this
Subscription Agreement, and this Subscription Agreement shall have no
force or effect.

  



  

2.  _Closing_. The closing of the sale of the Shares contemplated hereby (the
" _Closing_ ") is contingent upon the substantially concurrent consummation
of the Transaction. The Closing shall occur on the date of, and immediately
prior to, the consummation of the Transaction. Following written notice from
(or on behalf of) the Company to the undersigned (the " _Closing Notice_ ")
that the Company reasonably expects (i) all conditions to the closing of the
Transaction to be satisfied or waived and (ii) the Closing to occur on a date
that is not less than five (5) business days from the date of the Closing
Notice, the undersigned shall deliver to the Company, at least two (2)
business days prior to the anticipated Closing date specified in the Closing
Notice (the " _Closing Date_ "), or such other time agreed to between the
Company and the undersigned, the subscription amount for the Shares by wire
transfer of United States dollars in immediately available funds to the
account specified by the Company in the Closing Notice against delivery to
the undersigned of the Shares in book entry form as set forth in the
following sentence. The Company shall deliver (or cause the delivery of) (i)
the Shares in book entry form to the undersigned (or its nominee in
accordance with its delivery instructions) or to a custodian designated by
undersigned, as applicable, as indicated below and (ii) written evidence from
the Company's transfer agent reflecting the issuance of such Shares on and as
of the Closing Date. This Subscription Agreement shall terminate and be of no
further force or effect, without any liability to either party hereto, if the
Company notifies the undersigned in writing that it has abandoned its plans to
move forward with the Transaction. If this Subscription Agreement terminates
following the delivery by the undersigned of the purchase price for the
Shares, the Company shall promptly (but not later than two (2) business days
thereafter) return the purchase price to the undersigned.

  



  

   

A-1

 



    



  

3.  _Closing Conditions_. The Closing is also subject to the conditions that,
on the Closing Date:

  



  

a. all representations and warranties of the Company and the undersigned
contained in this Subscription Agreement shall be true and correct in all
material respects (other than representations and warranties that are
qualified as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect (as defined herein),
which representations and warranties shall be true in all respects) at and as
of the Closing Date, and consummation of the Closing shall constitute a
reaffirmation by each of the Company and the undersigned of each of the
representations, warranties and agreements of each such party contained in
this Subscription Agreement as of the Closing Date, but in each case without
giving effect to consummation of the Transaction;

  



  

b. the Company shall have performed, satisfied and complied in all material
respects with all covenants, agreements and conditions required by this
Subscription Agreement to be performed, satisfied or complied with by it at or
prior to the Closing;

  



  

c. no governmental authority shall have enacted, issued, promulgated,
enforced or entered any judgment, order, law, rule or regulation (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) which is then in effect and has the
effect of making consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby illegal
or otherwise restraining or prohibiting consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and no governmental authority shall have instituted or
threatened in writing a proceeding seeking to impose any such restraint
or prohibition;

  



  

d. as of the Closing Date, there has been no material adverse change in the
business, properties, financial condition, stockholders' equity or results of
operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole since the date
of this Subscription Agreement (other than (i) the election by holders of the
Common Stock to exercise redemption rights in connection with (x) the special
meeting of the Company's stockholders to approve the Transaction or (y) a
special meeting of the Company's stockholders to approve the extension of
time for the Company to complete a business combination, and (ii) in
connection with any offer to purchase outstanding warrants to purchase
Existing Class A Shares (as defined below) of the Company (the "Warrants")),
and consummation of the Closing shall constitute a representation of the
Company of such facts;

  



  

   

A-2

 



    



  

e. Pubco's initial listing application with the Nasdaq Capital Market in
connection with the Transaction shall have been approved and, immediately
following the Closing, Pubco shall satisfy any applicable initial and
continuing listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market and Pubco shall
not have received any notice of non-compliance therewith, and the Pubco
Shares, shall have been approved for listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market;
and

  



  

f. all conditions precedent to the closing of the Transaction, including the
approval of the Company's stockholders, shall have been satisfied or waived
(other than those conditions which, by their nature, are to be satisfied at
the closing of the Transaction).

  



  

4.  _Further Assurances_. At the Closing, the parties hereto shall execute
and deliver such additional documents and take such additional actions as the
parties reasonably may deem to be practical and necessary in order to
consummate the subscription as contemplated by this Subscription Agreement.

  



  

5.  _Company Representations and Warranties_. The Company represents and
warrants to the undersigned that:

  



  

a. The Company has been duly incorporated, is validly existing and is in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and conduct its business as
presently conducted.

  



  

b. The Shares have been duly authorized and, when issued and delivered to the
undersigned against full payment therefor in accordance with the terms of
this Subscription Agreement, the Shares will be validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable and will not have been issued in violation of or subject to
any preemptive or similar rights created under the Company's Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation or under the laws of the State of
Delaware.

  



  

c. This Subscription Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by the Company and is enforceable in accordance with its terms,
except as may be limited or otherwise affected by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or other laws relating to
or affecting the rights of creditors generally, and (ii) principles of equity,
whether considered at law or equity.

  



  

d. The issuance and sale of the Shares and the compliance by the Company with
all of the provisions of this Subscription Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions herein will not conflict with or result in a breach or
violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default
under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or
encumbrance upon any of the property or assets of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of (i) any indenture, mortgage, deed of
trust, loan agreement, lease, license or other agreement or instrument to
which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which the
Company or any of its subsidiaries is bound or to which any of the property or
assets of the Company is subject, which would have a material adverse effect
on the business, properties, financial condition, stockholders' equity or
results of operations of the Company (a " _Material Adverse Effect_ ") or
materially affect the validity of the Shares or the legal authority of the
Company to comply in all material respects with the terms of this Subscription
Agreement; (ii) result in any violation of the provisions of the
organizational documents of the Company; or (iii) result in any violation of
any statute or any judgment, order, rule or regulation of any court or
governmental agency or body, domestic or foreign, having jurisdiction over
the Company or any of its properties that would have a Material Adverse Effect
or materially affect the validity of the Shares or the legal authority of the
Company to comply with this Subscription Agreement; subject, in the case of
the foregoing clauses (i) and (iii) with respect to the consummation of the
transactions therein contemplated.

  



  

   

A-3

 



    



  

e. There are no securities or instruments issued by or to which the Company
is a party containing anti-dilution or similar provisions that will be
triggered by the issuance of (i) the Shares or (ii) the shares to be issued
pursuant to any subscription agreements with the Company substantially
similar to this Subscription Agreement (the " _Other Subscription Agreements_
"), that have not been or will not be validly waived on or prior to the
Closing Date.

  



  

f. The Company is not in default or violation (and no event has occurred
which, with notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute a default
or violation) of any term, condition or provision of (i) the organizational
documents of the Company, (ii) any loan or credit agreement, note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, lease or other agreement, permit, franchise or license to
which the Company is now a party or by which the Company's properties or
assets are bound or (iii) any statute or any judgment, order, rule or
regulation of any court or governmental agency or body, domestic or foreign,
having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its properties, except, in the
case of clauses (ii) and (iii), for defaults or violations that have not had
and would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

g. The Company is not required to obtain any consent, waiver, authorization
or order of, give any notice to, or make any filing or registration with, any
court or other federal, state, local or other governmental authority, self-
regulatory organization or other person in connection with the execution,
delivery and performance by the Company of this Subscription Agreement
(including, without limitation, the issuance of the Shares), other than (i)
the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _Commission_
") of the Registration Statement (as defined below), (ii) filings required by
applicable state securities laws, (iii) the filing of a Notice of Exempt
Offering of Securities on Form D with the Commission under Regulation D of the
Securities Act, (iv) the filings required in accordance with Section 7 of
this Subscription Agreement; (v) those required by the Nasdaq Stock Market
(the " _Nasdaq_ "), including with respect to obtaining stockholder approval,
and (vi) the failure of which to obtain would not be reasonably likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

h. As of the date hereof, the authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of (i) 100,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock, par value $0.0001
per share (" _Existing Class A Shares_ "); (ii) 10,000,000 shares of Class B
Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (" _Existing Class B Shares_ ");
and (iii) 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share ("
_Preferred Shares_ "). As of the date hereof: (i) no Preferred Shares are

and outstanding; (iii) 6,875,000 Existing Class B Shares are issued and
outstanding; and (iv) 14,166,666 Warrants to purchase 14,166,666 Existing

A-4

 



    



  

i. The Company has not received any written communication since December 31,
2018, from a governmental entity that alleges that the Company is not in
compliance with or is in default or violation of any applicable law, except
where such non-compliance, default or violation, would not individually or in
the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

j. The issued and outstanding Existing Class A Shares are registered pursuant
to Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "
_Exchange Act_ "), and are listed for trading on Nasdaq under the symbol
"NEBU." Except as otherwise disclosed by the Company in the SEC Documents (as
defined below), there is no suit, action, proceeding or investigation pending
or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company by Nasdaq
or the Commission with respect to any intention by such entity to deregister
the Existing Class A Shares or prohibit or terminate the listing of the
Existing Class A Shares on Nasdaq. The Company has taken no action that is
designed to terminate the registration of the Existing Class A Shares under
the Exchange Act.

  



  

k. Assuming the accuracy of the undersigned's representations and warranties
set forth in Section 6 of this Subscription Agreement, no registration under
the Securities Act is required for the offer and sale of the Shares by the
Company to the undersigned.

  



  

l. Neither the Company nor any person acting on its behalf has engaged or
will engage in any form of general solicitation or general advertising
(within the meaning of Regulation D of the Securities Act) in connection with
any offer or sale of the Shares.

  



  

m. The Company has not entered into any side letter or similar agreement with
any investor in connection with such investor's direct or indirect investment
in the Company other than the Other Subscription Agreements relating to the
issuance and sale by the Company of Class A Common Stock at the Purchase
Price.

  



  

n. The Company has made available to the undersigned (including via the
Commission's EDGAR system) a true, correct and complete copy of each form,
report, statement, schedule, prospectus, proxy, registration statement and
other documents filed by the Company with the Commission since its initial
registration of the Existing Class A Shares (the " _SEC Documents_ ")
and prior to the date of this Subscription Agreement. None of the SEC
Documents filed under the Exchange Act contained, when filed or, if amended
prior to the date of this Subscription Agreement, as of the date of such
amendment with respect to those disclosures that are amended, any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Company has
timely filed each report, statement, schedule, prospectus, and registration
statement that the Company was required to file with the Commission since its
inception. As of the date hereof, there are no material outstanding or
unresolved comments in comment letters from the Commission staff with respect
to any of the SEC Documents.

  



  

   

A-5

 



    



  

o. Except for such matters as have not had and would not be reasonably likely
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, as of
the date hereof, there is no (i) suit, action, charge, complaint, arbitration,
labor dispute or similar proceeding pending, or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened against the Company or (ii) judgment, decree,
injunction, ruling or order of any governmental entity or arbitrator
outstanding against the Company.

  



  

p. Except for commissions and expenses payable to Deutsche Bank Securities
and Goldman Sachs and Co. LLC (the " _Placement Agents_ ") in connection with
their engagement as placement agents for the sale of the Shares, the Company
has not paid, and is not obligated to pay, any brokerage, finder's or other
fee or commission in connection with its issuance and sale of the Shares,
including, for the avoidance of doubt, any fee or commission payable to any
shareholder or affiliate of the Company.

  



  

6.  _Representations and Warranties of the Undersigned_. The undersigned
represents and warrants to the Company that:

  



  

a. The undersigned is (i) a "qualified institutional buyer" (as defined in
Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities
Act_ ")) or (ii) an institutional "accredited investor" (within the
meaning of Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act), in each case, satisfying
the requirements set forth on Schedule A, and is acquiring the Shares only
for his, her or its own account and not for the account of others, and not on
behalf of any other account or person or with a view to, or for offer or sale
in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities
Act (and shall provide the requested information on Schedule A following the
signature page hereto). The undersigned is not an entity formed for the
specific purpose of acquiring the Shares.

  



  

b. The undersigned understands that the Shares are being offered in a
transaction not involving any public offering within the meaning of the
Securities Act and that the Shares have not been registered under the
Securities Act. The undersigned understands that the Shares may not be
resold, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of by the undersigned
absent an effective registration statement under the Securities Act except
(i) to the Company or a subsidiary thereof, (ii) to non-U.S. persons pursuant
to offers and sales that occur outside the United States within the meaning
of Regulation S under the Securities Act or (iii) pursuant to another
applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act,
and in each of cases (i) and (iii) in accordance with any applicable
securities laws of the states and other jurisdictions of the United States,
and that any certificates representing the Shares shall contain a legend to
such effect. The undersigned acknowledges that the Shares will not be eligible
for resale pursuant to Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities Act. The
undersigned understands and agrees that the Shares will be subject to
transfer restrictions and, as a result of these transfer restrictions, the
undersigned may not be able to readily resell the Shares and may be required
to bear the financial risk of an investment in the Shares for an indefinite
period of time. The undersigned understands that it has been advised to
consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or transfer of
any of the Shares.

  



  

   

A-6

 



    



  

c. The undersigned understands and agrees that the undersigned is purchasing
Shares directly from the Company. The undersigned further acknowledges that
there have been no representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made
to the undersigned by the Company, or its officers or directors, expressly or
by implication, other than those representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements included in this Subscription Agreement.

  



  

d. The undersigned's acquisition and holding of the Shares will not
constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406
of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, Section
4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or any applicable
similar law.

7.  _Registration Rights_.

  



  

a. In the event that the Pubco Shares issuable upon conversion of the Shares
are not registered in connection with the consummation of the Transaction,
Pubco agrees that, within forty-five (45) calendar days after the consummation
of the Transaction (the " _Filing Date_ "), Pubco will file with the
Commission (at Pubco's sole cost and expense) a registration statement (the "
_Registration Statement_ ") registering such resale, and Pubco shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to have the Registration Statement declared
effective as soon as practicable after the filing thereof, but no later than
the earlier of (i) the 90th calendar day (or 120th calendar day if the
Commission notifies Pubco that it will "review" the Registration Statement)
following the Closing and (ii) the 10th business day after the date Pubco is
notified (orally or in writing, whichever is earlier) by the Commission that
the Registration Statement will not be "reviewed" or will not be subject to
further review (such earlier date, the " _Effectiveness Date_ "); _provided_
, _however_ , that if the Commission is closed for operations due to a
government shutdown, the Effectiveness Date shall be extended by the same
amount of days that the Commission remains closed for operations, _provided,
further_ , that Pubco's obligations to include the Pubco Shares in the
Registration Statement are contingent upon the undersigned furnishing in
writing to Pubco such information regarding the undersigned, the
securities of Pubco held by the undersigned and the intended method of
disposition of the Pubco Shares as shall be reasonably requested by Pubco to
effect the registration of the Pubco Shares, and shall execute such documents
in connection with such registration as Pubco may reasonably request that are
customary of a selling stockholder in similar situations. For purposes of
clarification, any failure by Pubco to file the Registration Statement by the
Filing Date or to effect such Registration Statement by the
Effectiveness Date shall not otherwise relieve Pubco of its obligations to
file or effect the Registration Statement as set forth above in this Section
7.

  



  

   

A-9

 



    



  

b. Pubco further agrees that, in the event that (i) the Registration
Statement has not been declared effective by the Commission by the
Effectiveness Date, (ii) after such Registration Statement is declared
effective by the Commission, (A) such Registration Statement ceases for any
reason (including by reason of a stop order, or Pubco's failure to update the
Registration Statement), to remain continuously effective as to all Shares
for which it is required to be effective or (B) the undersigned is not
permitted to utilize the Registration Statement to resell the Shares (in each
case of (A) and (B), (x) other than within the time period(s) permitted by
this Subscription Agreement and (y) excluding by reason of a post-effective
amendment required in connection with Pubco's filing of an amendment thereto
(a " _Special Grace Period_ ") (which Special Grace Period shall not be
treated as a Registration Default (as defined below)), or (iii) after the date
one year following the Closing Date, and only in the event the Registration
Statement is not effective or available to sell all Shares, Pubco fails to
file with the Commission any required reports under Section 13 or 15(d) of
the Exchange Act such that it is not in compliance with Rule 144(c)(1) (or
Rule 144(i)(2), if applicable), as a result of which investors who are not
affiliates of Pubco are unable to sell the Shares without restriction under
Rule 144 (or any successor thereto) (each such event referred to in clauses
(i) through (iii), a " _Registration Default_ " and, for purposes of such
clauses, the date on which such Registration Default occurs, a "
_Default Date_ "), then in addition to any other rights the undersigned may
have hereunder or under applicable law, on each such Default Date and on each
monthly anniversary of each such Default Date (if the applicable Registration
Default shall not have been cured by such date) until the applicable
Registration Default is cured, Pubco shall pay to the undersigned an amount in
cash, as partial liquidated damages and not as a penalty (" _Liquidated
Damages_ "), equal to 0.5% of the aggregate Purchase Price paid by the
undersigned pursuant to this Subscription Agreement for any Pubco Shares held
by the undersigned on the Default Date; _provided, however_ , that if the
undersigned fails to provide Pubco with any information requested by Pubco
that is required to be provided in such Registration Statement with respect
to the undersigned as set forth herein, then, for purposes of this Section 7,
the Filing Date or Effectiveness Date, as applicable, for a Registration
Statement with respect to the undersigned shall be extended until two (2)
business days following the date of receipt by Pubco of such required
information from the undersigned; and in no event shall Pubco be required
hereunder to pay to the undersigned pursuant to this Subscription Agreement an
aggregate amount that exceeds 5.0% of the aggregate Purchase Price paid by
the undersigned for its Shares. The Liquidated Damages pursuant to the terms
hereof shall apply on a daily pro-rata basis for any portion of a month prior
to the cure of a Registration Default, except in the case of the first
Default Date. Pubco shall deliver the cash payment to the undersigned with
respect to any Liquidated Damages by the fifth business day after the date
payable. If Pubco fails to pay said cash payment to the undersigned in full
by the fifth business day after the date payable, Pubco will pay interest
thereon at a rate of 5.0% per annum (or such lesser maximum amount that is
permitted to be paid by applicable law, and calculated on the basis of a year
consisting of 360 days) to the undersigned, accruing daily from the date such
Liquidated Damages are due until such amounts, plus all such interest thereon,
are paid in full. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing shall preclude the
undersigned from pursuing or obtaining any available remedies at
law, specific performance or other equitable relief with respect to this
Section 7 in accordance with applicable law. The parties agree that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Liquidated Damages shall
be payable to the undersigned with respect to any period during which all of
the undersigned's Pubco Shares may be sold by the undersigned without volume
or manner of sale restrictions under Rule 144 and Pubco is in compliance with
the current public information requirements under Rule 144(c)(1) (or Rule
144(i)(2), if applicable).

  



  

   

A-10

 



    



  

c. In the case of the registration, qualification, exemption or compliance
effected by Pubco pursuant to this Subscription Agreement, Pubco shall, upon
reasonable request, inform the undersigned as to the status of such
registration, qualification, exemption and compliance. At its expense Pubco
shall:

  



       | i.  | except  for such times as Pubco is permitted hereunder
to suspend the use of the prospectus forming part of a Registration
Statement,  use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep such
registration, and any qualification, exemption or compliance under state 
securities laws which Pubco determines to obtain, continuously effective with
respect to the undersigned, and to keep the  applicable Registration
Statement or any subsequent shelf registration statement free of any material
misstatements or omissions,  until the earlier of the following: (i) the
undersigned ceases to hold any Shares or (ii) the date all Shares held by
the  undersigned may be sold without restriction under Rule 144, including
without limitation, any volume and manner of sale restrictions  which may be
applicable to affiliates under Rule 144 and without the requirement for Pubco
to be in compliance with the current  public information required under Rule
144(c)(1) (or Rule 144(i)(2), if applicable), and (iii) three years from the
Effective  Date of the Registration Statement. The period of time during
which Pubco is required hereunder to keep a Registration Statement  effective
is referred to herein as the " _Registration Period_ "; 
---|---|--- 
    



   | ii.| advise  the undersigned within five (5) business days: (1) when
a Registration Statement or any  amendment thereto has been filed with the
Commission and when such Registration Statement  or any post-effective
amendment thereto has become effective; (2) of any request by the  Commission
for amendments or supplements to any Registration Statement or the
prospectus  included therein or for additional information; (3) of the
issuance by the Commission  of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of
any Registration Statement or the initiation  of any proceedings for such
purpose; (4) of the receipt by Pubco of any notification  with respect to the
suspension of the qualification of the Shares included therein for  sale in
any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such 
purpose; and (5) subject to the provisions in this Subscription Agreement, of
the occurrence  of any event that requires the making of any changes in any
Registration Statement or  prospectus so that, as of such date, the
statements therein are not misleading and do  not omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make  the statements
therein (in the case of a prospectus, in the light of the circumstances 
under which they were made) not misleading.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

A-11

 



    



  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, Pubco shall not,
when so advising the undersigned of such events, provide the undersigned with
any material, nonpublic information regarding Pubco other than to the extent
that providing notice to the undersigned of the occurrence of the events
listed in (1) through (5) above constitutes material, nonpublic information
regarding Pubco;

  



   | iii.| use  its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
withdrawal of any order suspending  the effectiveness of any Registration
Statement as soon as reasonably practicable;  
---|---|--- 
  



   | iv.| upon  the occurrence of any event contemplated above, except for
such times as Pubco is permitted  hereunder to suspend, and has suspended,
the use of a prospectus forming part of a Registration  Statement, Pubco
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to as soon as reasonably 
practicable prepare a post-effective amendment to such Registration Statement
or a supplement  to the related prospectus, or file any other required
document so that, as thereafter  delivered to purchasers of the Shares
included therein, such prospectus will not include  any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary  to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were 
made, not misleading;  
---|---|--- 
  



   | v.| use  its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all Shares to
be listed on each securities  exchange or market, if any, on which the
Existing Parent Class A Shares issued by Pubco  have been listed; and  
---|---|--- 
  



   | vi.| use  its commercially reasonable efforts to take all other steps
necessary to effect the registration  of the Shares contemplated hereby and
to enable the undersigned to sell the Shares under  Rule 144.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

d. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Subscription Agreement,
Pubco shall be entitled to delay or postpone the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement, and from time to time to require the undersigned not
to sell under the Registration Statement or to suspend the effectiveness
thereof, if the negotiation or consummation of a transaction by Pubco or its
subsidiaries is pending or an event has occurred, which negotiation,
consummation or event Pubco's board of directors reasonably believes,
upon the advice of legal counsel, would require additional disclosure by
Pubco in the Registration Statement of material information that Pubco has a
bona fide business purpose for keeping confidential and the non-disclosure of
which in the Registration Statement would be expected, in the reasonable
determination of Pubco's board of directors, upon the advice of legal counsel,
to cause the Registration Statement to fail to comply with applicable
disclosure requirements (each such circumstance, a " _Suspension Event_ ");
_provided, however_ , that Pubco may not delay or suspend the Registration
Statement on more than two occasions or for more than sixty (60) consecutive
calendar days, or more than ninety (90) total calendar days, in each case
during any twelve-month period. Upon receipt of any written notice from Pubco
of the happening of any Suspension Event during the period that the
Registration Statement is effective or if as a result of a Suspension Event
the Registration Statement or related prospectus contains any
untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made (in the case of the
prospectus) not misleading, the undersigned agrees that (i) it will
immediately discontinue offers and sales of the Shares under the Registration
Statement (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, sales conducted pursuant to
Rule 144) until the undersigned receives copies of a supplemental or
amended prospectus (which Pubco agrees to promptly prepare) that corrects the
misstatement(s) or omission(s) referred to above and receives notice that any
post-effective amendment has become effective or unless otherwise notified by
Pubco that it may resume such offers and sales, and (ii) it will maintain the
confidentiality of any information included in such written notice delivered
by Pubco unless otherwise required by law or subpoena. If so directed by
Pubco, the undersigned will deliver to Pubco or, in the undersigned's sole
discretion destroy, all copies of the prospectus covering the Shares in the
undersigned's possession; provided, however, that this obligation to deliver
or destroy all copies of the prospectus covering the Shares shall not apply
(i) to the extent the undersigned is required to retain a copy of such
prospectus (a) in order to comply with applicable legal, regulatory, self-
regulatory or professional requirements or (b) in accordance with a bona fide
pre-existing document retention policy or (ii) to copies
stored electronically on archival servers as a result of automatic data back-
up.

  



  

   

A-12

 



    



  

e. The undersigned may deliver written notice (including via email in
accordance with this Subscription Agreement) (an " _Opt-Out Notice_ ") to
Pubco requesting that the undersigned not receive notices from Pubco otherwise
required by this Section 7; _provided, however_ , that the undersigned may
later revoke any such Opt-Out Notice in writing. Following receipt of an Opt-
Out Notice from the undersigned (unless subsequently revoked), (i) Pubco shall
not deliver any such notices to the undersigned and the undersigned shall no
longer be entitled to the rights associated with any such notice and (ii) each
time prior to the undersigned's intended use of an effective Registration
Statement, the undersigned will notify Pubco in writing at least two (2)
business days in advance of such intended use, and if a notice of a Suspension
Event was previously delivered (or would have been delivered but for the
provisions of this Section 7(e)) and the related suspension period remains in
effect, Pubco will so notify the undersigned, within one (1) business day of
the undersigned's notification to Pubco, by delivering to the undersigned a
copy of such previous notice of Suspension Event, and thereafter will provide
the undersigned with the related notice of the conclusion of such Suspension
Event immediately upon its availability.

  



  

f. Indemnification.

  



   | i.| Pubco  agrees to indemnify, to the extent permitted by law the
undersigned, its directors and  officers and agents and each person who
controls the undersigned, if any, (within the  meaning of the Securities Act)
against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and  expenses (including
attorneys' fees) caused by any untrue or alleged untrue statement  of
material fact contained in any Registration Statement or prospectus included
in any  Registration Statement or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto
or any omission  or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to  make the statements therein not misleading, except
insofar as the same are caused by  or contained in any information furnished
in writing to Pubco by the undersigned expressly  for use therein.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | ii.| In  connection with any Registration Statement in which the
undersigned is participating,  the undersigned shall furnish to Pubco in
writing such information and affidavits as  Pubco reasonably requests for use
in connection with any such Registration Statement  or prospectus and, to the
extent permitted by law, shall indemnify Pubco, its directors  and officers
and agents and each person who controls Pubco (within the meaning of the 
Securities Act) against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses
(including  without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees) resulting from any
untrue statement  of material fact contained in the Registration Statement,
prospectus, or any amendment  thereof or supplement thereto or any omission
of a material fact required to be stated  therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, but only to the extent  that such untrue
statement or omission is contained in any information or affidavit so 
furnished in writing by the undersigned expressly for use therein; provided,
however,  that the liability of the undersigned shall be several and not
joint and shall be in  proportion to and limited to the net proceeds received
from the sale of Shares pursuant  to such Registration Statement.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | iii.| Any  person entitled to indemnification herein shall (1) give
prompt written notice to the  indemnifying party of any claim with respect to
which it seeks indemnification (provided  that the failure to give prompt
notice shall not impair any person's right to indemnification  hereunder to
the extent such failure has not prejudiced the indemnifying party) and (2) 
permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with
counsel reasonably  satisfactory to the indemnified party. If such defense is
assumed, the indemnifying party  shall not be subject to any liability for
any settlement made by the indemnified party  without its consent (but such
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). An indemnifying  party who
elects not to assume the defense of a claim shall not be obligated to pay
the  fees and expenses of more than one (1) counsel for all parties
indemnified by such indemnifying  party with respect to such claim, unless in
the reasonable judgment of any indemnified  party a conflict of interest may
exist between such indemnified party and any other of  such indemnified
parties with respect to such claim. No indemnifying party shall, without  the
consent of the indemnified party, consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into  any settlement which cannot be settled in all respects by the
payment of money (and such  money is so paid by the indemnifying party
pursuant to the terms of such settlement)  or which settlement does not
include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the  claimant or
plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in
respect  to such claim or litigation.  
---|---|--- 
  



   

A-13

 



    



   | iv.| the  indemnification provided for under this Subscription
Agreement shall remain in full force  and effect regardless of any
investigation made by or on behalf of the indemnified party  or any officer,
director or controlling person of such indemnified party and shall survive 
the transfer of securities. Each party participating in an offering also
agrees to make  such provisions as are reasonably requested by any
indemnified party for contribution  to such party in the event such party's
indemnification is unavailable for any  reason.  
---|---|--- 
   | |   
---|---|--- 
   | v.| If  the indemnification provided under this Section 7(f) from the
indemnifying party is unavailable  to hold harmless an indemnified party in
respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities  and expenses referred to
herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying  the indemnified
party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the indemnified 
party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses in
such proportion  as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the
indemnifying party and the indemnified  party, as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations. The relative fault of  the indemnifying party and
indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among  other things,
whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue 
statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact,  was made by, or relates to information supplied by, such
indemnifying party or indemnified  party, and the indemnifying party's and
indemnified party's relative intent,  knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such action. The  amount paid or payable by
a party as a result of the losses or other liabilities referred  to above
shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 
7(e)(i), (ii) and (iii) above, any legal or other fees, charges or expenses
reasonably  incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or
proceeding. No person  guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities  Act) shall be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Section 7(f) from any person  who was not
guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

A-14

 



    



  

8.  _Termination_. This Subscription Agreement shall terminate and be void
and of no further force and effect, and all rights and obligations of the
parties hereunder shall terminate without any further liability on the part of
any party in respect thereof, upon the earlier to occur of (a) following the
execution of a definitive agreement among the Company, Pubco and Open
Lending with respect to the Transaction (a " _Transaction Agreement_ "), such
date and time as such Transaction Agreement is terminated in accordance with
its terms without the Transaction being consummated, (b) upon the mutual
written agreement of each of the parties hereto to terminate this
Subscription Agreement; (c) if any of the conditions to Closing set forth in
Section 3 of this Subscription Agreement are not satisfied or waived on or
prior to the Closing and, as a result thereof, the transactions contemplated
by this Subscription Agreement are not consummated at the Closing; or (d)
December 31, 2020; _provided _ that nothing herein will relieve any party
from liability for any willful breach hereof prior to the time of
termination, and each party will be entitled to any remedies at law or in
equity to recover losses, liabilities or damages arising from such breach.
The Company shall promptly notify the undersigned of the termination of the
Transaction Agreement after the termination of such agreement.

  



  

9.  _Trust Account Waiver_. The undersigned acknowledges that the Company is
a blank check company with the powers and privileges to effect a merger,
asset acquisition, reorganization or similar business combination involving
the Company and one or more businesses or assets. The undersigned further
acknowledges that, as described in the Company's prospectus relating to its
initial public offering dated January 9, 2018 (the " _Prospectus_ ")
available at www.sec.gov, substantially all of the Company's assets consist
of the cash proceeds of the Company's initial public offering and private
placements of its securities, and substantially all of those proceeds have
been deposited in a trust account (the " _Trust Account_ ") for the
benefit of the Company, its public shareholders and the underwriters of the
Company's initial public offering. For and in consideration of the Company
entering into this Subscription Agreement, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, the undersigned hereby irrevocably waives any
and all right, title and interest, or any claim of any kind it has or may have
in the future, in or to any monies held in the Trust Account, and agrees not
to seek recourse against the Trust Account as a result of, or arising out of,
this Subscription Agreement.

  



  

10.  _Miscellaneous_.

  



  

a. Neither this Subscription Agreement nor any rights that may accrue to the
undersigned hereunder (other than the Shares acquired hereunder, if any) may
be transferred or assigned.

  



  

b. The Company may request from the undersigned such additional information
as the Company may deem necessary to evaluate the eligibility of the
undersigned to acquire the Shares, and the undersigned shall provide such
information as may reasonably be requested, to the extent readily available
and to the extent consistent with its internal policies and procedures.

  



  

c. The undersigned acknowledges that the Company, Open Lending, the Placement
Agents and others will rely on the acknowledgments, understandings,
agreements, representations and warranties contained in this Subscription
Agreement. Prior to the Closing, the undersigned agrees to promptly notify
the Company if any of the acknowledgments, understandings, agreements,
representations and warranties set forth herein are no longer accurate. The
undersigned agrees that each purchase by the undersigned of Shares from the
Company will constitute a reaffirmation of the acknowledgments,
understandings, agreements, representations and warranties herein (as
modified by any such notice) by the undersigned as of the time of such
purchase. The undersigned further acknowledges and agrees that the Placement
Agents are third-party beneficiaries of the representations and warranties of
the undersigned contained in Section 6 of this Subscription Agreement.

  



  

   

A-15

irrevocably authorized to produce this Subscription Agreement or a copy
hereof to any interested party in any administrative or legal proceeding or
official inquiry with respect to the matters covered hereby.

  



  

e. All the agreements, representations and warranties made by each party
hereto in this Subscription Agreement shall survive the Closing.

  



  

f. This Subscription Agreement may not be modified, waived or terminated
except by an instrument in writing, signed by the party against whom
enforcement of such modification, waiver, or termination is sought. For the
avoidance of doubt, this Subscription Agreement may not be modified, waived
or terminated without the express written consent of Open Lending.

  



  

g. This Subscription Agreement constitutes the entire agreement, and
supersedes all other prior agreements, understandings, representations and
warranties, both written and oral, among the parties, with respect to the
subject matter hereof. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in subsection
(c) of this Section 10, this Subscription Agreement shall not confer any

inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or that this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder may not be enforced in

until such time as the BCA is executed by each of the parties thereto.

  



  

(k) Each of the parties hereto hereby waives to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law any right it may have to a trial by jury with respect to
any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection
with this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto (i) certifies that no
representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of
litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver and (ii) acknowledges that
it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this

this Agreement being referred to herein as the " _Shares_ "); and

  



  

WHEREAS, in order to induce ParentCo, NAC and the Company to enter into the

C-1

 



    



  

2\. _Transfer of Shares_. Each of the Founders agrees that it shall not,

waiver specified in this _Section 3_ shall be applicable only in connection
with the transactions contemplated by the BCA and this Agreement (and any
Equity Interests issued in connection with the transactions contemplated by
the BCA and this Agreement) and shall be void and of no force and effect if
the BCA shall be terminated for any reason.

  



  

4\. _Amendment of the Founder Shares Lock-up Period_. Each of the Founders
(including Nebula Holdings, LLC, the " _Sponsor_ "), NAC and the Company

that following the Closing, in addition to the consideration to be received
pursuant to the BCA, ParentCo shall be required to issue to the Sponsor
additional ParentCo Common Shares as follows:

  



  

(a) Six Hundred Twenty Five Thousand (625,000) ParentCo Common Shares, in the

immediately prior to the consummation of such Change of Control shall
immediately vest and the Sponsor shall be entitled to receive such
applicable Earn-Out Consideration prior to the consummation of such Change of
Control.

  



  

(e) The Earn-Out Consideration and the Earn-Out Targets shall be adjusted to
reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into ParentCo Common Shares), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to ParentCo Common Shares, occurring on or after the date hereof and

The total number of shares of all classes of capital stock which the
Corporation shall have authority to issue is [number spelled out]
([number]), divided into (i) [number spelled out] ([number]) shares of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Common Stock_ "), and (ii) [number
spelled out] ([number]) shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share
(the " _Preferred Stock_ ").

  



  

The powers (including voting powers), if any, and the preferences and
relative, participating, optional, special or other rights, if any, and the
qualifications, limitations or restrictions, if any, of each class or series
of capital stock of the Corporation shall be as provided by or pursuant to
this Article IV.

  



  

A. _COMMON STOCK_

  



  

Subject to law and the powers, preferences and rights, if any, of any of the
holders of any series of Preferred Stock then outstanding:

  



  

(a) the holders of the Common Stock shall have the exclusive right to vote
for the election of directors of the Corporation (the " _Directors_ " and
each, a " _Director_ ") and on all other matters requiring stockholder action,
each outstanding share of Common Stock entitling the holder thereof to one
(1) vote on each matter properly submitted to the stockholders of the
Corporation for their vote; _provided_ , _however_ , that, except as
otherwise required by law, holders of Common Stock, as such, shall not be
entitled to vote on any amendment to this Certificate of Incorporation (or on
any amendment to a certificate of designations of any series of Preferred
Stock then outstanding) that alters or changes the powers, preferences, rights
or other terms of one or more series of Preferred Stock then outstanding if
the holders of such affected series of Preferred Stock are entitled to

such series, on such amendment pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation
(or pursuant to any certificate of designations of any series of Preferred
Stock then outstanding) or pursuant to the DGCL;

powers), if any, of the shares of such series and the preferences and
relative, participating, optional, special or other rights, if any, and the
qualifications, limitations or restrictions, if any, of the shares of such
series. Except as otherwise provided by any certificate of designations of
any series of Preferred Stock then outstanding or by law, no holder of any
series of Preferred Stock, as such, shall be entitled to any voting powers in
respect thereof. The designations, powers, preferences and relative,
participating, optional, special and other rights of each series of Preferred
Stock, if any, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof,
if any, may differ from those of any and all other series of Preferred Stock
at any time outstanding. The number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock
may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof
then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
then outstanding shares of capital stock generally entitled to vote
irrespective of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL, without the separate vote of
the holders of the Preferred Stock as a class.

ARTICLE VI

  



  

 _DIRECTORS_

  



  

1. _General_. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors.

  



  

2. _Election of Directors_. Election of Directors need not be by written ballot unless the Bylaws of the Corporation (the "Bylaws") shall so provide.

  



  

3. _Term of Office_. The Directors, other than those who may be elected by the holders of any series of Preferred Stock then outstanding, shall be classified, with respect to the term for which they severally hold office, into three classes designated as "Class I", "Class II" and "Class III". The classification of the Board of Directors shall become effective upon the effectiveness of this Certificate of Incorporation in accordance with the DGCL and, at such effective time, the existing directors of the corporation shall be assigned to classes as follows: (a) Class I Directors - [names]; (b) Class II Directors - [names]; and (c) Class III Directors - [names]. The initial Class I Directors shall serve for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2021, the initial Class II Directors shall serve for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2022, and the initial Class III Directors shall serve for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2023. At each annual meeting of stockholders, Directors elected to succeed those Directors whose terms expire shall be elected for a term of office to expire at the third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders after their election. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Directors elected to each class shall hold office until their successors are duly elected and qualified or until their earlier resignation, death or removal.

  



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever, as provided by or pursuant to this
Certificate of Incorporation (or any certificate of designations of
any series of Preferred Stock then outstanding), the holders of any one or
more series of Preferred Stock then outstanding shall have the right, voting
separately as a series or together with holders of one or more other such
series, to elect Directors at an annual or special meeting of stockholders,
the election, term of office, filling of vacancies and other features of such
directorships shall be governed by the terms of this Certificate of
Incorporation and any certificate of designations applicable to such series.

  



  

In addition to any affirmative vote required by law or this Certificate of
Incorporation (or any certificate of designations of any series of
Preferred Stock then outstanding), the affirmative vote of the holders of not
less than two-thirds (2/3) of the outstanding shares of capital stock
generally entitled to vote, voting together as a single class, and the
affirmative vote of the holders of not less than two-thirds (2/3) of the
outstanding shares of each class entitled to vote thereon as a class, shall be
required to amend, alter, repeal or adopt any provision inconsistent with
this Article VI, Section 3.

  



    

D-4

 



    



  

4. _Vacancies_. Subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock then outstanding to elect Directors and to fill vacancies in the Board of Directors relating thereto, newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the authorized number of Directors and any and all vacancies in the Board of Directors, however occurring, including, without limitation, by reason of the death, resignation, disqualification or removal of a Director, shall be filled solely and exclusively by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining Directors then in office, even if less than a quorum of the Board of Directors or by the sole remaining Director, and not by the stockholders. Any Director elected in accordance with the preceding sentence shall hold office for the remainder of the full term of the class of Directors in which the new directorship was created or the vacancy occurred and until such Director's successor shall have been duly elected and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation, death or removal. Subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock then outstanding to elect Directors, when the number of Directors is increased or decreased, the Board of Directors shall, subject to Article VI, Section 3, determine the class or classes to which the increased or decreased number of Directors shall be apportioned; _provided_ , _however_ , that no decrease in the number of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent Director. In the event of a newly created directorship or vacancy in the Board of Directors, the remaining Directors, except as otherwise provided by law, shall exercise the powers of the full Board of Directors until the vacancy is filled.

  



  

5. _Removal_. Subject to the rights, if any, of any series of Preferred Stock then outstanding to elect Directors and to remove any Director whom the holders of any such series have the right to elect, any Director (including persons elected by Directors to fill newly created directorships or vacancies on the Board of Directors) may be removed from office (i) only with cause and (ii) only by the affirmative vote of the holders not less than two-thirds (2/3) of the outstanding shares of capital stock then entitled to vote at an election of Directors, voting together as a single class.

ARTICLE II 
 DETERMINATION OF CUMULATIVE REALIZED TAX BENEFIT

  



  

2.1 _Basis Adjustments_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that for all tax
reporting purposes (A) the Second Merger shall be treated as a transfer or
sale, respectively, of Company Units by the Company Unit Sellers to Parent and
(B) the Second Merger will give rise to a Basis Adjustment. The Basis
Adjustment with respect to a Reference Asset (or applicable portions thereof,
where the Basis Adjustment exceeds the basis adjustment under Section 732 or
743(b) of the Code) shall be recovered over the applicable period under
applicable Law. Basis Adjustments reflecting Parent's increased share of the
Non-Adjusted Tax Basis in a Reference Asset shall be determined as of the
Exchange Date and shall not be adjusted as a result of future changes to
Parent's ownership percentage in the Company. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that (x) all payments to a Company Unit Seller pursuant to this
Agreement (other than amounts treated as interest under the Code) will be
treated as subsequent upward purchase price adjustments that have the effect
of creating additional Basis Adjustments in respect of the Company Units
previously held by such Beneficiary in the year of payment and (y) as a
result, such additional Basis Adjustments in respect of such Company Units
will be incorporated into the current year calculation and into future year
calculations, as appropriate under applicable law.

  



  

   

F-11

 



    



  

2.2 _The Company Section 754 Election_. Parent will ensure that, on and after
the date hereof, the Company and each of its direct and indirect Subsidiaries
(that is owned through a chain of pass-through entities) that is treated as a
partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes will have in effect an
election under Section 754 of the Code (and under any similar provisions of
applicable U.S. state or local law) for each applicable Taxable Year, but
only to the extent that the Parent has the authority to cause such Subsidiary
to make such election under the applicable agreement for such Subsidiary.

  



  

2.3 _Basis Schedule_. Within ninety (90) calendar days after the filing of
the U.S. federal income Tax Return of Parent for each relevant Taxable Year,
Parent shall deliver to the Beneficiary Representative, for the benefit of
each Beneficiary, a schedule (the " _Basis Schedule_ ") that shows, in
reasonable detail as necessary in order to understand the calculations
performed under this Agreement: (a) the Non-Adjusted Tax Basis of the
Reference Assets as of the Exchange Date; (b) the Basis Adjustments with
respect to the Reference Assets as a result of the Second Merger; (c) the
period (or periods) over which the Reference Assets are amortizable and/or
depreciable; and (d) the period (or periods) over which each Basis Adjustment
described in clause (b) is amortizable and/or depreciable. The Basis Schedule
will become final and binding on the Parties pursuant to the procedures set
forth in _Section 2.6(a)_ and may be amended by the Parties pursuant to the
procedures set forth in _Section 2.6(b)_.

  



  

2.4 _Inherited Tax Attributes_.

  



  

(a) _Consequences of the Blocker Contribution_. The parties hereto further
acknowledge that the Blocker may have certain tax attributes at the time of
the Blocker Contribution to which Parent could inherit in the Blocker
Contribution under the Code or similar provisions of U.S. federal, state or
local and non-U.S. tax law arising from basis adjustments pursuant to Section
743 of the Code and the regulations thereunder. For this purpose, the term "
_Inherited Tax Attributes_ " with respect to the Blocker shall refer to the
items of loss or deduction that will arise to the Blocker or its successor as
a result of certain transactions that occurred prior to the Blocker
Contribution which increased the adjusted basis of property of the Company (or
its predecessor) with respect to the Blocker (or its predecessor) pursuant to
Sections 743(b), 755, 732, or 1012 of the Code; provided that such items will
not constitute an Inherited Tax Attribute until such time as such items are
available to be claimed as a loss or deduction for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. The parties further acknowledge that, in the event that the Blocker
Contribution is effected, the Parent's ability to utilize an Inherited Tax
Attribute to offset its taxable income or to reduce its Tax payments may be
limited under Sections 382, 383 and 384 of the Code or similar provisions of
U.S. federal, state or local and non-U.S. tax law (the " _Attribute
Limitations_ ").

  



  

(b) _Inherited Tax Attribute Schedule Generally_. Within 90 calendar days
after filing its U.S. federal income Tax Return for the year in which the
Blocker Contribution occurred, Parent shall deliver to the Blocker Holder, a
schedule (each, an " _Inherited Tax Attribute Schedule_ ") that shows, in
reasonable detail, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) the amount of
each Inherited Tax Attribute with respect to the Blocker, separately stated
to the extent relevant, (ii) the amount of each Attribute Limitation for the
Blocker Holder, if any, separately stated to the extent relevant, and (iii)
the amount of any "net unrealized built-in gain" or "net unrealized built-in
loss" as defined in Section 382(h)(3) of the Code for the Blocker. At the
time Parent delivers the Inherited Tax Attribute Schedule to the Blocker
Holder, it shall (x) deliver to the Blocker Holder supporting schedules and
work papers, as determined by the Parent or requested by the Blocker Holder,
that provide a reasonable level of detail regarding the data and calculations
that were relevant for purposes of preparing the Inherited Tax Attribute
Schedule and a letter from the Advisory Firm supporting such Inherited Tax
Attribute Schedule and (y) allow the Blocker Holder reasonable access to the
appropriate representatives at Parent, the Company, and the Advisory Firm in
connection with its review of such schedule. Each Inherited Tax Attribute
Schedule shall become final and binding on the parties unless the Blocker
Holder, within thirty (30) calendar days after receiving its respective
Inherited Tax Attribute Schedule, provides Parent with notice of a
material objection to such Inherited Tax Attribute Schedule made in good
faith and in reasonable detail. If Parent and the Blocker Holder, negotiating
in good faith, are unable to successfully resolve the issues raised in such
notice within sixty (60) calendar days after such notice was delivered to
Parent, Parent and the Blocker Holder shall employ the Reconciliation
Procedures.

  



  

   

F-12

 



    



  

(c) _Amendments to Inherited Tax Attribute Schedule_. Each Inherited Tax
Attribute Schedule may be amended from time to time by Parent (i) in
connection with a Determination, (ii) to correct inaccuracies to the original
Inherited Tax Attribute Schedule identified after the date of the Blocker
Contribution as a result of a mistake or the receipt of additional information
or (iii) to comply with the expert's determination under the Reconciliation
Procedures. At the time Parent delivers such amended Inherited Tax
Attribute Schedule to the Blocker Holder, it shall (x) deliver to the Blocker
Holder schedules and work papers providing reasonable detail regarding the
preparation of the relevant amended Inherited Tax Attribute Schedule and a
letter from the Advisory Firm supporting such amended Inherited Tax Attribute
Schedule and (y) allow the Blocker Holder reasonable access to the appropriate
representatives at Parent, the Company, and the Advisory Firm in connection
with its review of such schedule. Parent shall provide an Amended Schedule to
the Blocker Holder within sixty (60) calendar days of the occurrence of an
event referenced in clauses (i) through (iii) of the first sentence of this
Section 2.4(c). Each amended Inherited Tax Attribute Schedule shall become
final and binding on the parties unless the Blocker Holder, within thirty
(30) calendar days after receiving such amended Inherited Tax
Attribute Schedule, provide Parent with notice of a material objection to
such amended Inherited Tax Attribute Schedule made in good faith and in
reasonable detail. If Parent and the Blocker Holder, negotiating in good
faith, are unable to successfully resolve the issues raised in such notice
within thirty (30) calendar days after such notice was delivered to Parent,
Parent and the Blocker Holder shall employ the Reconciliation Procedures.

  



  

2.5 _Tax Benefit Schedule_.

  



  

(a) _Tax Benefit Schedule_. Within ninety (90) calendar days after the filing
of the U.S. federal income Tax Return of Parent for any Taxable Year in which
there is a Realized Tax Benefit or Realized Tax Detriment, Parent shall
provide to the Beneficiary Representative and the Blocker Holder a schedule
showing, in reasonable detail, the calculation of the Realized Tax Benefit or
Realized Tax Detriment for such Taxable Year (a " _Tax Benefit Schedule_ ")
with respect to each Beneficiary and the Blocker Holder. The Tax Benefit
Schedules will become final and binding on the Parties pursuant to the
procedures set forth in _Section 2.6(a)_ , and may be amended by the Parties
pursuant to the procedures set forth in _Section 2.6(b)_.

  



  

   

F-13

 



    



  

(b) _Applicable Principles_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the
Realized Tax Benefit or Realized Tax Detriment for each Taxable Year is
intended to measure the decrease or increase in the Actual Tax Liability of
Parent for such Taxable Year attributable to the Basis Adjustments, Imputed
Interest and Extension Rate Interest, and the Inherited Tax Attributes as
determined using a "with and without" methodology described in _Section
2.6(a)_. For the avoidance of doubt, the actual Covered Tax liability will
take into account the deduction of the portion of the Tax Benefit Payment that
must be accounted for as Imputed Interest under the Code based upon the
characterization of the Tax Benefit Payment as additional consideration
payable by the Company for the Company Units acquired in the Second Merger,
or payable by Parent for the assets acquired pursuant to the
Blocker Contribution, as the case may be. Carryovers or carrybacks of any tax
item attributable to any Basis Adjustment, Imputed Interest or Extension Rate
Interest or the Inherited Tax Attributes shall be considered to be subject to
the rules of the Code and the Treasury Regulations or the appropriate
provisions of U.S. state and local and non-U.S. tax law, as applicable,
governing the use, limitation and expiration of carryovers or carrybacks of
the relevant type. If a carryover or carryback of any Covered Tax item
includes a portion that is attributable to the Basis Adjustment, Imputed
Interest, or the Inherited Tax Attributes and another portion that is not,
such portions shall be considered to be used in the order determined using
such "with and without" methodology. The Parties agree that all Tax Benefit
Payments attributable to the Second Merger will be treated as subsequent
upward purchase price adjustments that give rise to further Basis Adjustments
for Parent beginning in the Taxable Year of payment, and as a result, such
additional Basis Adjustments will be incorporated into such Taxable Year
continuing for future Taxable Years until any incremental Basis Adjustment
benefits with respect to a Tax Benefit Payment equals a de minimis amount. For
the avoidance of doubt, the treatment of Tax Benefit Payments pursuant to the
preceding sentence shall not apply to Tax Benefit Payments attributable to
the Blocker Holder.

  



  

2.6 _Procedures; Amendments_.

  



  

(a) _Procedures_. Each time Parent delivers an applicable Schedule to the
Beneficiary Representative or the Blocker Holder under this
Agreement, including any Amended Schedule delivered pursuant to _Section
2.6(b)_ , but excluding any Early Termination Schedule or amended Early
Termination Schedule delivered pursuant to the procedures set forth in
_Section 4.2_ , Parent shall also: (x) deliver supporting schedules and work
papers, as determined by Parent or as reasonably requested by the Beneficiary
Representative or the Blocker Holder, that provide a reasonable level of
detail regarding the data and calculations that were relevant for purposes of
preparing the Schedule; (y) deliver a Parent Letter supporting such Schedule;
and (z) allow the Beneficiary Representative and the Blocker Holder and their
respective advisors to have reasonable access at no cost to the appropriate
representatives, as determined by Parent or as reasonably requested by the
Beneficiary Representative or the Blocker Holder, at Parent and the Advisory
Firm in connection with a review of such Schedule. Without limiting the
generality of the preceding sentence, Parent shall ensure that any Tax
Benefit Schedule that is delivered to the Beneficiary Representative or the
Blocker Holder, along with any supporting schedules and work papers, provides
a reasonably detailed presentation of the calculation of the Actual Tax
Liability of Parent for the relevant Taxable Year (the "with" calculation)
and the Hypothetical Tax Liability of Parent for such Taxable Year (the
"without" calculation), and identifies any material assumptions or operating
procedures or principles that were used for purposes of such calculations. An
applicable Schedule or amendment thereto shall become final and binding on
the Parties thirty (30) calendar days from the date on which the Beneficiary
Representative and the Blocker Holder first received the applicable Schedule
or amendment thereto unless:

  



  

(i) the Beneficiary Representative or the Blocker Holder within thirty (30)
calendar days after receiving the applicable Schedule or amendment thereto,
provides Parent with (A) written notice of a material objection to such
Schedule that is made in good faith and in reasonable detail (an " _Objection
Notice_ "); or

  



  

   

F-14

 



    



  

(ii) the Beneficiary Representative and each of the Blocker Holder provide a
written waiver of its right to deliver an Objection Notice within the time
period described in clause (i) above, in which case such Schedule or amendment
thereto becomes binding on the date the waivers from the Beneficiary
Representative and the Blocker Holder are received by Parent.

  



  

In the event that Beneficiary Representative or the Blocker Holder timely
delivers an Objection Notice pursuant to clause (i) above, and if the
Parties, for any reason, are unable to successfully resolve the issues raised
in the Objection Notice within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt by
Parent of the Objection Notice, Parent and the Beneficiary Representative and
the Blocker Holder shall employ the reconciliation procedures as described in
_Section 7.10_ of this Agreement (the " _Reconciliation Procedures_ ").

  



  

(b) _Amended Schedule_. The applicable Schedule for any Taxable Year may be
amended from time to time by Parent: (i) in connection with a Determination
affecting such Schedule; (ii) to correct inaccuracies in the Schedule
identified as a result of a mistake or the receipt of additional factual
information relating to a Taxable Year after the date the Schedule was
originally provided to the Beneficiary Representative and the Blocker Holder;
(iii) to comply with an Expert's determination under the
Reconciliation Procedures applicable to this Agreement; (iv) to reflect a
change in the Realized Tax Benefit or Realized Tax Detriment for such Taxable
Year attributable to a carryback or carryforward of a loss or other Tax item
to such Taxable Year; (v) to reflect a change in the Realized Tax Benefit or
Realized Tax Detriment for such Taxable Year attributable to an amended Tax
Return filed for such Taxable Year; or (vi) to adjust a Basis Schedule to
take into account any Tax Benefit Payments made pursuant to this
Agreement (any such Schedule, an " _Amended Schedule_ "). Parent shall
provide an Amended Schedule to the Beneficiary Representative and the Blocker
Holder within sixty (60) calendar days of the occurrence of an event
referenced in clauses (i) through (vi) of the immediately preceding sentence,
and any such Amended Schedule shall be subject to approval procedures similar
to those described in Section 2.6(a). For the avoidance of doubt, if a
Schedule is amended after such Schedule becomes final pursuant to
_Section 2.6(a)_ , the Amended Schedule shall not be taken into account in
calculating any Tax Benefit Payment in the Taxable Year to which such
amendment relates but instead shall be taken into account in calculating the
Cumulative Net Realized Tax Benefit for the Taxable Year in which the
amendment is executed.

  



  

   

F-15

 



    



  

2.7 _Significant Beneficiaries_. For the purposes of Sections 2.3, 2.5 and
2.6 of this Agreement, a Significant Beneficiary shall have the
same procedural rights and obligations as the Beneficiary Representative and
Parent shall have the same procedural duties and obligations to a Significant
Beneficiary as it does to the Beneficiary Representative.

  



  

ARTICLE III 
 TAX BENEFIT PAYMENTS

  



  

3.1 _Payments_.

  



  

(a) _Timing of Payments_. Subject to _Sections 3.2_ and _3.3_ , within five
(5) Business Days following the date on which each (i) Tax Benefit Schedule
that is required to be delivered by Parent to the Beneficiaries pursuant to
_Section 2.5(a)_ of this Agreement becomes final in accordance with _Section
2.6(a)_ of this Agreement and (ii) Inherited Tax Attribute Schedule that is
required to be delivered by Parent to the Blocker Holder pursuant to Section
2.4(b) and Section 2.4(c) of this Agreement becomes final in accordance with
Section 2.4(b) or Section 2.4(c) of this Agreement (such date, a " _Final
Payment Date_ " in respect of any applicable Tax Benefit Payment), unless
required pursuant to the last sentence of this _Section 3.1(a)_ , Parent
shall pay to each Beneficiary the Tax Benefit Payment as determined pursuant
to _Section 3.1(b)_. Each Tax Benefit Payment made pursuant to this Section
3.1(a) shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
bank account previously designated by such Beneficiary or as otherwise agreed
by Parent and such Beneficiary. For the avoidance of doubt, neither the
Beneficiaries nor the Blocker Holder shall be required under any circumstances
to return any portion of any Tax Benefit Payment previously paid by Parent to
the Beneficiaries or the Blocker Holder, as the case may be (including any
portion of any Early Termination Payment).

  



  

(b) _Amount of Payments_. For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Tax Benefit
Payment_ " with respect to each Beneficiary means an amount, not less than
zero, equal to the sum of: (A) the Net Tax Benefit that is Allocable to such
Beneficiary and (B) the Actual Interest Amount in respect of such portion of
Net Tax Benefit.

  



  

(i) _Allocable_. The portion of any Net Tax Benefit of Parent that is
"Allocable" to any Beneficiary shall be determined by reference to the assets
from which arise the depreciation, amortization or other similar deductions
for recovery of cost or basis (" _Depreciation_ ") and the Inherited Tax
Attributes, and the Imputed Interest that produce the Realized Tax Benefit,
under the following principles:

  



  

(A) Any Realized Tax Benefit arising from a deduction to Parent with respect
to a Taxable Year for Depreciation arising in respect of a Basis Adjustment
to a Reference Asset is Allocable to each Beneficiary (including the Blocker
Holder) on a pro rata basis in proportion to the Beneficiaries' Attributable
Company Units, in accordance with Exhibit A.

  



  

(B) Any Realized Tax Benefit arising from the use of an Inherited Tax
Attribute of the Blocker is 100% Allocable to the Blocker Holder.

  



  

   

F-16

 



    



  

(C) Any Realized Tax Benefit arising from a deduction to Parent with respect
to a Taxable Year in respect of Imputed Interest is Allocable to a
Beneficiary that is required to include the Imputed Interest in income
(without regard to whether such Beneficiary is actually subject to tax
thereon).

  



  

(ii) _Net Tax Benefit_. The " _Net Tax Benefit_ " for a Taxable Year equals
the amount of the excess, if any, of (x) 85% of the Cumulative Net Realized
Tax Benefit Allocable to the Beneficiary as of the end of such Taxable Year
over (y) the aggregate amount of all Tax Benefit Payments previously made to
such Beneficiary under this _Section 3.1_ (excluding payments attributable to
Actual Interest Amounts). For the avoidance of doubt, if the Cumulative Net
Realized Tax Benefit as of the end of any Taxable Year is less than the
aggregate amount of all Tax Benefit Payments previously made to a Beneficiary,
such Beneficiary shall not be required to return any portion of any Tax
Benefit Payment previously made by Parent to such Beneficiary.

  



  

(iii) _Imputed Interest_. The principles of Sections 1272, 1274, or 483 of
the Code, as applicable, and the principles of any similar provision of U.S.
state and local law, will apply to cause a portion of any Net Tax Benefit
payable by Parent to a Beneficiary under this Agreement to be treated as
imputed interest (" _Imputed Interest_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, the
deduction for the amount of Imputed Interest as determined with respect to
any Net Tax Benefit payable by Parent to a Beneficiary shall be excluded in
determining the Hypothetical Tax Liability of Parent for purposes of
calculating Realized Tax Benefits and Realized Tax Detriments pursuant to
this Agreement.

  



  

(iv) _Default Rate Interest_. In the event that Parent does not make timely
payment of all or any portion of a Tax Benefit Payment to a Beneficiary on or
before a Final Payment Date as determined pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ , the
amount of " _Default Rate Interest_ " calculated in respect of the Net Tax
Benefit (including previously accrued Imputed Interest and Extension Rate
Interest) for a Taxable Year will equal interest calculated at the Default
Rate from a Final Payment Date for a Tax Benefit Payment as
determined pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ until the date on which Parent makes
such Tax Benefit Payment to such Beneficiary. For the avoidance of doubt, the
amount of any Default Rate Interest as determined with respect to any Net Tax
Benefit payable by Parent to a Beneficiary shall be excluded in the
Hypothetical Tax Liability of Parent for purposes of calculating Realized Tax
Benefits and Realized Tax Detriments pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

(v) _Value_. Parent and the Beneficiaries hereby acknowledge and agree that,
as of the date of this Agreement and as of the date of the Second Merger, the
aggregate value of the Tax Benefit Payments cannot be reasonably ascertained
for U.S. federal income or other applicable tax purposes.

  



  

(c) _Interest_. The provisions of _Section 3.1(b)_ are intended to operate so
that interest will effectively accrue in respect of the Net Tax Benefit for
any Taxable Year as follows:

  



  

(i) first, at the applicable rate used to determine the amount of Imputed
Interest under the Code (from the Exchange Date until the due date (without
extensions) for filing the U.S. federal income Tax Return of Parent for such
Taxable Year);

  



  

   

F-17

 



    



  

(ii) second, at the Agreed Rate in respect of any Extension Rate Interest
(from the due date (without extensions) for filing the U.S. federal income
Tax Return of Parent for such Taxable Year until a Final Payment Date for a
Tax Benefit Payment as determined pursuant to _Section 3.1(a))_ ; and

  



  

(iii) third, at the Default Rate in respect of any Default Rate Interest
(from a Final Payment Date for a Tax Benefit Payment as determined pursuant
to _Section 3.1(a)_ until the date on which Parent makes the relevant Tax
Benefit Payment to a Beneficiary).

  



  

3.2 _No Duplicative Payments_. It is intended that the provisions of this
Agreement will not result in the duplicative payment of any amount (including
interest) that may be required under this Agreement, and the provisions of
this Agreement shall be consistently interpreted and applied in accordance
with that intent. For purposes of this Agreement, and also for the avoidance
of doubt, no Tax Benefit Payment shall be calculated or made in respect of
any estimated tax payments, including any estimated U.S. federal income tax
payments.

  



  

3.3 _Pro-Ration of Payments as Between the Beneficiaries and the Blocker
Holder; Coordination of Benefits_.

  



  

(a) _Insufficient Taxable Income_. Notwithstanding anything in _Section
3.1(b)_ to the contrary, if the aggregate potential Covered Tax benefit of
Parent as calculated with respect to the Basis Adjustments, the Inherited Tax
Attributes, and Imputed Interest (in each case, without regard to the Taxable
Year of origination) permitted to be utilized in a particular Taxable Year is
limited in such Taxable Year because Parent does not have sufficient actual
taxable income or otherwise pursuant to applicable law, then the available
Covered Tax benefit for Parent shall be allocated among the Beneficiaries
(including the Blocker Holder) in proportion to the respective Tax Benefit
Payment that would have been payable if Parent had in fact had sufficient
taxable income so that there had been no such limitation.

  



  

(b) _Pro-Rata Payments_. After taking into account Section 3.3(a), if for any
reason Parent does not fully satisfy its payment obligations to make all Tax
Benefit Payments due under this Agreement in respect of a particular Taxable
Year, then (i) Parent shall pay the same proportion of each Tax Benefit
Payment due to each Beneficiary in respect of such Taxable Year, without
favoring one obligation over the other, and (ii) no Tax Benefit Payment shall
be made in respect of any Taxable Year until all Tax Benefit Payments
in respect of prior Taxable Years have been made in full.

  



  

(c) _Late Payments_. If for any reason Parent is not able to timely and fully
satisfy its payment obligations under this Agreement in respect of a
particular Taxable Year, then Default Rate Interest will begin to accrue
pursuant to _Section 5.2_.

  



  

(d) _Excess Payments_. To the extent Parent makes a payment to a Beneficiary
in respect of a particular Taxable Year under Section 3.1(a) of this
Agreement (taking into account Section 3.3(a) and (b)) in an amount in excess
of the amount of such payment that should have been made to such Beneficiary
in respect of such Taxable Year, then (i) such Beneficiary shall not receive
further payments under Section 3.1(a) until such Beneficiary has foregone an
amount of payments equal to such excess and (ii) Parent will pay the amount
of such Beneficiary's foregone payments to the other Persons to whom a payment
is due under this Agreement in a manner such that each such Person to whom a
payment is due under this Agreement, to the maximum extent possible, receives
aggregate payments under Section 3.1(a) (taking into account Section 3.3(a)
and (b)) in the amount it would have received if there had been no
excess payment to such Beneficiary.

ARTICLE IV 
 TERMINATION

  



  

4.1 _Termination_. Unless terminated earlier pursuant to _Section 4.2_ , this
Agreement will terminate when there is no further potential for a Tax Benefit
Payment pursuant to this Agreement. Tax Benefit Payments under this Agreement
are not conditioned on any Beneficiary (including the Blocker Holder)
retaining an interest in Parent or any successor thereto.

  



  

4.2 _Early Termination_.

  



  

(a) _Parent 's Early Termination Right_. With the written approval of a
majority of the Independent Directors, Parent may completely terminate this
Agreement, as and to the extent provided herein, with respect to all amounts
payable to the Beneficiaries or the Blocker Holder pursuant to this Agreement
by paying to the Beneficiaries and the Blocker Holder the Early Termination
Payment; _provided _ that Early Termination Payments may be made pursuant to
this _Section 4.2(a)_ only if made to all Beneficiaries and the Blocker
Holder that are entitled t _o_ such a payment simultaneously; _provided
further,_ that Parent may withdraw any notice to execute its termination
rights under this _Section 4.2(a)_ prior to the time at which any Early
Termination Payment has been paid. Upon Parent's payment of the Early
Termination Payment, Parent shall not have any further payment
obligations under this Agreement, other than with respect to any: (i) prior
Tax Benefit Payments that are due and payable under this Agreement but that
still remain unpaid as of the date of the Early Termination Notice; and (ii)
current Tax Benefit Payment due for the Taxable Year ending on or including
the date of the Early Termination Notice (except to the extent that the amount
described in clause (ii) is included in the calculation of the Early
Termination Payment).

  



  

(b) _Acceleration Upon Change of Control_. In the event of a Change of
Control, all obligations hereunder shall be accelerated and such
obligations shall be calculated pursuant to this _Article IV_ as if an Early
Termination Notice had been delivered on the closing date of the Change of
Control and utilizing the Valuation Assumptions by substituting the phrase
"the closing date of a Change of Control" in each place where the phrase
"Early Termination Effective Date" appears. Such obligations shall include,
but not be limited to, (1) the Early Termination Payment calculated as if an
Early Termination Notice had been delivered on the closing date of the Change
of Control, (2) any Tax Benefit Payments agreed to by Parent and the
Beneficiaries as due and payable but unpaid as of the Early Termination
Notice and (3) any Tax Benefit Payments due for any Taxable Year ending prior
to, with or including the closing date of a Change of Control (except to the
extent that any amounts described in clauses (2) or (3) are included in the
Early Termination Payment). For the avoidance of doubt, _Sections 4.3_ and
_4.4_ shall apply to a Change of Control, _mutadis mutandi_.

  



  

   

F-19

 



    



  

(c) _Acceleration Upon Breach of Agreement_. In the event that Parent
materially breaches any of its material obligations under this
Agreement, whether as a result of failure to make any payment due pursuant to
this Agreement within thirty days of receiving written notice from the
Beneficiary Representative or the Blocker Holder of Parent's such failure to
timely pay, failure to honor any other material obligation required hereunder
to the extent not cured within thirty (30) days of receiving written notice
from any Beneficiary or the Blocker Holder that is materially prejudiced by
such failure, or by operation of law as a result of the rejection of
this Agreement in a case commenced under the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise,
then all obligations hereunder shall be accelerated and become immediately
due and payable upon notice of acceleration from a 10% Beneficiary or as a
result of a Two-Thirds Beneficiary Approval ( _provided_ that in the case of
any proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or other insolvency statute, such
acceleration shall be automatic without any such notice), and such
obligations shall be calculated as if an Early Termination Notice had
been delivered on the date of such notice of acceleration (or, in the case of
any proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or other insolvency statute, on the
date of such breach) and shall include, but not be limited to: (i) the Early
Termination Payment calculated as if an Early Termination Notice had been
delivered on the date of such acceleration; (ii) any prior Tax Benefit
Payments that are due and payable under this Agreement but that still remain
unpaid as of the date of such acceleration; and (iii) any current Tax Benefit
Payment due for the Taxable Year ending with or including the date of such
acceleration. For purposes of this _Section 4.2(c)_ , and subject to the
following sentence, the Parties agree that the failure to make any payment due
pursuant to this Agreement within thirty days of receiving written notice
from the Beneficiary Representative or the Blocker Holder of Parent's such
failure to timely pay shall be deemed to be a material breach of a material
obligation under this Agreement for all purposes of this Agreement, and that
it will not be considered to be a material breach of a material obligation
under this Agreement to make a payment due pursuant to this Agreement within
thirty days of receiving such written notice. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, it shall not be a material breach of a
material obligation of this Agreement if Parent fails to make any Tax Benefit
Payment to the extent that Parent has insufficient funds, or cannot take
commercially reasonable actions to obtain sufficient funds, to make such
payment; _provided_ that the interest provisions of _Section 5.2_ shall
apply to such late payment (unless Parent does not have sufficient funds to
make such payment as a result of limitations imposed by any Senior
Obligations, in which case _Section 5.2_ shall apply, but the Default Rate
shall be replaced by the Agreed Rate).

  



  

4.3 _Early Termination Notice_. If Parent chooses to exercise its right of
early termination under _Section 4.2_ above, Parent shall deliver to the
Beneficiaries and the Blocker Holder a notice of Parent's decision to exercise
such right (an " _Early Termination Notice_ ") and a schedule (the " _Early
Termination Schedule_ ") showing in reasonable detail the calculation of the
Early Termination Payment. Parent shall also (x) deliver supporting schedules
and work papers, as determined by Parent or as reasonably requested by a
Beneficiary or the Blocker Holder, that provide a reasonable level of detail
regarding the data and calculations that were relevant for purposes of
preparing the Early Termination Schedule; (y) deliver a Parent
Letter supporting such Early Termination Schedule; and (z) allow the
Beneficiaries or the Blocker Holder and their advisors to have
reasonable access to the appropriate representatives, as determined by Parent
or as reasonably requested by the Beneficiaries or the Blocker Holder, at
Parent and the Advisory Firm in connection with a review of such Early
Termination Schedule. The Early Termination Schedule shall become final and
binding on each Party forty-five (45) calendar days from the first date on
which the Beneficiaries or the Blocker Holder received such Early Termination
Schedule unless:

  



  

(i) a Beneficiary or the Blocker Holder, within forty-five (45) calendar days
after receiving the Early Termination Schedule, provides Parent with (A)
notice of a material objection to such Early Termination Schedule made in good
faith and setting forth in reasonable detail such Beneficiary's or the
Blocker Holder's material objection (a " _Termination Objection Notice_
") and (B) a letter from the Beneficiary Advisory Firm in support of such
Termination Objection Notice; or

  



  

   

F-20

 



    



  

(ii) each Beneficiary or the Blocker Holder provides a written waiver of such
right of a Termination Objection Notice within the period described in clause
(i) above, in which case such Early Termination Schedule becomes binding on
the date the waiver from all Beneficiaries or the Blocker Holder is received
by Parent.

  



  

In the event that a Beneficiary or the Blocker Holder timely delivers a
Termination Objection Notice pursuant to clause (i) above, and if the
Parties, for any reason, are unable to successfully resolve the issues raised
in the Termination Objection Notice within thirty (30) calendar days after
receipt by Parent of the Termination Objection Notice, Parent and such
Beneficiary or the Blocker Holder shall employ the Reconciliation Procedures.
For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, the expense of preparing and obtaining the letter from the
Beneficiary Advisory Firm referenced in clause (i) above shall be
borne solely by such Beneficiary or the Blocker Holder and Parent shall have
no liability with respect to such letter or any of the expenses associated
with its preparation and delivery. The date on which the Early Termination
Schedule becomes final in accordance with this _Section 4.3_ shall be the "
_Early Termination Reference Date_."

  



  

4.4 _Payment upon Early Termination_.

  



  

(a) _Timing of Payment_. Within five (5) Business Days after the Early
Termination Reference Date, Parent shall pay to each Beneficiary and the
Blocker Holder an amount equal to the Early Termination Payment for such
Beneficiary and the Blocker Holder. Such Early Termination Payment shall be
made by Parent by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank
account or accounts designated by the Beneficiaries or the Blocker Holder or
as otherwise agreed by Parent and the Beneficiaries or the Blocker Holder.

  



  

(b) _Amount of Payment_. The " _Early Termination Payment_ " payable to a
Beneficiary or the Blocker Holder pursuant to  _Section 4.4(a)_ shall equal
the present value, discounted at the Early Termination Rate as determined as
of the Early Termination Reference Date, of all Tax Benefit Payments that
would be required to be paid by Parent to such Beneficiary or the Blocker
Holder, beginning from the Early Termination Effective Date and using the
Valuation Assumptions.

  



  

ARTICLE V 
 SUBORDINATION AND BREACH OF PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS

  



  

5.1 _Subordination_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, any Tax Benefit Payment or Early Termination Payment
required to be made by Parent to the Beneficiaries or the Blocker Holder
under this Agreement shall rank subordinate and junior in right of payment to
any principal, interest, or other amounts due and payable in respect of any
obligations owed in respect of secured or unsecured indebtedness for borrowed
money of Parent and its Subsidiaries (in all events, excluding any debt
instruments between Parent and any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates) ("
_Senior Obligations_ ") and shall rank pari passu in right of payment with
all current or future unsecured obligations of Parent that are not Senior
Obligations. To the extent that any payment under this Agreement is not
permitted to be made at the time payment is due as a result of this _Section
5.1_ and the terms of the agreements governing Senior Obligations, such
payment obligation nevertheless shall accrue for the benefit of the
Beneficiaries or the Blocker Holder and Parent shall make such payments at the
first opportunity that such payments are permitted to be made in accordance
with the terms of the Senior Obligations. For the avoidance of doubt,
notwithstanding the above, the determination of whether it is a breach of
this Agreement if Parent fails to make any Tax Benefit Payment when due shall
be governed by _Section 4.2(c)_.

  



  

   

F-21

 



    



  

5.2 _Late Payments by Parent_. Except as otherwise provided herein, the
amount of all or any portion of any Tax Benefit Payment or Early Termination
Payment not made to the Beneficiaries or the Blocker Holder when due under the
terms of this Agreement, whether as a result of _Section 5.1_ and the terms
of the Senior Obligations or otherwise, shall be payable together with Default
Rate Interest, which shall accrue beginning on a Final Payment Date and be
computed as provided in _Section 3.1(b)(iv)_.

  



  

ARTICLE VI 
 TAX MATTERS; CONSISTENCY; COOPERATION

  



  

6.1 _Parent 's and the Company's Tax Matters_. Except as otherwise provided
herein, Parent shall have full responsibility for, and sole discretion over,
all Tax matters concerning Parent and the Company Group, including the
preparation, filing or amending of any Tax Return and defending, contesting
or settling any issue pertaining to Taxes, subject to a requirement that the
Parent act in good faith in connection with its control of any matter which
is reasonably expected to materially affect the Beneficiaries' rights and
obligations under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall
notify the Beneficiary Representative, the Significant Beneficiaries and the
Blocker Holder of, and keep them reasonably informed with respect to, the
portion of any tax audit of Parent or the Company, or any of the Company's
Subsidiaries, the outcome of which is reasonably expected to affect the Tax
Benefit Payments payable to the Beneficiaries or the Blocker Holder under this
Agreement.

  



  

6.2 _Consistency_. All calculations and determinations made hereunder,
including any Basis Adjustments, the Schedules, and the determination of
any Realized Tax Benefits or Realized Tax Detriments, shall be made in
accordance with the elections, methodologies or positions taken by Parent and
the Company on their respective Tax Returns. Each Beneficiary and the Blocker
Holder shall prepare its Tax Returns in a manner that is consistent with the
terms of this Agreement, and any related calculations or determinations that
are made hereunder, including the terms of _Section 2.1_ of this Agreement
and the Schedules provided to the Beneficiaries and the Blocker Holder under
this Agreement unless otherwise required by applicable Law. In the event that
an Advisory Firm is replaced with another Advisory Firm acceptable to the
Audit Committee, such replacement Advisory Firm shall perform its services
under this Agreement using procedures and methodologies consistent with the
previous Advisory Firm, unless otherwise required by law or unless Parent,
the Beneficiary Representative, the Significant Beneficiaries and the Blocker
Holder agree to the use of other procedures and methodologies.

  



  

   

F-22

 



    



  

6.3 _Cooperation_. Each Beneficiary and the Blocker Holder shall (a) furnish
to Parent in a timely manner such information, documents and other
materials as Parent may reasonably request for purposes of making any
determination or computation necessary or appropriate under this
Agreement, preparing any Tax Return or contesting or defending any audit,
examination or controversy with any Taxing Authority, (b) make itself
available to Parent and its representatives to provide explanations of
documents and materials and such other information as Parent or its
representatives may reasonably request in connection with any of the matters
described in clause (a) above, and (c) reasonably cooperate in connection
with any such matter, and Parent shall reimburse any Beneficiary or the
Blocker Holder for any reasonable third-party costs and expenses incurred by
such Beneficiary or the Blocker Holder pursuant to this _Section 6.3_.

  



  

6.4 _Pre-Transactions Tax Records_. Parent and its advisors may rely on all
Tax Returns of the Company that were prepared and filed prior to
completion of the Reorganization Transactions and may assume in good faith
that all such Tax Returns are correct, complete and accurate unless otherwise
established by a Determination.

  



  

6.5 _Tax Treatment of Beneficiary Rights_. The Parties acknowledge and hereby
agree to treat for all tax reporting purposes any payments made to a
Beneficiary under this Agreement: (i) such payments arising from the Second
Merger or the Blocker Contribution, as money received within the meaning of
Section 351(b)(1) of the Code, except with respect to Imputed Interest or
payments that are Actual Interest Amounts. The Parties shall for all tax
reporting purposes treat such payments consistently with this Section 6.5
except upon a contrary final determination by an applicable taxing authority.

7.2 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being understood that
all Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Delivery of an executed
signature page to this Agreement by facsimile transmission or electronic mail
shall be as effective as delivery of a manually signed counterpart of this
Agreement.

  



  

7.3 _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely
to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

  



  

7.4 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the law of the State of Delaware, without regard to the
conflicts of laws principles thereof that would mandate the application of the
laws of another jurisdiction.

  



  

7.5 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any law or public
policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

  



  

   

F-24

 



    



  

7.6 _Successors; Assignment; Amendments; Waivers_.

  



  

(a) _Assignment_. Each Beneficiary and the Blocker Holder may assign, sell,
pledge, or otherwise alienate or transfer any interest in this Agreement in
whole or in part, including the right to receive any Tax Benefit Payments
under this Agreement, to any Person without the prior written consent of
Parent, unless such transfer would be prohibited by law; _provided, however_ ,
such Person shall execute and deliver a Joinder agreeing to succeed to the
applicable portion of such Beneficiary's or the Blocker Holder's interest in
this Agreement and to become a Party for all purposes of this Agreement (the "
_Joinder Requirement_ "). Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, an assignee of only rights to receive a Tax Benefit Payment in
connection with the Second Merger has no rights under this Agreement other
than to enforce it right to receive a Tax Benefit Payment pursuant to this
Agreement.

  



  

(b) _Amendments_. No provision of this Agreement may be amended unless such
amendment is approved in writing by Parent and by the Beneficiaries or the
Blocker Holder who would be entitled to receive at least two-thirds of the
Early Termination Payments payable to all Beneficiaries and the Blocker
Holder hereunder if the Company had exercised its right of early termination
under Section 4.2; provided that no such amendment shall be effective if such
amendment will have a materially disproportionate effect on the payments
certain Beneficiaries or the Blocker Holder may receive under this Agreement
unless at least two-thirds of such Beneficiaries or the Blocker Holder
materially disproportionately effected (with such two-thirds threshold being
measured by the entitlement to Early Termination Payments as set forth in the
preceding portion of this sentence) consent in writing to such amendment. No
provision of this Agreement may be waived unless such waiver is in writing
and signed by the Party against whom the waiver is to be effective.

  



  

(c) _Successors_. All of the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be
binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by, the
Parties hereto and their respective successors, assigns, heirs, executors,
administrators and legal representatives. Parent shall require and cause any
direct or indirect successor (whether by purchase, Second Merger,
consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or
assets of Parent, by written agreement, expressly to assume and agree to
perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that Parent
would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place.

  



  

(d) _Waiver_. No failure by any Party to insist upon the strict performance
of any covenant, duty, agreement, or condition of this Agreement, or to
exercise any right or remedy consequent upon a breach thereof, shall
constitute a waiver of any such breach or any other covenant, duty,
agreement, or condition.

  



  

7.7 _Titles and Subtitles_. The headings and titles of the sections and
subsections of this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and are
not to be considered in construing this Agreement.

  



  

7.8 _Resolution of Disputes_.

  



  

(a) Except for Reconciliation Disputes subject to _Section 7.10_ , any and
all disputes which cannot be settled after substantial good-
faith negotiation, including any ancillary claims of any Party, arising out
of, relating to or in connection with the validity, negotiation, execution,
interpretation, performance or non-performance of this Agreement (including
the validity, scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision) (each a
" _Dispute_ ") shall be finally resolved by arbitration in accordance
with the International Institute for Conflict Prevention and Resolution Rules
for Non-Administered Arbitration by a panel of three arbitrators (the "
_Arbitrators_ "), of which Parent shall designate one Arbitrator and the
Beneficiaries or the Blocker Holder party to such Dispute shall designate one
Arbitrator in accordance with the "screened" appointment procedure provided
in Resolution Rule 5.4. The arbitration shall be governed by the Federal
Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1 _et seq_., and judgment upon the award
rendered by the arbitrators may be entered by any court having jurisdiction
thereof. The place of the arbitration shall be Wilmington, Delaware. The
Arbitrators are not empowered to award damages in excess of
compensatory damages, and each Party hereby irrevocably waives any right to
recover punitive, exemplary or similar damages with respect to any Dispute.

  



  

   

F-25

 



    



  

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a), any Party may bring an
action or special proceeding in any court of competent jurisdiction for the
purpose of compelling another Party to arbitrate, seeking temporary or
preliminary relief in aid of an arbitration hereunder, and/or enforcing an
arbitration award and, for the purposes of this paragraph (b), each Party (i)
expressly consents to the application of paragraph (c) of this _Section 7.8_
to any such action or proceeding, and (ii) agrees that proof shall not be
required that monetary damages for breach of the provisions of this Agreement
would be difficult to calculate and that remedies at law would be inadequate.
For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 7.8_ shall not apply to
Reconciliation Disputes to be settled in accordance with the procedures set
forth in _Section 7.10_.

  



  

(c) Each Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and
its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of the
State of Delaware or, if such Court declines jurisdiction, the courts of the
State of Delaware sitting in Wilmington, Delaware, and of the U.S. District
Court for the District of Delaware sitting in Wilmington, Delaware, and any
appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding brought in
accordance with the provisions of _Section 7.8(b)_ or any judicial proceeding
ancillary to an arbitration or contemplated arbitration (including any
proceeding to compel arbitration to obtain temporary or preliminary judicial
relief in aid of arbitration or to confirm an arbitration award) arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or for recognition or enforcement of any
judgment, and each of the Parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally
agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be
heard and determined in such Delaware State court or, to the fullest extent

(f) WAIVER OF RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY).

  



  

7.9 _Removal or Replacement of Beneficiary Representative_. The Beneficiary
Representative shall not be removed or replaced without the written consent
of Parent and the Two-Thirds Beneficiary Approval.

  



  

7.10 _Reconciliation_. In the event that Parent and the Beneficiary
Representative, a Significant Beneficiary, or the Blocker Holder are unable to
resolve a disagreement with respect to a Basis Schedule, Tax Benefit
Schedule, Inherited Tax Attribute Schedule (as applicable), or with respect
to an Early Termination Schedule, within the relevant time period designated
in this Agreement (a " _Reconciliation Dispute_ "), the Reconciliation
Dispute shall be submitted for determination to a nationally recognized expert
(the " _Expert_ ") in the particular area of disagreement mutually acceptable
to both Parties. The Expert shall be a partner or principal in a
nationally recognized accounting firm, and unless Parent and the Beneficiary
Representative, such Significant Beneficiary, or the Blocker Holder agree
otherwise, the Expert shall not, and the firm that employs the Expert shall
not, have any material relationship with Parent or the Beneficiary
Representative, such Significant Beneficiary, or the Blocker Holder or other
actual or potential conflict of interest. If the Parties are unable to agree
on an Expert within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt by the
respondent(s) of written notice of a Reconciliation Dispute, the selection of
an Expert shall be treated as a Dispute subject to _Section 7.8_ and an
arbitration panel shall pick an Expert from a nationally recognized accounting
firm that does not have any material relationship with Parent or the
Beneficiary Representative, such Significant Beneficiary, or the Blocker
Holder or other actual or potential conflict of interest. The Expert shall
resolve any matter relating to the Basis Schedule or an amendment
thereto, the Inherited Tax Attribute Schedule or an amendment thereto or the
Early Termination Schedule or an amendment thereto within thirty (30)
calendar days and shall resolve any matter relating to a Tax Benefit Schedule
or an amendment thereto within fifteen (15) calendar days or as soon
thereafter as is reasonably practicable, in each case after the matter has
been submitted to the Expert for resolution. Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence, if the matter is not resolved before any payment that is the
subject of a disagreement would be due (in the absence of such disagreement)
or any Tax Return reflecting the subject of a disagreement is due, the
undisputed amount shall be paid on the date prescribed by this Agreement and
such Tax Return may be filed as prepared by Parent, subject to adjustment or
amendment upon resolution. The costs and expenses relating to the engagement
of such Expert or amending any Tax Return shall be borne by Parent except as
provided in the next sentence. Parent, the Beneficiary Representative, such
Significant Beneficiary, or the Blocker Holder shall bear its own costs and
expenses of such proceeding, unless (i) the Expert adopts the Beneficiary
Representative's, such Significant Beneficiary's, or the Blocker Holder's
position, in which case Parent shall reimburse the Beneficiary
Representative, the Significant Beneficiary or the Blocker Holder, as the
case may be, for any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and
expenses in such proceeding, or (ii) the Expert adopts Parent's position, in
which case the Beneficiary Representative, the Significant Beneficiary or the
Blocker Holder, as the case may be, shall reimburse Parent for any reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses in such proceeding. Any
dispute as to whether a dispute is a Reconciliation Dispute within the
meaning of this _Section 7.10_ shall be decided by the Expert. The Expert
shall finally determine any Reconciliation Dispute and the determinations of
the Expert pursuant to this _Section 7.10 _ shall be binding on Parent, the
Beneficiary Representative, the Beneficiaries, and the Blocker Holder and may
be entered and enforced in any court having competent jurisdiction.

7.11 _Withholding_. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
payment payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any
provision of U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority
by Parent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the applicable Beneficiary or the applicable
Blocker Holder. Each Beneficiary or the Blocker Holder shall promptly provide
Parent with any applicable tax forms and certifications reasonably requested
by Parent in connection with determining whether any such deductions and
withholdings are required under any provision of U.S. federal state, local or
non-U.S. tax law. Prior to any such withholding, Parent shall (i) promptly
notify the Beneficiary Representative or the Blocker Holder, as applicable, of
any anticipated withholding, (ii) consult with the Beneficiary Representative
or the Blocker Holder, as applicable, in good faith to determine whether such
deduction and withholding is required under applicable Tax Law, and (iii)
cooperate with the Beneficiary Representative or the Blocker Holder, as
applicable, in good faith to minimize the amount of any applicable
withholding.

  



  

7.12 _Admission of Parent into a Consolidated Group; Transfers of Corporate
Assets_.

  



  

(a) If Parent becomes a member of an affiliated or consolidated group of
corporations that files a consolidated income tax return pursuant to Sections
1501, _et seq._ or other applicable Sections of the Code or any corresponding
provisions of state, local or non-U.S. law, then: (i) the provisions of this
Agreement shall be applied with respect to the group as a whole; and (ii) Tax
Benefit Payments, Early Termination Payments and other applicable items
hereunder shall be computed with reference to the consolidated taxable
income of the group as a whole.

  



  

(b) If Parent (or any other entity that is obligated to make a Tax Benefit
Payment or Early Termination Payment hereunder) or any member of the Company
Group transfers (or is deemed to transfer) one or more assets to a corporation
with which Parent or any other entity that is obligated to make a Tax Benefit
Payment or Early Termination Payment hereunder does not file a consolidated
tax return pursuant to Section 1501 of the Code (or will not file such a
return following a series of transactions undertaken in connection with such
transfer(s)), such entity, for purposes of calculating the amount of any Tax
Benefit Payment or Early Termination Payment due hereunder, shall be treated
as having disposed of such asset in a fully taxable transaction on the date of
such transfer. The consideration deemed to be received by such entity shall
be equal to the net fair market value of the transferred asset as determined
by Parent, plus (i) the amount of debt to which such asset is subject, in the
case of a transfer of an encumbered asset, or (ii) the amount of debt
allocated to such asset, in the case of a transfer of a partnership interest.

  



  

   

F-28

 



    



  

7.13 _Confidentiality_. Each Beneficiary and its assignees, the Beneficiary
Representative and each of its assignees, and the Blocker Holder and each of
its assignees acknowledges and agrees that the information of Parent is
confidential and, except in the course of performing any duties as necessary
for Parent and its Affiliates, as required by law or legal process or to
enforce the terms of this Agreement, such Person shall keep and retain in the
strictest confidence and not disclose to any Person any confidential matters,
acquired pursuant to this Agreement, of Parent and its Affiliates and
successors, learned by any Beneficiary or the Blocker Holder heretofore or
hereafter. This _Section 7.13_ shall not apply to (i) any information that has
been made publicly available by Parent or any of its Affiliates, becomes
public knowledge (except as a result of an act of any Beneficiary or the
Blocker Holder in violation of this Agreement) or is generally known to the
business community, (ii) the disclosure of information to the extent
necessary for a Beneficiary or the Blocker Holder to prosecute or defend
claims arising under or relating to this Agreement, and (iii) the disclosure
of information to the extent necessary for a Beneficiary or the Blocker Holder
to prepare and file its Tax Returns, to respond to any inquiries regarding
the same from any Taxing Authority or to prosecute or defend any action,
proceeding or audit by any Taxing Authority with respect to such Tax Returns.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Beneficiaries
the Blocker Holder and each of their respective assignees (and each employee,
representative or other agent of the Beneficiaries and the Blocker Holder or
their assignees, as applicable) may disclose at their discretion to any and
all Persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax
structure of Parent, the Beneficiaries and the Blocker Holder and any of their
transactions, and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions or other
tax analyses) that are provided to the Beneficiaries or the Blocker Holder
relating to such tax treatment and tax structure. If a Beneficiary, the
Blocker Holder or an assignee commits a breach, or threatens to commit a
breach, of any of the provisions of this _Section 7.13_ , Parent shall have
the right and remedy to have the provisions of this _Section 7.13_
specifically enforced by injunctive relief or otherwise by any court of
competent jurisdiction without the need to post any bond or other security,
it being acknowledged and agreed that any such breach or threatened breach
shall cause irreparable injury to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and that
money damages alone shall not provide an adequate remedy to such Persons.
Such rights and remedies shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any
other rights and remedies available at law or in equity.

  



  

7.14 _Independent Nature of Beneficiaries ' Rights and Obligations_. The
rights and obligations of each Beneficiary and the Blocker Holder hereunder
are several and not joint with the rights and obligations of any other Person.
A Beneficiary or the Blocker Holder shall not be responsible in any way for
the performance of the obligations of any other Person hereunder, nor shall a
Beneficiary or the Blocker Holder have the right to enforce the rights or
obligations of any other Person hereunder (other than Parent).
The obligations of a Beneficiary or the Blocker Holder hereunder are solely
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable solely by, Parent. Nothing
contained herein or in any other agreement or document delivered at any
closing, and no action taken by any Beneficiary or the Blocker Holder
pursuant hereto or thereto, shall be deemed to constitute the Beneficiaries or
the Blocker Holder acting as a partnership, an association, a joint venture
or any other kind of entity, or create a presumption that the
Beneficiaries or the Blocker Holder are in any way acting in concert or as a
group with respect to such rights or obligations or the
transactions contemplated hereby, and Parent acknowledges that the
Beneficiaries or the Blocker Holder are not acting in concert or as a
group and will not assert any such claim with respect to such rights or
obligations or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

   

F-29

 



    



  

7.15 _Change in Law_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if, in
connection with an actual or proposed change in law, a Beneficiary or the
Blocker Holder reasonably believes that the existence of this Agreement could
cause income (other than income arising from receipt of a payment under this
Agreement) recognized by such Beneficiary or the Blocker Holder (or direct or
indirect equity holders in such Beneficiary or the Blocker Holder) in
connection with the Second Merger or the Blocker Contribution to be
treated as ordinary income rather than capital gain (or otherwise taxed at
ordinary income rates) for U.S. federal income tax purposes or would have
other material adverse tax consequences to such Beneficiary, the Blocker
Holder or any direct or indirect owner of such Beneficiary or the Blocker
Holder, then at the written election of such Beneficiary or the Blocker
Holder, as the case may be, in its sole discretion (in an instrument signed
by such Beneficiary or the Blocker Holder and delivered to Parent) and to the
extent specified therein by such Beneficiary or the Blocker Holder, as the
case may be, this Agreement shall cease to have further effect, or may be
amended by in a manner reasonably determined by such Beneficiary or the
Blocker Holder; _provided _ that such amendment shall not result in an
increase in any payments owed by Parent under this Agreement at any time as
compared to the amounts and times of payments that would have been due in the
absence of such amendment.

  



  

7.16 _Interest Rate Limitation_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, the interest paid or agreed to be paid hereunder with
respect to amounts due to any Beneficiary or the Blocker Holder hereunder
shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by
applicable Law (the " _Maximum Rate_ "). If any Beneficiary or the Blocker
Holder shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the
excess interest shall be applied to the Tax Benefit Payment or
Early Termination Payment, as applicable (but in each case exclusive of any
component thereof comprising interest) or, if it exceeds such unpaid non-
interest amount, refunded to Parent. In determining whether the interest
contracted for, charged, or received by any Beneficiary or the Blocker Holder
exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Beneficiary or the Blocker Holder may, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not
principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude
voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate,
allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest
throughout the contemplated term of the payment obligations owed by Parent to
such Beneficiary or the Blocker Holder hereunder. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, it is the intention of the Parties to conform strictly to any
applicable usury laws.

2. REGISTRATION RIGHTS.

  



  

2.1 _Resale Shelf Registration Rights_.

  



  

2.1.1 _Registration Statement Covering Resale of Registrable Securities_.
ParentCo shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed with the
Commission, no later than forty five (45) days following the date that
ParentCo becomes eligible to use Form S-3 or its successor form (the " _S-3
Eligibility Date_ "), a Registration Statement for an offering to be made on a
continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act registering the
resale from time to time by Investors of all of the Registrable Securities
then held by or then issuable, including the shares of Common Stock issuable
as Contingency Consideration (as defined in the Business Combination
Agreement) and shares of Common Stock issuable as Earn-Out Consideration (as
defined in the Founder Support Agreement), to Investors that are not covered
by an effective registration statement on the S-3 Eligibility Date (the "
_Resale Shelf Registration Statement_ "). The Resale Shelf Registration
Statement shall be on Form S-3 or another appropriate form permitting
Registration of such Registrable Securities for resale by such Investors.
ParentCo shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Resale Shelf
Registration Statement to be declared effective as soon as possible after
filing, and once effective, to keep the Resale Shelf Registration Statement
continuously effective under the Securities Act at all times until the
expiration of the Effectiveness Period.

  



    

G-4

 



    



  

2.1.2 _Notification and Distribution of Materials_. ParentCo shall notify the
Investors in writing of the effectiveness of the Resale Shelf
Registration Statement and shall furnish to them, without charge, such number
of copies of the Resale Shelf Registration Statement (including any
amendments, supplements and exhibits), the Prospectus contained therein
(including each preliminary prospectus and all related amendments and
supplements) and any documents incorporated by reference in the Resale Shelf
Registration Statement or such other documents as the Investors may
reasonably request in order to facilitate the sale of the Registrable
Securities in the manner described in the Resale Shelf Registration
Statement.

  



  

2.1.3 _Amendments and Supplements_. Subject to the provisions of _Section
2.1.1_ above, ParentCo shall promptly prepare and file with the
Commission from time to time such amendments and supplements to the Resale
Shelf Registration Statement and Prospectus used in connection therewith as
may be necessary to keep the Resale Shelf Registration Statement effective and
to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the
disposition of all the Registrable Securities during the Effectiveness Period.

  



  

2.1.4 Notwithstanding the registration obligations set forth in this _Section
2.1_ , in the event the Commission informs ParentCo that all of
the Registrable Securities cannot, as a result of the application of Rule
415, be registered for resale as a secondary offering on a single
registration statement, ParentCo agrees to promptly (i) inform each of the
holders thereof and use its commercially reasonable efforts to file
amendments to the Resale Shelf Registration Statement as required by the
Commission and/or (ii) withdraw the Resale Shelf Registration Statement and
file a new registration statement (a " _New Registration Statement_ "), in
either case covering the maximum number of Registrable Securities permitted to
be registered by the Commission, on Form S-3 or such other form available to
register for resale the Registrable Securities as a secondary offering;
provided, however, that prior to filing such amendment or New Registration
Statement, ParentCo shall be obligated to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to advocate with the Commission for the registration of all of the
Registrable Securities in accordance with any publicly-available written or
oral guidance, comments, requirements or requests of the Commission staff (the
" _SEC Guidance_ "), including without limitation, the Manual of Publicly
Available Telephone Interpretations D.29. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, if any SEC Guidance sets forth a limitation of
the number of Registrable Securities permitted to be registered on a
particular Registration Statement as a secondary offering (and notwithstanding
that ParentCo used diligent efforts to advocate with the Commission for the
registration of all or a greater number of Registrable Securities), unless
otherwise directed in writing by a holder as to its Registrable Securities,
the number of Registrable Securities to be registered on such Registration
Statement will be reduced on a pro rata basis based on the total number of
Registrable Securities held by the Investors, subject to a determination by
the Commission that certain Investors must be reduced first based on the
number of Registrable Securities held by such Investors. In the event
ParentCo amends the Resale Shelf Registration Statement or files a New
Registration Statement, as the case may be, under clauses (i) or (ii) above,
ParentCo will use its commercially reasonable efforts to file with the
Commission, as promptly as allowed by Commission or SEC Guidance provided to
ParentCo or to registrants of securities in general, one or more
registration statements on Form S-3 or such other form available to register
for resale those Registrable Securities that were not registered for resale
on the Resale Shelf Registration Statement, as amended, or the New
Registration Statement.

  



    

G-5

 



    



  

2.1.5 _Notice of Certain Events_. ParentCo shall promptly notify the
Investors in writing of any request by the Commission for any amendment or
supplement to, or additional information in connection with, the Resale Shelf
Registration Statement required to be prepared and filed hereunder (or
Prospectus relating thereto). ParentCo shall promptly notify each Investor in
writing of the filing of the Resale Shelf Registration Statement or any
Prospectus, amendment or supplement related thereto or any post-effective
amendment to the Resale Shelf Registration Statement and the effectiveness of
any post-effective amendment.

  



  

(a) If ParentCo shall receive a request from the holders of Registrable
Securities with an estimated market value of at least $[●] (the requesting
holder(s) shall be referred to herein as the " _Requesting Holder_ ") that
ParentCo effect the Underwritten Takedown of all or any portion of the
Requesting Holder's Registrable Securities, and specifying the intended
method of disposition thereof, then ParentCo shall promptly give notice of
such requested Underwritten Takedown (each such request shall be referred to
herein as a " _Demand Takedown_ ") at least ten (10) Business Days prior to
the anticipated filing date of the prospectus or supplement relating to such
Demand Takedown to the other Investors and thereupon shall use its reasonable
best efforts to effect, as expeditiously as possible, the offering in such
Underwritten Takedown of:

  



  

(i) subject to the restrictions set forth in _Section 2.2.4_ , all
Registrable Securities for which the Requesting Holder has requested such
offering under _Section 2.1.5(a)_ , and

  



  

(ii) subject to the restrictions set forth in _Section 2.2.4_ , all other
Registrable Securities that any holders of Registrable Securities (all such
holders, together with the Requesting Holder, the " _Selling Holders_ ") have
requested ParentCo to offer by request received by ParentCo within seven
Business Days after such holders receive ParentCo's notice of the Demand
Takedown, all to the extent necessary to permit the disposition (in accordance
with the intended methods thereof as aforesaid) of the Registrable Securities
so to be offered.

  



  

(b) Promptly after the expiration of the seven-Business Day-period referred
to in _Section 2.1.5(a)(ii)_ , ParentCo will notify all Selling Holders of
the identities of the other Selling Holders and the number of shares of
Registrable Securities requested to be included therein.

  



    

G-6

 



    



  

(c) ParentCo shall only be required to effectuate: (i) one Underwritten
Takedown within any six-month period; (ii) no more than [●] Underwritten
Takedowns in respect of all Registrable Securities held by the NAC Investors
after giving effect to _Section 2.2.1(c)_; and (d) no more than [●]
Underwritten Takedowns in respect of all Registrable Securities held by the
Company Investors after giving effect to Section 2.2.1(d).

  



  

(d) If the managing underwriter in an Underwritten Takedown advises ParentCo
and the Requesting Holder that, in its view, the number of shares of
Registrable Securities requested to be included in such underwritten offering
exceeds the largest number of shares that can be sold without having an
adverse effect on such offering, including the price at which such shares can
be sold, the shares included in such Underwritten Takedown will be reduced by
the Registrable Securities held by the Selling Holders (applied on a pro rata
basis based on the total number of Registrable Securities held by such
Investors, subject to a determination by the Commission that certain
Investors must be reduced first based on the number of Registrable Securities
held by such Investors).

  



  

2.1.6 _Selection of Underwriters_. Selling Holders holding a majority in
interest of the Registrable Securities requested to be sold in an
Underwritten Takedown shall have the right to select an Underwriter or
Underwriters in connection with such Underwritten Takedown, which
Underwriter or Underwriters shall be reasonably acceptable to ParentCo. In
connection with an Underwritten Takedown, ParentCo shall enter into customary
agreements (including an underwriting agreement in customary form) and take
such other actions as are reasonably required in order to expedite or
facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities in such Underwritten
Takedown, including, if necessary, the engagement of a "qualified independent
underwriter" in connection with the qualification of the underwriting
arrangements with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.

  



  

2.1.7 Registrations effected pursuant to this _Section 2.1_ shall not be
counted as Demand Registrations effected pursuant to _Section 2.2_.

  



  

2.2 _Demand Registration_.

  



  

2.2.1 _Request for Registration_. At any time and from time to time after the
expiration of a lock-up to which such shares are subject, if any, (i) NAC
Investors who hold a [a majority in interest] of the Registrable Securities
held by all NAC Investors or (ii) Company Investors who hold [●]of the
Registrable Securities held by all Company Investors, as the case may be, may
make a written demand for Registration under the Securities Act of all or any
portion of their Registrable Securities on Form S-1 or any similar long-
form Registration or, if then available, on Form S-3. Each registration
requested pursuant to this _Section 2.2.1_ is referred to herein as a "
_Demand Registration_ ". Any demand for a Demand Registration shall specify
the number of shares of Registrable Securities proposed to be sold and the
intended method(s) of distribution thereof. ParentCo will notify
all Investors that are holders of Registrable Securities of the demand, and
each such holder of Registrable Securities who wishes to include all or a
portion of such holder's Registrable Securities in the Demand Registration
(each such holder including shares of Registrable Securities in such
registration, a " _Demanding Holder_ ") shall so notify ParentCo
within fifteen (15) days after the receipt by the holder of the notice from
ParentCo. Upon any such request, the Demanding Holders shall be entitled to
have their Registrable Securities included in the Demand Registration, subject
to _Section 2.2.4_ and the provisos set forth in _Section 3.1.1_. ParentCo
shall not be obligated to effect: (a) more than one (1) Demand Registration
during any six-month period; (b) any Demand Registration at any time there is
an effective Resale Shelf Registration Statement on file with the Commission
pursuant to Section 2.1; (c) more than [●]Underwritten Demand Registrations in
respect of all Registrable Securities held by the NAC Investors, each of
which will also count as an Underwritten Takedown of the NAC Investors under
_Section 2.1.5(c)(ii)_; or (d) more than [●]Underwritten Demand
Registrations in respect of all Registrable Securities held by the Company
Investors, each of which will also count as an Underwritten Takedown of the
Company Investors under _Section 2.1.5(c)(iii)_.

  



    

G-7

 



    



  

2.2.2 _Effective Registration_. A Registration will not count as a Demand
Registration until the Registration Statement filed with the Commission with
respect to such Demand Registration has been declared effective and ParentCo
has complied with all of its obligations under this Agreement with respect
thereto; provided, however, that if, after such Registration Statement has
been declared effective, the offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to a
Demand Registration is interfered with by any stop order or injunction of the
Commission or any other governmental agency or court, the Registration
Statement with respect to such Demand Registration will be deemed not to have
been declared effective, unless and until, (i) such stop order or injunction
is removed, rescinded or otherwise terminated, and (ii) a majority-in-
interest of the Demanding Holders thereafter elect to continue the offering;
provided, further, that ParentCo shall not be obligated to file a second
Registration Statement until a Registration Statement that has been filed is
counted as a Demand Registration or is terminated.

  



  

2.2.3 _Underwritten Offering_. If the Demanding Holders so elect and such
holders so advise ParentCo as part of their written demand for a
Demand Registration, the offering of such Registrable Securities pursuant to
such Demand Registration shall be in the form of an underwritten offering
with an estimated market value of at least $[●]. In such event, the right of
any holder to include its Registrable Securities in such registration shall
be conditioned upon such holder's participation in such underwriting and the
inclusion of such holder's Registrable Securities in the underwriting to the
extent provided herein. All Demanding Holders proposing to distribute their
Registrable Securities through such underwriting shall enter into an
underwriting agreement in customary form with the Underwriter or Underwriters
selected for such underwriting by the holders initiating the Demand
Registration, and subject to the approval of ParentCo.

  



  

2.2.4 _Reduction of Offering_. If the managing Underwriter or Underwriters
for a Demand Registration that is to be an underwritten offering
advises ParentCo and the Demanding Holders in writing that the dollar amount
or number of shares of Registrable Securities which the Demanding Holders
desire to sell, taken together with all other Common Stock or other securities
which ParentCo desires to sell and the Common Stock, if any, as to which
registration has been requested pursuant to written contractual piggy-back
registration rights held by other shareholders of ParentCo who desire to
sell, exceeds the maximum dollar amount or maximum number of shares that can
be sold in such offering without adversely affecting the proposed offering
price, the timing, the distribution method, or the probability of success of
such offering (such maximum dollar amount or maximum number of shares, as
applicable, the " _Maximum Number of Shares_ "), then ParentCo shall include
in such registration: (i) first, the Registrable Securities as to
which Demand Registration has been requested by the Demanding Holders (pro
rata in accordance with the number of shares that each such Person has
requested be included in such registration, regardless of the number of shares
held by each such Person (such proportion is referred to herein as " _Pro
Rata_ ")) that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Shares; (ii) second, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Shares has not
been reached under the foregoing clause (i), the Common Stock or other
securities that ParentCo desires to sell that can be sold without exceeding
the Maximum Number of Shares; (iii) third, to the extent that the Maximum
Number of Shares has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (i) and
(ii), the Common Stock or other securities for the account of other persons
that ParentCo is obligated to register pursuant to written contractual
arrangements with such persons, as to which "piggy-back" registration has
been requested by the holders thereof, Pro Rata, that can be sold without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares.

  



    

G-8

 



    



  

2.2.5 _Withdrawal_. If a majority-in-interest of the Demanding Holders
disapprove of the terms of any underwriting or are not entitled to include
all of their Registrable Securities in any offering, such majority-in-
interest of the Demanding Holders may elect to withdraw from such offering by
giving written notice to ParentCo and the Underwriter or Underwriters of their
request to withdraw prior to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement
filed with the Commission with respect to such Demand Registration. If the
majority-in-interest of the Demanding Holders withdraws from a proposed
offering relating to a Demand Registration, then either the Demanding
Holders shall reimburse ParentCo for the costs associated with the withdrawn
registration (in which case such registration shall not count as a Demand
Registration provided for in _Section 2.1_ ) or the withdrawn registration
shall count as a Demand Registration provided for in _Section 2.1_.

  



  

2.3 _Piggy-Back Registration_.

  



  

2.3.1 _Piggy-Back Rights_. If at any time after [________, 2020], ParentCo
proposes to file a Registration Statement under the Securities Act with
respect to an offering of equity securities, or securities or other
obligations exercisable or exchangeable for, or convertible into,
equity securities, by ParentCo for its own account or for shareholders of
ParentCo for their account (or by ParentCo and by shareholders of ParentCo
including, without limitation, pursuant to _Section 2.1_ ), other than a
Registration Statement (i) filed in connection with any employee stock option
or other benefit plan, (ii) for an exchange offer or offering of securities
solely to ParentCo's existing shareholders, (iii) for an offering of debt
that is convertible into equity securities of ParentCo or (iv) for a
dividend reinvestment plan, then ParentCo shall (x) give written notice of
such proposed filing to the holders of Registrable Securities as soon as
practicable but in no event less than ten (10) days before the anticipated
filing date, which notice shall describe the amount and type of securities to
be included in such offering, the intended method(s) of distribution, and the
name of the proposed managing Underwriter or Underwriters, if any, of the
offering, and (y) offer to the holders of Registrable Securities in such
notice the opportunity to register the sale of such number of shares of
Registrable Securities as such holders may request in writing within five (5)
days following receipt of such notice (a " _Piggy-Back Registration_ ").
ParentCo shall cause such Registrable Securities to be included in such
registration and shall use its best efforts to cause the managing Underwriter
or Underwriters of a proposed underwritten offering to permit the Registrable
Securities requested to be included in a Piggy-Back Registration on the same
terms and conditions as any similar securities of ParentCo and to permit the
sale or other disposition of such Registrable Securities in accordance with
the intended method(s) of distribution thereof. All holders of
Registrable Securities proposing to distribute their securities through a
Piggy-Back Registration that involves an Underwriter or Underwriters shall
enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the Underwriter or
Underwriters selected for such Piggy-Back Registration.

  



    

G-9

 



    



  

2.3.2 _Reduction of Offering_. If the managing Underwriter or Underwriters
for a Piggy-Back Registration that is to be an underwritten offering advises
ParentCo and the holders of Registrable Securities in writing that the dollar
amount or number of Common Stock which ParentCo desires to sell, taken
together with Common Stock, if any, as to which registration has been demanded
pursuant to written contractual arrangements with persons other than the
holders of Registrable Securities hereunder and the Registrable Securities as
to which registration has been requested under this _Section 2.3_ , exceeds
the Maximum Number of Shares, then ParentCo shall include in any such
registration:

  



  

(a) If the registration is undertaken for ParentCo's account: (A) first, the
Common Stock or other securities that ParentCo desires to sell that can be
sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares; and (B) second, to the
extent that the Maximum Number of Shares has not been reached under the
foregoing clause (A), the Common Stock or other securities, if any, comprised
of Registrable Securities, as to which registration has been requested
pursuant to the terms hereof, that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum
Number of Shares, Pro Rata; and (C) third, to the extent that the Maximum
Number of shares has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (A) and
(B), the Common Stock or other securities for the account of other persons
that ParentCo is obligated to register pursuant to written contractual piggy-
back registration rights with such persons and that can be sold without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares; and

  



  

(b) If the registration is a "demand" registration undertaken at the demand
of persons other than either the holders of Registrable Securities, (A)
first, the Common Stock or other securities for the account of the demanding
persons that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares; (B)
second, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Shares has not been
reached under the foregoing clause (A), the Common Stock or other securities
that ParentCo desires to sell that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum
Number of Shares; (C) third, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Shares
has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (A) and (B), the Common
Stock or other securities, if any, comprised of Registrable Securities, Pro
Rata, as to which registration has been requested pursuant to the terms
hereof, that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares; and
(D) fourth, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Shares has not been
reached under the foregoing clauses (A), (B) and (C), the Common Stock or
other securities for the account of other persons that ParentCo is obligated
to register pursuant to written contractual arrangements with such persons,
that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares.

  



  

2.3.3 _Withdrawal_. Any holder of Registrable Securities may elect to
withdraw such holder's request for inclusion of Registrable Securities in any
Piggy-Back Registration by giving written notice to ParentCo of such request
to withdraw prior to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement.
ParentCo (whether on its own determination or as the result of a withdrawal by
persons making a demand pursuant to written contractual obligations) may
withdraw a Registration Statement at any time prior to the effectiveness of
such Registration Statement. Notwithstanding any such withdrawal, ParentCo
shall pay all expenses incurred by the holders of Registrable Securities in
connection with such Piggy-Back Registration as provided in _Section 3.3_.

  



    

G-10

 



    



  

3. REGISTRATION PROCEDURES.

  



  

3.1 _Filings; Information_. Whenever ParentCo is required to effect the
registration of any Registrable Securities pursuant to _Section 2_ , ParentCo
shall use its reasonable best efforts to effect the registration and sale of
such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method(s) of
distribution thereof as expeditiously as practicable, and in connection with
any such request:

  



  

3.1.1 _Filing Registration Statement_. ParentCo shall use its reasonable best
efforts to, as expeditiously as possible after receipt of a request for
a Demand Registration pursuant to _Section 2.1_ , prepare and file with the
Commission a Registration Statement on any form for which ParentCo then
qualifies or which counsel for ParentCo shall deem appropriate and which form
shall be available for the sale of all Registrable Securities to be
registered thereunder in accordance with the intended method(s) of
distribution thereof, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such
Registration Statement to become effective and use its reasonable best
efforts to keep it effective for the Effectiveness Period; provided, however,
that ParentCo shall have the right to defer any Demand Registration for up to
sixty (60) days, and any Piggy-Back Registration for such period as may be
applicable to deferment of any Demand Registration to which such Piggy-Back
Registration relates, in each case if ParentCo shall furnish to the holders a
certificate signed by the Chief Executive Officer or Chairman of ParentCo
stating that, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of
ParentCo (the " _ParentCo Board_ "), it would be materially detrimental to
ParentCo and its shareholders for such Registration Statement to be effected
at such time; provided further, however, that ParentCo shall not have the
right to exercise the right set forth in the immediately preceding proviso
for more than a total of sixty (60) consecutive calendar days, or more than
ninety (90) total calendar days, in each case during any 365-day period in
respect of a Demand Registration hereunder.

  



  

3.1.2 _Copies_. ParentCo shall, prior to filing a Registration Statement or
prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, furnish without charge to
the holders of Registrable Securities included in such registration, and such
holders' legal counsel, copies of such Registration Statement as proposed to
be filed, each amendment and supplement to such Registration Statement (in
each case including all exhibits thereto and documents incorporated by
reference therein), the prospectus included in such Registration
Statement (including each preliminary prospectus), and such other documents
as the holders of Registrable Securities included in such registration or
legal counsel for any such holders may request in order to facilitate the
disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by such holders.

  



  

3.1.3 _Amendments and Supplements_. ParentCo shall prepare and file with the
Commission such amendments, including post-effective amendments,
and supplements to such Registration Statement and the prospectus used in
connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such Registration Statement
effective and in compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act until
all Registrable Securities and other securities covered by such Registration
Statement have been disposed of in accordance with the intended method(s) of
distribution set forth in such Registration Statement or such securities have
been withdrawn (the " _Effectiveness Period_ ").

  



    

G-11

 



    



  

3.1.4 _Notification_. After the filing of a Registration Statement, ParentCo
shall promptly, and in no event more than two (2) Business Days after
such filing, notify the holders of Registrable Securities included in such
Registration Statement of such filing, and shall further notify such holders
promptly and confirm such advice in writing in all events within two (2)
Business Days of the occurrence of any of the following: (i) when such
Registration Statement becomes effective; (ii) when any post-effective
amendment to such Registration Statement becomes effective; (iii) the
issuance or threatened issuance by the Commission of any stop order (and
ParentCo shall take all actions required to prevent the entry of such stop
order or to remove it if entered); and (iv) any request by the Commission for
any amendment or supplement to such Registration Statement or any prospectus
relating thereto or for additional information or of the occurrence of an
event requiring the preparation of a supplement or amendment to such
prospectus so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of the
securities covered by such Registration Statement, such prospectus will not
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, and promptly make available to the holders
of Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement any such
supplement or amendment; except that before filing with the Commission a
Registration Statement or prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto,
including documents incorporated by reference, ParentCo shall furnish to the
holders of Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement and
to the legal counsel for any such holders, copies of all such documents
proposed to be filed sufficiently in advance of filing to provide such
holders and legal counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review
such documents and comment thereon.

  



  

3.1.5 _Securities Laws Compliance_. ParentCo shall use its reasonable best
efforts to (i) register or qualify the Registrable Securities covered by the
Registration Statement under such securities or "blue sky" laws of such
jurisdictions in the United States as the holders of Registrable Securities
included in such Registration Statement (in light of their intended plan of
distribution) may reasonably request and (ii) take such action necessary to
cause such Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement to be
registered with or approved by such other governmental authorities as may be
necessary by virtue of the business and operations of ParentCo and do any and
all other acts and things that may be necessary or advisable to enable the
holders of Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement to
consummate the disposition of such Registrable Securities in such
jurisdictions; provided, however, that ParentCo shall not be required to
qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not
otherwise be required to qualify but for this paragraph or subject itself to
taxation in any such jurisdiction.

  



  

3.1.6 _Agreements for Disposition_. ParentCo shall enter into customary
agreements (including, if applicable, an underwriting agreement in
customary form) and take such other actions as are reasonably required in
order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such
Registrable Securities. The representations, warranties and covenants of
ParentCo in any underwriting agreement which are made to or for the benefit
of any Underwriters, to the extent applicable, shall also be made to and for
the benefit of the holders of Registrable Securities included in such
registration statement, and the representations, warranties and covenants of
the holders of Registrable Securities included in such registration statement
in any underwriting agreement which are made to or for the benefit of any
Underwriters, to the extent applicable, shall also be made to and for the
benefit of ParentCo.

  



    

G-12

 



    



  

3.1.7 _Comfort Letter_. ParentCo shall obtain a "cold comfort" letter from
ParentCo's independent registered public accountants in the event of an
underwritten offering, in customary form and covering such matters of the type
customarily covered by "cold comfort" letters as the managing Underwriter may
reasonably request, and reasonably satisfactory to a majority-in-interest of
the participating holders.

  



  

3.1.8 _Opinions_. On the date the Registrable Securities are delivered for
sale pursuant to any Registration, ParentCo shall obtain an opinion,
dated such date, of one (1) counsel representing ParentCo for the purposes of
such Registration, addressed to the holders, the placement agent or sales
agent, if any, and the Underwriters, if any, covering such legal matters with
respect to the Registration in respect of which such opinion is being given
as the holders, placement agent, sales agent, or Underwriter may reasonably
request and as are customarily included in such opinions, and reasonably
satisfactory to a majority in interest of the participating holders.

  



  

3.1.9 _Cooperation_. The principal executive officer of ParentCo, the
principal financial officer of ParentCo, the principal accounting officer of
ParentCo and all other officers and members of the management of ParentCo
shall cooperate fully in any offering of Registrable Securities hereunder,

materials and related documents, and participation in meetings with
Underwriters, attorneys, accountants and potential investors.

  



  

3.1.10 _Records_. Upon execution of confidentiality agreements, ParentCo
shall make available for inspection by the holders of Registrable
Securities included in such Registration Statement, any Underwriter
participating in any disposition pursuant to such registration statement and
any attorney, accountant or other professional retained by any holder of
Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement or any
Underwriter, all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents
and properties of ParentCo, as shall be necessary to enable them to exercise
their due diligence responsibility, and cause ParentCo's officers, directors

and regulations of the Commission and the Securities Act, and make available
to its shareholders, as soon as practicable, an earnings statement covering a
period of twelve (12) months, which earnings statement shall satisfy the
provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 thereunder.

G-13

 



    



  

3.2 _Obligation to Suspend Distribution_. Upon receipt of any notice from
ParentCo of the happening of any event of the kind described in
_Section 3.1.4(iv)_ , or, upon any suspension by ParentCo, pursuant to a
written insider trading compliance program adopted by the ParentCo Board, of
the ability of all "insiders" covered by such program to transact in
ParentCo's securities because of the existence of material non-public
information, each holder of Registrable Securities included in any
registration shall immediately discontinue disposition of such Registrable
Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement covering such Registrable
Securities until such holder receives the supplemented or amended prospectus
contemplated by _Section 3.1.4(iv)_ or the restriction on the ability of
"insiders" to transact in ParentCo's securities is removed, as applicable,
and, if so directed by ParentCo, each such holder will deliver to ParentCo
all copies, other than permanent file copies then in such
holder's possession, of the most recent prospectus covering such Registrable
Securities at the time of receipt of such notice.

  



  

3.3 _Registration Expenses_. ParentCo shall bear all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the Resale Shelf Registration Statement
pursuant to _Section 2.1_ , any Demand Registration pursuant to _Section 2.1_
, any Demand Takedown pursuant to _Section 2.1.5(a)(i)_ , any Piggy-Back
Registration pursuant to _Section 2.3_ , and any registration on Form S-3
effected pursuant to _Section 2.3_ , and all expenses incurred in performing
or complying with its other obligations under this Agreement, whether or not
the Registration Statement becomes effective, including, without limitation:
(i) all registration and filing fees; (ii) fees and expenses of
compliance with securities or "blue sky" laws (including fees and
disbursements of counsel in connection with blue sky qualifications of the
Registrable Securities); (iii) printing expenses; (iv) ParentCo's internal
expenses (including, without limitation, all salaries and expenses of its
officers and employees); (v) the fees and expenses incurred in connection with
the listing of the Registrable Securities as required by _Section 3.1.10_ ;
(vi) Financial Industry Regulatory Authority fees; (vii) fees and
disbursements of counsel for ParentCo and fees and expenses for independent

discounts or selling commissions shall be borne by such
holders. Additionally, in an underwritten offering, all selling shareholders
and ParentCo shall bear the expenses of the Underwriter pro rata in
proportion to the respective amount of shares each is selling in such

3.4 _Information_. The holders of Registrable Securities shall promptly
provide such information as may reasonably be requested by ParentCo, or
the managing Underwriter, if any, in connection with the preparation of any

Securities Act and in connection with ParentCo's obligation to comply with

4. INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION.

  



  

4.1 _Indemnification by ParentCo_. ParentCo agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless each Investor and each other holder of Registrable Securities, and
each of their respective officers, employees, affiliates, directors, partners,
members, attorneys and agents, and each person, if any, who controls an
Investor and each other holder of Registrable Securities (within the meaning
of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) (each,
an " _Investor Indemnified Party_ "), from and against any expenses, losses,
judgments, claims, damages or liabilities, whether joint or several, arising
out of or based upon any untrue statement (or allegedly untrue statement) of
a material fact contained in any Registration Statement under which the sale
of such Registrable Securities was registered under the Securities Act, any
preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained in
the Registration Statement, or any amendment or supplement to such
Registration Statement, or arising out of or based upon any omission (or
alleged omission) to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or any violation by
ParentCo of the Securities Act or any rule or regulation promulgated
thereunder applicable to ParentCo and relating to action or inaction required
of ParentCo in connection with any such registration; and ParentCo
shall promptly reimburse the Investor Indemnified Party for any legal and any
other expenses reasonably incurred by such Investor Indemnified Party in
connection with investigating and defending any such expense, loss, judgment,
claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that ParentCo will not
be liable in any such case to the extent that any such expense, loss, claim,
damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or
allegedly untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in
such Registration Statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, or
summary prospectus, or any such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and
in conformity with information furnished to ParentCo, in writing, by such
selling holder expressly for use therein, or is based on any selling holder's
violation of the federal securities laws (including Regulation M) or failure
to sell the Registrable Securities in accordance with the plan of
distribution contained in the prospectus.

  



  

4.2 _Indemnification by Holders of Registrable Securities_. Each selling
holder of Registrable Securities will, in the event that any registration is
being effected under the Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement of any
Registrable Securities held by such selling holder, indemnify and hold
harmless ParentCo, each of its directors and officers, and each other selling
holder and each other person, if any, who controls another selling holder
within the meaning of the Securities Act, against any losses, claims,
judgments, damages or liabilities, whether joint or several, insofar as such
losses, claims, judgments, damages or liabilities (or actions in
respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or
allegedly untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration
Statement under which the sale of such Registrable Securities was registered
under the Securities Act, any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or
summary prospectus contained in the Registration Statement, or any amendment
or supplement to the Registration Statement, or arise out of or are based
upon any omission or the alleged omission to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statement therein not
misleading, if the statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in
conformity with information furnished in writing to ParentCo by such selling
holder expressly for use therein, or is based on any selling holder's
violation of the federal securities laws (including Regulation M) or failure
to sell the Registrable Securities in accordance with the plan of
distribution contained in the prospectus, and shall reimburse ParentCo, its
directors and officers, and each other selling holder or controlling person
for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by any of them in
connection with investigation or defending any such loss, claim, damage,
liability or action. Each selling holder's indemnification obligations
hereunder shall be several and not joint and shall be limited to the amount of
any net proceeds actually received by such selling holder.

  



    

G-15

 



    



  

4.3 _Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings_. Promptly after receipt by any
person of any notice of any loss, claim, damage or liability or any action in
respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to _Sections 4.1_ or _4.2_
, such person (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall, if a claim in respect
thereof is to be made against any other person for indemnification hereunder,
notify such other person (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing of the
loss, claim, judgment, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that
the failure by the Indemnified Party to notify the Indemnifying Party shall
not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability which the Indemnifying
Party may have to such Indemnified Party hereunder, except and solely to the
extent the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such failure. If the
Indemnified Party is seeking indemnification with respect to any claim
or action brought against the Indemnified Party, then the Indemnifying Party
shall be entitled to participate in such claim or action, and, to the extent
that it wishes, jointly with all other Indemnifying Parties, to assume control
of the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to the Indemnified Party.
After notice from the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its
election to assume control of the defense of such claim or action, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any
legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in
connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of
investigation; provided, however, that in any action in which both the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party are named as defendants, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (but no more
than one such separate counsel, which counsel is reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnifying Party) to represent the Indemnified Party and its controlling
persons who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect
of which indemnity may be sought by the Indemnified Party against the
Indemnifying Party, with the fees and expenses of such counsel to be paid by
such Indemnifying Party if, based upon the written opinion of counsel of such
Indemnified Party, representation of both parties by the same counsel would be
inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. No
Indemnifying Party shall, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, consent to entry of judgment or effect any settlement of
any claim or pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which the
Indemnified Party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been
sought hereunder by such Indemnified Party, unless such judgment or
settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from
all liability arising out of such claim or proceeding.

  



  

4.4 _Contribution_.

  



  

4.4.1 If the indemnification provided for in the foregoing _Sections 4.1_ ,
_4.2_ and _4.3_ is unavailable to any Indemnified Party in respect of any
loss, claim, damage, liability or action referred to herein, then each such
Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result
of such loss, claim, damage, liability or action in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnified Parties and
the Indemnifying Parties in connection with the actions or omissions which
resulted in such loss, claim, damage, liability or action, as well as any
other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of any Indemnified
Party and any Indemnifying Party shall be determined by reference to, among
other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to
information supplied by such Indemnified Party or such Indemnifying Party and
the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity
to correct or prevent such statement or omission.

  



    

G-16

 



    



  

4.4.2 The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this _Section 4.4.2_ were determined by pro
rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take
account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately
preceding _Section 4.4.1_.

  



  

4.4.3 The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Party as a result of any
loss, claim, damage, liability or action referred to in the immediately
preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations
set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified
Party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this  _Section 4.4_ , no holder of
Registrable Securities shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of
the dollar amount of the net proceeds (after payment of any underwriting
fees, discounts, commissions or taxes) actually received by such holder from
the sale of Registrable Securities which gave rise to such contribution
obligation. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

  



  

5. UNDERWRITING AND DISTRIBUTION.

  



  

5.1 _Rule 144_. ParentCo covenants that it shall file any reports required to
be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and shall take
such further action as the holders of Registrable Securities may reasonably
request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such holders
to sell Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act
within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144 under the
Securities Act, as such Rules may be amended from time to time, or any
similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the Commission.

  



  

6. LOCK-UP AGREEMENTS

  



  

6.1 _Investor Lock-Up_. Each Investor agrees that such Investor shall not
Transfer any shares of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or
exercisable or exchangeable (directly or indirectly) for Common Stock
(whether such shares of Common Stock or any such securities are issued to
such Investor pursuant to the First Merger, the Contribution or the Second
Merger or are thereafter acquired) for 180-days following the Closing Date
(as such term is defined in the Business Combination Agreement). The foregoing
restriction is expressly agreed to preclude each Investor during such 180-day
period from engaging in any hedging or other transaction which is designed to
or which reasonably could be expected to lead to or result in a sale or
disposition of such Investor's Common Stock even if such shares of Common
Stock would be disposed of by someone other than the undersigned. Such
prohibited hedging or other transactions during such 180-day period would
include without limitation any short sale or any purchase, sale or grant of
any right (including without limitation any put or call option) with respect
to any of the Investor's Common Stock or with respect to any security that
includes, relates to, or derives any significant part of its value from such
shares of Common Stock. The foregoing notwithstanding, each executive officer
and director of the Company shall be permitted to establish a plan to acquire
and sell shares of Common Stock pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange
Act; _provided_ , _however_ , no sale of shares under any such plan shall be
made prior to the expiration of the 180-day lock-up period referred to in the
first sentence of this Section 6.1.

7.2 _NAC Directors_. Until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the date of this
Agreement, at each annual or special meeting of stockholders of ParentCo, NAC
Investors who represent a majority in interest of the Registrable Securities

dividend or other share recapitalization, share exchange or other event), the
rights of the Company Founders and obligations of the ParentCo Board under

7.5 _NAC Director Vacancies_. Each Investor agrees to vote, or cause to be
voted, all shares of Common Stock owned by such Investor, or over which such
Investor has voting control, from time to time and at all times, in whatever
manner as shall be necessary to ensure that: (a) no director elected pursuant
to Section 7.2 may be removed from office unless: (i) such removal is directed
or approved by the affirmative vote of the NAC Investors entitled under

NAC Investors entitled under Section 7.2 to designate such director.

appoint ParentCo with full power of substitution and resubstitution, as the
Investor's true and lawful attorney and irrevocable proxy, to the fullest
extent of the Investor's rights with respect to the shares of Common Stock
owned by such Investor as of the date of this Agreement or hereafter acquired,
to vote, each of such shares of Common Stock solely with respect to the
matters set forth in Section 7 hereof. Each Investor intends this proxy to be
irrevocable and coupled with an interest hereunder and hereby revokes any
proxy previously granted by such Investor with respect to the shares of
Common Stock owned by such Investor as of the date of this Agreement or
hereafter acquired.

  



  

8. MISCELLANEOUS.

  



  

8.1 _Other Registration Rights and Arrangements_. ParentCo represents and
warrants that no person, other than a holder of the Registrable
Securities has any right to require ParentCo to register any of ParentCo's
share capital for sale or to include ParentCo's share capital in any
registration filed by ParentCo for the sale of shares for its own account or
for the account of any other person. NAC and the NAC Investors hereby
terminate the Prior NAC Agreement, which shall be of no further force and
effect and is hereby superseded and replaced in its entirety by this
Agreement. The Company, Blocker and the Open Lending Investors hereby
terminate the Prior Company Agreement, which shall be of no further force and
effect and is hereby superseded and replaced in its entirety by this
Agreement. ParentCo shall not hereafter enter into any agreement with respect
to its securities which is inconsistent with or violates the rights granted
to the holders of Registrable Securities in this Agreement and in the event of
any conflict between any such agreement or agreements and this Agreement, the
terms of this Agreement shall prevail.

  



  

8.2 _Assignment; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and the
rights, duties and obligations of ParentCo hereunder may not be assigned or
delegated by ParentCo in whole or in part. This Agreement and the rights,
duties and obligations of the holders of Registrable Securities hereunder may
be freely assigned or delegated by such holder of Registrable Securities in
conjunction with and to the extent of any permitted transfer of Registrable
Securities by any such holder. This Agreement and the provisions hereof shall
be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of each of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns and the holders of Registrable
Securities and their respective successors and permitted assigns. This
Agreement is not intended to confer any rights or benefits on any persons
that are not party hereto other than as expressly set forth in _Section 4_ and
this _Section 8.2_. The rights of a holder of Registrable Securities under
this Agreement may be transferred by such a holder to a transferee who
acquires or holds Registrable Securities; provided, however, that such
transferee has executed and delivered to ParentCo a properly completed
agreement to be bound by the terms of this Agreement substantially in form
attached hereto as Exhibit A (an " _Addendum Agreement_ "), and the
transferor shall have delivered to ParentCo no later than thirty (30) days
following the date of the transfer, written notification of such transfer
setting forth the name of the transferor, the name and address of the
transferee, and the number of Registrable Securities so transferred. The
execution of an Addendum Agreement shall constitute a permitted amendment of
this Agreement.

  



    

G-20

 



    



  

8.3 _Amendments and Modifications_. Upon the written consent of ParentCo, the
Holders of at least a majority in interest of the Registrable Securities at
the time in question, compliance with any of the provisions, covenants and
conditions set forth in this Agreement may be waived, or any of such
provisions, covenants or conditions may be amended or modified; provided,
however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment hereto or waiver
hereof that adversely affects one Holder, solely in his, her or its capacity
as a holder of the shares of capital stock of ParentCo, in a manner that is
materially different from the other Holders (in such capacity) shall
require the consent of the Holder so affected. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in the foregoing, (i) the rights of the NAC Investors pursuant
to Section 1 (with respect to the definition of "Registrable Securities"),
Section 2.1.5, Section 2.2.1, Section 2.2.2, Section 6.1, Section 7.2,
Section 7.5 and Section 8.4 shall only be waived, amended and modified by the
NAC Investors who hold a majority in interest of the Registrable Securities
held by all NAC Investors at the time in question; (ii) the rights of Blocker
Holder pursuant to Section 7.3 and 7.6 shall only be waived, amended and
modified by Blocker Holder; and (iii) the rights of the Company Founders
pursuant to Section 7.4 and 7.7 shall only be waived, amended and modified by
the Company Founders who hold a majority in interest of the Registrable
Securities held by all Company Founders at the time in question. No course of
dealing between any Holder or ParentCo and any other party hereto or any
failure or delay on the part of a Holder or ParentCo in exercising any rights
or remedies under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of any rights or
remedies of any Holder or ParentCo. No single or partial exercise of any
rights or remedies under this Agreement by a party shall operate as a waiver
or preclude the exercise of any other rights or remedies hereunder or
thereunder by such party.

  



  

8.4 _Term_. This Agreement shall terminate upon the earlier of (i) the tenth
anniversary of the date of this Agreement or (ii) the date as of which (A)
all of the Registrable Securities have been sold pursuant to a Registration
Statement (but in no event prior to the applicable period referred to in
Section 4(a)(3) of the Securities Act and Rule 174 thereunder (or any
successor rule promulgated thereafter by the Commission)) or (B) the Holders
of all Registrable Securities are permitted to sell the Registrable
Securities under Rule 144 (or any similar provision) under the Securities Act
without limitation on the amount of securities sold or the manner of sale;
provided further that with respect to any Investor, such Investor will have no
rights under this Agreement and all obligations of ParentCo to such Investor
under this Agreement shall terminate upon the earlier of (x) the date such
Investor ceases to hold at least [●] Registrable Securities or (y) if such
Investor is an executive officer of the Company as of immediately prior to
the consummation of the Second Merger, the date such Investor no longer
serves as an executive officer of ParentCo.
