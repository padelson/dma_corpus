Parent, the &#147;<B><I>Parent Parties</I></B>&#148;) and Stone Energy Corporation, a Delaware corporation (&#147;<B><I>Target</I></B>&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, Target, Plains Exploration &#038; Production Company (&#147;<B><I>Plains</I></B>&#148;) and Plains Acquisition
Corporation entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April&nbsp;23, 2006 (the &#147;<B><I>Prior
Agreement</I></B>&#148;);
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, Target&#146;s Board of Directors has deemed the offer by Parent to acquire Target, on the
terms set forth in this Agreement, to be a &#147;Target Superior Proposal&#148; (as defined in the Prior
Agreement) and therefore, immediately prior to execution of this Agreement by Target, Target
terminated the Prior Agreement in accordance with its terms;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Parent and Target and the Managing Member
of Merger Sub deem it advisable and in the best interests of their respective corporations and
stockholders that Target merge with and into Merger Sub (the &#147;<B><I>Merger</I></B>&#148;) upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth herein, and such Boards of Directors and the Managing Member have
approved the Agreement and the Merger; and
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, (i)&nbsp;with the approval
of Target&#146;s Board of Directors, Parent has entered into voting agreements with each of James H.
Stone, David H. Welch and John P. Laborde under which such parties have among other things agreed
to support the Merger upon the terms and conditions set forth therein, and (ii)&nbsp;with the approval
of Parent&#146;s Board of Directors, Target has entered into voting agreements with Richard A. Bachmann,
Jerry D. Carlisle, Harold D. Carter, Dr.&nbsp;Norman C. Francis, Robert D. Gershen, Phillip A. Gobe and
William R. Herrin, Jr. under which such parties have among other things agreed to support the
Merger upon the terms and conditions set forth therein (collectively, the &#147;<B><I>Voting Agreements</I></B>&#148;); and
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger will qualify as
a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the United States Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the &#147;<B><I>Code</I></B>&#148;);
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the representations, warranties and

set forth in Section&nbsp;259 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the &#147;<B><I>DGCL</I></B>&#148;), and Section&nbsp;18-209
of the Delaware Limited Liability Act (the &#147;<B><I>LLCA</I></B>&#148;), including the Surviving Entity&#146;s succession to
