its representatives in connection with such review, including providing on a timely basis all other information necessary or useful in connection with the review of the Closing Statement as is reasonably requested by the Representative or its
representatives. If the Representative has any objections to the Closing Statement, the Representative will deliver to Parent a statement setting forth its objections thereto (an &#147;<U>Objections Statement</U>&#148;), which statement will
identify in reasonable detail those items to which the Representative objects (the &#147;<U>Disputed Items</U>&#148;). If an Objections Statement is not delivered to Parent within 30 days after delivery of the Closing Statement to the
Representative, the Closing Statement as prepared by Parent (and the Final Residual Cash Consideration resulting therefrom) will be final, binding and non-appealable by the parties hereto. If an Objections Statement is delivered to Parent, the
Representative and Parent will negotiate in good faith to resolve in writing the Disputed Items and all such discussions related thereto will (unless otherwise agreed by Parent and the Representative in writing) be governed by Rule 408 of the
Federal Rules of Evidence and any applicable similar state rule, but if they do not reach a final resolution within 30 days (or such longer period as Parent and Representative may agree in writing) after the delivery of the Objections Statement to
Parent, the Representative and Parent will submit any unresolved Disputed Items (and only such matters) to a mutually agreeable nationally recognized accounting firm independent to both the Representative and Parent (other than a <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">so-called</FONT> &#147;Big Four&#148; accounting firm) with expertise in resolving disputes of this nature (the &#147;<U>Accounting Firm</U>&#148;) for review and resolution. The Representative and Parent will instruct the
Accounting Firm to make a final determination of the Disputed Items in accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement. Parent and the Representative will cooperate with the Accounting Firm during the term of its engagement
and will instruct the Accounting Firm not to, and the Accounting Firm will not, assign a value to any item in dispute greater than the greatest value for such item assigned by Parent, on the one hand, or the Representative, on the other hand, or
less than the smallest value for such item assigned by Parent, on the one hand, or the Representative, on the other hand. Parent and the Representative will also instruct the Accounting Firm to, and the Accounting Firm will, make its determination
based solely on presentations by Parent and the Representative that are in accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement (<I>i.e.</I>, not on the basis of an independent review). The Closing Statement and the Final
Residual Cash Consideration resulting therefrom will become final and binding on the parties hereto on the date the Accounting Firm delivers its final resolution in writing to Parent and the Representative (which final resolution will be requested
by the parties to be delivered not more than 30 days following submission of the Disputed Items), and such resolution by the Accounting Firm will not be subject to court review or otherwise be appealable. The fees, costs and expenses of the
Accounting Firm will be allocated between Parent, on the one hand, and the Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders and Optionholders), on the other hand, based upon the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to
Parent, on the one hand, and the Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders and Optionholders), on the other hand, bears to the amount actually contested by such Person, as determined by the Accounting Firm. For example, if the Representative
claims that the Final Residual Cash Consideration is one thousand dollars ($1,000) greater than the amount determined by Parent, and Parent contests only five hundred dollars ($500) of the amount claimed by the Representative, and if the Accounting
