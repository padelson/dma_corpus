iv AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of December
9, 2014, is made by and among VIA Holdings I, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the " _Company_ "), Belden, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "),
Tahoe MergerSub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent (the " _Merger Sub_ "), and Thoma Bravo, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company, solely in its capacity as representative for the Companys
Stockholders and Optionholders (the " _Representative_ "). Capitalized terms
used and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in _Article
XI_ below.

WHEREAS, the board of directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
has approved and declared advisable the merger of Merger Sub with and into the
Company (the " _Merger_ "), pursuant to which the Company will continue as the
surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ");

 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of each of Parent and the Company has
determined that the Merger is in furtherance of and consistent with their
respective business strategies and is in the best interest of their respective
stockholders, and Parent has approved this Agreement and the Merger as the
sole stockholder of Merger Sub;

 

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Merger, among other things, all of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of the Company (assuming cancellation of all
outstanding Options in connection with the Merger in accordance with this
Agreement) immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided herein; and

 

WHEREAS, the parties to this Agreement desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and other agreements in connection with the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

1.01 _The Merger_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, at the Effective Time, Merger
Sub will merge with and into the Company in accordance with the DGCL,
whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub will cease, and the Company
will be the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

 

(b) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Sub will cause a certificate of
merger substantially in the form of _Exhibit A_ attached hereto to be
executed and filed with the  Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Certificate of Merger_
") and make all other filings or recordings required by the DGCL in connection
with the Merger. The Merger will become effective at such time as the
Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware or at such other time as Parent and the Company will agree and
specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective
being the " _Effective Time_ ").

(c) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will succeed
to all the assets, rights, privileges, powers and franchises and be subject to
all of the liabilities, restrictions and duties of the Company and Merger Sub,
all as provided under the DGCL.

 

1.02 _Conversion of Company Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof:

(a) Each Class A Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any Class A Common Shares to be canceled pursuant
to _Section 1.02(g)_ and Dissenting Shares) will be converted into the right
to receive an amount in cash equal to the Liquidation Value (as such term is
defined in the Companys certificate of incorporation, as amended and/or
restated prior to the Closing Date in accordance with _Section 6.01_) of such
Class A Common Share, together with the accrued and unpaid dividends thereon
through the Closing Date (determined in accordance with the Companys
certificate of incorporation, as amended and/or restated prior to the Closing
Date), payable to the holder thereof in accordance with _Section 1.03_ below
in full satisfaction of the Companys obligations in respect of each such
Class A Common Share. The aggregate consideration to which holders of Class A
Common Shares become entitled pursuant to this _Section 1.02(a)_ is referred
to herein as the " _Class A Merger Consideration_."

(b) Each Class B Common Share issued, outstanding and vested immediately prior
to the Effective Time, regardless of whether vesting occurs pursuant to the
terms of the associated equity purchase agreement or at the election of the
Companys board of directors or as otherwise permitted, (other than any Class
B Common Shares to be canceled pursuant to _Section 1.02(g)_ and Dissenting
Shares) will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to
the Per Share Portion of the Final Residual Cash Consideration; _provided_
that at the Closing the amount to be paid with respect to each Class B Common
Share will be based upon the Closing Residual Cash Consideration, payable to
the holder thereof in accordance with _Section 1.03_ below. The aggregate
consideration to which holders of Class B Common Shares become entitled
pursuant to this _Section 1.02(b)_ is referred to herein as the " _Class B
Merger Consideration_ " and, together with the Option Merger Consideration and
the Class A Merger Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_."

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Closing Residual
Cash Consideration_ " means (i) $710,000,000 (the " _Base Consideration_ "),
_minus_ (ii) the Class A Merger Consideration, _minus_ (iii) the amount of
Indebtedness outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
_plus_ (iv) the amount of Cash as of 11:59 PM on the Closing Date, _minus_ (v)
the amount of the unpaid Transaction Expenses as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, _plus_ (vi) the aggregate exercise price of the Options
(excluding Options cancelled for no consideration pursuant to _Section
1.04_), _minus_ (vii) the Escrow Amount, _minus_

 



2  (viii) the Representative Holdback Amount, _plus_ (ix) an amount equal to
the excess (if any) of (A) the sum of the Companys interest expense from the
date hereof through the Closing Date _plus_ the amount by which the employer-
paid payroll Taxes triggered by the exercise or settlement of any Options and
the payment of any transaction bonuses in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby is higher on the Closing Date than it would be on
December 31, 2014 _over_ (B) Pre-Closing Operating Cash Flow, in each case as
determined by the Company in good faith in the Closing Residual Cash
Consideration Calculation,.

 

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Final Residual Cash
Consideration_ " means the Closing Residual Cash Consideration as finally
determined pursuant to _Section 1.09_.

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Per Share Portion_ " means a
fraction, the numerator of which is one, and the denominator of which is the
sum of (i) the aggregate number of Class B Common Shares (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any Non-Accelerated Equity constituting unvested Class B
Common Shares, but not including Class B Common Shares to be canceled pursuant
to _Section 1.02(g)_), plus (ii) the maximum aggregate number of Class B
Common Shares issuable upon exercise of all Options (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, Non-Accelerated Equity constituting Options but excluding
Options cancelled for no consideration pursuant to _Section 1.04_), in each
case as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Options_ " means all employee
options to acquire Class B Common Shares which are vested (if applicable) and
exercisable (or will become exercisable as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby (whether pursuant to the terms of such options or at the
election of the Companys board of directors)), as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

(g) Each Company Share held immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Company as treasury shares or by Parent or Merger Sub will be canceled and no
payment will be made with respect thereto.

(h) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into and become one
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

1.03 _Exchange of Certificates; Lost Certificates_. The Paying Agent will act
as paying agent in effecting the exchange of cash for certificates which,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented Company Shares entitled
to payment pursuant to _Section 1.02_. On or promptly following the Closing
Date, the Paying Agent will pay (from the funds deposited with it pursuant to
_Section 2.01(b))_ each holder of Company Shares (each, a "Stockholder") who
has surrendered his, her or its certificates representing such Company Shares
(if such Company Shares are certificated) and a duly executed and completed
letter of transmittal substantially in the form of _Exhibit B_ attached
hereto (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), representing the number of Company
Shares held by such Stockholder, the amount of cash to which he, she or it is
entitled under _Section 1.02_. Surrendered certificates will forthwith be
canceled. Until so surrendered and exchanged, each such certificate will
represent from and after the Effective Time solely the

 



3  right to receive the Merger Consideration into which the shares it
theretofore represented will have been converted pursuant to _Section 1.02_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such certificate will have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then, upon the making of an affidavit of such fact by the
Person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying
Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate,
the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Company Shares
represented by such certificate, as contemplated by this _Section 1.03_.
After the Closing Date, there will be no transfers on the share
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of Company Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Closing Date. If, after the Closing Date,
certificates representing such Company Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, they will be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Section
1.03_. No interest will be paid or will accrue on the Merger Consideration
payable upon surrender of any certificate. All cash paid upon the surrender of
certificates in accordance with the terms of this _Section 1.03_ will be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
Company Shares previously represented by such certificates. None of Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company will be liable to any Person in respect of any cash
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

 

1.04 _Options_. The Company will cause all outstanding Options to be canceled
as of the Effective Time, at which time each holder of an Option (an "
_Optionholder_ ") will be entitled to receive from Parent an amount in cash
equal to the product of (i) the excess of the Per Share Portion of the Final
Residual Cash Consideration over the applicable exercise price per share of
such Option, multiplied by (ii) the maximum aggregate number of Class B Common
Shares such holder could have purchased if such holder had exercised such
Option in full immediately prior to such time, less applicable Taxes
withheld;  _provided_ that at the Closing the amount to be paid with respect
to each Option will be based upon the Closing Residual Cash Consideration,
payable to the holder thereof in accordance with this _Section 1.04_. For any
Options for which the exercise price of such Option is greater than or equal
to the Per Share Portion of the Final Residual Cash Consideration allocable to
such Option, such Option will be terminated for no consideration. The
aggregate consideration to which Optionholders become entitled pursuant to
this _Section 1.04_ is collectively referred to herein as the " _Option
Merger Consideration_." Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation or one of
its Subsidiaries to pay the Option Merger Consideration to the Optionholders
promptly, and in any event within five (5) Business Days, following the
Closing Date through the Surviving Corporations or the applicable
Subsidiarys payroll; _provided_ that no Optionholder will be paid his or her
portion of the Option Merger Consideration until he or she has executed and
delivered to the Company an option cancellation agreement substantially in the
form of _Exhibit C_ attached hereto (an " _Option Cancellation Agreement_
"). Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation or the applicable Subsidiary
to make timely payment to the appropriate taxing authority or authorities of
any amounts withheld from payment to the Optionholders under this _Section
1.04_.

1.05 _Certificate of Incorporation_. The certificate of incorporation of
Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be
amended at the Effective Time to change the corporate name set forth therein
to "VIA Holdings I, Inc." and, as so amended, will be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with
applicable Law.

 



4 1.06 _Bylaws_. The Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, will be amended at the Effective Time to change the corporate
name set forth therein to "VIA Holdings I, Inc." and, as so amended, will be
the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with
applicable Law.

 

1.07 _Directors and Officers_. From and after the Effective Time, until
successors are duly elected or appointed in accordance with the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and applicable Law,
(a) the directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time will be the directors of
the Surviving Corporation and (b) the officers of Merger Sub at the Effective
Time will be the officers of the Surviving Corporation.

1.08 _Calculation of Closing Residual Cash Consideration_. At least two (2)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company will deliver to Parent a
calculation of the Closing Residual Cash Consideration (the " _Closing
Residual Cash Consideration Calculation_ "). During the period from the
delivery of the Closing Residual Cash Consideration Calculation to the
Closing, Parent shall have an opportunity to review and comment on the Closing
Residual Cash Consideration Calculation, and the Company shall consider in
good faith any comments provided by Parent to the Closing Residual Cash
Consideration Calculation.

1.09 _Final Residual Cash Consideration_.

 

(a) As promptly as possible, but in any event within 60 days after the Closing
Date, Parent will deliver to the Representative (i) an unaudited,
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
Closing (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and (ii) its calculation of the
Final Residual Cash Consideration (together, the " _Closing Statement_ ").
The Closing Balance Sheet will be prepared on a consolidated basis for the
Company and its Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis
consistent with the methodologies, practices, estimation techniques,
assumptions and principles used in the preparation of the Latest Balance
Sheet. The Closing Statement will be derived from the Closing Balance Sheet,
and will, with respect to all of the amounts taken into account in calculating
the Final Residual Cash Consideration (as well as the Final Residual Cash
Consideration resulting therefrom), be prepared in accordance with the
applicable definitions in this Agreement. The Closing Statement will entirely
disregard (x) any and all effects on the assets or liabilities of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby or of
any financing or refinancing arrangements entered into at any time by Parent
or the Surviving Corporation or any other transaction entered into by Parent
or the Surviving Corporation in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and (y) any of the plans, transactions, or
changes which Parent intends to initiate or make or cause to be initiated or
made after the Closing with respect to the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries or their business or assets, or any facts or circumstances that
are unique or particular to Parent or any of its assets or liabilities.

 

(b) Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
to, at the Representatives sole expense, (i) assist the Representative and
its representatives in the review of the Closing Statement and provide the
Representative and its representatives with reasonable access during normal
business hours to the books, records, supporting data (including work papers,
schedules, memoranda and other documents, but excluding privileged documents),

 



5  facilities and employees of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
for purposes of their review of the Closing Statement, and (ii) reasonably
cooperate with the Representative and its representatives in connection with
such review, including providing on a timely basis all other information
necessary or useful in connection with the review of the Closing Statement as
is reasonably requested by the Representative or its representatives. If the
Representative has any objections to the Closing Statement, the Representative
will deliver to Parent a statement setting forth its objections thereto (an "
_Objections Statement_ "), which statement will identify in reasonable detail
those items to which the Representative objects (the " _Disputed Items_ "). If
an Objections Statement is not delivered to Parent within 30 days after
delivery of the Closing Statement to the Representative, the Closing
Statement as prepared by Parent (and the Final Residual Cash Consideration
resulting therefrom) will be final, binding and non-appealable by the parties
hereto. If an Objections Statement is delivered to Parent, the Representative
and Parent will negotiate in good faith to resolve in writing the Disputed
Items and all such discussions related thereto will (unless otherwise agreed
by Parent and the Representative in writing) be governed by Rule 408 of
the Federal Rules of Evidence and any applicable similar state rule, but if
they do not reach a final resolution within 30 days (or such longer period as
Parent and Representative may agree in writing) after the delivery of the
Objections Statement to Parent, the Representative and Parent will submit any
unresolved Disputed Items (and only such matters) to a mutually agreeable
nationally recognized accounting firm independent to both the Representative
and Parent (other than a so-called "Big Four" accounting firm) with expertise
in resolving disputes of this nature (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") for review
and resolution. The Representative and Parent will instruct the Accounting
Firm to make a final determination of the Disputed Items in accordance with
the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement. Parent and the
Representative will cooperate with the Accounting Firm during the term of its
engagement and will instruct the Accounting Firm not to, and the Accounting
Firm will not, assign a value to any item in dispute greater than the greatest
value for such item assigned by Parent, on the one hand, or the
Representative, on the other hand, or less than the smallest value for such
item assigned by Parent, on the one hand, or the Representative, on the other
hand. Parent and the Representative will also instruct the Accounting Firm to,
and the Accounting Firm will, make its determination based solely on
presentations by Parent and the Representative that are in accordance with the
guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement ( _i.e._ , not on the
basis of an independent review). The Closing Statement and the Final Residual
Cash Consideration resulting therefrom will become final and binding on the
parties hereto on the date the Accounting Firm delivers its final resolution
in writing to Parent and the Representative (which final resolution will be
requested by the parties to be delivered not more than 30 days following
submission of the Disputed Items), and such resolution by the Accounting Firm
will not be subject to court review or otherwise be appealable. The fees,
costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm will be allocated between Parent,
on the one hand, and the Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders and
Optionholders), on the other hand, based upon the percentage which the portion
of the contested amount not awarded to Parent, on the one hand, and the
Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders and Optionholders), on the other
hand, bears to the amount actually contested by such Person, as determined by
the Accounting Firm. For example, if the Representative claims that the Final
Residual Cash Consideration is one thousand dollars ($1,000) greater than the
amount determined by Parent, and Parent contests only five hundred dollars
($500) of the amount claimed by the Representative, and if the
Accounting Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding the
Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders

 



6  and Optionholders) three hundred dollars ($300) of the five hundred dollars
($500) contested, then the costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm will be
allocated sixty percent (60%) ( _i.e._ , 300 ÷ 500) to Parent and forty
percent (40%) ( _i.e._ , 200 ÷ 500) to the Representative (on behalf of the
Stockholders and Optionholders).

 

(c) If the Final Residual Cash Consideration as finally determined pursuant to
_Section 1.09(b)_ is greater than the Closing Residual Cash Consideration,
then, within five (5) Business Days after the determination of the Final
Residual Cash Consideration, (i) Parent will pay, as directed by the
Representative, (A) to the Paying Agent (for the benefit of
the Stockholders), by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount
equal to the portion of such excess allocable to the Stockholders, and the
Paying Agent will pay to the Stockholders such amount as directed by the
Representative (according to each such Stockholders Per Share Portion)
pursuant to the payment instructions set forth in each such Stockholders
Letter of Transmittal, and (B) to the Surviving Corporation or one of its
Subsidiaries (for the benefit of the Optionholders), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, an amount equal to the portion of such excess
allocable to the Optionholders, and the Surviving Corporation or such
Subsidiary will pay to the Optionholders such amount (according to each such
Optionholders Per Share Portion) through the Surviving Corporations or the
applicable Subsidiarys payroll, and (ii) Parent and the Representative will
instruct the Escrow Agent to release the Escrow Amount (X) to the Paying
Agent (for the benefit of the Stockholders) by wire transfer of immediately
available funds an amount equal to the portion of the Escrow Amount allocable
to the Stockholders, and the Paying Agent will pay to the Stockholders such
amount as directed by the Representative (according to each such Stockholders
Per Share Portion) pursuant to the payment instructions set forth in each such
Stockholders Letter of Transmittal, and (Y) to the Surviving Corporation or
one of its Subsidiaries (for the benefit of the Optionholders), by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to the portion of the
Escrow Amount allocable to the Optionholders, and the Surviving Corporation or
such Subsidiary will pay to the Optionholders such amount (according to each
such Optionholders Per Share Portion) through the Surviving Corporations or
the applicable Subsidiarys payroll.

 

(d) If the Final Residual Cash Consideration as finally determined pursuant to
_Section 1.09(b)_ is less than the Closing Residual Cash Consideration,
then, within five (5) Business Days after the determination of the Final
Residual Cash Consideration, Parent and the Representative will instruct the
Escrow Agent to (i) pay to Parent by wire transfer of immediately available
funds an amount equal to such shortfall from the Escrow Amount and (ii)
release the remainder of the Escrow Amount (if any) (A) to the Paying Agent
(for the benefit of the Stockholders) by wire transfer of immediately
available funds an amount equal to the portion of such remainder allocable to
the Stockholders, and the Paying Agent will pay to the Stockholders such
amount as directed by the Representative (according to each such Stockholders
Per Share Portion) pursuant to the payment instructions set forth in each
such Stockholders Letter of Transmittal, and (B) to the Surviving Corporation
or one of its Subsidiaries (for the benefit of the Optionholders), by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to the portion of
such remainder allocable to the Optionholders, and the Surviving Corporation
or such Subsidiary will pay to the Optionholders such amount (according to
each such Optionholders Per Share Portion) through the Surviving
Corporations or the applicable Subsidiarys payroll. In the event the excess
of the Closing Residual Cash Consideration over the Final Residual Cash
Consideration is greater than the Escrow Amount, 

 



7  then the Representative shall pay to Parent any such shortfall to the extent
of the Representative Holdback Amount. Recourse against the Escrow Amount and
the Representative Holdback Amount shall be Parents and its Affiliates sole
and exclusive source of recovery for any amounts owing to Parent pursuant to
this _Section 1.09(d)_. For the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, no claim by Parent for the payment of any
amounts owing to Parent pursuant to this _Section 1.09(d)_ shall be asserted
against the Representative (except with respect to the Representative Holdback
Amount), any Stockholder, any Optionholder or any other Person.

(e) All payments required pursuant to _Section 1.09(c)_ and _Section
1.09(d)_ will be deemed to be adjustments for Tax purposes to the Closing
Residual Cash Consideration.

1.10 _The Closing_. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at the offices of Kirkland and
Ellis LLP, located at 300 North LaSalle St., Chicago, Illinois 60654, on the
third (3rd) Business Day following satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in _Section 3.01_ and _Section 3.02_, but in no event prior to
January 2, 2015 (it being agreed and understood that the Closing shall take
place on January 2, 2015 to the extent that the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in _Section 3.01_ and _Section 3.02_ has occurred at
least two (2) Business Days prior thereto). The date of the Closing is herein
referred to as the " _Closing Date_."

1.11 _Appraisal Rights_. Each issued and outstanding Company Share that is
held by a Stockholder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented
thereto in writing or executed an enforceable waiver of appraisal rights to
the extent permitted by applicable Law and, in the case of any Person required
to have exercised appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL as of the
Effective Time of the Merger in order to preserve such rights, with respect to
which appraisal rights under the DGCL have been properly exercised, will not
be converted into the right to receive any portion of the applicable Merger
Consideration and will be converted into the right to receive payment from the
Surviving Corporation with respect thereto as provided by the DGCL, unless and
until the holder of any such Company Share will have failed to perfect or
will have effectively withdrawn or lost his, her or its right to appraisal and
payment under the DGCL, in which case such Company Share will thereupon be
deemed, as of the Effective Time, to have been cancelled and retired and to
have ceased to exist and been converted into the right to receive, upon
surrender of such certificate in accordance with _Section 1.03_, a portion,
without interest, in accordance with this Agreement, of the Merger
Consideration payable with respect to such Company Share. From and after the
Effective Time, no Stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be
entitled to vote his, her or its Company Shares for any purpose or to receive
payment of dividends or other distributions on his, her or its Company Shares
(except dividends or other distributions payable to Stockholders of record at
a date prior to the Effective Time, or dividends that accrued thereon prior to
the Effective Time). Company Shares for which appraisal rights have been
properly exercised, and not subsequently withdrawn, lost or failed to be
perfected, are referred to herein as " _Dissenting Shares_."

participating or contributing employer in any "multiemployer plan" (as defined
in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) with respect to employees of the Company or
its Subsidiaries nor has the Company or any of its Subsidiaries incurred any
withdrawal liability with respect to any multiemployer plan that remains
outstanding.

 

(f) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.12(f)_ , neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Merger will (either

current or former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
with respect to any Plan, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under
any Plan, (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting

24  applicable, has modified the terms of any nonqualified deferred compensation
plan that had been exempt from the requirements of Code Section 409A in a
matter that could cause an interest previously granted under such plan to
become subject to the Taxes imposed by Code Section 409A.

(i) With respect to each Plan that the Company or its Subsidiaries maintains
and that covers any employees residing or working outside of the United States
(any such Plan, a " _Foreign Benefit Plan_ "), each Foreign Benefit Plan has

Governmental Bodies and, if required to be registered or approved by any
Governmental Body under the Law of any jurisdiction outside of the United
States, has been so registered and approved, and if any Foreign Benefit Plan

Arrangement_ ") would result in the payment of any "excess parachute
payment," no payments or benefits payable pursuant to agreements entered into
between Parent (or any of its Affiliates) and any "disqualified individual"
(within the meaning of Code Section 280G) shall be taken into account),
except to the extent the Company has been informed of such 280G Arrangement
that will be entered into by Parent or any of its Affiliates in accordance

out-of-pocket costs of Parent and Merger Sub arising from the consummation of

or consented to in writing by Parent (which consent will not be unreasonably
delayed), the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to conduct
its business and the businesses of its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practices; _provided_ that, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.01_, the Company and its

and the Companys board of directors shall accelerate the vesting of any
unvested Class B Common Shares and unvested employee options to acquire Class
B Common Shares (except to the extent set forth in the following proviso),
and nothing in this Agreement shall limit the ability of the Company and its
board of directors from effectuating the foregoing; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Companys board of directors shall not accelerate the vesting of any
unvested Class B Common Shares and unvested

 



31  employee options to acquire Class B Common Shares to the extent agreed in
writing by the Company, Parent and each of the holders of such unvested Class
B Common Shares or unvested employee options to acquire Class B Common Shares
(collectively, the " _Non-Accelerated Equity_ "). Parent will indemnify and
hold harmless the DandO Indemnitees and the other Seller Indemnified Parties
against any Losses suffered or incurred by any such DandO Indemnitee or other
Seller Indemnified Party to the extent such Loss results from the written

(b) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, except as otherwise provided
for by this Agreement, as set forth on _Schedule 6.01(b)_ , or consented to
in writing by Parent (which consent will not be unreasonably delayed), the

action which, if taken after the date of the Latest Balance Sheet and
prior to the date of this Agreement, would be required to be disclosed on
_Schedule 4.07_ ; _provided_ , that the Company shall be permitted to
repurchase securities of the Company from the holders thereof pursuant to the

Date, the Company will provide Parent and its authorized representatives ("

of the Company and its Subsidiaries in order for Parent to have the
opportunity to make such investigation as it reasonably desires to make of the
affairs of the Company and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ that (a) such access
does not unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, (b) such access occurs in such a manner as the Company
reasonably determines to be appropriate to protect the confidentiality of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (c) all requests for such
access will be directed to James Johnson, Kelly Lang or such other Person as
the Company or the Representative may designate in writing from time to time
(the " _Designated Contacts_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries will be required to
disclose any information to Parent or Parents Representatives if such
disclosure would be reasonably likely to (x) jeopardize any attorney client or
other legal privilege or (y) contravene any applicable Law, fiduciary duty or
binding agreement entered into prior to the date hereof. The Company does not
make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy of any information (if
any) provided pursuant to this _Section 6.02_, and Parent may not rely on
the accuracy of any such information, in each case other than as expressly set
forth in the Companys representations and warranties contained in _Article
IV_. Other than the Designated Contacts, Parent is not authorized to and will
not (and will cause Parents Representatives not to) contact any officer,
director, employee, customer, supplier, lessor, lender or other material
business relation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement prior to the Effective
Time without the prior written consent of the Company or the Representative
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed 

 



32 or conditioned). The information provided pursuant to this _Section 6.02_
will be governed by all the terms and conditions of the Mutual
Confidentiality Agreement, dated June 30, 2014, by and between Tripwire, Inc.
and Belden Inc. (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). Parent acknowledges

date hereof), applicable to the Company and its Subsidiaries for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein. Subject to applicable
Laws relating to the exchange of information, Parent will have the right to

filings and submissions unless it consults with Parent in advance and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Body, gives Parent the opportunity to
attend and participate thereat.

cause the conditions set forth in _Section 3.01_ to be satisfied and to
consummate the transactions contemplated herein as soon as reasonably possible
after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article III_

obtained through the Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.01_, the Company and its Subsidiaries will not, and
the Company and its Subsidiaries will instruct their Affiliates, directors,
employees, agents and representatives not to, solicit, encourage, initiate or

Transaction. Additionally, from the date the Requisite Stockholder Approval
is obtained through the Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.01_, the Company and its Subsidiaries will, and the
Company and its Subsidiaries will instruct their Affiliates, directors,
employees, agents and representatives to, (i) immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations

representatives with respect to any Competing Transaction or potential
Competing Transaction and (ii) notify Parent as promptly as practicable (and,
in any event within 24 hours) if any inquiries, proposals or offers with
respect to any Competing Transaction or potential Competing Transaction are
received by, any information with respect thereto is required from, or any
discussions or negotiations with respect thereto are sought to be initiated or
continued with, the Company or any of its directors, officers, employees,
Affiliates, representatives or agents.

 

6.06 _Notification_. From the date hereof until the Closing Date, the Company
shall disclose to Parent in writing (in the form of updated Disclosure
Schedules) any material variances from the representations and warranties
contained in _Article IV_, as applicable, and of any other fact or event that
constitutes a breach of the covenants in this Agreement made by the
Company, in each case with respect to facts or events first arising after the

Disclosure Schedules delivered on the date hereof, but shall not be taken into
account in determining (i) the satisfaction by Parent or Merger Sub of the
conditions to closing set forth in _Section 3.01(a)_ and _Section 3.01(b)_
and (ii) Parents ability to terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section
9.01(b)_ below.

ARTICLE VII

 

COVENANTS OF PARENT

7.01  _Access to Books and Records_. From and after the Closing, Parent will,
and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide the Representative and
its authorized representatives with reasonable access (for the purpose of
examining and copying), during normal business hours and upon reasonable
notice, to the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries with
respect to periods or occurrences prior to or on the Closing Date for purposes
of complying with any applicable Tax, financial reporting or regulatory
requirements or any other reasonable business purposes; _provided_ , that,
except as provided in _Section 1.09_, the foregoing access may not be used in
connection with any disputes between the Representative, the Stockholders,
the Optionholders or any of their respective Affiliates or immediate family
members, on the one hand, and Parent, the Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates, on the other hand. Unless
otherwise consented to in writing by the Representative, Parent will not, and
will not permit the Surviving Corporation, until the expiration of the later
of the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date, to destroy, alter or
otherwise dispose of any of the material books and records of the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries for any period prior to the Closing Date
without first giving reasonable prior notice to the Representative and
offering to surrender to the Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders
and Optionholders) such books and records or any portion thereof which Parent
or the Surviving Corporation may intend to destroy, alter or dispose of.

 

7.02 _Employee, Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification_.

 

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, Parent will not, and will
not permit the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to, amend,
repeal or otherwise modify any provision in the Companys or any of its
Subsidiaries certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or equivalent governing
document) or any agreement relating to the exculpation or 

 



34  indemnification of any employees, officers and/or directors (unless required
by Law), it being the intent of the parties that the officers and directors of
the Company and its Subsidiaries will continue to be entitled to at least as
favorable exculpation and indemnification.

(b) In addition to the other rights provided for in this _Section 7.02(b)_
and not in limitation thereof, from and after the Closing, the Surviving
Corporation will and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and the
Subsidiaries (each, a " _D andO Indemnifying Party_") to, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, (i) indemnify and hold harmless (and release from
any liability to Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of the
Subsidiaries), current and former officers and directors of the Company or
its Subsidiaries (each, a " _D andO Indemnitee_") against all DandO Expenses (as
defined below), losses, claims, damages, judgments or amounts paid in
settlement (collectively, " _D andO Costs_") in respect of any threatened,
pending or completed claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether criminal,
civil, administrative or investigative, based on or arising from or relating
to the fact that such Person is or was a director or officer of the Company or
any of the Subsidiaries arising out of acts or omissions occurring on or
prior to the Closing (but not in respect of acts or omissions in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby) (a " _D andO
Indemnifiable Claim_") and (ii) advance to such DandO Indemnitees all DandO
Expenses incurred in connection with any DandO Indemnifiable Claim (including in
circumstances where the DandO Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of
such claim) promptly after receipt of reasonably detailed statements
therefor; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Person to whom DandO Expenses are to
be advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification. Any DandO
Indemnifiable Claims will continue until such DandO Indemnifiable Claim is
disposed of or all Orders in connection with such DandO Indemnifiable Claim are
fully satisfied. For the purposes of this _Section 7.02(b)_, " _D andO
Expenses_" will include reasonable attorneys fees and all other costs,
charges and expenses paid or incurred in connection with investigating,
defending, being a witness in or participating in (including on appeal), or
preparing to defend, to be a witness in or participate in any DandO
Indemnifiable Claim, but will exclude losses, judgments and amounts paid in
settlement (which items are included in the definition of DandO Costs).

(c) At the Closing, Parent will cause the Company to obtain and maintain
irrevocable "tail" insurance policies (the " _D andO Tail Policies_") naming
the DandO Indemnitees as direct beneficiaries with a claims period of at least
six (6) years from the Closing Date from an insurance carrier with the same or
better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect
to directors liability insurance in an amount and scope at least as favorable
as the Companys existing policies with respect to matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Closing Date. Parent, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, will bear equally the fees and expenses of
purchasing the DandO Tail Policies. Parent will not, and will cause the
Surviving Corporation not to, cancel or change such insurance policies in any
respect.

(d) In the event that all or substantially all of the assets of the Surviving
Corporation are sold, whether in one transaction or a series of transactions,
then Parent and the Surviving Corporation will, in each such case, ensure that
the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations
set forth in this  _Section 7.02_. The provisions of this _Section 7.02(d)_
will apply to all of the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation.

 



35 (e) The obligations of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their
Subsidiaries under this  _Section 7.02_ shall not be terminated or modified
in such a manner as to adversely affect any Person to whom this _Section
7.02_ applies without the consent of such affected Person.

 

7.03 _Employee Matters_. Parent will or will cause the Surviving Corporation
to provide employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing
Date who continue to be employed following the Closing Date (" _Company
Employees_ ") with compensation (including cash bonuses, but excluding any
retention or change-in-control related bonuses or any equity-related payments
or entitlements) and benefits substantially similar in the aggregate than
those in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date for a period of at least
12 months following the Closing Date. Parent further agrees that, from and
after the Closing Date, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation
to use commercially reasonable efforts to grant all Company Employees credit
for any service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries earned prior to
the Closing Date for eligibility and vesting purposes and for determining the
amount of benefits under any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement
or arrangement that may be established or maintained by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates on or after the Closing Date (the "
_New Plans_ "). In addition, Parent will or will cause the Surviving
Corporation to use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive all pre-
existing condition exclusion and actively-at-work requirements and similar
limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements under any New Plans to the extent waived or satisfied by an
employee under any Plan as of the Closing Date, and (ii) take into account
any covered expenses incurred on or before the Closing Date by any Company
Employee (or covered dependent thereof) for purposes of satisfying applicable
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions after the
Closing Date under any applicable New Plan. Parent and the Surviving
Corporation will be solely responsible for any obligations arising under
Section 4980B of the Code with respect to all "MandA qualified beneficiaries"
as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9. Nothing in this
_Section 7.03_ shall (i) create any third-party beneficiary or other rights
in any current or former employee, director or other service provider of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enforce the provisions of this _Section
7.03_, (ii) be construed as an amendment, waiver or creation of any Plan or
other employee benefit plan, (iii) limit in any way the right of the Company,
its Subsidiaries, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or their respective
Affiliates to amend or terminate any Plan at any time, or (iv) create any
right to employment, continued employment or any term or condition of
employment with the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or their respective Affiliates.

(a) Parent will, within five (5) Business Days after the date hereof, make or
cause to be made all filings and submissions under any anti-trust,
competition and similar legislation or regulations, including the HSR Act (to
the extent required filings or submissions have not been made prior to the
date hereof), applicable to Parent and its Affiliates for the consummation of
the transactions contemplated herein. Subject to applicable Laws relating to
the exchange of information, the Company will have the right to review in
advance, and to the extent practicable will consult with Parent on, all the
information that appears in any such filings. In exercising the foregoing
right, the Company will act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Parent,
on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, will bear equally all
fees associated with all filings and submissions referred to in _Section
6.03_ and this _Section 7.04(a)_.

 



36 (b) Parent will comply with any additional requests for information, including
requests for production of documents and production of witnesses for
interviews or depositions by any Governmental Bodies, in connection with the
filings under _Section 7.04(a)_. Parent agrees to use reasonable best
efforts to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Law that
may be asserted by any Governmental Body or any other Person so as to enable
the parties to expeditiously close the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(c) Parent will keep the Company apprised of the status of all filings and
submissions referred to in _Section 7.04(a)_, including furnishing the
Company with copies of notices or other communications received by Parent in
connection therewith. Parent will not permit any of Parents Representatives
to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Body in respect of
such filings and submissions unless it consults with the Company in advance
and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Body, gives the Company the
opportunity to attend and participate thereat.

 

7.05 _Conditions_. Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the conditions set forth in _Section 3.02_ to be satisfied and to consummate

than those to be satisfied at the Closing).

 

7.06 _Closing Date Covenants_. On the Closing Date after the Closing, the
Company and its Subsidiaries will not (a) declare, set aside or pay any
dividend or other distribution (whether in Cash, securities or other property)
with respect to any securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (b)
purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of the securities of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or (c) take any other action with the intent of
diminishing the amount of Cash on the Closing Date except in the ordinary

ARTICLE VIII

 

INDEMNIFICATION

8.01  _Survival_. The Fundamental Representations and representations and
warranties contained in the Letters of Transmittal and the Option Cancellation
Agreements will survive the Closing and will terminate on the date that is
three (3) years after the Closing Date. The covenants and agreements
contained in _Article VI_ and _Article VII_ will terminate on the Closing
Date (and no claim for indemnification may be made therefor) unless a specific
covenant contained in  _Article VI_ or _Article VII_ requires performance
after the Closing Date, in which case such covenant will survive for a period
of 30 days following the date on which the breach of such covenant is
discovered by Parent or the Representative, as applicable; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the covenants set forth in _Section 6.01(b)_ shall survive
for thirty (30) days after the Closing Date. The covenants and agreements set
forth in _Article VIII_ , _Article X_, _Article XI_ and _Article XII_ will
survive in accordance with the terms thereof. No claim for indemnification
hereunder for breach of any such representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements may be made after the expiration of such applicable survival
period.

 



37 8.02 _Indemnification for the Benefit of Parent Indemnified Parties_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing (but subject to the terms and conditions of
this _Article VIII_ ), each Stockholder and Optionholder shall, severally in
accordance with their Per Share Portion and not jointly and severally,
indemnify and hold harmless Parent and each of its Affiliates, officers,
directors, employees, agents, successors and permitted assigns (collectively,
the " _Parent Indemnified Parties_ ") in respect of any loss, cost,
liability, damage or expenses (including reasonable legal fees) (hereinafter
individually, a " _Loss_ " and collectively, " _Losses_ ") suffered or
incurred by any such Parent Indemnified Party to the extent such Loss results
from (i) any breach of any of the Fundamental Representations set forth in
_Article IV_ , in each case taking into account any disclosure made pursuant
to  _Section 6.06_, (ii) any Specified Tax Matters to the extent such
Specified Tax Matters are not accrued as Indebtedness as of the Closing Date
or (iii) any breach of the covenants set forth in _Section 6.01(b)_, but
in the case of this clause (iii) only to the extent that such Losses exceed
$1,500,000. Any Loss incurred with respect to a Specified Tax Matter shall be
calculated by taking into account (i) any reduction of net Taxes that any
Parent Indemnified Party actually realizes as a direct result of such
Specified Tax Matter in the taxable year in which the Loss is incurred and
(ii) any Tax credit carryforward or net operating loss carryforward of the
Company and its Subsidiaries utilized to offset any Taxes that, but for such
carryforward, would have been incurred as a result of such Specified Tax
Matter. From and after the Closing (but subject to the terms and conditions of
this _Article VIII_), each Stockholder and Optionholder will, severally and
not jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless the Parent Indemnified
Parties in respect of any Loss suffered or incurred by any such Parent
Indemnified Party to the extent such Loss results from (i) any breach or
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty set forth in any Letter of
Transmittal or Option Cancellation Agreement delivered by such Stockholder or
Optionholder, as applicable or (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement
set forth in any Letter of Transmittal or Option Cancellation Agreement
delivered by such Stockholder or Optionholder, as applicable, and, for the
avoidance of doubt, no other Stockholder or Optionholder will be liable to the
Parent Indemnified Parties in connection therewith. From and after the
Closing (but subject to the terms and conditions of this _Article VIII_ ), the
Representative shall indemnify and hold harmless the Parent Indemnified
Parties in respect of any Loss suffered or incurred by any such Parent
Indemnified Party to the extent such Loss results from any breach of the
covenants set forth in _Section 10.06_.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, even
if a Parent Indemnified Party would otherwise be entitled to recover a Loss
pursuant to this Agreement, any indemnification under this _Section 8.02_
shall be limited, in the aggregate, to the Merger Consideration actually
received by the applicable Stockholder or Optionholder.

 

(c) The parties hereto agree that the provisions in this Agreement relating to
indemnification, and the limits imposed on Parent Indemnified Parties
remedies with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby were specifically bargained for between sophisticated parties and were
specifically taken into account in the determination of the amounts to be paid
to the Stockholders and Optionholders hereunder.

(d) All payments under this _Section 8.02_ will be treated by the parties as
an adjustment to the proceeds received by the Stockholders and Optionholders
pursuant to _Article II_.

 



38 8.03 _Indemnification for the Benefit of Seller Indemnified Parties_.

 

(a) Parent will indemnify and hold harmless the Stockholders, the
Optionholders and the Representative and their respective
officers, directors, partners, members, employees, agents, successors and
permitted assigns (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") against
any Losses suffered or incurred by any such Seller Indemnified Party to the
extent such Loss results from (i) any breach of any of the Fundamental
Representations set forth in _Article V_ , (ii) any breach of any covenant of
Parent contained in this Agreement requiring performance by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation after the Closing and (iii) actions taken by Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries on or after
the Closing Date or relating to the post-Closing operations of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries. All payments under this _Section 8.03(a)_
will be treated by the parties as an adjustment to the proceeds received by
the Stockholders and Optionholders pursuant to _Article II_.

 

(b) Any indemnification payments pursuant to this _Section 8.03_ will be
effected by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account(s)
designated by the Representative within 10 days after the determination
thereof. The indemnification amount paid to each Stockholder or Optionholder
will be pro rata based upon such Persons Per Share Portion of the Final
Residual Cash Consideration.

8.04 _Termination of Indemnification_. The obligations to indemnify and hold
harmless a party in respect of a breach of representation or warranty,
covenant or agreement will terminate on the applicable survival termination
date as set forth in this Agreement, unless, with respect to a representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement that terminates following the Closing Date,
an Indemnitee has incurred a Loss prior to such applicable survival
termination date and made a proper claim for indemnification under _Section
8.02_ or _Section 8.03_, subject to the terms and conditions of this
_Article VIII_ (including application of Alternative Arrangements as required
by _Section 8.06(a)_), prior to such termination date, as applicable,
including by delivering a written notice (stating in reasonable detail the
nature of and factual basis for the indemnification claim, the amount thereof
(if known and quantifiable, or if not known, a good faith and reasonable
estimate thereof) and the provisions of this Agreement upon which such claim
for indemnification is made) to the Indemnitor. If an Indemnitee has made a
proper claim for indemnification under _Section 8.02_ or _Section 8.03_
prior to such termination date, then such claim for such Loss incurred (after
giving effect to any reductions for Alternative Arrangements pursuant to
_Section 8.06(a)_), and only such claim for such modified Loss incurred, if
then unresolved, will not be extinguished by the passage of the deadlines set
forth in this Agreement.

8.05 _Defense of Third Party Claims_. Any Person making a claim for
indemnification under _Section 8.02_ or  _Section 8.03_ (an " _Indemnitee_
") will notify the indemnifying party (an " _Indemnitor_ ") and the
Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders and Optionholders), if
applicable, of the claim in writing promptly after receiving written notice
of any Legal Proceeding, investigation or other claim against it by a third
party (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") or becoming aware of the facts giving rise
to a Third Party Claim, stating in reasonable detail the nature of and
factual basis for the Third Party Claim, the amount thereof (if known and
quantifiable, or if not known, a good faith and reasonable estimate thereof)
and the provisions of this Agreement upon which such claim
for indemnification is made. Any Indemnitor will be entitled to participate
in the defense of such Third Party Claim giving rise to an Indemnitees

 



39  claim for indemnification at such Indemnitors expense, and at its option
(other than in the case of a Third Party Claim (i) consisting of a criminal or
quasi-criminal Legal Proceeding, investigation or other claim, (ii) that
seeks equitable relief (other than equitable claims that are ancillary to a
claim for monetary damages or (iii) if, in the opinion of counsel to the
Indemnitee, the Third Party Claim involves potential conflicts of interests
or substantially different defenses for the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee)
will be entitled to assume and control the defense thereof by appointing a
reputable counsel to be the lead counsel in connection with such defense;
_provided_ that any Indemnitor will continue to be entitled to assert any
limitation on any claims contained herein; _provided_ _further_ that the
Indemnitee will be entitled to participate in the defense of such Third
Party Claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose (it being
understood that the fees and expenses of such separate counsel will be borne
by the Indemnitee). If the Indemnitor will control the defense of any such
claim then the Indemnitor will be entitled to settle such claim; _provided_
that the Indemnitor will obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnitee
(which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned)
before entering into any settlement of a Third Party Claim or ceasing to
defend such claim if, pursuant to or as a result of such settlement or
cessation, injunctive or other equitable relief will be imposed against the
Indemnitee or if such settlement does not expressly and unconditionally
release the Indemnitee from all liabilities and obligations with respect to
such claim. If the Indemnitor chooses to defend any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnitee and its Affiliates, and their respective officers,
directors, employees, agents and representatives, will cooperate in good
faith in the defense or prosecution of such Third Party Claim. Such
cooperation will include the retention and (upon the Indemnitors request) the
provision to the Indemnitor of records and information which are reasonably
relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees and other
representatives and advisors available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Whether or not the Representative has assumed the defense of a
claim hereunder, neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates will admit any
liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, any Third Party
Claim for which a Parent Indemnified Party is seeking indemnification
hereunder without the prior written consent of the Representative. The
Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders and Optionholders) will act on
behalf of all Indemnitors in the case of all Third Party Claims with respect
to which a Parent Indemnified Party is seeking indemnification under _Section
8.02_ (with each Stockholder or Optionholder responsible for its portion of
Representatives costs and expenses in undertaking such representation
(determined on a pro rata basis according to each such Persons Per Share
Portion of the Final Residual Cash Consideration)).

 

8.06 _Determination of Loss Amount_.

 

(a) The amount of any Loss subject to indemnification under _Section 8.02_ or
_Section 8.03_ will be calculated net of any amounts actually recovered by
any Indemnitee or any of such Indemnitees Affiliates under or pursuant to any
insurance policy, title insurance policy, indemnity, reimbursement arrangement
or contract pursuant to which or under which such Indemnitee or such
Indemnitees Affiliates is a party or has rights (collectively, " _Alternative
Arrangements_ "). The Parent Indemnified Parties will have no right to assert
any claims against the Stockholders or Optionholders with respect to any
Losses that would have been covered by an Alternative Arrangement had Parent
maintained for its benefit and the benefit of the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries the same rights or coverage under an Alternative Arrangement

 



40  following the Closing that was in effect for the Company immediately prior
to the Closing. In the event that a recovery is made under an Alternative
Arrangement by any Parent Indemnified Party with respect to any Loss for
which any such Person has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to
the aggregate amount of the recovery will be made promptly to the
Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders and the Optionholders).

 

(b) In no event will any Indemnitee be entitled to recover or make a claim for
any amounts in respect of punitive damages, unless such punitive damages were
actually paid to a third party. In addition, in no event will any Parent
Indemnified Parties be entitled to recover for any Losses that are
attributable to the unavailability of any Tax attribute from a Pre-Closing Tax
Period. The Parent Indemnified Parties will not be entitled to any
indemnification under this _Article VIII_ to the extent (i) such matter was
taken into account in determining the Final Residual Cash Consideration or
(ii) such matter was sufficiently reserved for in the Financial Statements.

8.07 _Acknowledgment of Parent_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledges that it has conducted to its satisfaction, an independent
investigation of the financial condition, results of operations, assets,
liabilities, properties and projected operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in making its determination to proceed with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and Parent and Merger Sub have relied on the
results of their own independent investigation and the representations and
warranties of the Company expressly and specifically set forth in  _Article
IV_, as qualified by the Disclosure Schedules (and updated Disclosure
Schedules), and of the Stockholders in the Letters of Transmittal and the
Optionholders in the Option Cancellation Agreements. In connection with
Parents and Merger Subs investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
each of Parent and Merger Sub has received or may receive from the Company and
its Subsidiaries certain projections, forward looking statements, other
forecasts, including projected statements of operating revenues and income
from operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and certain business plan
information. Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections and
other forecasts and plans, that each of Parent and Merger Sub is familiar with
such uncertainties and that each of Parent and Merger Sub is taking full
responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of
all estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans so furnished to it
(including, without limitation, the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts and plans). Accordingly,
each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledges that none of the Company,
its Subsidiaries, the Stockholders or the Optionholders, nor any member,
partner, officer, director, employee or agent of any of the foregoing, whether
in an individual, corporate or any other capacity, is making any
representation or warranty with respect to such estimates, projections and
other forecasts and plans (including, without limitation, the reasonableness
of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts and
plans), and each of Parent and Merger Sub is not relying on, such estimates,
projections, forecasts or plans (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts or plans).

the Closing:

(a) by the mutual written consent of Parent and the Representative (on behalf
of the Stockholders, the Optionholders and the Company);

(b) by Parent, if there has been a material violation or breach by the
Company or its Subsidiaries of any covenant, representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement that has prevented the satisfaction of any
condition to the obligations of Parent at the Closing and such violation
or breach has not been waived by Parent or cured by the Company within 10
Business Days after receipt by the Representative of written notice thereof
from Parent;

 

(c) by the Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders, the Optionholders
and the Company), if there has been a material violation or breach by Parent

Agreement that has prevented the satisfaction of any condition to the
obligations of the Company at the Closing and such violation or breach has not
been waived by the Representative or cured by Parent within 10 Business Days
after receipt by Parent of written notice thereof by the Representative;
_provided_ that neither a breach by Parent of _Section 5.08_ nor the failure
to deliver the Merger Consideration at the Closing as required hereunder will
be subject to cure hereunder unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the
Representative;

 

(d) by Parent, if the transactions contemplated hereby have not been
consummated on or before April 8, 2015; _provided_ that Parent will not be
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.01(d)_ if
Parents knowing and willful breach of this Agreement has prevented the

(e) by the Representative, if the transactions contemplated hereby have not
been consummated on or before January 8, 2015;  _provided_ that the

Agreement has prevented the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby; or

(f) by either Parent or the Representative, if any Governmental Body has
issued an Order or taken any other action restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and such Order or other action has become final and nonappealable.

 

9.02 _Effect of Termination_. In the event this Agreement is terminated by
either Parent or the Representative as provided above, the provisions of this
Agreement will immediately become void and of no further force and effect

with its terms), and there will be no liability on the part of any of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company, 

 



42  the Stockholders or the Optionholders to one another, except, in the case of
Company and Parent, for knowing and willful breaches of this Agreement prior
to the time of such termination. A breach by Parent of _Section 5.08_ or the
failure to deliver the Merger Consideration at the Closing will be considered
a knowing and willful breach of this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE X

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS

10.01 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns_.

 

(i) Parent will prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or cause to be
timely filed all Tax Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries that have
not been filed as of the Closing Date. Parent will timely pay or cause to be
timely paid any amount shown as due on such Tax Returns. At least 20 days
prior to the due date of any Tax Return with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period which is related to a Specified Tax Matter, Parent will submit such Tax
Return to the Representative to provide the Representative for review and
comment. Parent shall accept any reasonable written comments received from
Representative at least 10 days prior to the due date of such Tax Return. If
Parent and Representative cannot agree to any such comments within five days
prior to the due date of any such Tax Return, Parent shall file such Tax
Return as prepared; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Parent and Representative
shall submit such disputed Tax Return to the Accounting Firm for review and
resolution and if such Tax Return was not filed in accordance with the
Accounting Firms final determination, then Parent shall amend such Tax
Return accordingly. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared and filed in a
manner that is consistent with the past practices of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries unless (i) Parent reasonably believes that such
past practice is not more likely than not to be successfully defended in a
judicial or administrative proceeding, (ii) such past practice resulted in an
adjustment by a taxing authority, or (iii) otherwise required by applicable
Law.

 

(ii) For the portion of the day of the Closing after the time of Closing,
other than the transactions expressly contemplated hereby, Parent will cause
the Company and each of its Subsidiaries to carry on its business only in the
ordinary course in the same manner as heretofore conducted. Parent, the
Company and the Subsidiaries will not take any action, or permit any action
to be taken, that may prevent the Tax year of the Company and its Subsidiaries
from ending for all relevant Tax purposes at the end of the day on which the
Closing occurs and will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, elect with
the relevant taxing authority to treat for all purposes the Closing Date as
the last day of a taxable period of the Company and the Subsidiaries.

 

(iii) To the extent that (i) there are any net operating losses at the end of
any Pre-Closing Tax Period and (ii) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
incurs

 



43  Taxes in a Pre-Closing Tax Period with respect to a Specified Tax Matter,
the Representative, Parent and the Company consent and agree that the Company
and each Subsidiary, as appropriate, will elect to carry back such net
operating losses to prior taxable years to the fullest extent permitted by Law
to offset such Taxes with respect to a Specified Tax Matter (using any
available short form or accelerated procedures and filing amended Tax Returns
to the extent necessary), and Parent, the Company and/or the Subsidiaries will
prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, as soon as practicable
following the Closing Date, any claim for refund resulting from such carry
back as part of the preparation and filing of the Tax Returns described in
_Section 10.01(a)(i)_ (and the Representative will have the review and
comment rights described in _Section 10.01(a)(i)_).

 

(iv) For the avoidance of doubt, the Representative, Parent and the Company
acknowledge and agree that the Representative, the Stockholders and the
Optionholders shall not have any liability for Taxes of the Parent Indemnified
Parties, the Company and its Subsidiaries as a result of any acceleration of
deferred revenue attributable to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

(b) _Tax Refunds_. Any refunds of Taxes with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period that are received by Parent, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
after the Closing Date (any such refund, a " _Pre-Closing Tax Refund_ ") that
are (i) attributable to an overpayment of estimated Taxes claimed upon an
income Tax Return of the Company or its Subsidiaries filed after the Closing
Date or (ii) described in Item 2 of Section (b) on _Schedule 4.08_ hereto
shall be for the account of the Stockholders and Optionholders, provided,
however, that the Stockholders and Optionholders shall not be entitled to a
Pre-Closing Tax Refund that is attributable to a Transaction Tax Deduction
and, provided further, that any such Pre-Closing Tax Refunds shall be reduced
by the amount of any Taxes payable with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Returns except to the extent that any such Taxes payable were taken into
account as accrued income Taxes as finally determined. Parent shall pay over,
as directed by the Representative for the benefit of the Stockholders
and Optionholders, any such Pre-Closing Tax Refund within 20 days after the
filing of the final originally filed income Tax Return of the Company or its
Subsidiaries with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period that is filed after the
Closing Date. Parent shall cooperate with the Representative in obtaining
Pre-Closing Tax Refunds to which the Stockholders and Optionholders are
entitled under this _Section 10.01(b)_, including through the filing of
amended Tax Returns or refund claims, it being understood that any such Pre-
Closing Tax Refunds will be claimed in cash rather than as a credit against
future Tax liabilities.

 

(c) _Books and Records; Cooperation_. Parent and the Representative will, and
will cause their respective representatives to, (i) provide the other party
and its representatives with such assistance as may be reasonably requested in
connection with the preparation of any Tax Return or any audit or other
examination by any taxing authority or judicial or administrative proceeding
relating to Taxes with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
(ii) retain and provide the other party and its representatives with
reasonable access to all records or information that may be relevant to such
Tax Return, audit, examination or proceeding, _provided_ that the foregoing
will be done at the expense of the party making such request and in a manner
so as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the
parties.

 



44 (d) _Transfer Taxes_. Parent, on the one hand, and the Stockholders and
Optionholders, on the other hand, will bear equally any stamp Tax, stock
transfer Tax, or other similar Tax imposed on the Company and its Subsidiaries
or one or more Stockholders or Optionholders as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ "), and any
penalties, interest or additions to Tax with respect to the Transfer Taxes.
The Stockholders and Optionholders agree to cooperate with Parent in the
filing of any returns with respect to the Transfer Taxes, including promptly
supplying any information in their possession that is reasonably necessary to
complete such returns.

 

(e) _Amendment of Tax Returns; Tax Elections_. Without the prior written
consent of Representative, Parent will not amend or permit the Company or any
Subsidiary to (i) amend any Tax Return relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or
(ii) make any election that has retroactive effect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period if and to the extent, in each case, such amendment or election would
reasonably be expected to increase the Stockholders or Optionholders
indemnification obligations with respect to a Specified Tax Matter.

 

(f) _No Section 338 or Section 336 Election_. Parent will not make any
election under Code Section 338 or Code Section 336 (or any similar provision
under state, local, or foreign Law) with respect to the acquisition of the
Company and its Affiliates.

 

(g) _Non-Avoidance_. Parent will not take any action with respect to the
Company that would cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to
constitute part of a transaction that is the same as, or substantially similar
to, the "Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter" described in Internal Revenue
Service Notices 2001-16 and 2008-111.

 

10.02 _280G_. The Company shall prior to the Closing Date, seek to obtain the
approval of the Stockholders (in accordance with the requirements of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto)
with respect to any payments to be made by the Company and its Subsidiaries
with respect to arrangements in place at the Closing that would, absent
Stockholder approval (" _Stockholder Approval_ "), be excess parachute
payments as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby. Such Stockholder
Approval shall include any contract, agreement, or plan entered into by
Parent, the Company or any of their Affiliates and a "disqualified
individual" (as defined in Section 280G of the Code) in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement on or before the Closing Date,
provided that Parent shall provide a copy of such contract, agreement or plan
to the Company and the Representative at least 15 days before the Closing Date
and shall cooperate with the Company in good faith in order to calculate or
determine the value (for the purposes of Section 280G of the Code) of any
payments or benefits granted or contemplated therein, which may be paid or
granted in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that could constitute a "parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code.
Prior to such Stockholder approval, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain waivers from such individuals, such that unless
such payments are approved by the Stockholders to the extent and in the
manner required under Sections 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) and 280G(b)(5)(B) of the
Code, no such payments shall be made. Copies of all disclosures, waivers,
consent, and voting materials used in connection with the foregoing shall be
provided to Parent at least three (3) Business Days in advance of
distribution to stockholders or the disqualified individuals, as applicable,
and Parent shall be provided with a reasonable opportunity to comment thereon
(and the Company will 

 



45  include in such materials any reasonable comments provided by Parent). The
Company shall provide to Parent at or prior to the Effective Time evidence
reasonably satisfactory to Parent that the Company has satisfied its
obligations under this _Section 10.02_. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Closing shall not be conditioned on such vote described in this _Section
10.02_ occurring or receiving Stockholder approval for any such payments.

10.03 _Further Assurances_. From time to time, as and when requested by any
party hereto and at such partys expense, any other party will execute and
deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents and
instruments and will take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other
actions as such requesting party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable
to evidence and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

10.04 _Disclosure Generally_. All Disclosure Schedules attached hereto are

12.06 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof will be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective heirs, successors and permitted assigns. Neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder will be assigned
(including by operation of law) without the prior written consent of (i)
prior to the Closing, the Company, the Representative and Parent and (ii) from
and after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation, the Representative and
Parent.

 

12.07 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will
be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or
invalid under applicable Law, such provision will be ineffective only to the
extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder
of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement, and the
parties will amend or otherwise modify this Agreement to replace any
prohibited or invalid provision with an effective and valid provision that
gives effect to the intent of the parties to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable Law.

12.08 _References_. The table of contents and the section and other headings
and subheadings contained in this Agreement and the exhibits hereto are solely
for the purpose of reference, are not part of the agreement of the parties
hereto, and will not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement or any exhibit hereto. All references to days or months will be
deemed references to calendar days or months. Unless the context otherwise
requires, any reference to a " _Section_ ," " _Exhibit_ ," "
_Disclosure Schedule_ " or " _Schedule_ " will be deemed to refer to a
section of this Agreement, exhibit to this Agreement or a schedule to this

 



58  Agreement, as applicable. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and
words of similar import referring to this Agreement refer to this Agreement as
a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. English will
be the governing language of this Agreement.

12.09 _Construction_. The language used in this Agreement will be deemed to
be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent,
and no rule of strict construction will be applied against any Person. The
specification of any dollar amount or the inclusion of any item in the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or the Disclosure
Schedules or Exhibits attached hereto is not intended to imply that the
amounts, or higher or lower amounts, or the items so included, or
other items, are or are not required to be disclosed (including, without
limitation, whether such amounts or items are required to be disclosed as
material or threatened) or are within or outside of the ordinary course of
business, and no party will use the fact of the setting of the amounts or the
fact of the inclusion of any item in this Agreement or the Disclosure
Schedules or Exhibits in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to
whether any obligation, item or matter not described or included in this
Agreement or in any Disclosure Schedule or Exhibit is or is not required to be
disclosed (including whether the amount or items are required to be disclosed
as material or threatened) or is within or outside of the ordinary course of
business for purposes of this Agreement. The information contained in this
Agreement and in the Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits hereto is disclosed
solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no information contained herein or
therein will be deemed to be an admission by any party hereto to any third
party of any matter whatsoever (including, without limitation, any violation
of Law or breach of contract). The Disclosure Schedules and the information
and disclosures contained therein are intended only to qualify and limit the
representations, warranties or covenants of the Company contained in this
Agreement and shall not be deemed to expand in any way the scope or effect of
any of such representations, warranties or covenants. In disclosing the
information in the Disclosure Schedules, the Company does not waive any
attorney-client privilege associated with such information or any protection
afforded by the work-product doctrine with respect to any of the matters
disclosed or discussed therein. Disclosure of an item on one Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed disclosure on any other Disclosure Schedule(s) to the
extent its relevance to such other Disclosure Schedule(s) is reasonably
apparent or cross-referenced on such Disclosure Schedule. Capitalized terms
used in the Disclosure Schedules and not otherwise defined therein have the
meanings given to them in this Agreement.

 

12.10 _Amendment and Waiver_. Any provision of this Agreement or the
Disclosure Schedules (except as contemplated by  _Section 6.06_) or Exhibits
hereto may be amended or waived only in a writing signed by Parent, the
Company (or after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation) and the
Representative. No waiver of any provision hereunder or any breach or default
thereof will extend to or affect in any way any other provision or prior or
subsequent breach or default.

12.11 _Complete Agreement_. This Agreement, the Disclosure Schedules and the
documents referred to herein (including the Confidentiality Agreement) contain
the complete agreement between the parties hereto and supersede any prior
understandings, agreements or representations by or between the parties,
written or oral, which may have related to the subject matter hereof in any
way. The parties agree that prior drafts of this Agreement will be deemed not
to provide any evidence as to the meaning of any provision hereof or the
intent of the parties

 



59  hereto with respect hereto. The parties hereto have voluntarily agreed to
define their rights, liabilities and obligations respecting the sale and
purchase of the Company exclusively in contract pursuant to the express terms
and provisions of this Agreement; and the parties hereto expressly disclaim
that they are owed any duties or are entitled to any remedies not expressly
set forth in this Agreement. The parties hereto agree and acknowledge that to
the extent any terms and provisions of this Agreement are in any way
inconsistent with or in conflict with any term, condition or provision of any
other agreement, document or instrument contemplated hereby, this Agreement
will govern and control.

12.12 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Certain provisions of this Agreement are
intended for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, the Stockholders,
the Optionholders and, solely with respect to _Section 7.02_, the DandO
Indemnitees. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, nothing expressed
or referred to in this Agreement will be construed to give any Person other
than the parties to this Agreement and the Stockholders, the Optionholders
and, solely with respect to _Section 7.02_, the DandO Indemnitees, as the case
may be, any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim under or with respect
to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement.

12.13 _CONSENT TO JURISDICTION AND SERVICE OF PROCESS; PREVAILING PARTY_. THE
PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT SUBMIT TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE STATE
COURTS LOCATED IN WILMINGTON, DELAWARE OR THE COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES
LOCATED IN WILMINGTON, DELAWARE IN RESPECT OF THE INTERPRETATION AND
ENFORCEMENT OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY RELATED AGREEMENT,
CERTIFICATE OR OTHER DOCUMENT DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH AND BY THIS
AGREEMENT WAIVE, AND AGREE NOT TO ASSERT, ANY DEFENSE IN ANY ACTION FOR THE
INTERPRETATION OR ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY RELATED AGREEMENT,
CERTIFICATE OR OTHER DOCUMENT DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, THAT THEY ARE
NOT SUBJECT THERETO OR THAT SUCH ACTION MAY NOT BE BROUGHT OR IS NOT
MAINTAINABLE IN SUCH COURTS OR THAT THIS AGREEMENT MAY NOT BE ENFORCED IN OR
BY SUCH COURTS OR THAT THEIR PROPERTY IS EXEMPT OR IMMUNE FROM EXECUTION, THAT
THE ACTION IS BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM, OR THAT THE VENUE OF THE
ACTION IS IMPROPER. SERVICE OF PROCESS WITH RESPECT THERETO MAY BE MADE UPON
ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT BY MAILING A COPY THEREOF BY REGISTERED OR
CERTIFIED MAIL, POSTAGE PREPAID, TO SUCH PARTY AT ITS ADDRESS AS PROVIDED IN
_SECTION 12.05_.

 

12.14 _WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND
AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I)

 



60  NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH SUCH PARTY
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH
SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) EACH SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 12.14_.

12.15 _Parent Deliveries_. Parent agrees and acknowledges that all documents
or other items delivered or made available to Parents Representatives will be
deemed to be delivered or made available, as the case may be, to Parent for
all purposes hereunder.

 

12.16 _Electronic Delivery_. This Agreement and any signed agreement or
instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments
hereto or thereto, to the extent delivered by means of a facsimile machine or
electronic mail (any such delivery, an " _Electronic Delivery_ "), will be
treated in all manner and respects as an original agreement or instrument and
will be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the
original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the request of any
party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument, each other party hereto
or thereto will re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to all
other parties. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument will
raise the use of Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature or the fact that
any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated
through the use of Electronic Delivery as a defense to the formation of a
contract, and each such party forever waives any such defense, except to the
extent such defense related to lack of authenticity. 

12.17 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts
(including by means of telecopied signature pages or electronic transmission
in portable document format (pdf)), any one of which need not contain the
signatures of more than one party, but all such counterparts taken together
will constitute one and the same instrument.

 

12.18 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action
(whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of
or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with
this Agreement) will be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements executed and
performed entirely within such State.

 

12.19 _Remedies; Specific Performance_.

 

(a) _Acknowledgement Regarding Available Remedies_. After the Effective Time,
the rights and remedies of the parties hereto shall be cumulative (and not
alternative). Each of the parties to this Agreement acknowledges and agrees
that the other parties to this Agreement would be irreparably damaged in the
event that any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement are not performed
in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise are breached. Therefore,
each of the parties to this Agreement hereby agrees that (i) the parties to
this

 



61  Agreement shall be entitled to obtain an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement, and to
enforce specifically the performance by each other party hereto under this
Agreement, (ii) the provisions set forth in _Section 12.19(b)_ (A) are not
intended to and do not adequately compensate for the harm that would result
from a breach of this Agreement and (B) shall not be construed to diminish or
otherwise impair in any respect any partys rights to specific enforcement and
(iii) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, neither
the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. Each party to
this Agreement hereby agrees to waive the defense in any such suit that the
other parties to this Agreement have an adequate remedy at law and to
interpose no opposition, legal or otherwise, as to the propriety of injunction
or specific performance as a remedy, and hereby agrees to waive any
requirement to post any bond or other type of security in connection with
obtaining such relief.

(b) _Remedies of Parent and the Company_.

 

(i) _Specific Performance_. Prior to the valid termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.01_, each of Parent and the Company, without posting
a bond and without proof of actual damages, shall be entitled to seek and
obtain an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief in the
event of a breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of this
Agreement by the other party in the courts described in _Section 12.13_ and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, including such
partys obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(ii) _Termination_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall
be entitled to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 9.01_.

(iii) _Monetary Remedies_. Other than in the case of fraud, in no event shall
Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, have
the right to seek or obtain monetary damages from the other party or its
Affiliates and its and their respective officers, directors, employees,
agents, attorneys, accountants, advisors and other authorized representatives
under this Agreement (whether at law or in equity, in contract, tort or
otherwise) other than as provided in _Article VIII_ and _Section 9.02_. 

(iv) _Sole Remedy_. The parties acknowledge and agree that, from and after the
Closing, the remedies provided for in this _Section 12.19_ shall be the
parties sole and exclusive remedies for any breaches of this Agreement or any
claims relating to the transactions contemplated hereby. In furtherance of the
foregoing and effective as of the Closing, each party hereby waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any and all other rights, claims
and causes of action, known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or
may arise in the future, that such party may have against the other party or
its Affiliates and its and their respective officers, directors, employees,
agents, attorneys, accountants, advisors and other authorized representatives,
as the case may be, arising under or based upon any applicable Law (including
any securities law, common law or otherwise) for any breach of the
representations and warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement.

 



62 12.20 _Payments Under Agreement_. Each party hereto agrees that all amounts
required to be paid hereunder will be paid in United States currency and,
except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, without discount,
rebate or reduction and subject to no counterclaim or offset (other than
withholding Tax obligations required to be withheld by Law), on the dates
specified herein (with time being of the essence). In the event any Legal
Proceeding is commenced or threatened by any Person (the " _Claiming Party_ ")
to enforce its rights under this Agreement against any other Person (the "
_Defending Party_ "), if the Defending Party is the prevailing party in such
Legal Proceeding, all fees, costs and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys fees and court costs, incurred by the Defending Party in such
Legal Proceeding will be reimbursed by the Claiming Party; _provided_ that if
the Defending Party prevails in part, and loses in part, in such Legal
Proceeding, the court, arbitrator or other adjudicator presiding over such
Legal Proceeding will award a reimbursement of the fees, costs and expenses
incurred by the Defending Party on an equitable basis. For purposes hereof,
and without limitation, the Defending Party will be deemed to have prevailed
in any Legal Proceeding described in the immediately preceding sentence if
the Claiming Party commences or threatens any such Legal Proceeding and (i)
such underlying claim(s) are subsequently dropped, voluntarily dismissed or
voluntarily reduced and/or (ii) the Defending Party defeats any such
claim(s).

12.21 _Appointment of the Stockholder and Optionholder Representative_. 

(a) In order to administer efficiently the determination of, amongst other
items, the defense and/or settlement of any claim or liability in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, the Stockholders
and Optionholders, by their adoption and approval of this Agreement, as well
as, in certain cases, through separate instruments (including the Letters
of Transmittal and Option Cancellation Agreements), irrevocably appoint the
Representative as their agent, attorney in fact and representative (with full
power of substitution in the premises), and, by its execution hereof, the
Representative hereby accepts such appointment.

(b) The Representative is hereby authorized (i) to take all action necessary
in connection with the defense and/or settlement of any claim or liability in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii)
to give and receive all notices required to be given under this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement, the Paying Agent Agreement and the other agreements
contemplated hereby to which all of the Stockholders and the Optionholders are
subject and (iii) to do or refrain from doing all such further acts and
things, and to execute all such documents as the Representative will deem
necessary or appropriate in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including, without limitation, the power:

 

(i) to execute and deliver the Escrow Agreement and any amendments or waivers
thereto as the representative of the Stockholders and the Optionholders; to
execute any instructions or directions to the Escrow Agent with respect to
disbursements or other matters thereunder; to pay any expenses of the
Stockholders, the Optionholders or the Representative from the Escrow
Amount; and to take such further actions under the Escrow Agreement as the
Representative deems to be necessary or appropriate;

 



63 (ii) to execute and deliver all consents, waivers, ancillary agreements,
stock powers, certificates and documents that the Representative deems
necessary or appropriate in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 

(iii) to execute and deliver all amendments and waivers to this Agreement that
the Representative deems necessary or appropriate, whether prior to, at or
after the Closing;

(iv) to receive funds, make payments of funds, and give receipts for funds;

(v) to receive funds for the payment of expenses of the Stockholders and the
Optionholders (including the Representative Holdback Amount), to deposit such
funds in such accounts as the Representative deems appropriate and apply such
funds in payment for such expenses;

 

(vi) to do or refrain from doing any further act or deed on behalf of the
Stockholders and the Optionholders that the Representative deems necessary or
appropriate in its sole discretion relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement as fully and completely as the Stockholders and the Optionholders
could do if personally present; and

 

(vii) to receive service of process in connection with any claims under this
Agreement.

 

(c) The Stockholders and Optionholders, by their adoption and approval of this
Agreement, as well as, in certain cases, through separate instruments
(including the Letters of Transmittal and Option Cancellation Agreements)
acknowledge that the Representative Holdback Amount will be retained by the
Representative for such time as the Representative will determine in its
sole discretion, on behalf of the Stockholders and Optionholders, to satisfy
potential future obligations of the Stockholders and Optionholders hereunder.
Any remaining amounts distributed from the Representative Holdback Amount will
be distributed to the Stockholders and Optionholders pro rata, based on such
Persons Per Share Portion of the Final Residual Cash Consideration.

(d) In the event that the Representative becomes unable to perform its
responsibilities hereunder or resigns from such position, the Stockholders and
the Optionholders (or, if applicable, their respective heirs, legal
representatives, successors and assigns) who held a majority of the voting
power represented by the Company Shares issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, will select another representative to fill such
vacancy and such substituted representative will be deemed to be the
Representative for all purposes of this Agreement.

 



64 (e) All decisions and actions by the Representative, including the defense or
settlement of any claim or liability in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, will be binding upon all of the Stockholders
and Optionholders, and no Stockholder or Optionholder will have the right to
object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same.

(f) Parent will be able to rely conclusively on the instructions and decisions
of the Representative as to the settlement or compromise of any claim or
liability in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby and any other actions required to be taken by the Representative
hereunder, and no party hereunder or Stockholder or Optionholder will have
any cause of action against Parent or Merger Sub for any action taken by
Parent or Merger Sub in reliance upon the instructions or decisions of the
Representative.

 

(g) All actions, decisions and instructions of the Representative will be
conclusive and binding upon all of the Stockholders and Optionholders, and no
Stockholder or Optionholder will have any cause of action against the
Representative for any action taken or not taken, decision made or instruction
given by the Representative under this Agreement, except for fraud or
willful misconduct by the Representative;

(h) The provisions of this _Section 12.21_ are independent and severable, are
irrevocable and coupled with an interest and will be enforceable
notwithstanding any rights or remedies that any Stockholder or Optionholder
may have in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
and

 

(i) The provisions of this _Section 12.21_ will be binding upon the heirs,
legal representatives, successors and assigns of each Stockholder and
Optionholder, and any references in this Agreement to a Stockholder or an
Optionholder or the Stockholders or Optionholders will mean and include the
successors to the rights of the Stockholders and Optionholders hereunder,
whether pursuant to testamentary disposition, the Laws of descent and
distribution or otherwise.
