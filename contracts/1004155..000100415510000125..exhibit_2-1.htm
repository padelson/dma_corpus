the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance
with the LLC Act, without further approval, authorization or direction from or
by any of the Parties hereto;

  

  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company Board") has, upon

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub, Merger LLC and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the

AGREEMENT

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, the Parties to this Agreement agree as follows:

  

  

ARTICLE 1

  

  

THE MERGER

  

  

1.1 The Merger.

  

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and in accordance with the IBCA, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue
as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation"). At
the Effective Time, the effects of the Merger shall be as provided in this
Agreement and the applicable provisions of the IBCA. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all of the property,
rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and
Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all of the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(b) At the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of Merger Sub as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended
as provided therein or herein or by applicable Law. In addition, at the
Effective Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) The Parties shall take all actions necessary so that the directors of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the
Effective Time, be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to
hold office in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until their respective successors shall have been duly
elected, designated or qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time, from and after the Effective Time, shall continue as the
officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with
the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
their respective successors shall have been duly elected, designated or
qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(d) After the Effective Time, if the Surviving Corporation shall determine or
shall be advised that any deeds, bills of sale, instruments of conveyance,
assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub acquired or to be
acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with,
the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, then the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub, all
such deeds, bills of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments and
assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of each of such
corporations or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may be
necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, title or
interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving
Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

  

  

1.2 Closing and Effective Time of the Merger. The closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") will take place at 9:00 a.m., Chicago, Illinois time, on the date
that is the later of (i) the third Business Day after satisfaction or waiver
of all of the conditions set forth in Article 6 (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
fulfillment or waiver of those conditions at the Closing) and (ii) the final
day of the Marketing Period or such earlier date as may be specified by Parent
on no less than three Business Days' prior notice to the Company (such date on
which the Closing occurs, the "Closing Date"), at the offices of Latham and
Watkins LLP, 233 South Wacker Drive, Suite 5800, Chicago, Illinois 60606,
unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the Parties
hereto. On the Closing Date, or on such other date as Parent and the Company
may agree to in writing, (i) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause
appropriate articles of merger or other appropriate documents (the "Articles
of Merger") to be executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State
of Illinois in accordance with the relevant provisions of the IBCA and shall
make all other filings or recordings required under the IBCA and (ii) Parent
shall file the Charter Amendment with the Secretary of State of Georgia. The
Merger shall become effective at the time the Articles of Merger shall have
been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Illinois or such
other date and time as is agreed upon by the Parties and specified in the
Articles of Merger, such date and time hereinafter referred to as the
"Effective Time".

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

1.3 Subsequent Merger.

  

  

(a) Immediately after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
merge with and into Merger LLC, the separate corporate existence of the
Surviving Corporation shall thereupon cease, Merger LLC shall continue as the
surviving entity (the "Surviving Company") and all of the rights and
obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this Agreement shall be deemed
the rights and obligations of the Surviving Company. The effects of the
Subsequent Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable
provisions of the LLC Act. Immediately following the completion of the
Subsequent Merger, the Articles of Organization and Operating Agreement of the
Surviving Company shall be as mutually agreed by Parent and the Company prior
to filing the Joint Proxy Statement with the SEC.

  

  

(b) The Merger and Subsequent Merger, taken together as a single integrated
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and along with the other
transactions effected pursuant to this Agreement, are intended to be treated
for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a "reorganization" under Section
368(a) of the Code (to which each of Parent and the Company are to be parties
under Section 368(b) of the Code) in which the Company is to be treated as
merging directly with and into Parent, with the Company Common Stock converted
in such merger into the right to receive the consideration provided for
hereunder. This Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" within
the meaning of Treasury Regulation Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a).

  

  

(c) Each of the Parties hereto shall, and shall cause its affiliates to, treat
the Merger and Subsequent Merger for all Tax purposes consistent with Section
1.3(b) unless required to do otherwise by applicable Law.

  

  

ARTICLE 2

  

  

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

  

  

2.1 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of any of the following securities:

  

  

(a) Conversion of Common Stock. Subject to Section 2.2, each share of common
stock, par value $2.50 per share, of the Company (a "Share" or collectively,
the "Shares") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(c) and other
than Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into the right to receive (i)
$21.20 in cash, without interest (the "Cash Consideration"), and (ii) 0.8382
(the "Exchange Ratio") of a share of validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock (the "Stock Consideration" and,
together with the Cash Consideration, the "Merger Consideration").

  

  

(b) Effect on Common Stock. At the Effective Time, all of the Shares shall
cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each
certificate (a "Certificate") formerly representing any of the Shares (other
than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(c) and other than
Dissenting Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration and any other amounts as provided in Section 2.2, in each
case without interest, subject to compliance with the procedures for surrender
of such Shares as set forth in Section 2.2.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock. All Shares that are
held in the treasury of the Company or owned of record by any Company
Subsidiary and all Shares owned of record by Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries shall be cancelled immediately
prior to the Effective Time and shall cease to exist, with no payment being
made with respect thereto.

  

  

(d) Merger Sub Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into and become one newly and validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(e) Merger Consideration Adjustment. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Company
Common Stock or the securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of
Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class by reason of any
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares, readjustment, or
other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or stock distribution thereon
shall be declared with a record date within said period, the Merger
Consideration and the Exchange Ratio and any other similarly dependent items,
as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of
Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such event.

  

  

(f) Total Stock Consideration Adjustment. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, if the Total Stock Consideration is less than 40% of
the aggregate Base Merger Consideration, then the Exchange Ratio shall be
increased (with a corresponding reduction in the Cash Consideration) to the
extent necessary so that the Total Stock Consideration is equal to 40% of the
aggregate Base Merger Consideration (the "Adjustment"). The Adjustment made
pursuant to this Section 2.1(f) shall be made as follows: for each 0.0001
increase to the Exchange Ratio, there will be a corresponding decrease to the
Cash Consideration in the amount of the product of 0.0001 multiplied by the
Parent Signing Share Price.

  

  

2.2 Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates.

  

  

(a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with a
nationally recognized financial institution designated by Parent and
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit
of the holders of Shares, for exchange in accordance with this Article 2,
certificates representing the full number of shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable pursuant to Section 2.1 in exchange for outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall provide or shall cause
to be provided to the Exchange Agent in immediately available funds all of the
cash necessary to pay the cash portion of the Merger Consideration, and shall,
after the Effective Time on the appropriate payment date, if applicable,
provide or cause to be provided to the Exchange Agent any dividends or other
distributions payable on such shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
Section 2.2(c) (such shares of Parent Common Stock and cash provided to the
Exchange Agent, together with any dividends or other distributions with
respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). For
the purposes of such deposit, Parent shall assume that there will not be any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock. Parent shall make available to the
Exchange Agent, for addition to the Exchange Fund, from time to time as
needed, cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance
with Section 2.2(e). The cash component of the Exchange Fund shall be invested
by the Exchange Agent, as directed by Parent, in short-term obligations of the
United States of America with maturities of no more than 30 days, pending
payment thereof by the Exchange Agent to the holders of Shares pursuant to
this Article 2. The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, deliver the Parent Common Stock and cash contemplated to be
issued pursuant to Section 2.1 out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any other purpose.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Procedures for Surrender. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record
of a Certificate or non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry ("Book-
Entry Shares"), in each case whose Shares were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this
Agreement: (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and shall
otherwise be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration issuable and payable in respect thereof, and any dividends or
other distributions to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section
2.2(c). Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent
or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, and upon
delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with
respect to such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such other documents as
may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the amount of cash and the number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock (which shall be in non-certificated book-entry form unless a physical
certificate is requested) into which each Share formerly represented by such
Certificates and each Book-Entry Share was converted pursuant to Section
2.1(a) and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as set
forth in Section 2.2(e), including any dividends or other distributions to
which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and the
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Until such time as
the Merger Consideration is issued to or at the direction of the holder of a
surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, such Parent Common Stock shall
not be voted on any matter. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
payment may be made and Merger Consideration may be issued to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if
such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate so surrendered or shall establish to the satisfaction of Parent
that such Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be paid. Payment
of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be
made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.
Subject to the last sentence of Section 2.2(c), until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration into which the Shares theretofore
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share having been converted
pursuant to Section 2.1(a). No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash
payable upon surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) Dividends. No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid
to the holder of any Certificate formerly representing Company Common Stock or
any Book-Entry Share with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable upon surrender thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional
shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.2(e) until the
surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this
Article 2. Subject to applicable Law, following surrender of any such
Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the shares of Parent Common
Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly after the
time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional
share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.2(e) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such
whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to
such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common
Stock.

  

  

(d) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares. As of the close of
business on the date of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration
of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company. The Merger Consideration
issued (and paid) in accordance with the terms of this Article 2 upon
conversion of any Shares shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares (other than the
right to receive dividends or other distributions, if any, in accordance with
Section 2.2(c)). From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or
by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  

(e) Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Shares pursuant
to Section 2.1, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a holder of Parent Common Stock. For
purposes of this Section 2.2(e), all fractional shares to which a single
record holder would be entitled shall be aggregated and calculations shall be
rounded to three decimal places. In lieu of any such fractional shares, each
holder of Shares who would otherwise be entitled to such fractional shares
shall be entitled to an amount in cash, without interest, rounded down to the
nearest cent, equal to the product of (A) the amount of the fractional share
interest in a share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
under Section 2.1(a) (or would be entitled but for this Section 2.2(e)) and
(B) an amount equal to the average of the closing sale prices of the Parent
Common Stock on the NYSE as reported in the Wall Street Journal for each of
the twenty consecutive trading days ending with the fifth complete trading day
prior to the Closing Date (not counting the Closing Date). As soon as
practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid
to holders of Shares in lieu of any fractional share interests in Parent
Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts, without
interest, to the holders of Shares entitled to receive such cash.

  

  

(f) Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability. At any time
following nine months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall be
entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any portion of the
Exchange Fund (including any interest received with respect thereto) not
disbursed to holders of Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled
to look only to the Surviving Company (subject to abandoned property, escheat
or other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger
Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Shares and compliance with
the procedures set forth in Section 2.2(b), and any dividends or distributions
with respect to Parent Common Stock as contemplated by Section 2.2(c), in each
case, without interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving
Company nor the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Share for
Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  

  

(g) Withholding Rights. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the
Surviving Company and the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares, Company Options,
Restricted Stock or RSUs, as applicable, such amounts that Parent, Merger Sub,
the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any other provision of applicable Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the
Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares,
Company Options, Restricted Stock, or RSUs, as applicable, in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

8  

  

 

 

 

  

(h) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger Consideration and
any unpaid dividends or other distributions payable or deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that Parent may, in its
reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such
Merger Consideration, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent with
respect to the Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  

  

2.3 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held
by a holder who is entitled to demand and has properly demanded appraisal for
such Shares in accordance with, and who complies with, Sections 5/11.65 and
5/11.70 of the IBCA (such Shares, "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section
2.1(a), and shall instead represent the right to receive payment of the
consideration due to the holder of Dissenting Shares, to the extent available,
in accordance with Section 5/11.70 of the IBCA. Upon consummation of the
Merger, the Dissenting Shares shall cease to be issued and outstanding and the
holders thereof shall be entitled to receive such consideration as will be
determined under Section 5/11.70 of the IBCA. If any such holder fails to
perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses his right to appraisal under
Section 5/11.65 of the IBCA or other applicable Law, then such Dissenting
Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into,
and to have become exchangeable solely for, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(a) and any unpaid dividends or other
distributions payable or deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to Section
2.2(c), in each case without interest. The Company shall serve prompt notice
to Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any Shares,
and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to, or settle, offer to settle or compromise, any such
demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

  

  

2.4 Treatment of Company Options, Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units,
Stock Plans.

  

  

(a) Treatment of Options. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or,
if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions and
take all other actions necessary and appropriate to provide that, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase Shares (the
"Company Options"), under the Nicor Inc. 1989 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as
amended, the Nicor Inc. 1997 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended, the 2006
Long Term Incentive Plan, as amended, or any other Company Benefit Plan
providing for the issuance of such options (collectively, the "Company Equity
Plans"), shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each former holder of
any such cancelled Company Option shall be entitled to receive, in
consideration of the cancellation of such Company Option and in settlement
therefor, a payment in cash of an amount equal to the product of (i) the total
number of Shares previously subject to such Company Option and (ii) the
excess, if any, of the Cash-Out Amount over the exercise price per Share
previously subject to such Company Option (such amounts payable hereunder, the
"Option Payments"), subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable
Law to be withheld in accordance with Section 2.2(g). From and after the
Effective Time, any such cancelled Company Option shall no longer be
exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall only entitle such holder
to the payment of the Option Payment.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

9  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Treatment of Restricted Stock. Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each unvested Share subject to forfeiture restrictions, repurchase rights or
other restrictions under the Company Equity Plans ("Restricted Stock") shall
vest in full, and all restrictions (including forfeiture restrictions or
repurchase rights) otherwise applicable to such Restricted Stock shall lapse
and the Restricted Stock shall be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without interest, as provided in Section 2.1(a), subject
to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law to be withheld in
accordance with Section 2.2(g).

  

  

(c) Restricted Stock Units. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
contractual right to receive a Share at a future date granted pursuant to the
Company Equity Plans, the Nicor Inc. Stock Deferral Plan, any other plan,
agreement or arrangement of the Company or any Company Subsidiary ("RSU") that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then
vested, shall be cancelled and in exchange therefor, each former holder of any
such cancelled RSU shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of the
cancellation of such RSU and in settlement therefor, an amount in cash equal
to the Cash-Out Amount multiplied by the number of Shares subject to such RSU
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, with such cash payable under
the terms of the RSU, subject to any withholding of Taxes required by
applicable Law to be withheld in accordance with Section 2.2(g).

  

  

(d) Termination of Company Equity Plans. After the Effective Time, all Company
Equity Plans shall be terminated and no further Company Options, Restricted
Stock, RSUs or other rights with respect to Shares shall be granted
thereunder.

  

  

(e) Parent Funding. At the Effective Time, Parent shall make a cash
contribution to the Surviving Company in immediately available funds to permit
the Surviving Company to make the payments required under this Section 2.4.

  

  

2.5 Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The current offerings in
progress as of the date hereof under the Nicor Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(the "ESPP") shall continue, and shares of Company Common Stock shall be
issued to participants thereunder on the next currently scheduled purchase
dates occurring after the date hereof as provided under, and subject to the
terms and conditions of, the ESPP. In accordance with the terms of the ESPP,
any offering in progress as of the Effective Time shall be shortened, and the
Business Day immediately preceding the Effective Time shall be the price date
and purchase date for the ESPP (the "New Price Date"). Each then outstanding
option under the ESPP shall be deemed exercised automatically on such New
Price Date. Notwithstanding any restrictions on transfer of stock in the ESPP,
the treatment in the Merger of any Shares under this provision shall be in
accordance with Section 2.1(a). The Company shall terminate the ESPP as of or
prior to the Effective Time.

operation of its properties or assets or the conduct of its business requires
such qualification or license, except where the failure to be so qualified,

and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

  

  

(b) The Company has made available to Parent, prior to the date hereof, true

(f) The Company or another Company Subsidiary owns, directly or indirectly,
all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or other Equity
Interests of each of the Company Subsidiaries, free and clear of any Liens
(other than transfer and other restrictions under applicable federal and state

directly or indirectly any Equity Interest in any Person, or has any
obligation to acquire any such Equity Interest, or to provide funds to or make
any investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in,
any Company Subsidiary or any other Person. There are no outstanding
obligations to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party (i)

3.3 Authority.

the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, subject to receipt
of the Company Shareholder Approval and any regulatory approvals referenced in
Sections 3.5(d), 3.5(e) and 3.5(f). The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the

validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by Parent, Merger Sub and Merger LLC, constitutes the
legally valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms, except that (i) such enforcement may be
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar Laws, now or
hereafter in effect, affecting creditors' rights generally and (ii) the remedy

correct, no other state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation
applies or purports to apply to the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(c) The affirmative vote of the holders of shares representing a majority of
the voting power of the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock
entitled to vote at the Company Shareholder Meeting is the only vote required
of the holders of any class or series of capital stock or other Equity
Interests of the Company to approve and adopt this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger (the "Company
Shareholder Approval").

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

13

respective properties or assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
pursuant to, any Contract to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a
party or by which any of their respective properties or assets are bound or
any Company Permit, except, with respect to clauses (b) and (c), for any such
conflicts, violations, consents, breaches, losses, changes of control,

Material Adverse Effect or (ii) prevent or materially delay the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

performance of this Agreement by the Company, or the consummation by the
Company of the Merger, Subsequent Merger or any other transaction contemplated
by this Agreement will require (with or without notice or lapse of time, or
both) any consent, approval, declaration, authorization or permit of, or

(a) The Company and each Company Subsidiary is in possession of all
authorizations, licenses, permits, franchises, grants, consents,
qualifications, permissions, certificates, variances, exemptions, approvals,
orders, registrations and clearances of any Governmental Entity necessary for
the Company and each Company Subsidiary to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets, and to carry on and operate its businesses as currently
conducted (the "Company Permits"), except where the failure to have, or the
suspension or cancellation of, or the failure to be in full force and effect
of, any Company Permits, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
All Company Permits are valid and in full force and effect, except where the
failure to be in full force and effect would not be reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company and each Company Subsidiary is in compliance in all respects with the
terms and requirements of such Company Permits, except where the failure to be
in compliance would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(b) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is in conflict with,
default under or violation of, any Law applicable to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or by which any property or asset of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is bound or affected, except for any conflicts, defaults or
violations that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the
knowledge of the Company, no investigation by any Governmental Entity with
respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary is pending, nor has any
Governmental Entity indicated to the Company an intention to conduct any such
investigation, except for such investigations, the outcomes of which if
determined adversely to the Company or any Company Subsidiary, individually or
in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

3.8 Internal Controls. The Company has established and maintains a system of
internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) intended to provide reasonable assurances
regarding the reliability of financial reporting for the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries. The Company has designed disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act)
to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by the Company in
the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC's rules and forms, and that all such material information is accumulated
and communicated to the Company's management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The
Company's management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the
Company's internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended
December 31, 2009, and such assessment concluded that such controls were
effective. Based on its most recent evaluation of internal controls prior to
the date hereof, the Company has disclosed to the Company's auditors and the
audit committee of the Company Board (i) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any
material respect the Company's ability to report financial information and
(ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Company's internal controls over
financial reporting, and each such deficiency, weakness and fraud so disclosed
to auditors, if any, has been disclosed to Parent prior to the date hereof.

Company, or the consummation by the Company of the Merger, Subsequent Merger
or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement will require (with or

(d) Since December 31, 2009, to the knowledge of the Company, the Intellectual

reasonably be expected to result in the abandonment, cancellation or
unenforceability of any such Intellectual Property, except for such conflicts,
infringements, violations, interferences, claims, invalidity, abandonments,

3.20 Tax Treatment. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has taken
any action or failed to take any action or knows of any fact, agreement, plan

Subsidiaries and their respective properties and assets, and are in character
and amount at least equivalent to that carried by persons engaged in similar
businesses and subject to the same or similar perils or hazards, except for

FERC regulation as a "natural gas company" pursuant to the Natural Gas Act
(the "NGA") sections 1(b) and/or 1(c), 15 U.S.C. §§ 717 (b), (c). Under FERC
regulation, the Nicor Gas section 1(c) exemption also exempts the Company from
FERC PUHCA 2005 regulation. In addition, Nicor Gas holds a blanket certificate
pursuant to 18 C.F.R. § 284.224 authorizing Nicor Gas to provide certain

(b) Nicor Gas is regulated as a "gas company" under the Illinois Statutes.

  

  

(c) Central Valley Gas Storage, L.L.C., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company is also regulated as a "gas corporation" under Section 222 of the
California Public Utilities Code and as a "public utility" under Section 216
of the California Public Utilities Code. Central Valley Gas Storage, L.L.C. is
developing a natural gas storage facility that will qualify as an "intrastate
pipeline" and/or a "Hinshaw pipeline" exempt from FERC regulation under NGA
sections 1(b) and/or 1(c), 15 U.S.C. §§ 717 (b), (c).

  

  

(d) Except for (i) the regulation of the Company by FERC as a holding company
of a single state holding company system under PUHCA 2005, (ii) the regulation
of Nicor Gas by FERC as a "local distribution company" and/or a "Hinshaw
pipeline" transporting natural gas in interstate commerce under the NGA, (iii)
the regulation of Nicor Gas Company by the ICC, and (iv) the regulation of
Central Valley Gas Storage, L.L.C. by the California Public Utilities
Commission as a "gas corporation" and a "public utility" under the California
Public Utilities Code, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is
subject to regulation as a public utility or public service company (or
similar designation) by any state in the United States having jurisdiction
over them or their respective properties or assets. In addition, neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary is subject to regulation as a public
utility by FERC under Section 201(e) of the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. §

3.26 No Additional Representations. The Company has undertaken an independent
review and analysis of the business, operations, assets, liabilities, results
of operations, financial condition and prospects of Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries. The Company acknowledges that in entering into this Agreement,
the Company relied solely upon its independent investigation and analysis and
the representations and warranties of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries set
forth in Section 4 and none of Parent, Merger Sub or Merger LLC makes any
representation or warranty as to any matter whatsoever except as expressly set
forth in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by Parent, Merger Sub
or Merger LLC to the Company in accordance with the terms hereof, and
specifically (but without limiting the generality of the foregoing) that none
of Parent, Merger Sub or Merger LLC makes any representation or warranty with
respect to (a) any projections, estimates or budgets delivered or made
available to the Company (or any of their respective affiliates, officers,
directors, employees or Company Representatives) of future revenues, results
of operations (or any component thereof), cash flows or financial condition
(or any component thereof) of Parent and its Subsidiaries or (b) the future
business and operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries. Absent fraud, Parent,
the Parent Subsidiaries, and their respective affiliates, shareholders and
members, and the Parent Representatives shall have no liability or
responsibility based upon any information provided or made available or
statements made or omissions therefrom to the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries or the Company Representatives, except as and only to the extent

Letter).

Parent and each Parent Subsidiary is in compliance in all respects with the
terms and requirements of such Parent Permits, except where the failure to be

no investigation by any Governmental Entity with respect to Parent, Merger
Sub, Merger LLC or any other Parent Subsidiary is pending, nor has any

applicable, all registration statements, prospectuses, forms, reports,
definitive proxy statements, schedules and other documents required to be

pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (such documents and any other documents
filed by Parent with or furnished by Parent to the SEC, together with any
supplements, modifications and amendments thereto since the time of filing
through the date hereof, collectively, the "Parent SEC Documents" and such
documents and any other documents filed by any Parent Subsidiary Issuer with
or furnished by any Parent Subsidiary Issuer to the SEC, together with any
supplements, modifications and amendments thereto since the time of filing,
collectively, the "Parent Subsidiary SEC Documents"). As of their respective
filing dates and, if supplemented, modified or amended since the time of
filing, as of the date of such supplement, modification or amendment, the
Parent SEC Documents and the Parent Subsidiary SEC Documents (i) did not at
the time each such document was filed, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and (ii) complied in
all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act or
the Securities Act, as the case may be, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Except for

required to file any forms or reports with the SEC.

interim financial statements, for normal and recurring year-end adjustments
and as may be permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q, Form 8-K or any successor or
like form under the Exchange Act) and (iii) fairly present in all material
respects the consolidated financial position and the consolidated results of
operations, cash flows and changes in shareholders' equity of Parent and the
consolidated Parent Subsidiaries as of the dates and for the periods referred
to therein (except, in the case of interim financial statements, for normal
and recurring year-end adjustments as may be permitted by the SEC on Form
10-Q, Form 8-K or any successor or like form under the Exchange Act).

  

 

 

 

  

 

33  

  

 

 

 

  

  

4.8 Internal Controls. Parent has established and maintains a system of
internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) intended to provide reasonable assurances
regarding the reliability of financial reporting for Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries. Parent has designed disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material information required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it
files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms,
and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to
Parent's management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Parent's management has
completed an assessment of the effectiveness of Parent's internal controls
over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2009, and such
assessment concluded that such controls were effective. Based on its most
recent evaluation of internal controls prior to the date hereof, Parent has
disclosed to Parent's auditors and the audit committee of the Parent Board (i)
any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably
likely to adversely affect in any material respect Parent's ability to report

commitment letter, dated December 6, 2010 (the "Commitment Letter") from the
lenders party thereto (collectively, the "Lenders") relating to the commitment
of the Lenders to provide the debt financing required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The debt financing required to

Merger LLC under the terms and conditions of the Commitment Letter, other than
any such default or breach that has been waived by the Lenders or otherwise
cured in a timely manner by Parent, Merger Sub or Merger LLC to the

in or contemplated by the Commitment Letter. As of the date hereof, Parent,
Merger Sub and Merger LLC do not have any reason to believe that any
conditions of the Financing will not be satisfied or that the Financing will
not be available to Parent, Merger Sub or Merger LLC at the Effective Time.

fees or other fees required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Commitment

in the Merger by Parent is fair, from a financial point of view, to Parent.

  

  

4.22 Brokers. Except for Parent's obligations to Goldman Sachs and Co, Parent's
financial advisor, pursuant to an engagement letter, a copy of which has been

directors, officers, employees or affiliates, has incurred or will incur on
behalf of Parent, Merger Sub, Merger LLC or any other Parent Subsidiary, any
brokerage, finders', advisory or similar fee in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

4.23 Trading. Parent has established risk parameters, limits and guidelines
(including position limits and limitations on working capital and VaR) in
compliance with the risk management policy approved by the Parent (the "Parent
Trading Guidelines") to restrict the level of risk that Parent and the non-
utility Parent Subsidiaries are authorized to take with respect to, among
other things, the net position resulting from all physical commodity
transactions, exchange-traded futures and options transactions, over-the-
counter transactions and derivatives thereof and similar transactions (the
"Net Parent Position") and monitor compliance by Parent and the non-utility
Parent Subsidiaries with such Parent Trading Guidelines. Parent has provided a
copy of the Parent Trading Guidelines to the Company prior to the date of this
Agreement. At no time between September 30, 2010 and the date hereof, (a) has
the Net Parent Position not been within the risk parameters in all material
respects that are set forth in the Parent Trading Guidelines, or (b) has the
exposure of Parent and the non-utility Parent Subsidiaries with respect to the
Net Parent Position resulting from all such transactions been material to
Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries taken as a whole. From September 30, 2010

under Section 368(a) and related provisions of the Code;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  

(xvi) except as required by applicable Law, make any changes or propose any
changes in its rates or charges, standards of service or regulatory accounting
from those in effect on the date of this Agreement, or make any filing to
change its rates on file with the ICC, or any other applicable state utility

expected to cause the return on equity in respect of the Company's regulated
business to be materially lower than the return on equity which the Company is
authorized to receive in respect of such regulated business and (B) which

materially increase the risk of not obtaining any Company Required

Effect;

with past practice, terminate the Company Trading Guidelines; provided, that
in the case of any such termination, new Company Trading Guidelines are
adopted that are at least as restrictive as the Company Trading Guidelines in
effect on the date hereof or take any action that violates the Company Trading
Guidelines or cause or permit the Net Company Position to be outside the risk
parameters set forth in the Company Trading Guidelines (other than as a result
of movement in market prices); and if at any time the Net Company Position
becomes outside the risk parameters set forth in the Company Trading
Guidelines due to a move in market prices then action will be taken to bring
the Net Company Position back inside the parameters as is required by the
Company Trading Guidelines;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

  

(xix) enter into any Contract that would materially restrain, limit or impede

necessary) that would constitute a material violation of any order or
regulation of any Governmental Entity governing the Company's and Company
Subsidiaries' operations; or

  

  

(xx) enter into any Contract or commit to do or authorize any of the
foregoing.

agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), Parent
will, and will cause each Parent Subsidiary to, (i) conduct its operations
only in the ordinary course of business and (ii) use its commercially
reasonable efforts to preserve substantially intact its business organization.

Parent Disclosure Letter or as permitted by any other provision of this
Agreement or as required by applicable Law or the regulations and requirements
of the NYSE, Parent shall not, and Parent shall not permit any Parent

exchangeable securities, other than the issuance of Parent Common Stock or

Parent Subsidiary in the ordinary course of business, consistent with past
practice and in amounts not in excess of the aggregate amounts set forth on
Section 5.1(b)(ii) of the Parent Disclosure Letter;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

49

(whether payable in cash, stock, property or a combination thereof) with
respect to any of its shares of capital stock (other than (A) regular
quarterly cash dividends paid by Parent in a manner and per share amount
consistent with past practice (including normal course increases consistent
with past practice), with usual declaration, record and payment dates and in a
manner consistent with Parent's past dividend policy or (B) dividends paid by
a wholly-owned Parent Subsidiary to Parent or another wholly-owned Parent
Subsidiary) or enter into any agreement with respect to the voting or
registration of its Equity Interests;

of, or redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, any of
its Equity Interests;

assets in the ordinary course of business and other acquisitions for
consideration not exceeding, individually or in the aggregate, an amount equal

whole; as reflected in the most recent balance sheet included in the Parent
Financial Statements, provided that such other acquisitions do not conflict
with Parent's obligations pursuant to Section 5.6(a) and otherwise would not
present a material risk of preventing or materially delaying the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

  

(vii) incur any indebtedness for borrowed money or issue any debt securities,
or assume or guarantee the obligations of any Person (other than a wholly-
owned Parent Subsidiary) for borrowed money, except if taking such action

Parent, whether prior to or after giving effect to the Merger, the Subsequent
Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, as determined by any
nationally recognized credit agency, to fall below investment grade;

  

  

(viii) make any change in accounting policies or procedures, other than as

operations;

  

  

(xi) take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any action or
fail to cause any action to be taken (including any action or failure to act

the extent such termination, lapse or failure to apply for renewal would not
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect;

in a manner that results in such Parent Trading Guidelines being materially
less restrictive than the Parent Trading Guidelines in effect on the date
hereof taking into account any amendment or modification necessary to reflect
increases in trading volume in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice, and the gas purchase requirements of the Golden Triangle
Storage project, or, other than in the ordinary course of business consistent

5.2 Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement; Shareholder
Meetings.

  

  

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, Parent and the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the
Joint Proxy Statement in preliminary form and Parent shall file with the SEC
the Form S-4, in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a
prospectus. Subject to Section 5.4, the Joint Proxy Statement shall include
the Company Board Recommendation and the Parent Board Recommendation. Each of
Parent and the Company shall cooperate in the preparation and filing of the
Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement and shall provide the other with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such documents prior to their
filing with the SEC. Each of Parent and the Company shall use their best
efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing and to keep the Form S-4
effective as long as necessary to consummate the Merger and the Subsequent
Merger. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company's shareholders, and Parent shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be
mailed to Parent's shareholders, in each case, as promptly as practicable
after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act. Each of
Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to
be delivered to the other a "comfort letter" of its independent auditors,
dated the date that is two (2) Business Days prior to the date on which the
Form S-4 becomes effective. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the
Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement will be made by Parent or the Company,
as applicable, without the other's prior written consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and without providing the other
the reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. Parent or the
Company, as applicable, will advise the other promptly after it receives oral
or written notice of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective or any
supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the
suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any
oral or written request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement
or the Form S-4 or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the
SEC for additional information, and will promptly provide the other with
copies of any written communication from the SEC or any state securities
commission.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to
Parent or the Company, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or
directors, is discovered by Parent or the Company that should be set forth in
an amendment or supplement to either the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement
so that either such document would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the Party that
discovers such information shall as promptly as practicable notify the other
Party and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information
shall be filed with the SEC as promptly as practicable after the other Party
has had a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, and, to the
extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the respective shareholders
of Parent and the Company, as applicable. The Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy
Statement will comply as to form and substance in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and other
applicable Law, including the regulations and requirements of the NYSE.

  

  

(c) In addition to their obligations pursuant to Section 5.2(a) and Section
5.2(b), Parent and the Company shall make all necessary filings with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereunder, including the Merger, the
Subsequent Merger and the Share Issuance, under the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act and applicable Blue Sky Laws, including but not limited to filing
of a Form S-8 covering the Parent Common Stock to be held by any Company
Benefit Plans following the Effective Time, and each of Parent and the Company
shall furnish all information concerning it and its shareholders as may
reasonably be requested by the other Party for purposes of making such
filings. Each of Parent and the Company shall make available to each other
copies of such filings.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

  

(d) The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable following
effectiveness of the Form S-4, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Company Shareholder Meeting for the purpose of seeking the Company Shareholder
Approval. Subject to Section 5.4, the Company Board shall recommend that the
Company's shareholders adopt and approve this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger (the "Company Board
Recommendation"), and the Company shall, unless there has been a Change of
Company Board Recommendation, use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from
its shareholders proxies in favor of the approval and adoption of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and
to take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the Company
Shareholder Approval.

  

  

(e) Parent shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable following
effectiveness of the Form S-4, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its shareholders for the purpose of seeking the Parent Shareholder
Approval (as such meeting may be validly adjourned or postponed, the "Parent
Shareholder Meeting"). Subject to Section 5.5, the Parent Board shall
recommend that Parent's shareholders approve the Share Issuance and the
Charter Amendment (the "Parent Board Recommendation"), and Parent shall,
unless there has been a Change of Parent Board Recommendation, use its
reasonable best efforts to solicit from its shareholders proxies in favor of
the Share Issuance and the Charter Amendment and take all other action
necessary or advisable to secure the Parent Shareholder Approval. Other than
as expressly permitted by Section 5.5 in connection with a Parent Superior
Proposal, the Parent Board shall not, nor publicly propose to, withhold,
withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withhold, withdraw, amend,
modify or qualify the Parent Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to the
Company, or make any public statement in connection with such Parent Board
Recommendation that is inconsistent with the Parent Board Recommendation (any
such actions and/or actions described in clauses (iv) or (v) of Section 5.5(a)
being a "Change of Parent Board Recommendation"). Nothing contained in this
Section 5.2(e) shall prohibit the Parent Board from making any disclosure to
Parent's shareholders if the Parent Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to make such
disclosure would reasonably be determined to be inconsistent with applicable
Law. Notwithstanding any Change of Parent Board Recommendation, unless this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the obligations of the
Parties hereunder shall continue in full force and effect.

  

  

(f) Each of the Company and Parent will work together in an effort to hold the
Company Shareholder Meeting and the Parent Shareholder Meeting, respectively,
on the same date as the other Party.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54

Representatives") to: (i) provide to Parent, Merger Sub and Merger LLC and
their respective directors, officers, employees, accountants, consultants,
legal counsel, advisors, agents and other representatives (collectively, the

such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the operation of any
business conducted by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, upon reasonable
advance notice to the Company, to the officers, employees, properties, offices
and other facilities of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and to the
books, contracts and records thereof (including Tax Returns) and (ii) furnish
promptly such information concerning the business, properties, contracts,
assets and liabilities of the Company and Company Subsidiaries as Parent or
the Parent Representatives may reasonably request; provided, however, that the
Company shall not be required to (or to cause any Company Subsidiary to)
afford such access or furnish such information to the extent that the Company
believes that doing so would: (A) result in the loss of attorney-client
privilege (provided that the Company shall use its reasonable efforts to allow
for such access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in a loss of
attorney-client privilege), (B) result in the disclosure of any trade secrets
of third parties or violate any obligations of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary with respect to confidentiality to any third party or otherwise
breach, contravene or violate any then effective Contract to which the Company
or any Company Subsidiary is party, (C) result in a competitor of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary receiving information that is competitively
sensitive or (D) breach, contravene or violate any applicable Law (including
the HSR Act or any other antitrust or competition Law). Parent agrees to
indemnify and hold the Company and Company Subsidiaries harmless from any and
all claims and liabilities, including related costs and expenses, resulting
from the action of any Parent Representative or any information provided to
such Parent Representatives pursuant to this Section 5.3(a).

  

  

(b) From the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, Parent shall, and
shall cause each Parent Subsidiary and each Parent Representative to: (i)
provide to the Company and the Company Representatives reasonable access
during normal business hours in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably
with the operation of any business conducted by Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary, upon reasonable advance notice to Parent, to the officers,
employees, properties, offices and other facilities of Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries and to the books, contracts and records thereof (including Tax
Returns) and (ii) furnish promptly such information concerning the business,
properties, contracts, assets and liabilities of Parent and Parent
Subsidiaries as the Company or the Company Representatives may reasonably
request; provided, however, that Parent shall not be required to (or to cause
any Parent Subsidiary to) afford such access or furnish such information to
the extent that Parent believes that doing so would: (A) result in the loss of
attorney-client privilege (provided that Parent shall use its reasonable
efforts to allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that does not
result in a loss of attorney-client privilege), (B) result in the disclosure
of any trade secrets of third parties or violate any obligations of Parent or
any Parent Subsidiary with respect to confidentiality to any third party or
otherwise breach, contravene or violate any then effective Contract to which
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is party, (C) result in a competitor of Parent
or any Parent Subsidiary receiving information that is competitively sensitive
or (D) breach, contravene or violate any applicable Law (including the HSR Act
or any other antitrust or competition Law). The Company agrees to indemnify
and hold Parent and Parent Subsidiaries harmless from any and all claims and
liabilities, including related costs and expenses, resulting from the action
of any the Company Representative or any information provided to such Company
Representatives pursuant to this Section 5.3(b).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) With respect to the information disclosed pursuant to Sections 5.3(a) and
5.3(b), Parent shall comply with, and shall cause each Parent Subsidiary and
each Parent Representative to comply with and the Company shall comply with
and shall cause each Company Representative to comply with, all of their
respective obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement dated October 1,
2010 and the Confidentiality Agreement dated November 3, 2010, in each case,
by and between the Company and Parent (collectively, the "Confidentiality
Agreements").

(a) Subject to Section 5.4(b), from and after the date hereof until the
Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with Article 7, the Company agrees that neither it nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries shall, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Company Representatives not to (and each shall not authorize or give
permission to the Company Representatives to), directly or indirectly: (i)
initiate, solicit, seek, induce or intentionally encourage or facilitate, any
inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal involving the
Company or any Significant Company Subsidiary, or engage in any discussions or

Agreement, enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations with any Person (other than Parent and Merger Sub) with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) furnish any information regarding the
Company or any Significant Company Subsidiaries to, or afford access to the
properties, books and records of the Company to, any Person (other than Parent
and Merger Sub) in connection with or in response to an Acquisition Proposal,
(iv) approve, endorse or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, endorse or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal involving the Company, (v) withhold,
withdraw, qualify, amend or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, or publicly
propose to withdraw, qualify, amend or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent,
the Company Board Recommendation, (vi) enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other similar agreement constituting, or relating to, any
Acquisition Proposal or requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to
consummate the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or (vii) resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing (any action
set forth in the foregoing clauses (iv)-(v), a "Change of Company Board
Recommendation"). Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any
violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.4(a) by the Company
or any Significant Company Subsidiary shall be deemed to be a breach of this
Section 5.4(a) by the Company. The Company shall, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries and the Company Representatives to, immediately cease and cause
to be terminated any and all activities, discussions or negotiations with any
Persons conducted prior to the date hereof by the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries or any of the Company Representatives with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal involving the Company or a Company Subsidiary. Not later
than the 45th day after the date hereof, the Company shall request each Person
that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with
its consideration of any Acquisition Proposal to return or destroy all
confidential information furnished prior to the execution of this Agreement to
or for the benefit of such Person by or on behalf of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary; provided, that if the Company shall have provided Parent
the notice specified in Section 5.4(d)(iii)(A) with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal prior to the 45th day after the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall not be required to request that the Person making the Acquisition
Proposal return or destroy all such confidential information during the period
that the Company is considering such Acquisition Proposal.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

The Company agrees that it will promptly inform the Company Representatives of
the obligations undertaken in this Section 5.4.

  

  

Nothing in this Section 5.4 shall restrict the Company or any Company
Subsidiary from making any acquisition that is otherwise permitted by Section
5.1(a)(vii).

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.4(a), if
at any time following the date hereof and prior to the Company securing the
Company Shareholder Approval (i) the Company has received an unsolicited, bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal involving the Company or any Significant
Company Subsidiary that did not result from a breach of this Section 5.4 and
(ii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal, then the
Company may then take the following actions: (A) furnish information with
respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal and its representatives and (B) participate in
discussions or negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal
and its representatives regarding such Acquisition Proposal; provided, that
the Company (x) will not, and will not allow the Company Subsidiaries and the
Company Representatives to, disclose any information to such Person without
first entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (y) will as
promptly as practicable provide to Parent any material information concerning
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries provided or made available to such
other Person (or its representatives) which was not previously provided or
made available to Parent.

  

  

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Sections
5.4(a), (b) and (d) hereof, as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any
event within 24 hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any
request for nonpublic information or any request or inquiry relating in any
way to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal, the Company shall provide Parent with notice of the material terms
and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and the
identity of the Person making any such Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry and a copy of all written materials provided to it in connection with
such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry. In addition, the Company shall
provide Parent as promptly as practicable (and in any event within one
Business Day) with all information as is reasonably necessary to keep Parent
reasonably informed of all material developments and any changes to the
economic or other material terms of, any such Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry, and shall provide, as promptly as reasonably practicable, to Parent
(i) a copy of all material written materials (including material written
materials provided by email or otherwise in electronic format) provided by or
to the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or the Company Representatives
making or materially amending, modifying or supplementing such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry, or (ii) if oral, a reasonably detailed summary
of the terms of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry and any material
amendment, modification or supplementation thereof.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.4(a), the
Company Board may, in response to a Superior Proposal, terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(f)(ii) and concurrently enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, if all of the
following conditions are met, as applicable: (i) such Superior Proposal has
been made and has not been withdrawn and, taking into account any revised
terms offered by Parent, continues to constitute a Superior Proposal; (ii) the
Company Shareholder Approval has not theretofore been obtained; (iii) the
Company has (A) initially provided to Parent five Business Days' prior written
notice which shall state expressly (1) that it has received an Acquisition
Proposal that it has determined or is prepared to determine constitutes a
Superior Proposal, (2) the material terms and conditions of the Superior
Proposal (including the consideration offered therein and the identity of the
Person making the Superior Proposal), and shall have contemporaneously
provided a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements making such
Superior Proposal and other material documents, including the definitive
agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal (the "Alternative Acquisition
Agreement") (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the
financial terms or any other material term of such Superior Proposal shall
require a notice and a new period of (x) 72 hours, or (y) solely in the event
Parent notifies the Company that it has reasonably and in good faith
determined that it would be prudent to seek and will seek rating agency review
prior to modifying or amending the terms of this Agreement, a total of five
Business Days (which, for the avoidance of doubt, is inclusive of, rather than
in addition to, the 72 hours set forth in clause (x)) and (3) that it intends
to terminate this Agreement, and (B) prior to terminating this Agreement, to
the extent requested by Parent, engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent
to amend this Agreement in such a manner that the Alternative Acquisition
Agreement ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal; (iv) the Company shall not
have breached any of the provisions set forth in this Section 5.4 in any
material respect; and (v) in advance of or concurrently with such termination,
the Company pays the Company Termination Fee.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

 

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.4(a), the
Company Board may make a Change of Company Board Recommendation (other than in
connection with the Company terminating this Agreement to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement pursuant to Section 5.4(d)) if it determines
in good faith after consultation with its outside counsel that the failure to
effect a Change of Company Board Recommendation would constitute a breach of
its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company under applicable Law;
provided, that (i) the Company has provided Parent five Business Days' prior
written notice advising Parent that it intends to effect a Change of Company
Board Recommendation and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons for the
Change of Company Board Recommendation and (ii) during such five Business Day
period, if requested by Parent, the Company engages in good faith negotiations
with Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement in a manner that obviates the
need for the Change of Company Board Recommendation.

  

  

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 5.4 shall prohibit the Company Board
from (i) disclosing to the shareholders of the Company a position contemplated
by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated
under the Exchange Act; or (ii) making any disclosure to the shareholders of
the Company if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure would
constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company
under applicable Law (for the avoidance of doubt, it being agreed that the
issuance by the Company or the Company Board of a "stop, look and listen"
statement pending disclosure of its position, as contemplated by Rules 14d-9
and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, shall not constitute a Change
of Company Board Recommendation).

  

  

5.5 Parent No Solicitation of Transactions; Change of Parent Board
Recommendation.

  

  

(a) Subject to Section 5.5(b), from and after the date hereof until the
Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with Article 7, Parent agrees that neither it nor any of the Parent
Subsidiaries shall, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Parent Representatives not to (and each shall not authorize or give permission
to the Parent Representatives to), directly or indirectly: (i) initiate,
solicit, seek, induce or intentionally encourage or facilitate, any inquiries
or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal involving Parent or any
Significant Parent Subsidiary, or engage in any discussions or negotiations
with respect thereto, (ii) except as expressly permitted by this Agreement,
enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations with any Person (other than the Company) with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) furnish any information regarding Parent or any
Significant Parent Subsidiaries to, or afford access to the properties, books
and records of Parent to, any Person (other than the Company) in connection
with or in response to an Acquisition Proposal, (iv) approve, endorse or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve, endorse or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal involving Parent, (v) withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend
or modify, in a manner adverse to the Company, or publicly propose to
withdraw, qualify, amend or modify, in a manner adverse to the Company, the
Parent Board Recommendation, (vi) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum
of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or
other similar agreement constituting, or relating to, any Acquisition Proposal
or requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (vii) resolve or agree
to do any of the foregoing. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that
any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.5(a) by Parent
or any Significant Parent Subsidiary shall be deemed to be a breach of this
Section 5.5(a) by Parent. Parent shall, and shall cause the Parent
Subsidiaries and the Parent Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any and all activities, discussions or negotiations with any
Persons conducted prior to the date hereof by Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries
or any of the Parent Representatives with respect to any Acquisition Proposal
involving Parent or a Parent Subsidiary.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

  

Parent agrees that it will promptly inform the Parent Representatives of the
obligations undertaken in this Section 5.5.

  

  

Nothing in this Section 5.5 shall restrict Parent or any Parent Subsidiary
from making any acquisition that is otherwise permitted by Section 5.1(b)(vi).

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.5(a), if
at any time following the date hereof and prior to Parent securing the Parent
Shareholder Approval (i) Parent has received an unsolicited, bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal involving Parent or any Significant Parent Subsidiary
that did not result from a breach of this Section 5.5 and (ii) the Parent
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors
and outside counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is
reasonably likely to result in a Parent Superior Proposal, then Parent may
then take the following actions: (A) furnish information with respect to
Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal and its representatives and (B) participate in discussions or
negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and its
representatives regarding such Acquisition Proposal; provided, that Parent (x)
will not, and will not allow the Parent Subsidiaries and the Parent
Representatives to, disclose any information to such Person without first
entering into a confidentiality agreement that contains provisions restricting
such Person that are no less favorable in the aggregate to Parent than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and (y) will as promptly as
practicable provide to the Company any material information concerning Parent
or the Parent Subsidiaries provided or made available to such other Person (or
its representatives) which was not previously provided or made available to
the Company.

  

  

(c) In addition to the obligations of Parent set forth in Sections 5.5(a), (b)
and (d) hereof, as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within
24 hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for
nonpublic information or any request or inquiry relating in any way to, or
that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, Parent
shall provide the Company with notice of the material terms and conditions of
such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and the identity of the Person
making any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry and a copy of all
written materials provided to it in connection with such Acquisition Proposal,
request or inquiry. In addition, Parent shall provide the Company as promptly
as practicable (and in any event within one Business Day) with all information
as is reasonably necessary to keep the Company reasonably informed of all
material developments and any changes to the economic or other material terms
of, any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and shall provide, as
promptly as reasonably practicable, to the Company (i) a copy of all material
written materials (including material written materials provided by email or
otherwise in electronic format) provided by or to Parent, any of the Parent
Subsidiaries or the Parent Representatives making or materially amending,
modifying or supplementing such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, or
(ii) if oral, a reasonably detailed summary of the terms of such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry, and any material amendment, modification or
supplementation thereof.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

60  

  

 

 

 

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.5(a), the
Parent Board may, in response to a Parent Superior Proposal, terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(e)(ii) and concurrently enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Parent Superior Proposal, if all of
the following conditions are met, as applicable: (i) such Parent Superior
Proposal (A) has been made and has not been withdrawn, and (B) continues to
constitute a Parent Superior Proposal; (ii) either (A) such Parent Superior
Proposal requires or conditions the consummation of the Acquisition Proposal
on Parent's termination of this Agreement or (B) after ten Business Days'
prior written notice, during which period Parent shall have engaged in good
faith negotiations with the Company and the other Person to enable the
consummation of both the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such
Acquisition Proposal, (1) the Company and Parent have not reached agreement
and amended this Agreement to permit Parent to pursue such Parent Superior
Proposal in accordance with its terms, and (2) the Company has not waived
those breaches of this Agreement that would result if Parent entered into a
Parent Alternative Acquisition Agreement or consummated a Parent Superior
Proposal, in order to permit Parent to pursue such Parent Superior Proposal in
accordance with its terms, without adverse consequence to Parent, Merger Sub
or Merger LLC hereunder; provided that such ten Business Day period shall (x)
only be imposed one time with respect to any Person that makes such an
Acquisition Proposal, and (y) run concurrently with any other applicable
notice period under this Section 5.5(d); (iii) the Parent Shareholder Approval
has not theretofore been obtained; (iv) Parent has (A) initially provided to
the Company five Business Days' prior written notice which shall state
expressly (1) that it has received an Acquisition Proposal that it has
determined or is prepared to determine constitutes a Parent Superior Proposal,
(2) the material terms and conditions of the Parent Superior Proposal
(including the consideration offered therein and the identity of the Person
making the Parent Superior Proposal), and shall have contemporaneously
provided a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements making such
Parent Superior Proposal and other material documents, including the
definitive agreement with respect to such Parent Superior Proposal (the
"Parent Alternative Acquisition Agreement") (it being understood and agreed
that any amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of such
Parent Superior Proposal shall require a notice and a new period, which shall
be 72 hours instead of five Business Days) and (3) that it intends to
terminate this Agreement, and (B) prior to terminating this Agreement, to the
extent requested by the Company, engaged in good faith negotiations with the
Company to amend this Agreement in such a manner that the Parent Alternative
Acquisition Agreement ceases to constitute a Parent Superior Proposal or
enables the consummation of both the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and such Acquisition Proposal; (v) the Parent Board has determined
in good faith, after consultation with its legal counsel, that, in light of
such Parent Superior Proposal and taking into account any revised terms
offered by the Company, the failure to terminate this Agreement and enter into
the Parent Alternative Acquisition Agreement would reasonably be expected to
constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; (vi) Parent
shall not have breached any of the provisions set forth in this Section 5.5 in
any material respect; and (vii) in advance of or concurrently with such
termination, Parent pays the Parent Termination Fee.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

61  

  

 

 

 

  

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 5.5 shall prohibit the Parent Board from
(i) disclosing to the shareholders of Parent a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the
Exchange Act; or (ii) making any disclosure to the shareholders of Parent if
the Parent Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure would constitute a breach of
its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of Parent under applicable Law (for
the avoidance of doubt, it being agreed that the issuance by Parent or the
Parent Board of a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its
position, as contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act, shall not constitute a Change of Parent Board Recommendation).

  

  

5.6 Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings.

  

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
the Company and Parent shall cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts
(subject to, and in accordance with, applicable Law) to take, or cause to be
taken, all appropriate action and do, or cause to be done, and to assist the
other Party in doing all things necessary, proper or advisable on its part
under applicable Law or otherwise to (i) consummate and make effective, the
Merger, the Subsequent Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as practicable, (ii) obtain from any Governmental
Entities any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations
or orders required to be obtained by Parent or the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, or to avoid any action or proceeding by any
Governmental Entity (including, those in connection with the HSR Act, the NGA,
PUHCA 2005 and the Illinois Statutes), in connection with the authorization,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) cause the satisfaction of all
conditions set forth in Article 6, (iv) resolve all lawsuits or other legal,
regulatory or other governmental proceedings to which it is a party
challenging or affecting this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case until the issuance
of a final, non-appealable order, (v) seek to have lifted or rescinded any
injunction or restraining order which may adversely affect the ability of the
Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case until
the issuance of a final, non-appealable order, and (vi) as promptly as
practicable, and in any event within 60 days after the date hereof, make or
cause to be made all necessary applications and filings, and thereafter make
any other required submissions, and pay any fees due in connection therewith,
with respect to this Agreement and the Merger and Subsequent Merger required
under the HSR Act and the Illinois Statutes and any other applicable Law;
provided, that the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other in
connection with determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing
with, any Governmental Entity is required in connection with the consummation
of the Merger and the Subsequent Merger and seeking any such actions,
consents, approvals or waivers or making any such filings. The Company and
Parent shall furnish to each other all information required for any
application or other filing under the rules and regulations of any applicable
Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No
Party to this Agreement shall consent to any voluntary delay of the Closing at
the behest of any Governmental Entity without the consent of the other Parties
to this Agreement, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned. Parent shall not, except as may be consented to in writing by
the Company, directly or indirectly through one or more of its affiliates,
seek to acquire or acquire any regulated gas distribution utility (x) in the
State of Illinois or (y) in any other jurisdiction, if such acquisition would
present more than a de minimis risk of materially delaying or materially
increasing the risk of any of the Parties hereto not obtaining the approval of
the ICC with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Company and Parent will consult with each other prior to agreeing to any
merger requirements sought by any Governmental Entity, to the extent permitted
under applicable Law. Nothing in this Section 5.6 shall obligate Parent or the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to take any action that is not
conditioned on the Closing.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

62  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) The Company and Parent shall give (or shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and use, and cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use, their commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any third party consents (i) necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the Merger, the Subsequent Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) disclosed in the Company Disclosure
Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable; provided, however that
the Company and Parent shall coordinate and cooperate in determining whether
any actions, consents, approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from
parties to any Company Real Property Leases and Company Scheduled Contracts in
connection with the consummation of the Merger or the Subsequent Merger and in
seeking any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers. In the event that
either Party shall fail to obtain any third party consent described in this
Section 5.6(b), such Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, and
shall take any such actions reasonably requested by the other Party hereto, to
minimize any adverse effect upon the Company and Parent, their respective
Subsidiaries, and their respective businesses resulting, or which could
reasonably be expected to result, after the Effective Time, as applicable,
from the failure to obtain such consent.

  

  

(c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section 5.6,
each Party hereto shall: (i) give the other Parties prompt notice of the
making or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal
proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger,
the Subsequent Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (ii) keep the other Parties informed as to the status of any such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding; and (iii)
promptly inform the other Parties of any communication to or from the Federal
Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, FERC, the ICC or any other
Governmental Entity regarding the Merger or the Subsequent Merger. Each Party
hereto will consult and cooperate with the other Parties and will consider in
good faith the views of the other Parties in connection with any filing,
analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or
proposal made or submitted in connection with the Merger, the Subsequent
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any
Law, in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or
legal proceeding, each Party hereto will permit authorized representatives of
the other Parties to be present at each meeting or conference relating to such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding and to have access
to and be consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made
or submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

63  

  

 

 

 

  

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or Merger Sub,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the
Company prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
complete unilateral control and supervision over its business operations.

  

  

5.7 Certain Notices. From and after the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, each Party hereto shall promptly notify the other Party hereto
of (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event that would be likely to
cause any condition to the obligations of any Party to effect the Merger, the
Subsequent Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement not
to be satisfied or (b) the failure of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or
Merger LLC, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this
Agreement which would reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the
obligations of any Party to effect the Merger, the Subsequent Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied;
provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section
5.7 shall not cure any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the
remedies available hereunder to the Party receiving such notice.

  

  

5.8 Public Announcements. Each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and Merger
LLC agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be issued by any Party without the prior written
consent of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as such release or announcement may
be required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable
United States securities exchange or Governmental Entity to which the relevant
Party is subject, in which case the Party required to make the release or
announcement shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow each other
Party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of
such issuance. The Company, Parent, Merger Sub and Merger LLC agree that the
press release announcing the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be
a joint release of, and shall not be issued prior to the approval of each of,
the Company and Parent.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

 

  

5.9 Employee Benefit Matters.

  

  

(a) For a period of one year following the Effective Time (the "Benefit
Protection Period"), Parent shall either (i) assume and maintain, or cause the
Parent Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Company, to assume and maintain,
for the benefit of the employees of the Company and Company Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Company Employees"), the Company
Benefit Plans (other than the Company Equity Plans and the ESPP) at the
benefit levels in effect on the date of this Agreement and provide or cause
the Parent Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Company, to provide
compensation and benefits to each Company Employee under the Company Benefit
Plans or other employee benefit plans or compensation arrangements of Parent
or any of the Parent Subsidiaries that have a value sufficient to replace the
value of the compensation and benefits provided to such Company Employee under
the Company Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time taking into
account the value of equity based compensation, or (ii) provide or cause the
Parent Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Company, to provide compensation
and benefits to each Company Employee that, taken as a whole (including equity
based compensation), is not less favorable in the aggregate than the
compensation and benefits provided to such Company Employee immediately prior
to the Effective Time.

  

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.9(a), from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries,
including the Surviving Company, to, assume, honor and continue without
amendment during the Benefit Protection Period or, if sooner, until all
obligations thereunder have been satisfied, all of the Company's employment,
severance, retention and termination plans, policies, programs, agreements and
arrangements (including any change in control or severance agreement between
the Company and any Company Employee), in each case, as in effect at the
Effective Time, including with respect to any payments, benefits or rights
arising as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either
alone or in combination with any other event), without any amendment or
modification, other than any amendment or modification required to comply with
applicable Law or as consented to by the parties thereto.

  

  

(c) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.9(a), the Surviving Company
and its Subsidiaries shall be permitted to make payments to Company Employees
pursuant to annual cash incentive plans with respect to the annual performance
period in which the Effective Time occurs upon the terms and conditions
consistent with the terms of the annual cash incentive plans as in effect on
the date hereof, or such future plans as may be established by the
compensation committee of the Company Board, consistent with the parameters
set forth on Section 5.9(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter, for annual
performance periods commencing after the date hereof, which such future plans
shall be consistent with the Company's and the Company Subsidiaries' business
plans and past practice.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

65  

  

 

 

 

  

(d) With respect to any "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA, maintained by Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries, including the
Surviving Company (including any vacation, paid time-off and severance plans),
for all purposes, including determining eligibility to participate, level of
benefits, vesting, benefit accruals and early retirement subsidies, each
Company Employee's service with the Company or any Company Subsidiary (as well
as service with any predecessor employer of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, to the extent service with the predecessor employer is recognized
by the Company or such Company Subsidiary) shall be treated as service with
Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Company;
provided, however, that such service need not be recognized to the extent that
such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits.

  

  

(e) Parent shall, or shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries, including the
Surviving Company, to waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively at work requirements and waiting periods
under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of the Parent
Subsidiaries in which Company Employees (and their eligible dependents) will
be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time, except to the
extent that such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-
work requirements and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived
under the comparable Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Parent shall, or shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries, including the
Surviving Company, to recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar amount
of all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each Company
Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in
which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such year's
deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans
in which such Company Employee (and dependents) will be eligible to
participate from and after the Effective Time.

  

  

5.10 Takeover Laws. If any "control share acquisition", "fair price",
"business combination" or other state takeover statute or similar Law becomes
or is deemed to be applicable to the Merger, including the acquisition of
Shares pursuant thereto, the Subsequent Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, then the Company Board or the Parent Board, as
applicable, shall take all action reasonably available to it (i) to render
such Law inapplicable to the foregoing and (ii) to ensure that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms required by, or provided for, in this Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on the Merger, the Subsequent
Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby .

5.11 Indemnification of Directors and Officers.

  

  

(a) For a period beginning at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Company shall
indemnify and hold harmless all former and current directors, officers and
employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to the same extent such
Persons are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the Company
pursuant to applicable Law, the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws, the
articles of incorporation and bylaws, or equivalent organizational or
governing documents, of any Company Subsidiary, and indemnification
agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this Agreement with any
directors, officers and employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
arising out of acts or omissions in their capacity as directors, officers or
employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time; provided, however, that Parent agrees, and Parent will
cause the Surviving Company to, indemnify and hold harmless such persons to
the fullest extent permitted by Law for acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Parent and the Surviving Company shall
advance expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in
the defense of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation with
respect to the matters subject to indemnification pursuant to this Section
5.11 in accordance with the procedures and limitations set forth in the
Company Charter, the Company Bylaws, the articles of incorporation and bylaws,
or equivalent organizational documents, of any Company Subsidiary, and
indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this
Agreement; provided, however, that the director, officer or employee to whom
expenses are advanced undertakes to repay such advanced expenses to Parent and
the Surviving Company if it is ultimately determined that such director,
officer or employee is not entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
Section 5.11(a). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at
or after the Effective Time) is made against such persons with respect to
matters subject to indemnification hereunder on or prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 5.11(a)
shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation.

  

  

(b) For not less than six years from and after the Effective Time, the
governing documents of the Surviving Company shall contain provisions no less
favorable with respect to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of
expenses of directors, officers and employees of the Company for periods at or
prior to the Effective Time than are currently set forth in the Company
Charter and the Company Bylaws. The indemnification agreements, if any, in
existence on the date of this Agreement with any of the directors, officers or
employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be assumed by the
Surviving Company, without any further action, and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms following the Effective Time.

  

  

(c) For the benefit of the Company's directors and officers, as of the date of
this Agreement and as of the Effective Time, the Company shall be permitted,
prior to the Effective Time, to obtain and fully pay the premium for an
insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for a period of
six years from and after the Effective Time for events occurring prior to the
Effective Time (the "DandO Insurance") that is substantially equivalent to and
in any event not less favorable in the aggregate than the Company's existing
policy (true and complete copies which have been previously provided to
Parent) or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the
best available coverage; provided, however, that the annual premium payable by
the Company for any such policy shall not exceed 250% of the last annual
premium paid by the Company for comparable director and officer insurance
coverage prior to the date of this Agreement but in such case may purchase as
much coverage as is available for such amount. If the Company is unable to
purchase such DandO Insurance prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Company
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, as of the Effective
Time, obtain and fully pay the premium for DandO Insurance that is substantially
equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in the aggregate than the
Company's existing policy (true and complete copies which have been previously
provided to Parent) or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is
unavailable, the best available coverage; provided, however, that the
Surviving Company shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO
Insurance in excess of 250% of the last annual premium paid by the Company for
comparable director and officer insurance coverage prior to the date of this
Agreement, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as is available
for such amount. The Surviving Company shall maintain such policies in full
force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder for a
period of not less than six years from and after the Effective Time.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

67  

  

 

 

 

  

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Company (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
company or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper
provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving company or entity
or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 5.11.

  

  

(e) The obligations under this Section 5.11 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any former or current
directors, officers and employees of the Company to whom this Section 5.11
applies without the consent of such affected Person (it being expressly agreed
that the persons to whom this Section 5.11 applies are express third party
beneficiaries of this Section 5.11).

  

  

(f) In the event of any breach by the Surviving Company or Parent of this
Section 5.11, the Surviving Company or Parent shall pay all reasonable
expenses, including attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by any former or
current directors, officers and employees of the Company in enforcing the
indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 5.11 as such fees are
incurred upon the written request of such person.

in accordance with applicable Law and the articles of incorporation and bylaws
of Merger Sub and the articles of organization and operating agreement of

68  

  

 

 

 

  

5.13 Financing.

  

  

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the
Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter,
including (i) taking actions to enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter
and (ii) using its reasonable best efforts to (A) negotiate definitive
agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained therein
or on other terms no more adverse to the Company in any material respect, (B)
satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub
in such definitive agreements and (C) consummate the Financing at or prior to
the Effective Time. Parent will furnish correct and complete copies of all
such definitive agreements to the Company promptly upon their execution.
Parent and Merger Sub shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current
basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to complete the
Financing.

  

  

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall not agree to any amendment,
replacement, supplement or other modification of, or waive any of its rights
under or consent to the assignment of, the Commitment Letter or any definitive
agreements related to the Financing, in each case, without the Company's prior
written consent, including any such amendment, replacement, supplement or
other modification to or assignment or waiver of any provision of the
Commitment Letter that amends, supplements or otherwise modifies the
conditions precedent to the Financing; provided, however, that (i) Parent may
terminate and replace the Commitment Letter with a New Commitment Letter or
(ii) Parent may amend the Commitment Letter solely to add lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not
executed the Commitment Letter as of the date hereof so long as (x) the
addition of such lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or
similar entities would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(y) the Arranger (as defined in the Commitment Letter) shall remain obligated
and committed to fund its financing commitments under the Commitment Letter
(as in effect prior to any such amendment) on the terms and conditions of, and
subject to the assignment provisions set forth in, the Commitment Letter (as
in effect prior to any such amendment). Upon any such amendment, replacement,
supplement or modification of the Commitment Letter in accordance with this
Section 5.13(b), the term "Commitment Letter" shall mean the Commitment Letter
as so amended, supplemented or modified in accordance with this Section
5.13(b) or any New Commitment Letter in replacement of the Commitment Letter,
as the case may be, and, in the event that Parent or Merger Sub obtains
Alternative Financing in accordance with Section 5.13(c), the term "Commitment
Letter" shall mean the commitment letter (as amended, replaced, supplemented
or modified in accordance with this Section 5.13(b)) related to the
Alternative Financing. The term "New Commitment Letter" shall mean the
instrument replacing the existing Commitment Letter that (A) is on terms no
less beneficial to Parent and its Subsidiaries (after giving effect to the
Merger and Subsequent Merger) than those set forth in the Commitment Letter,
including as to permitted dividends and the impact of the Financing
contemplated thereby on Parent's credit rating; (B) does not involve any
conditions precedent to funding the Financing that are not contained in the
Commitment Letter; and (C) would not reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

69  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) In the event any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
and conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter (as such terms may be
modified or adjusted in accordance with the terms of, and within the limits
of, the "flex" provisions contained in the Commitment Letter or accompanying
fee letter) for any reason, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable but no later
than the Initial Outside Date (or, if applicable, the Extended Outside Date),
financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that would not (i) involve any
conditions to funding the Financing that are not contained in the Commitment
Letter; (ii) reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (iii)
include terms that would be materially adverse when compared to the terms of
the Commitment Letter (an alternative financing meeting the foregoing
requirements shall be an "Alternative Financing"). In the event that
Alternative Financing shall be obtained pursuant to this Section 5.13(c),
Parent and Merger Sub shall comply with the covenants in Section 5.13(b) with
respect to such Alternative Financing.

  

  

(d) Parent and Merger Sub shall give the Company prompt written notice of any
material breach by any party of the Commitment Letter (or commitments for any
Alternative Financing obtained in accordance with this Section 5.13) of which
Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware, any termination of the Commitment Letter
(or commitments for any Alternative Financing obtained in accordance with this
Section 5.13) or any condition precedent of the Financing (or any Alternative
Financing obtained in accordance with this Section 5.13) which Parent and
Merger Sub have any reason to believe will not be satisfied at the Effective
Time, as applicable.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

70  

  

 

 

 

  

(e) At Parent's request, the Company shall, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries and the Company Representatives to, at Parent's sole expense, use
its and their reasonable best efforts to (x) cooperate with Parent to complete
the Financing (or any Alternative Financing) and any other financing or
refinancing transactions undertaken by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to the
extent that information relating to, or the participation by members of
management of, the Company is reasonably necessary in connection therewith;
and (y) provide all information and assistance that is customarily provided in
financings comparable to the proposed Financing or such other financing or
refinancing transaction, as the case may be. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Company shall (i) furnish to Parent as promptly as
practicable, upon Parent's request from time to time, all Required Financial
Information; (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to Parent, as
promptly as reasonably practicable, other information with respect to the
Company reasonably requested by Parent in writing so that Parent may satisfy
the applicable SEC requirements for a public capital markets offering as set
forth on Section 5.13(e) of the Parent Disclosure Letter (to the extent such
matters set forth on such Section 5.13(e) of Parent Disclosure Letter are
consistent with SEC requirements); (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to
furnish to Parent, as promptly as reasonably practicable, information relating
to the Company reasonably requested by Parent in writing (including such
requests made after the provision of the Required Financial Information) that

documents or rating agency, lender presentations or road shows relating to
such financing, including the Company Financial Statements and budgets; (iv)
upon reasonable advance notice (which notice shall not be less than three

town travel), participate in a reasonable number of investor presentations,
road shows, due diligence sessions and rating agency presentations in
connection with such financing; (v) assist with the preparation, including
upon reasonable advance notice (subject to the parenthetical in clause (iv)
above) participating in a reasonable number of drafting sessions, of one
confidential information memorandum, offering memorandum or other offering
document, (including any amendments or supplements thereto and an additional
version of any confidential information memorandum for use by "public-side"
lenders) in connection with any such financing; (vi) request required consents
of accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to any such
financing where the inclusion of such reports is necessary and the delivery of
customary comfort letters and customary representation letters; (vii) use its
reasonable best efforts to facilitate pledging collateral in connection with
any debt portion of the Financing from and after the Closing as may be
reasonably requested by Parent (provided that any obligations contained in
such documents shall be effective no earlier than as of the Closing); (viii)
take such corporate actions (subject to the occurrence of the Closing) as are
reasonably necessary to complete any such financing; (ix) refrain from
syndicating or issuing, attempting to syndicate or issue, announcing or
authorizing the announcement of the syndication or issuance of, or engaging in
discussions concerning the syndication or issuance of, any debt facility or
any debt or equity security of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries, except
as set forth in Section 5.13(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter and (x) use
reasonable best efforts to facilitate the execution and delivery (at the
Closing) of definitive documents related to the Financing. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.13(e) shall require the cooperation or
participation of the Company to the extent it would unreasonably interfere
with the business or operations of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or
otherwise unreasonably interfere with the prompt and timely discharge by the
Company's or any Company Subsidiary's employees of their normal duties.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the
Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall (A) be required to bear any
cost or expense or to pay any commitment or other similar fee or make any
other payment in connection with the Financing or any of the foregoing prior
to the Effective Time, and Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company,

expressly contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in this Agreement shall require the Company Board to take any action
to approve the Financing, the Alternative Financing or any other financing in
connection with the Merger or Subsequent Merger. Parent and Parent
Subsidiaries shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and each of their respective officers, directors, employees,
agents, representatives, successors and assigns from and against any and all
damages, fees, costs and expenses suffered or incurred by them other than
those liabilities, damages, fees, costs and expenses arising out of a material
misstatement in or failure to state a material fact pertinent to the
information provided by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to this Section
5.13(e), in connection with the arrangement of the Financing (or any
Alternative Financing) or the use of any offering documents contemplated by
this Section 5.13.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

71  

  

 

 

 

  

(f) All non-public or other confidential information provided by the Company
pursuant to Section 5.13(e) shall be kept confidential in accordance with
Section 5.3 and the Confidentiality Agreement, except that Parent shall be

under the Exchange Act).

derivative securities) pursuant to this Agreement shall be an exempt
transaction under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Company
and Parent shall provide copies of such resolutions to counsel to the other
Party.

the Subsequent Merger, taken together as a single integrated transaction for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, and along with the other transactions

its best efforts to cause the Merger and the Subsequent Merger, taken together
as a single integrated transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and
along with the other transactions effected pursuant to this Agreement, to be
treated, for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a "reorganization" under
Section 368(a) of the Code (to which each of Parent and the Company are to be
parties under Section 368(b) of the Code) in which the Company is to be
treated as merging directly with and into Parent, with the Company Common

could reasonably be expected to prevent or impede the Merger and the
Subsequent Merger, taken together as a single integrated transaction for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, and along with the other transactions effected

of (a) the 12 current directors of the Parent Board and (b) four directors
designated by the Company, subject to the approval of Parent, not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, (each, a "Company Designee"). At the first
annual meeting of Parent following the Closing, Parent shall nominate each of
the Company Designees, and use reasonable efforts to cause each Company
Designee, to be reelected to the Parent Board. Parent shall also take all
actions as may be reasonably necessary to cause, as of the Effective Time, at

5.22 Dividends. Each of Parent and the Company shall coordinate with the other
regarding the declaration and payment of dividends in respect of Parent Common
Stock and Company Common Stock and the record dates and payment dates relating

Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall receive two dividends, or
fail to receive one dividend, for any single calendar quarter (or portion
thereof) with respect to its shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common
Stock, as the case may be, and/or any shares of Parent Common Stock any holder
of Company Common Stock receives pursuant to the Merger. For the avoidance of
doubt, it is the Parties' intent that (i) the first quarterly dividend paid to
the holders of Parent Common Stock (including former holders of Company Common
Stock) following the Effective Time shall be paid in accordance with Parent's
dividend policy, to be adopted immediately after the Effective Time, and in no
event later than the first record date for the payment of dividends after the

declaration and payment of dividends prior to the Effective Time and Parent
shall coordinate the declaration and payment of its dividends after the
Effective Time.

reasonable best efforts to provide each notice required, as a consequence of
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, by any
Contract to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party, where
failure to provide such notice would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

have been obtained (including, in each case, the expiration or termination of
any applicable waiting period, together with any extensions thereof, under the
HSR Act) at or prior to the Effective Time, such approvals shall have become
Final Orders and such Final Orders shall not, individually or in the
aggregate, include or impose any Material Adverse Term. For purposes of this
section, a "Final Order" means an action by the relevant Governmental Entity
that has not been reversed, stayed, enjoined, set aside, annulled or
suspended, with respect to which any waiting period prescribed by Law before
the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated has expired, and as to
which all conditions to the consummation of such transactions prescribed by
Law have been satisfied.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

76  

  

 

 

 

  

(e) Form S-4. The Form S-4 shall have become effective under the Securities
Act, and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Form S-4 shall have
been issued and no proceedings for that purpose shall have been initiated by
the SEC.

  

  

6.2 Additional Conditions to Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub. The
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to effect the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated herein are also subject to the satisfaction (unless
waived by Parent or Merger Sub) on or prior to the Effective Time of the
following conditions:

  

  

(a) Representations and Warranties. Each of the representations and warranties
of the Company contained in this Agreement shall be true and correct as of the
date hereof and as of the Effective Time as though made on and as of the
Effective Time (except that those representations and warranties that address
matters only as of a particular date need only be true and correct as of such
date); provided, however, that the condition in this Section 6.2(a) shall be
deemed to be satisfied so long as any failure of such representations and
warranties to be true and correct has not, individually or in the aggregate,
had a Company Material Adverse Effect (without regard to materiality or
Company Material Adverse Effect qualifiers contained within such
representations and warranties). The representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in Sections 3.2(a), 3.2(b), 3.2(c), 3.2(d) and 3.3(a) shall
be true and correct in all material respects as of the date of this Agreement
and as of the Effective Time as though made on and as of the Effective Time
(except that those representations and warranties that address matters only as
of a particular date need only be true and correct in all material respects as
of such date). Parent shall have received a certificate signed by the Chief
Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer of the Company to that effect.

  

  

(b) Agreements and Covenants. The Company shall have performed or complied in
all material respects with all agreements, obligations and covenants required
by this Agreement to be performed or complied with by it on or prior to the
Effective Time.

  

  

(c) Material Adverse Effect. Since the date of this Agreement, there shall not
have occurred any Company Material Adverse Effect or any event or development
that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result
in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(d) Tax Opinion. Parent shall have received an opinion of Dewey and LeBoeuf LLP
dated as of the Closing Date, to the effect that, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes: (i) the Merger and the Subsequent Merger, taken together as a single
integrated transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and along with
the other transactions effected pursuant to this Agreement, will constitute a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and (ii) the
Company and Parent will each be a party to that reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code. In rendering such opinion, Dewey and
LeBoeuf LLP may rely upon representations contained herein and may receive and
rely upon representations from Parent, the Company and others, including
representations from Parent in the Parent Tax Certificate and representations
from the Company in the Company Tax Certificate, in each case, that are
reasonably satisfactory to Dewey and LeBoeuf LLP.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

77  

  

 

 

 

  

6.3 Additional Conditions to Obligations of the Company. The obligations of
the Company to effect the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
herein are also subject to the satisfaction (unless waived by the Company) on
or prior to the Effective Time of the following conditions:

  

  

(a) Representations and Warranties. Each of the representations and warranties
of Parent, Merger Sub and Merger LLC contained in this Agreement shall be true
and correct as of the date hereof and as of the Effective Time as though made
on and as of the Effective Time (except that those representations and
warranties that address matters only as of a particular date need only be true
and correct as of such date); provided, however, that the condition in this
Section 6.3(a) shall be deemed to be satisfied so long as any failure of such
representations and warranties to be true and correct has not, individually or
in the aggregate, had a Parent Material Adverse Effect (without regard to
materiality or Parent Material Adverse Effect qualifiers contained within such
representations and warranties). The representations and warranties of Parent
set forth in Sections 4.2(a), 4.2(b), 4.2(c), 4.2(d) and 4.3 shall be true and
correct in all material respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of
the Effective Time as though made on and as of the Effective Time (except that
those representations and warranties that address matters only as of a
particular date need only be true and correct in all material respects as of
such date). The Company shall have received a certificate signed by the Chief
Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer of Parent to that effect.

  

  

(b) Agreements and Covenants. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and Merger LLC shall
have performed or complied in all material respects with all agreements,
obligations and covenants required by this Agreement to be performed or
complied with by it on or prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

(c) Material Adverse Effect. Since the date of this Agreement, there shall not
have occurred any Parent Material Adverse Effect or any event or development
that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result
in a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(d) Tax Opinion. The Company shall have received an opinion of Latham and
Watkins LLP, dated as of the Closing Date, to the effect that, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes: (i) the Merger and the Subsequent Merger, taken
together as a single integrated transaction for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, and along with the other transactions effected pursuant to this
Agreement, will constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code and (ii) the Company and Parent will each be a party to
that reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code. In
rendering such opinion, Latham and Watkins LLP may rely upon the representations
contained herein and may receive and rely upon representations from Parent,
the Company, and others, including representations from Parent in the Parent
Tax Certificate and representations from the Company in the Company Tax
Certificate, in each case, that are reasonably satisfactory to Latham and
Watkins LLP.

further that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b),
shall not be available to any Party whose failure to fulfill any of its

failure of the Effective Time to occur on or before such date;

  

  

(c) By either the Company or Parent, if

  

  

(i) the Company Shareholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the duly
held Company Shareholder Meeting, including any adjournments thereof;
provided, however, that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 7.1(c)(i) if the Company has breached in any material respect
any of its obligations under this Agreement in any manner that could
reasonably have caused the failure to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval;
or

held Parent Shareholder Meeting, including any adjournments thereof; provided,
however, that Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section

Approval;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

79  

  

 

 

 

  

(d) By either the Company or Parent, if any court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Entity shall have issued an order or injunction or taken
any other action, in each case, permanently enjoining, restraining or
prohibiting the Merger, and such order, injunction or other action shall have
become final and nonappealable; provided, however, that the Party seeking to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(d) shall have used its
reasonable best efforts to resist, resolve or lift such order, injunction or
action, as applicable;

  

  

(e) By Parent, (i) at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder
Approval, if (A) the Company Board shall have effected a Change of Company
Board Recommendation (whether or not in compliance with Section 5.4) or (B)
the Company shall have entered into a merger agreement, letter of intent or
other similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) at any
time prior to the receipt of the Parent Shareholder Approval, if the Parent

or concurrently with such termination pay the Parent Termination Fee, to or
for the account of the Company;

  

  

(f) By the Company, (i) at any time prior to the receipt of the Parent
Shareholder Approval, if (A) the Parent Board shall have effected a Change of

Board shall have effected a Change of Parent Board Recommendation in breach of
Section 5.5 or Parent's obligations set forth in the third sentence of Section
5.2(e), or (C) Parent shall have entered into a merger agreement, letter of
intent or other similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal in
compliance with Section 5.5, or (ii) at any time prior to the receipt of the
Company Shareholder Approval, if the Company Board determines to accept a
Superior Proposal in compliance with Section 5.4(d), but only in the case of
clause (ii) if the Company shall prior to or concurrently with such
termination pay the Company Termination Fee, to or for the account of Parent;

  

  

(g) [RESERVED]

  

  

(h) By Parent, at any time prior to the Effective Time, if: (i) there has been
a breach by the Company of its representations, warranties or covenants
contained in this Agreement, in any case, such that the conditions contained
in Sections 6.2(a) or 6.2(b) are not reasonably capable of being satisfied,
(ii) Parent shall have delivered to the Company written notice of such breach,
and (iii) either such breach is not capable of cure or at least 30 days shall
have elapsed since the date of delivery of such written notice to the Company
and such breach shall not have been cured in all material respects; provided,
however, that Parent shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 7.1(h) if there has been any material breach by
either Parent or Merger Sub of its material representations, warranties or
covenants contained in this Agreement, and such breach shall not have been
cured in all material respects;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

80  

  

 

 

 

  

(i) By the Company, at any time prior to the Effective Time, if: (i) there has
been a breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any of its representations,
warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement in any case, such that the
conditions contained in Sections 6.3(a) or 6.3(b) are not reasonably capable
of being satisfied, (ii) the Company shall have delivered to Parent written
notice of such breach, and (iii) either such breach is not capable of cure or
at least 30 days shall have elapsed since the date of delivery of such written
notice to Parent and such breach shall not have been cured in all material
respects; provided, however, that the Company shall not be permitted to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(i) if there has been any
material breach by the Company of its material representations, warranties or
covenants contained in this Agreement (other than a breach solely due to a
Financing Failure), and such breach shall not have been cured in all material
respects; or

  

  

(j) By the Company or Parent, if the conditions to Closing set forth in
Section 6.1 and (i) Section 6.2 (in the case of the Company) or (ii) Section
6.3 (in the case of Parent) are satisfied (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, provided that such conditions
are reasonably capable of being satisfied) and Parent, Merger Sub or Merger
LLC are unable to satisfy their obligation to effect the Closing at such time
because of a Financing Failure; provided, however, that the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(j) shall not be available to any
Party if there has been any material breach by such Party of its
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, which
was a proximate cause of the Financing Failure.

  

  

7.2 Effect of Termination.

  

  

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 7.1,
this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and there shall be no

case of a termination by the Company, or within two Business Days thereafter,
in the case of a termination by Parent, a termination fee of $67,000,000 (the
"Company Termination Fee"); provided, however, that in the event this
Agreement is properly terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(e)(i) or Section
7.1(f)(ii) with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (as the same may be
modified, amended or supplemented) from a third party prior to the 45th day
after the date of this Agreement (or, if later, terminated on the 3rd Business
Day following the date on which Parent's most recent matching period shall
have expired with respect to the Person having made such Acquisition
Proposal), then, but only then, the Company Termination Fee shall be
$36,000,000;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

81  

  

 

 

 

  

(ii) pursuant to Section 7.1(h) due to a material breach of Section 5.4, then

advisors, accountants, experts and consultants reasonably retained by Parent,
and, in the event that within six months after such termination, the Company
shall have entered into a definitive agreement or consummated a transaction
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall pay the
Company Termination Fee (less any amounts previously paid pursuant to this
clause (b)(ii)) to Parent no later than two Business Days after the earlier of
the date that the Company enters into such definitive agreement or consummates
such transaction with respect to such Acquisition Proposal. For purposes of
this Section 7.2(b)(ii), the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall have the
meaning assigned to such term in Section 8.4, except that the references to
"20%" shall be deemed to be references to "50%" and the references to "Person"
shall be deemed to be references to "the Company or Nicor Gas";

  

  

(iii) pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(i) or Section 7.1(h) (other than as set forth
in Section 7.2(b)(ii)) and (A) prior to the Company Shareholder Meeting or the
breach giving rise to Parent's right to terminate under Section 7.1(h), an
Acquisition Proposal involving the Company shall have been made to the Company
or the Company Board or publicly disclosed and not withdrawn and (B) within
twelve months after such termination, the Company shall have entered into a
definitive agreement or consummated a transaction with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal (or any modification thereof), then the Company shall pay
the Company Termination Fee to Parent no later than two Business Days after
the earlier of the date that the Company enters into such definitive agreement
or consummates such transaction with respect to such Acquisition Proposal. For
purposes of this Section 7.2(b)(iii), the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall
have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 8.4, except that the
references to "20%" shall be deemed to be references to "50%" and the
references to "Person" shall be deemed to be references to "the Company or
Nicor Gas."

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

82  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated

  

  

(i) pursuant to Section 7.1(e)(ii) or clause (A) or (C) of Section 7.1(f)(i),
then Parent shall pay to the Company prior to or concurrently with such
termination, in the case of a termination by Parent, or within two Business
Days thereafter, in the case of a termination by the Company, a termination
fee of $67,000,000 (the "Parent Termination Fee");

  

  

(ii) pursuant to Section 7.1(i) due to a material breach of Section 5.5 or
Parent's obligations set forth in the third sentence of Section 5.2(e), then
Parent shall reimburse the Company upon demand for all documented out-of-
pocket fees and expenses incurred or paid on or on behalf of the Company in
connection with the Merger or the Subsequent Merger or related to the
authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this
Agreement, in each case including all fees and expenses of counsel, financial
advisors, accountants, experts and consultants reasonably retained by the
Company, and, in the event that within six months after such termination,
Parent shall have entered into a definitive agreement or consummated a
transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, then Parent shall pay the
Parent Termination Fee (less any amounts previously paid pursuant to this
clause (c)(ii)) to the Company no later than two Business Days after the
earlier of the date that Parent enters into such definitive agreement or
consummates such transaction with respect to such Acquisition Proposal. For
purposes of this Section 7.2(c)(ii), the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall
have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 8.4, except that the
references to "20%" shall be deemed to be references to "50%" and the
references to "Person" shall be deemed to be references to "Parent";

  

  

(iii) pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii) or Section 7.1(i) (other than as set
forth in Section 7.2(c)(ii)) and (A) prior to the Parent Shareholder Meeting
or the breach giving rise to the Company's right to terminate under Section
7.1(i), an Acquisition Proposal involving Parent shall have been made to
Parent or the Parent Board or publicly disclosed and not withdrawn and (B)
within twelve months after such termination, Parent shall have entered into a
definitive agreement or consummated a transaction with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal (or any modification thereof), then Parent shall pay the
Parent Termination Fee no later than two Business Days after the earlier of
the date that Parent enters into such definitive agreement or consummates such
transaction with respect to such Acquisition Proposal. For purposes of this
Section 7.2(c)(iii), the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall have the meaning
assigned to such term in Section 8.4, except that the references to "20%"
shall be deemed to be references to "50%" and the references to "Person" shall
be deemed to be references to "Parent";

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

83  

  

 

 

 

  

(iv) pursuant to Section 7.1(j), then Parent shall pay the Company a
termination fee of $115,000,000 (the "Financing Failure Fee" and together with
the Company Termination Fee and Parent Termination Fee, the "Termination
Fees") no later than two Business Days after such termination.

  

  

(d) In the event this Agreement is terminated:

  

  

(i) pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(i), then the Company shall reimburse Parent
upon demand for all documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred or
paid on or on behalf of Parent in connection with the Merger or the Subsequent
Merger or related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution
and performance of this Agreement, in each case including all fees and
expenses of counsel, financial advisors, accountants, experts and consultants
reasonably retained by Parent and any Termination Fee subsequently paid in
respect of such termination shall be reduced by the amount so paid;

  

  

(ii) pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii), then Parent shall reimburse the Company
upon demand for all documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred or
paid on or on behalf of the Company in connection with the Merger or the
Subsequent Merger or related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation,
execution and performance of this Agreement, in each case including all fees
and expenses of counsel, financial advisors, accountants, experts and
consultants reasonably retained by the Company and any Termination Fee
subsequently paid in respect of such termination shall be reduced by the
amount so paid.

  

  

(e) All payments under this Section 7.2 shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent or
the Company, as applicable.

  

  

(f) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that (i) the
agreements contained in this Section 7.2 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) without these
agreements, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company would not enter into this
Agreement. It is acknowledged and agreed that the Termination Fees are not a
penalty, but rather are liquidated damages representing a reasonable estimate
of the amount that would compensate the Company or Parent and Merger Sub in
the circumstances in which such Termination Fee is payable, absent an
intentional breach of this Agreement. In no event shall the Company be
required to pay to Parent more than one Company Termination Fee pursuant to
Section 7.2(b) and in no event shall Parent be required to pay to the Company
more than one Parent Termination Fee pursuant to Section 7.2(c). It is further
acknowledged and agreed that, upon payment of a Termination Fee, the paying
Party (and in the case of Parent, Merger Sub and Merger LLC) shall have no
further liability or obligation with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and the right to receive such Termination Fee
(and only such amount) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the other
Party; provided, however, in the case of an intentional breach of this
Agreement the foregoing limitation shall not apply unless the Company has
accepted a Termination Fee that was paid in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

84  

  

 

 

 

  

7.3 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub by action taken by or on behalf of their respective boards of directors at
any time prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that, after receipt
of the Company Shareholder Approval, no amendment may be made which, by Law or
in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange, requires further
approval or authorization by the Company's shareholders without such further
approval or authorization. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed by the Parties hereto.

  

  

7.4 Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub, on
the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may (a) extend the time for
the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other, (b)
waive any breach of the representations and warranties of the other contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance
by the other with any of the covenants or conditions contained herein, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law; provided, however, that after receipt of
the Company Shareholder Approval, there may not be any extension or waiver of
this Agreement which decreases the Merger Consideration or which adversely
affects the rights of the Company's shareholders hereunder without the
approval of such shareholders at a duly convened meeting of the Company's
shareholders called to obtain approval of such extension or waiver. Any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby, but such extension
or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel
with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

8.6 Headings. The headings and table of contents contained in this Agreement
are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

  

  

8.7 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy,
all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the
end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

101  

  

 

 

 

  

8.8 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits, Parent
Disclosure Letter and Company Disclosure Letter and the other documents
delivered pursuant hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreements constitute the
entire agreement of the Parties and supersede all prior agreements and
undertakings, both written and oral, among the Parties, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof and, except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, are not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights
or remedies hereunder.

  

  

8.9 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise by any of the Parties hereto without the prior
written consent of the other Parties. Any assignment in violation of the
preceding sentence shall be void.

  

  

8.10 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each Party hereto and their respective successors and
assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other than any Persons
entitled to indemnification under the provisions of Section 5.11
(Indemnification of Directors and Officers), with respect to such provisions,
who shall be entitled to enforce their rights under this Agreement as third-
party beneficiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) following the
Effective Time, the provisions of Article 2 shall be enforceable by the
holders of Certificates; and (ii) the Financing Sources are hereby made third
party beneficiaries of Sections 8.12(b), 8.12(c) and 8.15. Sections 8.12(b),
8.12(c) and 8.15 of this Agreement (and the related definitions and other
provisions of this Agreement to the extent a modification or waiver or
termination would serve to modify the substance or provisions of such
Sections) may not be modified, waived or terminated in a manner that impacts
or is adverse in any material respect to the Financing Sources without the
prior written consent of the Arranger (as defined in the Commitment Letter),
on behalf of the Financing Sources, and shall survive any termination of this
Agreement.

  

  

8.11 Mutual Drafting; Interpretation. Each Party hereto has participated in
the drafting of this Agreement, which each Party acknowledges is the result of
extensive negotiations between the Parties. If an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires: the
singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine gender
shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender shall
include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall include
masculine and feminine genders. As used in this Agreement, the words "include"
and "including," and variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of
limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement
to "Sections," "Exhibits," "Annexes" and "Schedules" are intended to refer to
Sections of this Agreement and Exhibits, Annexes and Schedules to this
Agreement. All references in this Agreement to "$" are intended to refer to
U.S. dollars. Unless otherwise specifically provided for herein, the term "or"
shall not be deemed to be exclusive. Disclosure of any item on the Company
Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter by reference to any
particular Section or Subsection of this Agreement shall be deemed to
constitute disclosure with respect to any other Section or Subsection of this
Agreement if the relevance of such disclosure to such other Section or
Subsection is reasonably apparent from such disclosure or the context in which
such disclosure is made. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and
words of similar import, when used in this Agreement, refer to this Agreement
as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. References
in this Agreement to any agreement, instrument, statute, rule or regulation
are to the agreement, instrument, statute, rule or regulation as amended,
modified, supplemented or replaced from time to time (and, in the case of
statutes, include any rules and regulations promulgated under said statutes)
and to any section of any statute, rule or regulation including any successor
to said section. References to a Person are also to its successors and
permitted assigns. All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined
meanings when used in any certificate or other document made or delivered
pursuant thereto unless otherwise defined therein.

8.12 Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by Jury.

  

  

(a) Except to the extent the IBCA is mandatorily applicable to the Merger and
the Subsequent Merger, this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to Laws
that may be applicable under conflicts of laws principles (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

  

  

(b) Each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits,
for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware
Court of Chancery and any appellate court from thereof in the State of
Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the
State of Delaware and any appellate court from any thereof), in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements
delivered in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto,
and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not
to commence any such action or proceeding except in such court, (ii) agrees
that any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and
determined in such court, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally
and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in such court, and (iv)
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in such court located in
Delaware. Each of the Parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such
action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.
Each Party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the
manner provided for notices in Section 8.3. Nothing in this Agreement will
affect the right of any Party to this Agreement to serve process in any other
manner permitted by Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties
hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action,
claim, cross-claim or third-party claim or any kind of description, whether in
law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any
Financing Source (including, without limitation, the Arranger (as defined in
the Commitment Letter)) in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Financing, including but
not limited to any dispute arising out of relating in any way to the
Commitment Letter or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under
applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and
appellate courts thereof); provided, however, that for purposes of any action
or claim referred to in this sentence, the interpretation of the definition of
Acquired Business Material Adverse Effect and Company Material Adverse Effect
(each, as defined in the Commitment Letter), in each case, as set forth the
Commitment Letter, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise
govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

103  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS
DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR
THEREBY INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THE COMMITMENT LETTER OR THE FINANCING OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS,
(II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III)
IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS SECTION 8.12(c).

  

  

8.13 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts,
and by the different Parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which
when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. The exchange of a fully
executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by facsimile or by
electronic delivery in .pdf format shall be sufficient to bind the Parties to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

  

  

8.14 Specific Performance.

  

  

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the Parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including
failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to
consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise
breach such provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that each Party
hereto shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, without proof of actual damages
(and each Party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond or other undertaking in connection with such remedy), this being in
addition to, and not exclusive of, any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity. Without limitation of the foregoing and notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Parties hereby further
acknowledge and agree that prior to the Closing, each Party shall be entitled
to seek specific performance (i) to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of, and to prevent or cure breaches of, Section 5.6 and Section
5.13; (ii) if (A) all conditions in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been
satisfied or waived and (B) Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing
by the date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to Section 1.2,
to cause Parent and/or Merger Sub to draw down the full amount of the
Financing and (iii) to prevent or cure breaches of this Agreement by the other
Party and/or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, including to cause the other Party to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, including to effect the Closing in accordance with
Section 1.2, on the terms and subject to the conditions in this Agreement.
Each Party hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
(x) the other Party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

104  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) The Parties further agree that (x) the seeking of the remedies provided
for in Section 8.14(a) shall not in any respect constitute a waiver by any
Party seeking such remedies of its respective right to seek any other form of
relief that may be available to it under this Agreement, including under
Section 7.2, in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the
event that the remedies provided for in Section 8.14(a) are not available or
otherwise are not granted, and (y) nothing set forth in this Agreement shall
require a Party to institute any proceeding for (or limit a Party's right to
institute any proceeding for) specific performance under Section 8.14(a) prior
or as a condition to exercising any termination right under Article 7 (and
pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall the commencement of any
legal proceeding pursuant to Section 8.14(a) or anything set forth in this
Section 8.14(b) restrict or limit a Party's right to terminate this Agreement
in accordance with the terms of Article 7 or pursue any other remedies under
this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.

  

  

8.15 Sole and Exclusive Remedy. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company (whether at law, in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against the Financing Sources for
any Financing Failure shall be to terminate this Agreement as provided in
Section 7.1(j) and receive payment of the Financing Failure Fee and upon
payment of the Financing Failure Fee none of the Financing Sources will have
any liability to the Company, its affiliates or any other Person relating to
or arising out of this Agreement, the Commitment Letter or otherwise, whether
at law, or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and no Person will have
any rights or claims against any of the Financing Sources hereunder or
thereunder. In no event shall the Company be entitled to seek the remedy of
specific performance of this Agreement against the Financing Sources, and in
no event shall any Financing Source be liable for or obligated to pay
consequential, special, multiple, punitive or exemplary damages including, but
not limited to, damages arising from loss of profits, business opportunities
or goodwill in respect of any breach or failure to comply with this Agreement
or in respect of any of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the
Financing and the Commitment Letter).

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

105  

  

 

 

 

   
 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Merger Sub, Merger LLC and the Company have caused
this Agreement to be executed as of the date first written above by their
respective officers thereunto duly authorized.
