receives at Closing, the adjustment in this proviso, the " _Preferred Share
Adjustment Mechanic_ "), (d) any additional amounts to which the Seller may be

 | 31| 
---|---|--- 

 



     



  

3.5 _Adjustment to the Estimated Merger Consideration_.

  



  

(a) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall deliver to the Buyer a good faith estimate (the "
_Estimated Closing Statement_ ") of (i) Closing Working Capital (the "
_Working Capital Estimate_ ") and the resulting Working Capital Overage or
Working Capital Underage, (ii) the amount of Assumed Indebtedness (the "
_Estimated Assumed Indebtedness Amount_ "), (iii) the amount of Closing Cash
(the " _Estimated Closing Cash_ ") and (iv) the Credit Facility Payoff
Amount, in each case, prepared in accordance with the Balance Sheet Rules, if
applicable, and this Agreement. The Company shall reasonably consult with the
Buyer prior to the delivery of the Estimated Closing Statement.

  



  

(b) Within forty-five (45) days after the Closing Date, the Buyer
shall deliver to the Seller's Representative a statement of its calculation
of the Closing Working Capital, the Assumed Indebtedness and the Closing Cash,
in each case prepared in accordance with the Balance Sheet Rules, if
applicable, and this Agreement (the " _Statement_ "). The Buyer shall not
amend, supplement or modify the Statement following its delivery to the
Seller's Representative.

  



  

(c) The Statement shall become final and binding upon the parties
on the forty-fifth (45th) day following the date on which the Statement was
delivered to the Seller's Representative, unless the Seller's Representative
delivers written notice of its disagreement with the Statement (a " _Notice
of Disagreement_ ") to the Buyer prior to such date. If a Notice of
Disagreement is received by the Buyer in a timely manner, then the Statement
(as revised in accordance with this sentence) shall become final and binding
upon the parties on the earlier of (A) the date the Seller's Representative
and the Buyer resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to
the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement and (B) the date any
disputed matters are finally resolved in writing by the Independent
Accountant. During the fourteen (14)-day period following the delivery of a
Notice of Disagreement, the Seller's Representative and the Buyer shall seek
in good faith to resolve in writing any differences that they may have with
respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement. If at the end
of such fourteen (14)-day period the Seller's Representative and the Buyer
have not resolved in writing the matters specified in the Notice of
Disagreement, the Seller's Representative and the Buyer shall submit to the
Independent Accountant for resolution, acting as an expert and in accordance
with the standards set forth in this _Section 3.5_, only matters that remain
in dispute. The Seller's Representative and the Buyer shall use reasonable
efforts to cause the Independent Accountant to render a written decision
resolving the matters submitted to the Independent Accountant within thirty
(30) days of the receipt of such submission. The scope of the disputes to be
resolved by the Independent Accountant shall be limited to fixing mathematical
errors and determining whether the items disputed in the Notice of
Disagreement were determined in accordance with the Balance Sheet Rules, if
applicable, and this Agreement, and the Independent Accountant is not to make
any other determination, including any determination as to whether the Target
Working Capital, the Working Capital Estimate, the Estimated Assumed
Indebtedness Amount or the Estimated Closing Cash are correct. The
Independent Accountant's decision shall be based solely on written submissions
by the Seller's Representative and the Buyer and their respective
Representatives and not by independent review and shall be final and
binding on all of the parties hereto. The Independent Accountant may not
assign a value greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by
either party or smaller than the smallest value for such item claimed by
either party. Judgment may be entered upon the determination of the
Independent Accountant in any court having jurisdiction over the party against
which such determination is to be enforced. The fees and expenses of the
Independent Accountant incurred pursuant to this _Section 3.5_ shall be
allocated between the Seller's Representative (on behalf of the Seller), on
the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, based upon the percentage
that the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party bears to
the amount actually contested by such party in the Notice of Disagreement.
For example, if the Seller's Representative claims that the appropriate
adjustments are $1,000 greater than the amount determined by Buyer and if the
Independent Accountant ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding to
the Seller's Representative $300 of the $1,000 contested, then the fees and
expenses of the Independent Accountant will be allocated 30% ( _i.e._ , 300 Ã·
1,000) to the Company and 70% ( _i.e._ , 700 Ã· 1,000) to the Seller's
Representative.

(d) For the purposes of this Agreement, " _Final Working Capital_ "
means the Closing Working Capital, " _Final Assumed Indebtedness_ " means the
Assumed Indebtedness and " _Final Closing Cash_ " means the Closing Cash, in
each case, as finally agreed or determined in accordance with _Section
3.5(c)_. Following the determination of the Final Working Capital, the Final
Assumed Indebtedness and the Final Closing Cash, the Estimated Merger
Consideration shall be (i) increased by the Seller Adjustment Amount and (ii)
decreased by the Buyer Adjustment Amount as described herein. If the Seller
Adjustment Amount exceeds the Buyer Adjustment Amount, within three (3)
Business Days after the Final Working Capital, the Final Assumed
Indebtedness and the Final Closing Cash are determined, the Buyer shall cause
the Company to pay to the Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, an amount equal to such excess. If the Buyer Adjustment Amount exceeds
the Seller Adjustment Amount, within three (3) Business Days after the Final
Working Capital, the Final Assumed Indebtedness and the Final Closing Cash are
determined, the Seller shall deliver to the Company, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, an amount equal to such excess. Upon payment of
the amounts provided in this _Section 3.5(d)_, none of the parties hereto may
make or assert any claim under this Agreement for any matter included in the
Final Working Capital, Final Assumed Indebtedness or Final Closing Cash.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 3.5(d)_ , to the
extent that, as a result of payments or adjustment under this _Section
3.5_, the Seller is entitled to receive incremental consideration from the
Company hereunder, the consideration shall be paid in additional Buyer Common
Shares to the extent necessary to comply with the proviso to the definition of
Cash Consideration.

  



  

(e) If the Seller Adjustment Amount is equal to the Buyer
Adjustment Amount, then no payments shall be made by the Buyer or the
Seller pursuant to _Section 3.5(d)_.

  



    

 | 33| 
---|---|--- 

 



     



  

(f) Following the Closing, the Buyer shall not take any action with
respect to the accounting books and records of the Company, or the
items reflected thereon, on which the Statement is to be based, that is
inconsistent with the Company's past practices. No actions taken by the Buyer
on its own behalf or on behalf of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries on
or following the Closing Date shall be given effect for purposes of
determining the Closing Working Capital, the Assumed Indebtedness or the
Closing Cash. During the period of time from and after the Closing Date
through the final determination and payment of Final Working Capital, Final
Assumed Indebtedness and Final Closing Cash in accordance with this _Section
3.5_, the Buyer shall afford, and shall cause the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to afford, to the Seller's Representative and the Independent
Accountant, if any, and any accountants, counsel or other Representatives
retained by the Seller's Representative and/or the Independent Accountant, if
any, in connection with the review of Closing Working Capital, Assumed
Indebtedness and Closing Cash in accordance with this  _Section 3.5_, direct
access during normal business hours upon reasonable advance notice to all the
properties, books, contracts, personnel, Representatives (including the
Buyer's and the Company's accountants) and records of the Buyer, the Company,
the Company Subsidiaries and such Representatives (including the work papers
of the Company's accountants) relevant to the review of the Statement and the
calculation of Closing Working Capital, Assumed Indebtedness and Closing Cash
in accordance with this _Section 3.5_.

  



  

3.6 _Earnout_. From and after the Closing, the Buyer shall issue to
the Seller up to an additional 9,000,000 Buyer Common Shares in the
aggregate (the " _Earnout Shares_ "), which shall be fully paid (without any
additional consideration from the Seller), non-assessable and free and clear
of all Encumbrances other than transfer restrictions under applicable federal
and state securities Laws or the Ancillary Agreements, as described in this
_Section 3.6_ and only upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein.

  



  

(a) As soon as practicable (and in any event no later than thirty
(30) days) following receipt of audited consolidated financial statements of
the Company (or, if applicable, a direct or indirect parent of the Company)
for the fiscal years ended on December 31, 2018 (the " _2018 Audited
Financial Statements_ ") or December 31, 2019 (the " _2019 Audited Financial
Statements_ "), as applicable, from such audited entity's certified public
accountants, the Buyer shall deliver to the Seller's Representative a
certificate executed by an executive officer of the Buyer setting forth the
Buyer's calculation of 2018 EBITDA (the " _2018 Earnout Statement_ ") or 2019
EBITDA (the " _2019 Earnout Statement_ ", and each of the 2018 Earnout
Statement and the 2019 Earnout Statement, an " _Earnout Statement_ "), as
applicable, in each case together with reasonable supporting documentation
(including a copy of the 2018 Audited Financial Statements or 2019 Audited
Financial Statements, as applicable, and a calculation of each component of
Company EBITDA and the exclusions therefrom). The Buyer shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause (x) the 2018 Audited Financial Statements to be
prepared and delivered to the Company or the applicable audited entity no
later than June 30, 2019 and (y) the 2019 Audited Financial Statements to be
prepared and delivered to the Company or the applicable audited entity no
later than June 30, 2020. If the 2018 Audited Financial Statements are not
prepared by June 30, 2019 or the 2019 Audited Financial Statements are not
prepared by June 30, 2020, as soon as practicable but in any event within
thirty (30) days, the Buyer shall deliver to the Seller's Representative the
applicable Earnout Statement, prepared based upon the Company's or the
applicable entity's financial statements prepared in accordance with the
accounting policies, principles, procedures, rules, practices, methodologies,
categorizations, asset recognition bases, definitions, judgments and
estimation techniques utilized in preparing the Audited Financial Statements,
applied on a consistent basis and reasonable supporting documentation thereof
(including a copy of such financial statements and a calculation of each
component of Company EBITDA and the exclusions therefrom).

(b) Within forty-five (45) days after the receipt by the Seller's
Representative of an Earnout Statement, the Seller's Representative may
deliver to the Buyer a written statement either accepting such Earnout
Statement or specifying any objections thereto (in which case, such written
statement shall include the Seller's Representative's calculations of any
disputed items or amounts and the Seller's Representative's grounds for such
disagreement in reasonable detail) (an " _Earnout Objections Statement_ ").
If the Seller's Representative does not deliver an Earnout Objections
Statement to the Buyer within forty-five (45) days after the Seller's
Representative's receipt of an Earnout Statement, such Earnout Statement
will be final and binding upon the Seller and the Buyer.

  



  

(c) If the Seller's Representative delivers an Earnout Objections
Statement, then the Seller's Representative and the Buyer shall, during the
fourteen (14) days following such delivery, seek in good faith to resolve in
writing any differences that they may have with respect to the matters
specified in such Earnout Objections Statement in order to determine 2018
EBITDA or 2019 EBITDA, as applicable. If the Seller's Representative and the
Buyer are unable to reach such resolution during such period, then they shall
promptly thereafter appoint the Independent Accountant to promptly review this
Agreement and the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of calculating
the actual amount of 2018 EBITDA or 2019 EBITDA, as applicable. The
Independent Accountant, acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator, shall
determine in accordance with this Agreement the actual amount of 2018 EBITDA
or 2019 EBITDA, as applicable, and shall deliver to the Seller's
Representative and the Buyer a written report setting forth
such calculations. In resolving any disputed item, the Independent Accountant
(i) shall be bound by the provisions of this _Section 3.6_ and the
definitions of Company EBITDA and 2018 EBITDA or 2019 EBITDA, as applicable,
(ii) shall limit its review to the disputed items submitted to the
Independent Accountant for resolution and (iii) shall further limit its review
solely to whether the applicable Earnout Statement has been prepared in
accordance with this _Section 3.6_ or contains any mathematical error. The
determination of any disputed items cannot, however, be in excess of, or less
than, the greatest or lowest value, respectively, claimed for any such item
in the applicable Earnout Statement or Earnout Objections Statement. Such
report shall be final and binding upon the Seller and the Buyer, absent
manifest error. The fees, costs and expenses of the Independent Accountant
shall be allocated between the Seller's Representative (on behalf of the
Seller), on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, based upon the
percentage that the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party
bears to the amount actually contested by such party in the Earnout
Objections Statement. For example, if the Seller's Representative claims that
the appropriate adjustments are $1,000 greater than the amount determined by
Buyer and if the Independent Accountant ultimately resolves the dispute by
awarding to the Seller's Representative $300 of the $1,000 contested, then
the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant will be allocated 30% (
_i.e._ , 300 Ã· 1,000) to the Company and 70% ( _i.e._ , 700 Ã· 1,000) to the
Seller's Representative.

(d) During the period of time from and after delivery of an Earnout
Statement through the final determination of 2018 EBITDA or 2019 EBITDA, as
applicable, in accordance with this _Section 3.6_ , the Buyer shall afford,
and shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to afford, to the
Seller's Representative and the Independent Accountant, if any, and any
accountants, counsel or other Representatives retained by the Seller's
Representative and/or the Independent Accountant, if any, direct
access during normal business hours upon reasonable advance notice, to all
properties, books, contracts, personnel, Representatives (including the
Buyer's and the Company's accountants) and records of the Buyer, the Company,
the Company Subsidiaries and such Representatives (including the work papers
of the Buyer's and the Company's accountants) relevant to the review of the
applicable Earnout Statement and the calculation of 2018 EBITDA or 2019
EBITDA, as applicable, in accordance with this _Section 3.6_.

  



  

(e) As used herein, (i) " _Final 2018 EBITDA_ " means (x) if the
Seller's Representative fails to deliver an Earnout Objections Statement with
respect to the 2018 Earnout Statement in accordance with _Section 3.6(b)_ ,
the 2018 EBITDA as set forth in the 2018 Earnout Statement, or (y) if a
dispute between the Seller's Representative and the Buyer with respect
to 2018 EBITDA is resolved by resolution of the Buyer and the Seller's
Representative or by submission of any remaining disputes to the Independent
Accountant, as contemplated by this _Section 3.6_ , 2018 EBITDA as so
resolved, and (ii) " _Final 2019 EBITDA_ " means (x) if the Seller's
Representative fails to deliver an Earnout Objections Statement with
respect to the 2019 Earnout Statement in accordance with _Section 3.6(b)_ ,
the 2019 EBITDA as set forth in the 2019 Earnout Statement, or (y) if a
dispute between the Seller's Representative and the Buyer with respect to 2019
EBITDA is resolved by resolution of the Buyer and the Seller's Representative
or by submission of any remaining disputes to the Independent Accountant,
as contemplated by this _Section 3.6_ , 2019 EBITDA as so resolved.

  



  

(f) If Final 2018 EBITDA equals or exceeds $65,000,000, then the
Buyer shall promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business
Days following the determination of Final 2018 EBITDA) deliver to the Seller
certificates or, at the Seller's request, evidence of shares in book-entry
form representing (i) 1,000,000 Buyer Common Shares, and (ii) an additional
number of Buyer Common Shares equal to the product of (x) 250,000 _multiplied
by_ (y) a fraction, (A) the numerator of which is the amount by which
Final 2018 EBITDA exceeds $65,000,000 and (B) the denominator of which is
$1,000,000; _provided_ , _however_ , that (1) if the Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries acquires one or more business enterprises, divisions or lines of
business with an aggregate purchase price in excess of $10,000,000 following
the Closing and prior to December 31, 2018, in accordance with the Investor
Rights Agreement, all or any portion of the revenue of which is included in
the calculation of Final 2018 EBITDA, then in no event shall the number of
Buyer Common Shares issuable by the Buyer to the Seller pursuant to this
_Section 3.6(f)_ exceed 6,000,000 Buyer Common Shares in the aggregate, and
(2) if no such acquisition is taken into account in the calculation of Final
2018 EBITDA, in no event shall the number of Buyer Common Shares issuable by
the Buyer to the Seller pursuant to this _Section 3.6(f)_ exceed
9,000,000 Buyer Common Shares in the aggregate. For the avoidance of doubt,
if 2018 EBITDA is less than $65,000,000, then no Buyer Common Shares will be
issuable to the Seller under this _Section 3.6(f)_.

  



    

 | 36| 
---|---|--- 

 



     



  

(g) If Final 2019 EBITDA equals or exceeds $90,000,000, then the
Buyer shall promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business
Days following the determination of Final 2019 EBITDA) deliver to the Seller
certificates or, at the Seller's request, evidence of shares in book-entry
form representing (i) 1,000,000 Buyer Common Shares, and (ii) an additional
number of Buyer Common Shares equal to the product of (x) 250,000 _multiplied
by_ (y) a fraction, (A) the numerator of which is the amount by which
Final 2019 EBITDA exceeds $90,000,000 and (B) the denominator of which is
$1,000,000; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the number of
Buyer Common Shares issuable by the Buyer to the Seller pursuant to _Section
3.6(f)_ , together with the number of Buyer Common Shares issuable by the
Buyer to the Seller pursuant to this _Section 3.6(g)_ , exceed 9,000,000
Buyer Common Shares in the aggregate. For the avoidance of doubt, if 2019
EBITDA is less than $90,000,000, then no Buyer Common Shares will be issuable
to the Seller under this _Section 3.6(g)_.

  



  

(h) The Buyer shall give the Seller's Representative written notice
of the occurrence of any Change of Control or entry into a
definitive agreement with respect thereto, in each case promptly following
the Buyer's obtaining actual knowledge thereof. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this _Section 3.6_ , if a Change of Control occurs (i) on or
prior to December 31, 2019, then all contingencies to the payments under
_Section 3.6(f)_ and _Section 3.6(g)_ shall be deemed satisfied and,
immediately prior to the occurrence of such Change of Control, the Buyer
shall promptly issue to the Seller an aggregate number of Buyer Common Shares
equal to 9,000,000 Buyer Common Shares less any Buyer Common Shares previously
issued to the Seller in accordance with this  _Section 3.6_ or (ii) after
December 31, 2019 but prior to the determination of Final 2019 EBITDA, Buyer
shall cause the successor or acquiring Person to assume all of Buyer's
obligations hereunder, and the Seller shall be entitled to receive any
cash, securities or other property receivable upon such Change of Control if
the Earnout Shares with respect to the Final 2019 EBITDA were outstanding
immediately prior to such Change of Control.

  



  

(i) During the period from the date hereof through the date of the
determination of Final 2019 EBITDA and the issuance of any Buyer
Common Shares, if any, required in accordance with this _Section 3.6_ , the
Buyer shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to:

  



  

(i) reserve for issuance a sufficient number of unissued Buyer
Common Shares to permit the Buyer to satisfy its issuance obligations set
forth in this _Section 3.6_ and take all actions required to increase the
authorized number of Buyer Common Shares if at any time there shall be
insufficient unissued Buyer Common Shares to permit such reservation;

  



    

 | 37| 
---|---|--- 

 



     



  

(ii) keep books and records of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries in a manner to enable the calculation of Company EBITDA
hereunder;

  



  

(iii) operate the business of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries in a commercially reasonable manner and solely through the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries;

  



  

(iv) other than in connection with a Change of Control, which shall
be governed by _Section 3.6(h)_ , not sell, assign, lease or
otherwise transfer (directly or indirectly, in a single transaction or a
series of related transactions) all or a portion of the assets or business of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any line of business or division (or
any rights therein), to any Person (other than the Company or a wholly-owned
Company Subsidiary), other than (x) sales of assets the aggregate value of
which is less than $5,000,000 and (y) sales of assets acquired after the
Closing to the extent the Buyer's Board of Directors reasonably
determines such assets are not core to the business conducted by the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries as of the ClosingÍ¾ _provided_ , that if assets
are sold pursuant to the foregoing clause (y), Company EBITDA for the 2018
Fiscal Year or 2019 Fiscal Year, as applicable, shall be increased (without
duplication to any adjustment that occurred pursuant to the definition of
"Company EBITDA") by an amount equal to the capital charge relating to such
sold assets described in clause (d) of the definition of the term
"Company EBITDA" in _Section 1.1_ ;

  



  

(v) not enter into or permit to exist any agreement, arrangement or
understanding that would restrict or prevent issuance of the Buyer Common
Shares to the Seller when due in accordance with this _Section 3.6_ Í¾ and

  



  

(vi) not take any actions (including accelerating expenses or
delaying revenues) outside the ordinary course of business for the
purpose, whether primary or otherwise, of avoiding or reducing the payments
contemplated by _Section 3.6(f)_ or _Section 3.6(g)_ ;

  



  

 _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) the foregoing shall not prohibit the Buyer
and its Subsidiaries from continuing to operate the current businesses of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, as conducted on the date hereof or
the Closing and (y) in no event shall Buyer be deemed to have taken or failed
to take any action in violation of (iii) or (vi) of the foregoing to the
extent such action or failure to take action (A) was not approved by the
Buyer's Board of Directors or (B) was approved or consented to by a majority
of the GFI Designees (as defined in the Investor Rights Agreement).

  



  

(j) The Buyer shall take such actions as are reasonably requested
by the Seller to evidence the issuances pursuant to this _Section 3.6_
, including through delivery of duly and validly executed certificates
representing the Seller's Earnout Shares.

  



    

 | 38| 
---|---|--- 

 



     



  

(k) The parties further agree that:

  



  

(i) The payment of any Earnout Shares under this _Section 3.6_ , if
any, shall be treated by the parties for federal, state and local income tax
purposes (whether foreign or domestic) as an adjustment to the Estimated
Merger Consideration issued in the Mergers except as otherwise required by a
change in applicable Law after the date hereof or a Final Determination; and

  



  

(ii) Any payment of Earnout Shares pursuant to this _Section 3.6_
shall be treated as comprised of two components, respectively, a principal
component and an interest component, the amounts of which shall be determined
as provided in Section 1.483-4(b) of the Treasury Regulations (including
example 2), using the 3-month test rate of interest provided for in Section
1.1274-4(a)(1)(ii) and employing the semi-annual compounding period. The
parties shall treat the principal component as received on a tax-
deferred basis as additional consideration received in the A Reorganization
in a manner consistent with Revenue Procedure 84-42, 1984-1 CB 521 on their
Tax Returns, except as otherwise required by a change in applicable law after
the date hereof or a Final Determination. With respect to any Earnout Share
payment made pursuant to this _Section 3.6_ to the Seller, shares representing
the principal component (with a value equal to the principal component) and
shares representing the interest component (with a value equal to the
interest component) shall be represented by separate certificates or book-
entries, as applicable.

  



  

(l) The Seller acknowledges that (i) achievement of the targets for
2018 EBITDA and 2019 EBITDA set forth herein is speculative in nature and
subject to numerous factors outside Buyer's control; (ii) the contingent
rights to receive the Earnout Shares shall not be represented by any form of
certificate or other instrument and are not guaranteed or secured in any
fashion, and (iii) Seller shall not have any rights as a stockholder or other
securityholder of Buyer or any of its Affiliates in respect of the
Earnout Shares as a result of Seller's contingent right to receive the
Earnout Shares until the Earnout Shares are required to be issued pursuant to
the terms of this _Section 3.6_.

  



  

3.7 _Equitable Adjustments_. If at any time following the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, any change in the number of outstanding Buyer
Common Shares shall occur as a result of any stock split (including a reverse
stock split) or combination, any reclassification, any stock dividend or
stock distribution (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into or exchangeable for Buyer Common Shares) or
similar transaction, then in each such case, the number of Buyer
Common Shares issued to the Seller at Closing, the Buyer Share Issue Price
and the number of Earnout Shares, if any, required to be issued to the Seller
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be equitably adjusted to reflect
such change.

  



    

 | 39| 
---|---|--- 

 



     



  

3.8 _Tax Withholding_. Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the Total Consideration, or any other payment payable pursuant
to this Agreement (including the Earnout Shares), such amounts as may be
required to be deducted and withheld under any provision of federal, state,
local or non-U.S. Tax Law and to request any necessary tax forms or
information, including Form W-9 or appropriate series of Form W-8, as
applicable, or any similar information. To the extent that amounts are so
deducted, withheld, and timely paid to the appropriate Tax authority, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction, withholding and payment
was made. Except with respect to compensation payments to employees or other
similar payments, and provided the Buyer timely receives the applicable tax
forms and information described in this _Section 3.8_ and the certificate
provided for in _Section 7.18_ , Buyer is not aware of any withholding Taxes
that may become due and payable in connection with the payment of the Total
Consideration pursuant to this Agreement. With respect to any payment of the
Total Consideration (other than compensation payments described in the
preceding sentence), Buyer shall provide prompt written notice of its
intention to deduct and withhold such amounts to the Person in respect of
whom such withholding is to be made of the amount of such Tax and the basis
upon which such withholding is required. Buyer shall cooperate with Seller in
good faith and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain exemptions from,
or reductions of, any Taxes required to be withheld from payments to this
Agreement.

4.2 _Authority; Binding Obligation_. The Seller has all requisite
organizational power and authority to execute, deliver and perform this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which the Seller is a party and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution by
the Seller of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which the
Seller is a party and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby have been duly and validly authorized by all required
limited liability company action on the part of the Seller, and no other
proceedings on the part of the Seller are required to authorize this
Agreement, such Ancillary Agreements or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. This Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement
to which the Seller is a party has been, or in the case of the Ancillary
Agreements will be at Closing, duly executed and delivered by the Seller and
assuming that this Agreement or such Ancillary Agreement constitutes the
legal, valid and binding obligation of the other parties thereto, constitutes
the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Seller, enforceable against
the Seller in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that the
enforceability thereof may be limited by: (a) applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws
from time to time in effect affecting generally the enforcement of creditors'
rights and remedies; and (b) general principles of equity (collectively, the

4.3 _No Defaults or Conflicts_. Neither the execution and delivery
of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to which the Seller is a party,

Seller or the performance by the Seller of its obligations hereunder or
thereunder (a) results in any violation of the applicable
organizational documents of the Seller; (b) conflicts with, or results in a
material breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitutes a
material default under any material agreement or instrument to which the
Seller is a party or by which it is bound or to which the Company Common
Units owned by the Seller are subject; or (c) violates any existing applicable
material Law, judgment, order or decree of any Governmental Authority having
jurisdiction over the Seller or the Company Common Units owned by the Seller.

  



  

4.4 _No Governmental Authorization Required; Consents_. Except for
applicable requirements of Antitrust Laws, no authorization or approval or
other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any Governmental Authority
will be required to be obtained or made by the Seller in connection with the
due execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement by the Seller and the consummation by the Seller of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
no representation or warranty is made with respect to authorizations,
approvals, notices or filings with any Governmental Authority or any other
Person that, if not obtained or made, would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the Seller, constitute a
material violation of Law or reasonably be expected to materially impair or
delay the ability of the Seller to consummate the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to
which the Seller is a party.

  



  

4.5 _Company Common Units_. As of the date hereof, the Seller is
the record and beneficial owner of the equity interests set forth opposite
the name of the Seller on _Section 4.5_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedules, and the equity interests set forth on _Section 4.5_ of the

Company set forth opposite the name of the Seller on _Section 4.5_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedules, the Seller has no other equity interests or
rights to acquire equity interests in the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
as of the date hereof. As of immediately prior to the Closing, the Company
Common Units represent 100% of the total voting power and economic rights with
respect to the Company's equity interests and the Seller will have good and
valid title to the Company Common Units set forth opposite the name of the
Seller on _Section 4.5_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules, free and clear
of all Encumbrances, except (i) Permitted Encumbrances against such Company
Common Units all of which will be discharged at or prior to the Closing, (ii)
Encumbrances on transfer imposed under applicable securities Laws and (iii)

---|---|--- 

 



     



  

4.6 _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
Actions pending or, to the Knowledge of the Seller, threatened against the
Seller, before any Governmental Authority that would prevent, impair or delay
the Seller from consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

4.7 _Proxy Statement_. None of the information relating to the
Seller supplied by the Seller, or by any other Person acting on behalf of the
Seller, in writing which is included in the Proxy Statement will, as of the
date that the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) is
first mailed to the Buyer's stockholders or at the time of the Buyer
Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller makes no representation, warranty,

4.9 _Investment Purpose_. The Seller is entering into the Mergers
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement for the purpose of
investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, the
distribution of any Buyer Common Shares or Buyer Preferred Shares in
violation of applicable federal, state or provincial securities Laws. The
Seller acknowledges that the issuance of the Buyer Common Shares or Buyer
Preferred Shares contemplated by this Agreement have not been registered
under the Securities Act of 1933 (the " _Securities Act_ ") or any state
securities Laws, and that the Buyer Common Shares or Buyer Preferred Shares
may not be sold, transferred, offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated, or
otherwise disposed of without registration under the Securities Act, pursuant
to an exemption from the Securities Act or in a transaction not subject
thereto. The Seller represents that it is an "Accredited Investor" as that
term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D of the Securities Act.

  



    

 | 42| 
---|---|--- 

 



     



  

4.10 _Legends_. Seller understands that each certificate representing
Buyer Common Shares and Buyer Preferred Shares shall bear any legend as
required by the "blue sky" laws of any state and a restrictive legend in
substantially the following form (and a stop-transfer order may be placed
against transfer of such Buyer Common Shares and Buyer Preferred Shares):

  



  

THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED (THE "ACT"), OR ANY STATE SECURITIES BLUE SKY LAWS ("BLUE SKY
LAW") AND MAY NOT BE SOLD, TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF
WITHOUT REGISTRATION UNDER THE ACT AND UNDER APPLICABLE BLUE SKY LAW OR
UNLESS SUCH SALE, TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER DISPOSITION IS EXEMPT FROM
REGISTRATION THEREUNDER (AND BASED UPON AN OPINION OF COUNSEL IF THE COMPANY
SO REQUESTS).

  



  

4.11 _No Outside Reliance_. Each of the Seller and the Seller's
Representative acknowledges that it and their respective Representatives have
been permitted satisfactory access to the books and records, facilities,
equipment, Tax Returns, contracts, insurance policies (or summaries thereof)
and other properties and assets of the Buyer that it and their respective
Representatives have desired or requested to see or review, and that it and
their respective Representatives have had a satisfactory opportunity to meet
with the officers and employees of the Buyer to discuss the business of the
Buyer. Each of the Seller and the Seller's Representative acknowledges that
neither the Buyer nor any other Person has made any representation or
warranty, express or implied, written or oral, as to the accuracy or
completeness of any information that the Buyer furnished or made available to
the Seller, the Seller's Representative or any of their respective
Representatives, except as expressly set forth in _Article 6_ of this
Agreement, and neither the Buyer nor any other Person (including any officer,
director, employee, member or partner of Buyer) shall have or be subject to
any liability (whether in contract or tort, under applicable securities Laws
or otherwise) to the Seller or the Seller's Representative, based upon any
information, documents or materials made available to the Seller or the
Seller's Representative or resulting from the use by the Seller or the
Seller's Representative of any information, documents or material made
available to the Seller or the Seller's Representative, in each case in any
"data rooms," management presentations, due diligence or in any other form in
expectation of the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing in this _Section 4.11_ is intended to limit or modify the
representations and warranties contained in _Article 6_ which the Buyer
acknowledges the Seller and the Seller's Representative are relying on in
executing and delivering this Agreement. Each of the Seller and the Seller's
Representative acknowledges that, except for the representations and
warranties contained in _Article 6_, neither the Buyer nor any other Person
has made, and the Seller and the Seller's Representative have not relied on,
any other express or implied representation or warranty by or on behalf of
the Buyer, including any implied representation or warranty as to value,
condition, capacity, merchantability, environmental condition or suitability.
Each of the Seller and the Seller's Representative acknowledges that neither
the Buyer nor any other Person, directly or indirectly, has made, and the
Seller and the Seller's Representative have not relied on, any representation
or warranty regarding the pro-forma financial information, budgets, estimates,
projections, business plans, forecasts or other forward-looking statements of
the Buyer (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such
information, budgets, estimates, projections, business plans, forecasts or
forward-looking statements), and neither the Seller's Representative nor the

Merger Sub II LLC or their respective Affiliates or of the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries or any investment held directly or indirectly by the

case it may include proposals for the election of directors and such other

Subsidiary of the Surviving Company) agrees that (i) the Surviving Company or
the applicable Subsidiary of the Surviving Company is the indemnitor of first

provide indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by any
such Indemnified Party are secondary), (ii) the Surviving Company or the
applicable Subsidiary of the Surviving Company shall be required to advance
the full amount of expenses incurred by any such Indemnified Party and shall
be liable for the full indemnifiable amounts, without regard to any rights any
such Indemnified Party may have against any such other Person and (iii) each
of the Buyer, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II LLC irrevocably
waives, relinquishes and releases Sub (on its own behalf and, as of the
Closing, on behalf of the Surviving Company and each Subsidiary of the
Surviving Company) such other Persons from any and all claims against any such
other Persons for contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any kind
in respect thereof. Each of the Buyer, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II LLC (on
its own behalf and, as of the Closing, on behalf of the Surviving Company and
each Subsidiary of the Surviving Company) further agrees that no advancement
or payment by any of such other Persons on behalf of any such Indemnified
Party with respect to any claim for which such Indemnified Party has sought
indemnification from the Buyer, the Surviving Company or the applicable
Subsidiary of the Surviving Company shall affect the foregoing and such other
Persons shall have a right of contribution or be subrogated to the extent

(e) In the event that the Buyer or the Surviving Company (following
the Closing) or any of their respective successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, the Buyer shall take all
necessary action so that the successors or assigns of the Buyer or the
Surviving Company (following the Closing), as the case may be, shall succeed
to the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.12_ and _Section 7.13_.

  



  

7.13 _Termination of Affiliate Obligations_.

(Parallel), L.P. a fee in an aggregate amount equal to three percent (3%) per

obligations under the Westchester Indemnity, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account(s) designated by such Persons. Such fee shall

Company and (ii) the Westchester Release Date (which, in the case of payments
on the last date of the fiscal quarter of the Company in which the Closing
occurs and on the Westchester Release Date, shall be pro-rated based on the
number of days elapsed from the Closing Date and the first date of the fiscal
quarter of the Company, respectively). From and after the Closing, the
Buyer, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall indemnify and hold

owners, Representatives, successors or assigns from and against any and all
Losses incurred or suffered by any such Person resulting from, arising out of

advisable to obtain the irrevocable and unconditional release of IEA and the
applicable Affiliates of IEA from the guarantee, indemnity and other
obligations described in _Section 7.13(d)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedules (the " _Affiliate Guarantees_ "). In furtherance of the foregoing,

requirement to post any collateral (except as otherwise expressly provided in
_Section 7.13(b)_  or _Section 7.13(c)_ ), (i) enter into a guarantee on the
same terms as the Affiliate Guarantees in substitution for IEA or (ii)
provide or procure substitute instruments to replace each of the Affiliate
Guarantees. From and after the Closing, the Buyer, the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries shall indemnify and hold harmless IEA and its Affiliates
and all of their respective owners, Representatives, successors or assigns

Counsel may represent the Seller, the Seller's Representative or any of their
respective Affiliates in such dispute even though the interests of the Seller,

may have represented the Company or the Company Subsidiaries in a matter

take, all steps necessary to implement the intent of this _Section
7.14_. Each of the Buyer, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II LLC (on its own
behalf and, as of the Closing, on behalf of the Surviving Company and each

the Company's right to replace, restate, supplement, modify, assign,

(b) The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Buyer, amend, modify, supplement or waive any provision of the

modification, supplement or waiver would (i) reduce the aggregate amount of
the Debt Financing set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter or (ii) impose new
or additional conditions, or otherwise amend or modify any of the conditions,
to the receipt of the Debt Financing in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to (A) make the funding of the Debt Financing (or the satisfaction
of the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing) less likely to occur or
(B) materially delay the Closing; provided that the Company may amend,
supplement, or modify the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents, or similar entities (or titles
with respect to such entities) in order to increase the commitments pursuant
thereto in accordance with Section 7.19(a). Any other amendment, supplement or
modification of the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter not specified in the
immediately foregoing sentence shall be subject to the consent of the Buyer
(not to be unreasonably withheld). Upon any such amendment, supplement or
modification of the Debt Commitment Letter in accordance with this _Section

Letter as so amended, supplemented or modified.

(c) If all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable
on the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letters

Debt Financing or such portion of the Debt Financing from alternative
sources, which may include one or more of a senior secured debt financing, an
offering and sale of notes, or any other financing or offer and sale of other
debt securities, or any combination thereof, in an amount not less than the
amount of the aggregate commitment in the Debt Commitment Letter ("
_Alternative Financing_ "); _provided_ that the terms of any such Debt
Financing are no less favorable than those contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter. In such event, the term "Debt Financing" as used in this Agreement
shall be deemed to include any Alternative Financing, and the term "Debt
Commitment Letter" as used in this Agreement shall be deemed to include the
commitment letter with respect to such Alternative Financing.

  



  

(d) At Closing, the Company shall cause letters of credit to be
issued under the Replacement Credit Facility either in replacement of, or as
back-to-back arrangements satisfactory to the issuer of, letters of credit
issued under the Existing Credit Facility.

(a) The Buyer shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Seller's Representative, make, or cause or permit to be made, any material

material and adverse effect on the Seller (or their owners) solely with
respect to any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the
Closing Date.

  



  

(b) Prior to, on and after the Closing, each party hereto shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Mergers to qualify as

omission would reasonably be expected to prevent the Mergers from qualifying
as such a reorganization. In addition, the Buyer shall cause Merger Sub II
LLC to be treated as a disregarded entity of the Buyer.

circumstances underlying the transactions from the terms as described in this
Agreement (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned, _provided_ , _that_ , withholding consent based on position for
which there is at least substantial authority, as determined by a tax advisor
mutually agreed to by Buyer and Seller's Representative, for treatment of the
transactions as described in this clause (c) shall not be considered
unreasonable), the parties shall treat (w) the Mergers as an integrated
transaction that is characterized as a merger of the Company into the Buyer
with the Buyer surviving that qualifies as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code, (x) the Real Property Spinoff described
in _Schedule I_ as described in _Schedule I_ , (y) any gain recognized in the
Mergers by the Seller under Section 356(a)(1) of the Code solely as gain
recognized from the exchange of property, with no portion of such gain being
treated as gain recognized with respect to the distribution of a dividend
under the provisions of Section 356(a)(2); and (z) any distributions made by
the Company to the Seller prior to the date of this Agreement (whether
in cash or in-kind, including interests in companies holding the Specified
Real Property) as distributions to which Section 301 applies (collectively,
the " _Pre-Signing Distributions_ ") and not as consideration received in the
transactions (such matters described in clauses (w), (x), (y) and (z),
collectively, the " _Intended Tax Treatment_ "). The parties hereto and their
respective Affiliates shall, unless otherwise required by a Final
Determination or change in applicable Law, or with the consent of the
Seller's Representative based on a change in the facts and circumstances
underlying the transactions from the terms as described in this Agreement
(which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned,
_provided_ ,  _that_ , withholding consent based on a position for which
there is at least substantial authority, as determined by a tax advisor
mutually agreed to by Buyer and Seller's Representative, for treatment of the
transactions as described in this clause (c) shall not be considered
unreasonable), prepare and file all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with
the Intended Tax Treatment (including using the agreed value of the Specified
Real Property) and (2) take no position in any Tax Return inconsistent
with the Intended Tax Treatment. If any such position regarding the Intended
Tax Treatment is disputed in writing by any Governmental Authority, the party
receiving notice of such dispute shall promptly notify and consult with the
other parties concerning the resolution of such dispute, and the Seller's
Representative shall have the right, at its election, and at its own expense,
to control, conduct of any audit, contest or similar proceeding (a "
_Contest_ ") (or portion thereof) relating to such dispute;  _provided_ ,
_that_ , the Buyer shall have the right to participate in such Contest at its
own expense, and the Seller's Representative shall not settle, compromise
and/or concede any such Contest (or portion thereof) without the prior written
consent of the Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement or otherwise, the Buyer and its Affiliates make no representations
to the Seller hereunder with respect to the Intended Tax Treatment or the Tax
consequences of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the Buyer
and its Affiliates (including the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries)
shall have no liability hereunder arising from any divergence in the
Tax consequences to the Seller of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement from the Tax consequences that would result under the Intended Tax
Treatment, except to the extent that any such divergence results from a
willful, intentional or reckless breach by Buyer of its covenants set forth
in this _Section 7.20;_ provided that in no event shall Buyer be deemed to
have taken or failed to take any action subject to the exception in this
sentence to the extent such action or failure to take action (A) was not
approved by the Buyer's Board of Directors or (B) was approved or consented to
by a majority of the GFI Designees (as defined in the Investor Rights
Agreement).

(d) To the extent that the RE Tax Amount Liability as determined on
the applicable Tax Returns for the Company exceeds the RE Tax
Amount Liability as determined at the Closing, the Buyer shall provide the
Seller's Representative with the Tax Returns of the Company and a revised
calculation of the RE Tax Amount Liability. If the Seller's Representative
disputes the calculation of the RE Tax Amount Liability, the dispute
resolution mechanics of _Section 3.5_ (including the provisions regarding fees
and expense) shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ to the determination of the RE
Tax Amount hereunder. Once the RE Tax Amount Liability is finally determined
on the applicable Tax Returns for the Company, if the RE Tax Amount Liability
as finally determined pursuant to this  _Section 7.20(d)_ exceeds the RE Tax
Amount Liability determined at Closing, the Seller shall promptly pay the
Company in cash such excess (if any), with such amounts being treated as
adjustments to the consideration received under this Agreement for applicable
tax purposes except as otherwise required by applicable Law.

  



  

(e) The parties shall cooperate (i) to determine the current and
accumulated earnings and profits of the Company for purposes of
determining the amount of the Pre-Signing Distributions that are treated as
dividends under Section 316(a) of the Code and (ii) to agree on the value of
the Specified Real Property for purposes of determining the RE Tax Amount. If
the parties cannot agree on such amounts, the dispute resolution mechanics of
_Section 3.5_ (including the provisions regarding fees and expense) shall
apply _mutatis mutandis_ , _provided_ that any fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the determinations pursuant to this _Section 7.20(e)_ shall
be borne by the Sellers.

  



  

(f) _Tax Amount Liability Indemnity and Process_.

  



  

(i) The Buyer shall provide a copy of the Tax Return(s) reflecting
the Pre-Signing Distributions and Real Property Spinoff to the
Seller's Representative as soon as reasonably practicable prior to the due
date for filing such Tax Return(s) for approval by the
Seller's Representative of the reporting of such Pre-Signing Distributions
and Real Property Spinoff on such Tax Return(s). If the
Seller's Representative disputes the reporting of the Pre-Signing
Distributions or Real Property Spinoff on any such Tax Return, it
shall notify the Buyer of the disputed items and the basis for its objection.
The parties shall act in good faith to resolve any such dispute prior to the
date on which the relevant Tax Return is required to be filed. If the parties
cannot resolve any disputed item, the dispute resolution mechanics of
_Section 3.5_ (including the provisions regarding fees and expense) shall
apply  _mutatis mutandis_.

(ii) Without duplication of any amounts taken into account in the
calculation of the Estimated Merger Consideration (as adjusted pursuant to 
_Section 3.5(d)_ ) and the RE Tax Amount Liability at Closing (or as paid by
the Seller pursuant to _Section 7.20(d)_ ), the Seller shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Buyer, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, from any
and all Taxes attributable to the Pre-Signing Distributions and the Real
Property Spinoff (collectively, the " _Tax Amount Liability Indemnity_
"). The indemnification obligations of the Seller in respect of the Tax
Amount Liability Indemnity and this _Section 7.20(f)_  shall terminate and
all rights, claims and causes of action (whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, or whether at law or in equity) with respect thereto shall
terminate on the earlier of:

  



  

(x) one year after the filing of the U.S. federal income Tax Return of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries for the taxable year ending on the
Closing Date, and

  



  

(y) April 30, 2019, but only to the extent both (I) the RE Tax Amount
Liability reported on such Tax Return is agreed by the Parties in
accordance with _Section 7.20(f)(i)_ without use of the dispute resolution
mechanics of Section 3.5 and (II) the Real Property Spinoff occurs prior to
December 31, 2017.

  



  

(iii) If written notice of any claim for indemnification pursuant to
this _Section 7.20(f)_ is given by the Buyer to the Seller's Representative
in accordance with the provisions hereof prior to the expiration of the
periods described above, such claim shall survive until finally resolved or
judicially determined.

  



  

(iv) The Buyer shall not and shall not permit its Affiliates
(including the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) to voluntarily
approach a Governmental Authority with regard to or related to Taxes that
would be indemnifiable pursuant to this _Section 7.20(f)_  and shall not
amend any Tax Returns or waive or extend any statute of limitations, in each
case, with respect to the Pre-Closing Tax Period to the extent the RE Tax
Amount would reasonably be expected to materially increase as a result,
without the consent of the Seller's Representative.

  



  

(v) In the case of a Contest after the Closing Date that relates to
Taxes for which the Buyer is indemnified under _Section 7.20(f)_  (which
indemnification right has not terminated), the Seller's Representative shall
have the right, at its election, to control the conduct of such Contest (or
relevant portion thereof), but the Buyer shall have the right to participate
in such Contest at its own expense, and the Seller's Representative shall not
settle, compromise and/or concede any such Contest (or portion thereof)
without the prior written consent of the Buyer, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned;  _provided_ , that, that if
the Seller's Representative fails to assume control of the conduct of any such
Contest within a reasonable period following the receipt by the Seller's
Representative of notice of such Contest, Buyer shall have the right to
assume control of such Contest, but shall not settle, compromise and/or
concede any matter that could reasonably be expected to result in a material
liability for the Seller pursuant to _Section 7.20(f)_ without the Seller's
Representative's prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

existence.

Intermediate Holdco to be, as of immediately following the Mergers, (i) a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer and (ii) as a result of the Mergers, the
sole owner of all of the equity interests of the Surviving Company. Prior to
the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause Intermediate Holdco not to (i) engage in
any business activities or conduct any operations other than in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) except as expressly
contemplated by this Agreement, have any assets, liabilities or obligations
of any kind or nature whatsoever other than those incident to its formation
and equity interests in Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II LLC and (iii) take any
actions that Buyer, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II LLC would otherwise have
not been permitted to take hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement but subject to this _Section 7.24_ , the formation of
Intermediate Holdco shall not be deemed to breach or cause to be untrue any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Buyer. Buyer may cause
Intermediate Holdco to fulfill Buyer's monetary obligations under, or
obligations under _Section 7.13_ of, this Agreement and fulfillment of such
obligations by Intermediate Holdco shall be in satisfaction of Buyer's
obligations hereunder; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, the
foregoing shall not relieve the Buyer of any of its obligations hereunder.

_Buyer Prospectus_ "). For and in consideration of Buyer executing and
delivering this Agreement and agreeing to the terms hereof, and for other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is
hereby acknowledged, the Company, the Seller and the Seller's Representative
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agree that (a) none of such Persons
have now and shall not at any time hereafter have any right, title, interest
or claim of any kind, regardless of the factual basis of any such claim and

the Seller's Representative to pursue a claim against the Buyer for legal
relief against monies or other assets of Buyer held outside the Trust Account
or for specific performance or other equitable reliefÍ¾ and nothing in this

12.13 _Buyer Release_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Closing, the Buyer hereby absolutely,
unconditionally and irrevocably releases, indemnifies and discharges, and
the Buyer shall cause each of its Affiliates (including, following the
Closing, the Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries) (the " _Buyer
Releasors_ ") to absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably release,
indemnify and discharge the Seller and the Seller Related Parties, from any
and all claims, demands, rights, actions, suits, proceedings, liabilities,
obligations and causes of action of any kind and nature whatsoever, fixed or
contingent, known or unknown, liquidated or unliquidated, that any Buyer
Releasor or any Person claiming through or under a Buyer Releasor ever had or
now has or hereafter can, shall or may have arising out of, or relating to,
the organization, management or operation of the businesses of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary relating to any matter, occurrence, action or activity
prior to the Closing Date, except for (w) claims based on Fraud, (x)
covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement which contemplate
performance after the Closing or otherwise expressly by their terms survive
the Closing, each of which will survive in accordance with its terms, (y) the
agreements set forth on _Section 7.13(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedules and (z) the Ancillary Agreements.

  



    

 | 120| 
---|---|--- 

 



     



  

(b) Each Buyer Releasor is aware that it may hereafter discover
facts in addition to or different from those it now knows or believes to be
true with respect to the subject matter of the release provided for in this
_Section 12.13_ ; however, it is the intention of each Buyer Releasor that
such release shall be effective as a full and final accord and satisfactory
release of each and every matter specifically or generally referred to in
this _Section 12.13_. In furtherance of this intention, each Buyer
Releasor expressly waives and relinquishes any and all claims, rights or
benefits that it may have under Section 1542, and any similar provision in
any other jurisdiction, which provides as follows:

  



  

"A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW
OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE,
WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER
SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."

  



  

Each Buyer Releasor acknowledges that Section 1542, and any similar provision
in any other jurisdiction, if they exist, are designed to protect a
party from waiving claims which it does not know exist or may exist.
Nonetheless, each Buyer Releasor agrees that the waiver of Section 1542 and
any similar provision in any other jurisdiction is a material portion of the
releases intended by this _Section 12.13_ , and it therefore intends to waive
all protection provided by Section 1542 and any other similar provision in any
other jurisdiction. EACH BUYER RELEASOR FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS AWARE
THAT IT MAY HEREAFTER DISCOVER CLAIMS OR FACTS IN ADDITION TO OR
DIFFERENT FROM THOSE IT NOW KNOWS OR BELIEVES TO BE TRUE WITH RESPECT TO THE
MATTERS RELEASED HEREIN. NEVERTHELESS, IT INTENDS TO FULLY, FINALLY AND
FOREVER RELEASE ALL SUCH MATTERS, AND ALL CLAIMS RELATIVE THERETO, WHICH DO
NOW EXIST, MAY EXIST, OR HERETOFORE HAVE EXISTED BETWEEN SUCH PARTY, ON THE
ONE HAND, AND THE SELLER OR SELLER RELATED PARTY UNDER THIS _SECTION 12.13_ ,
ON THE OTHER HAND. IN FURTHERANCE OF SUCH INTENTION, THE RELEASES GIVEN
HEREIN SHALL BE AND REMAIN IN EFFECT AS FULL AND COMPLETE GENERAL RELEASES OF
ALL SUCH MATTERS, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DISCOVERY OR EXISTENCE OF ANY ADDITIONAL
OR DIFFERENT CLAIMS OR FACTS RELATIVE THERETO.

12.14 _Seller Release_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Closing, the Seller hereby absolutely,

the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective former, current and
future Representatives, successors or assigns that is not a party to this
Agreement (collectively, the " _Company Related Parties_ ") from any and all
claims, demands, rights, actions, suits, proceedings, liabilities, obligations
and causes of action of any kind and nature whatsoever, fixed or contingent,
known or unknown, liquidated or unliquidated, that the Seller, any of its
Affiliates or any Person claiming through or under the Seller or any of its
Affiliates ever had or now has or hereafter can, shall or may have arising
out of, or relating to, the organization, management or operation of the
businesses of the Buyer relating to any matter, occurrence, action or
activity prior to the Closing Date, except for (w) any rights to
indemnification or advancement of expenses pursuant to the documents set
forth in _Section 7.12_ , (x) covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement which contemplate performance after the Closing or otherwise
expressly by their terms survive the Closing, each of which will survive in
accordance with its terms, (y) the agreements set forth on _Section 7.13(a)_
of the Company Disclosure Schedules and (z) the Ancillary Agreements.

  



  

(b) Each Seller Releasor is aware that it may hereafter discover
facts in addition to or different from those it now knows or believes to be
true with respect to the subject matter of the release provided for in
_Section 12.10_ or this _Section 12.14_ ; however, it is the intention of
each Seller Releasor that such release shall be effective as a full and final
accord and satisfactory release of each and every matter specifically or
generally referred to in _Section 12.10_ or this _Section 12.14_ , in each
case except as otherwise set forth in such Section. In furtherance of this
intention, each Seller Releasor expressly waives and relinquishes any and all
claims, rights or benefits that it may have under Section 1542, and any
similar provision in any other jurisdiction, which provides as follows:

  



  

"A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW
OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE,
WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER
SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."

  



  

Each Seller Releasor acknowledges that Section 1542, and any similar
provision in any other jurisdiction, if they exist, are designed to protect a
party from waiving claims which it does not know exist or may exist.
Nonetheless, each Seller Releasor agrees that the waiver of Section 1542 and
any similar provision in any other jurisdiction is a material portion of the
releases intended by _Section 12.10_  or this _Section 12.14_ , and it
therefore intends to waive all protection provided by Section 1542 and any
other similar provision in any other jurisdiction. EACH SELLER RELEASOR
FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS AWARE THAT IT MAY HEREAFTER DISCOVER CLAIMS
OR FACTS IN ADDITION TO OR DIFFERENT FROM THOSE IT NOW KNOWS OR BELIEVES TO
BE TRUE WITH RESPECT TO THE MATTERS RELEASED HEREIN. NEVERTHELESS, IT INTENDS
TO FULLY, FINALLY AND FOREVER RELEASE ALL SUCH MATTERS, AND ALL CLAIMS
RELATIVE THERETO, WHICH DO NOW EXIST, MAY EXIST, OR HERETOFORE HAVE EXISTED
BETWEEN SUCH PARTY, ON THE ONE HAND, AND ANY COMPANY RELATED PARTY UNDER THIS
_SECTION 12.14_ , ON THE OTHER HAND. IN FURTHERANCE OF SUCH INTENTION, THE
RELEASES GIVEN HEREIN SHALL BE AND REMAIN IN EFFECT AS FULL AND
COMPLETE GENERAL RELEASES OF ALL SUCH MATTERS, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DISCOVERY
OR EXISTENCE OF ANY ADDITIONAL OR DIFFERENT CLAIMS OR FACTS RELATIVE THERETO.

12.15 _Governing Law and Jurisdiction_. Except as otherwise provided in
_Section 12.23_ hereof, this Agreement and any claim or controversy hereunder
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of
Delaware without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws thereof.

  



  

12.16 _Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process_. Except as
otherwise provided in _Section 12.23 _ hereof, any legal action, suit or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby may only be instituted in any state or federal court in
the State of Delaware, and each party waives any objection which such party
may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such action, suit
or proceeding, and irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any such court
in any such action, suit or proceeding.

  



  

12.17 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED (WHETHER BASED ON
CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

  



  

12.18 _Conveyance Taxes_. All sales, use, value added, transfer, stamp,
registration, documentary, excise, real property transfer or gains, or
similar Taxes incurred as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (other than any such Taxes relating to the Real Property Spinoff,
which shall be borne solely by the Seller) (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall
constitute Transaction Expenses and be payable by the Surviving Company
following the Closing, and the Seller's Representative and the Buyer shall
jointly file all required change of ownership and similar statements.

  



  

12.19 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with its terms or otherwise breach
such provisions. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and agree that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance or other equitable relief on the basis that the other
parties have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is
not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any party
seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall
not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any
such order or injunction.

12.20 _Seller 's Representative_.

  



  

(a) By virtue of the adoption of this Agreement, Oaktree, in its
capacity as the Seller's Representative, is hereby authorized, directed and
appointed to act as sole and exclusive agent, attorney-in-fact and
representative of the Seller, with full power of substitution with respect to
all matters under this Agreement, including determining, giving and receiving
notices and processes hereunder, calculating the Estimated Merger
Consideration and any adjustment to the Estimated Merger Consideration,
calculating the Earnout Shares to which the Seller is entitled, executing and
delivering, on behalf of the Seller, any and all documents or certificates to
be executed by the Seller in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, granting any waiver, consent, approval or
election, and making any filings with any Governmental Authority, on behalf of
the Seller under this Agreement, appointing, in its sole discretion, one or
more successor Seller's Representatives, contesting and settling any and all
adjustments pursuant to _Section 3.5_, resolving any other disputes
hereunder, performing the duties expressly assigned to the Seller's
Representative hereunder, and to engage and employ agents and representatives
and to incur such other expenses as the Seller's Representative shall
reasonably deem necessary or prudent in connection with the foregoing. The
Seller's Representative shall have the sole and exclusive right on behalf of
the Seller to take any action or provide any waiver, or receive any notice
with respect to the adjustments pursuant to _Section 3.5_, and to settle any
claim or controversy arising with respect thereto. Any such actions taken,
exercises of rights, power or authority, and any decision or determination
made by the Seller's Representative consistent herewith, shall be absolutely
and irrevocably binding on the Seller as if the Seller personally had taken
such action, exercised such rights, power or authority or made such decision
or determination in the Seller's individual capacity, and the Seller shall
have no right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same.

  



  

(b) The appointment of the Seller's Representative as the Seller's
attorney-in-fact revokes any power of attorney heretofore granted that
authorized any other Person or Persons to represent the Seller with regard to
this Agreement. The appointment of the Seller's Representative as attorney-
in-fact pursuant hereto is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable. The
obligations of the Seller pursuant to this Agreement (i) will not be
terminated by operation of law, death, mental or physical
incapacity, liquidation, dissolution, bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event
with respect to the Seller or any proceeding in connection therewith, or in
the case of a trust, by the death of any trustee or trustees or the
termination of such trust, or any other event, and (ii) shall survive the
delivery of an assignment by the Seller of the whole or any fraction of its
interest in any payment due to it under this Agreement.

  



    

 | 124| 
---|---|--- 

 



     



  

(c) The Seller's Representative hereby accepts the foregoing
appointment and agrees to serve as Seller's Representative, subject to the
provisions hereof, for the period of time from and after the date hereof
without compensation except for the reimbursement by the Seller of fees and
expenses incurred by the Seller's Representative in its capacity as such. The
Company and the Seller's Representative will, at least two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, direct, by joint written notice(s) to the
Buyer, that on the Closing Date an amount equal to $3,000,000 (the " _Seller
's Representative Holdback Amount_"), shall be paid directly to the Seller's
Representative as designated in such notice, as a fund for the fees and
expenses of the Seller's Representative incurred in connection with this
Agreement (the " _Seller 's Representative Holdback Account_"), with any
balance of the Seller's Representative Holdback Account not used for such
purposes (as determined by the Seller's Representative in good faith) to be
paid by the Seller's Representative to the Seller.

  



  

(d) For all purposes of this Agreement, the Buyer shall be entitled
to rely conclusively on the instructions and decisions of the
Seller's Representative as to the determination of any adjustment pursuant to
_Section 3.5_, or any other actions required or permitted to be taken by the
Seller's Representative hereunder or in connection with any of the
transactions and other matters contemplated hereby.

  



  

(e) The Seller's Representative shall not have any liability to the
Seller whatsoever with respect to its actions, decisions and determinations,
and shall be entitled to assume that all actions, decisions and determinations
are fully authorized by the Seller. The Seller shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Seller's Representative, its Affiliates and all of their
respective owners, Representatives, successors or assigns from and against
any and all Losses incurred or suffered by any such Person resulting
from, arising out of or relating or attributable to any and all actions,
decisions and determinations taken or made by the Seller's Representative in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

(f) The Seller's Representative shall be entitled to rely upon any
order, judgment, certification, demand, notice, instrument or other writing
delivered to it hereunder without being required to determine the authenticity
or the correctness of any fact stated therein or the propriety or validity of
the service thereof. The Seller's Representative may act in reliance upon any
instrument or signature believed by it to be genuine and may assume that the
Person purporting to give receipt or advice or make any statement or execute
any document in connection with the provisions hereof has been duly authorized
to do so. The Seller's Representative may conclusively presume that the
undersigned representative of any party hereto which is an entity other than a
natural person has full power and authority to instruct the Seller's
Representative on behalf of that party unless written notice to the contrary
is delivered to the Seller's Representative.

  



  

(g) The Seller's Representative may act pursuant to the advice of
counsel with respect to any matter relating to this Agreement, and shall not
be liable for any action taken or omitted by it in good faith in accordance
with such advice.

  



    

 | 125| 
---|---|--- 

 



     



  

(h) Each of the Buyer, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II LLC hereby
agrees that the Seller's Representative shall not, in its capacity as such,
have any liability to the Buyer, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II LLC or any of
their respective Affiliates whatsoever with respect to its actions, decisions
or determinations.

  



  

(i) The rights, powers and benefits of the Seller's Representative
under this Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

  



  

12.21 _Severability_. If any term, provision, agreement, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to
be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
agreements, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated
hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto.
Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in a reasonably acceptable manner so that the transactions
contemplated hereby may be consummated as originally contemplated to the
fullest extent possible.

  



  

12.22 _Interpretation_. The parties have participated in the drafting
and negotiation of this Agreement and if an ambiguity or question of
interpretation should arise, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties thereto and no presumption of burden of proof shall
arise favoring or burdening either party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision in this Agreement.

  



    

 | 126| 
---|---|--- 

 



     



  

12.23 _Financing Source Arrangements_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto: (a) agrees
that it will not bring or support any Person, or permit any of its Affiliates
to bring or support any Person, in any action, suit, proceeding, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or
description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against any Person that has committed or subsequently commits to
provide or otherwise enters into agreements in connection with the Debt
Financing (the "Financing Sources," which defined term for the purposes of
this provision shall include Bank of America, N.A., Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
Fenner and Smith Incorporated, Cadence Bank, N.A., any other lenders and their
respective former, current and future Affiliates, equity holders, members,
partners, controlling persons, officers, directors, employees, agents,
advisors and representatives involved in such Debt Financing) in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including, but not limited to, any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter, the Fee Letter or the
performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, in any forum
other than the federal and New York State courts located in the Borough of
Manhattan within the City of New York; (b) agrees that, except as specifically
set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, all claims or causes of action
(whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of
the Financing Sources in any way relating to the Debt Commitment Letter, the
Fee Letter or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated
thereby, shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the internal laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to
principles or rules of conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules
would require or permit the application of laws of another jurisdiction; and
(c) hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such party may
have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation (whether at law or in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) directly or indirectly arising out
of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter, THE FEE LETTER or
the performance thereof or the financing contemplated thereby.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i) the
Seller, the Seller's Representative and their respective subsidiaries,
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, managers,
members or stockholders shall not have any rights or claims against any
Financing Source in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or
therewith, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Debt Commitment Letter, the Fee Letter or the performance thereof or the
financings contemplated thereby, whether at law or in equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise and (ii) no Financing Source shall have any liability
(whether in contract, in tort or otherwise) to the Seller, the Seller's
Representative or any of their respective subsidiaries, Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, managers, members or
stockholders for any obligations or liabilities of any party hereto under
this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or
therewith, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Debt Commitment Letter, the Fee Letter or the performance thereof or the
financings contemplated thereby, whether at law or in equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Financing Sources are intended third-party beneficiaries of,
and shall be entitled to the protections of this provision and 12.2, 12.15
and 12.16 which cross-reference this Section 23 to the same extent as if the
Financing Sources were parties to this Agreement. This _Section 12.23_ , and
_Sections 12.2_ , _12.15_ and _12.16_ may not be amended, modified or
supplemented, or any of its provisions waived, without the written consent of
the Financing Sources, which consent may be granted or withheld in the sole
discretion of the Financing Sources. Nothing contained herein to the contrary
shall restrict the Company from pursuing any remedies it has against any
Financing Party pursuant to the terms of, or on account of an alleged default
by a Financing Party under, the Debt Commitment Letter.

ARTICLE I

  



  

 _DEFINITIONS AND USAGE_

  



  

Section 1.1 _Definitions_. As used in this Agreement, the
following terms shall have the following meanings:

  



  

" _Affiliate_ " means, with respect to any Person, any other Person directly
or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such
Person; _provided_ , that any portfolio company of Oaktree Capital Management,
L.P. or its Affiliates, that is not a portfolio company of the GFI
Representative (or any parallel or successor funds) shall be deemed not to be
an "Affiliate" of the GFI Representative to the extent neither the GFI
Representative nor any of its portfolio companies nor any officer,
director, general partner or managing member of any of the foregoing has any
material economic interest in, or exercises any control with respect to, any
such portfolio company. For the purposes of this definition, " _control_ "
(including the terms " _controlling_ " and " _controlled_ "), with respect to
the relationship between or among two or more Persons, means the possession,
directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the
affairs or management of such subject Person, whether through the ownership
of voting securities, as trustee or executor, by contract or otherwise.

  



  

" _Affiliate Transaction_ " shall have the meaning assigned to such term in
_Section 3.1(a)_.

  



  

" _Agreement_ " shall have the meaning assigned to such term in the Preamble.

  



  

" _beneficial ownership_ " has the meaning assigned to such term in Rule
13d-3 and Rule 13d-5 under the Exchange Act. The terms " _beneficially own_
" and " _beneficial owner_ " shall have correlative meanings. With respect to
the Selling Stockholders, beneficial ownership of Common Stock shall exclude
any shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock
beneficially owned by the Selling Stockholders, regardless of whether the
Preferred Stock is convertible within 60 days of the date of calculation. For
the avoidance of doubt, with respect to the Sponsors and any Sponsor
Affiliated Transferee, beneficial ownership shall include any Earnout Shares,
regardless of whether vested or unvested.

  



  

" _Board of Directors_ " means the board of directors of the Company.

  



  

" _By-Laws_ " means the by-laws of the Company, as they may be amended,
restated or otherwise modified from time to time.

  



  

" _Certificate of Incorporation_ " means the certificate of incorporation of
the Company, as it may be amended, restated or otherwise modified from time
to time.

  



  

" _Claim_ " shall have the meaning assigned to such term in _Section 6.1_.

  



  

" _Common Stock_ " shall have the meaning assigned to such term in the
Recitals.

  



    

 | 2| 
---|---|---

 | 6| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(a) By virtue of the adoption of this Agreement, each Selling
Stockholder hereby authorizes, directs and appoints the GFI Representative to
act as its sole and exclusive agent, attorney-in-fact and representative, and
grants a proxy to the GFI Representative over such Selling Stockholder's
Voting Securities, and hereby constitutes and appoints the GFI Representative
as the proxy holder thereof, with full power of substitution with respect to
all matters under this Agreement, including (i) determining, giving
and receiving notices and processes hereunder, (ii) executing and delivering,
on behalf of the Selling Stockholders, any and all documents or certificates

otherwise contest the same.

  



  

(b) The appointment of the GFI Representative as each Selling

proxy heretofore granted that authorized any other Person or Persons to
represent such Selling Stockholder with regard to this Agreement. The
appointment of the GFI Representative as attorney-in-fact and the grant to the
GFI Representative of a proxy hereto is coupled with an interest and is
irrevocable. The obligations of each Selling Stockholder pursuant to this
Agreement (i) will not be terminated by operation of law, death, mental or
physical incapacity, liquidation, dissolution, bankruptcy, insolvency or
similar event with respect to such Selling Stockholder or any proceeding in
connection therewith, or in the case of a trust, by the death of any
trustee or trustees or the termination of such trust, or any other event, and
(ii) shall survive the delivery of an assignment by any Selling Stockholder
of the whole or any fraction of its interest in any payment due to it under
this Agreement.

  



  

(c) The GFI Representative hereby accepts the foregoing appointment
and agrees to serve as the GFI Representative, subject to the
provisions hereof, for the period of time from and after the date hereof
without compensation except for the reimbursement by the Selling Stockholders
of fees and expenses incurred by the GFI Representative in its capacity as
such.

  



  

(d) For all purposes of this Agreement, the Company shall be
entitled to rely conclusively on the instructions and decisions of the
GFI Representative as to any other actions required or permitted to be taken
by the GFI Representative hereunder or in connection with any of the
transactions and other matters contemplated hereby.

  



    

 | 7| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) The GFI Representative shall not have any liability to the
Selling Stockholders whatsoever with respect to its actions, decisions
and determinations, and shall be entitled to assume that all actions,
decisions and determinations are fully authorized by each and every one of
the Selling Stockholders. The Selling Stockholders shall indemnify and hold
harmless the GFI Representative, its Affiliates and all of their respective
owners, representatives, successors or assigns from and against any and all
losses incurred or suffered by any such Person resulting from, arising out of
or relating or attributable to any and all actions, decisions and
determinations taken or made by the GFI Representative in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

(f) The GFI Representative shall be entitled to rely upon any order,
judgment, certification, demand, notice, instrument or other
writing delivered to it hereunder without being required to determine the
authenticity or the correctness of any fact stated therein or the propriety
or validity of the service thereof. The GFI Representative may act in reliance
upon any instrument or signature believed by it to be genuine and may assume
that the Person purporting to give receipt or advice or make any statement or
execute any document in connection with the provisions hereof has been duly
authorized to do so. The GFI Representative may conclusively presume that the
undersigned representative of any party hereto which is an entity other than a
natural person has full power and authority to instruct the GFI
Representative on behalf of that party unless written notice to the contrary
is delivered to the GFI Representative.

  



  

(g) The GFI Representative may act pursuant to the advice of counsel
with respect to any matter relating to this Agreement, and shall not be
liable for any action taken or omitted by it in good faith in accordance with
such advice.

  



  

(h) The Company hereby agrees that the GFI Representative shall not,
in its capacity as such, have any liability to the Company, or any of its
Affiliates whatsoever with respect to its actions, decisions or
determinations.

Sponsors' and the Sponsor Affiliated Transferees', as applicable,
aggregate direct or indirect beneficial ownership of Common Stock is
increased after the date hereof, the number of directors the GFI
Representative or Sponsors, as applicable, is entitled to designate pursuant
to _Section 5.2(a)_ or _Section 5.2(b)_ , as applicable shall be increased
(but not decreased) proportionally so that the percentage of directors the GFI
Representative or Sponsors, as applicable, is entitled to designate is
proportional to the direct or indirect beneficial ownership of the GFI
Representative and the Seller Affiliated Transferees or the Sponsor and
Sponsor Affiliated Transferees, as applicable (for such purposes, rounding up
to the next whole director); _provided_ that, in no event, will either the GFI
Representative or the Sponsors be entitled to nominate a majority of the
Board of Directors unless the GFI Representative's (including the Seller
Affiliated Transferees) or the Sponsors' (including the Sponsor Affiliated
Transferees), as applicable, direct and indirect beneficial
ownership constitutes a majority of the outstanding Voting Securities. Any
additional nominees to which such persons are entitled under this  _Section
5.2(g)_ shall qualify as independent directors pursuant to SEC Guidance and
the rules of the applicable stock exchange to the extent necessary for the
Company to comply with such rules and regulations.

  



  

(h) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company
agrees with the Sponsors and the Company agrees with the GFI
Representative and the Selling Stockholders to include the Designees in the
slate of nominees recommended by the Board of Directors and to use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the election of each such Designee to the
Board of Directors, including nominating each such Designee to be elected as
a director, recommending such Designee's election and soliciting proxies or
consents in favor thereof, in each case subject to applicable law.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _ARTICLE V_ ,
(i) for so long as the Seller Minimum Condition is satisfied, each Sponsor
Designee shall require the approval of the GFI Representative (which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless such
nominee is an investment professional and a bona fide officer or employee of
one of the Sponsors or their respective managing members, general partners or
management companies, and (ii) for so long as the Sponsor Minimum Condition is
satisfied, each GFI Designee shall require the approval of the Sponsors
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
unless such nominee is an investment professional and an officer or employee
of Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.

  



  

(j) In the event that a vacancy is created at any time by the death,
disability, retirement, resignation or removal of any director who was a GFI
Designee or Sponsor Designee, the Company agrees to take at any time and from
time to time all actions necessary to cause the vacancy created thereby to be
filled as promptly as practicable by a new GFI Designee or Sponsor Designee,
as applicable (with respect to the applicable Initial Term only, regardless
of the GFI Representative's or Sponsors' beneficial ownership of the Company
Common Stock at the time of such vacancy).

  



  

(k) Unless waived by a majority of the Board of Directors excluding
the GFI Designees (in the case of removal of a GFI Designee) or the
Sponsor Designees (in the case of removal of a Sponsor Designee), as
applicable, if the number of directors entitled to be designated as GFI
Designees or Sponsor Designees, as applicable, pursuant to _Section 5.2(a)_
and/or _Section 5.2(b)_ , as applicable, decreases, the Stockholders shall
take reasonable actions to cause a sufficient number of GFI Designees or
Sponsor Designees, as applicable, to resign from the Board of Directors as
promptly as possible, such that the number of GFI Designees or Sponsor
Designees, as applicable, after such resignation(s) equals the number of
directors the GFI Representative or the Sponsors, as applicable, would have
been entitled to designate pursuant to _Section 5.2(a)_ and/or _Section
5.2(b)_ , as applicable. Any vacancies created by such resignation may remain
vacant until the next annual meeting of stockholders or filled by a majority
vote of the remaining Board of Directors in accordance with the Certificate
of Incorporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such GFI Designee(s) or
Sponsor Designee(s), as applicable, need not resign from the Board of
Directors at or prior to the end of such director's term if such director(s)
is a member of the Initial Board and has not yet completed such director(s)
Initial Term.

  



  

Section 5.3 _Committees_.

  



  

(a) The Company agrees with the GFI Representative that it shall
take all reasonable actions to cause to be appointed to any committee of the
Board of Directors, unless waived by the GFI Representative, at least one GFI
Designee (if any), to the extent such director is permitted to serve on such
committees under SEC Guidance and the rules of any applicable stock exchange
and for so long as the Seller Higher Condition is satisfied; and

  



  

(b) The Company agrees with the Sponsors that it shall take all
reasonable actions to cause to be appointed to any committee of the Board of
Directors, unless waived by the Sponsors, at least one Sponsor Designee (if
any), to the extent such director is permitted to serve on such committees
under SEC Guidance and the rules of any applicable stock exchange, until such
time as the Earnout Shares (as defined in the Founder Shares Amendment
Agreement) have fully vested or expired without vesting, in each case pursuant
to the Founder Shares Amendment Agreement, whichever is earlier.

  



    

 | 14| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) It is understood by the parties hereto that the GFI
Representative and the Sponsors shall not have any obligation to appoint a
GFI Designee or Sponsor Designee, as applicable, to any committee of the
Board of Directors and any failure to exercise such right in this section in
a prior period shall not constitute any waiver of such right in a subsequent
period.

  



  

(d) The Company agrees with the GFI Representative and the Company
agrees with the Sponsors that during the period from the date hereof until
December 31, 2019, the Company shall establish and maintain an investment
committee of the Board (the " _Investment Committee_ "), the approval of
which shall be required for the Company or its Subsidiaries to purchase, rent,
license exchange or otherwise acquire any assets (including securities). The
Investment Committee shall consist of three Directors, including (so long as
such designees are entitled to serve on the Board) two Sponsor Designees and
one GFI Designee.

  



  

Section 5.4 _Subsidiaries_. The Company shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to take any action that, if taken by the Company, would
require the approval of the Board of Directors unless such action by such
Subsidiary has been approved by the Board of Directors in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement as would be applied to the Company.

relating to, arising out of, or by reason of any third party or
governmental claims relating to such Covered Person's status as a stockholder
or controlling person of the Company (including any and all losses, claims,
damages or liabilities under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other

 | 15| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 6.2 _Prepayment of Expenses_. To the extent not prohibited
by applicable law, the Company shall pay the expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees) incurred by a Covered Person in defending any Claim in
advance of its final disposition; _provided_ , _however_ , that, to the
extent required by applicable law, such payment of expenses in advance of the
final disposition of such Claim shall be made only upon receipt of an
undertaking by such Covered Person to repay all amounts advanced if it should
be ultimately determined that such Covered Person is not entitled to be
indemnified under this _ARTICLE VI_ or otherwise.

  



  

Section 6.3 _Claims_. If a claim for indemnification or
advancement of expenses under this _ARTICLE VI_ is not paid in full within 30
days after a written claim therefor by the Covered Person has been received
by the Company, such Covered Person may file suit to recover the unpaid
amount of such claim and, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled
to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim. In any such action the
Company shall have the burden of proving that the Covered Person is not
entitled to the requested indemnification or advancement of expenses under
applicable law.

  



  

Section 6.4 _Nonexclusivity of Rights_. The rights conferred on
any Covered Person by this _ARTICLE VI_ shall not be exclusive of any other
rights that such Covered Person may have or hereafter acquire under any
statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws or any
agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

  



  

Section 6.5 _Other Sources_. Subject to _Section 6.6_ , the
Company's obligation, if any, to indemnify or to advance expenses to
any Covered Person shall be reduced by any amount such Covered Person may
collect as indemnification or advancement of expenses from any other Person.

  



  

Section 6.6 _Indemnitor of First Resort_. The Company hereby
acknowledges that the Covered Persons may have certain rights to advancement
and/or indemnification by the Selling Stockholders or their Affiliates or the
Sponsors or their Affiliates, as applicable (in each case, other than
the Company and collectively, the " _Other Indemnitors_ "). In all events,
(i) the Company hereby agrees that it is the indemnitor of first resort
(i.e., its obligation to a Covered Person to provide advancement and/or
indemnification to such Covered Person are primary and any obligation of the
Other Indemnitors (including any Affiliate thereof other than the Company) to
provide advancement or indemnification hereunder or under any other
indemnification agreement (whether pursuant to contract, by-laws or charter),
or any obligation of any insurer of the Other Indemnitors to provide insurance
coverage, for the same expenses, liabilities, judgments, penalties, fines and
amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other
charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of such expenses,
liabilities, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement)
incurred by such Covered Person are secondary and (ii) if any Other Indemnitor
(or any Affiliate thereof, other than the Company) pays or causes to be paid,
for any reason, any amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder or under any
other indemnification agreement (whether pursuant to contract, by-laws or
charter) with such Covered Person, then (x) such Other Indemnitor (or such
Affiliate, as the case may be) shall be fully subrogated to all rights of such
Covered Person with respect to such payment and (y) the Company shall fully
indemnify, reimburse and hold harmless such Other Indemnitor (or such other
Affiliate, as the case may be) for all such payments actually made by such
Other Indemnitor (or such other Affiliate, as the case may be).

or privilege hereunder shall operate as waiver thereof nor shall any single
or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by law.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS

  



  

Section 5.1 _Board Powers_. The business and affairs of the Corporation
shall be managed by, or under the direction of, the Board. In addition to the
powers and authority expressly conferred upon the Board by statute, this
Second Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws (" _Bylaws_ ") of the
Corporation, the Board is hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do
all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation,
subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the DGCL and this Second Amended
and Restated Certificate.

  



    



 



    



  

Section 5.2 _Number, Election and Term_.

  



  

(a) The number of directors of the Corporation, other than those who may be
elected by the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock voting
separately by class or series, shall be fixed from time to time exclusively
by the Board pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the Board.

  



  

(b) Subject to _Section 5.5_ hereof, the Board shall be divided into three
classes, as nearly equal in number as possible and designated Class I, Class
II and Class III. The term of the initial Class I Directors shall expire at
the annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation held in 2019, the
term of the initial Class II Directors shall expire at the annual meeting of
the stockholders of the Corporation held in 2020 and the term of the initial
Class III Directors shall expire at the annual meeting of the stockholders of
the Corporation held in 2021.1 At each annual meeting of the stockholders of
the Corporation, successors to the class of directors whose term expires at
that annual meeting shall be elected for a three-year term. Subject to
_Section 5.5_ hereof, if the number of directors is changed, any increase or
decrease shall be apportioned by the Board among the classes so as to
maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible,
but in no case shall a decrease in the number of directors shorten the term
of any incumbent director.

  



  

(c) Subject to _Section 5.5_ hereof, a director shall hold office until the
annual meeting for the year in which his or her term expires and until his or
her successor has been elected and qualified, subject, however, to such
director's earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or
removal.

  



  

(d) Unless and except to the extent that the Bylaws shall so require, the
election of directors need not be by written ballot.

  



  

Section 5.3 _Newly Created Directorships and Vacancies_. Subject to
_Section 5.5_ hereof and the Investor Rights Agreement, newly created
directorships resulting from an increase in the number of directors and any
vacancies on the Board resulting from death, resignation,
retirement, disqualification, removal or other cause may be filled solely by
a majority vote of the remaining directors then in office, even if less than
a quorum, or by a sole remaining director (and not by stockholders), and any
director so chosen shall hold office for the remainder of the full term of
the class of directors to which the new directorship was added or in which the
vacancy occurred and until his or her successor has been elected and
qualified, subject, however, to such director's earlier death,
resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal.

  



  

Section 5.4 _Removal_. Subject to _Section 5.5_ hereof and the Investor
Rights Agreement, any or all of the directors may be removed from office at
any time, but only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of holders of a
majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock
of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors,
voting together as a single class.

  



  

Section 5.5 _Preferred Stock  - Directors_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this _Article V_ , and except as otherwise required by law,
whenever the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock shall have
the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect one or more
directors, the term of office, the filling of vacancies, the removal from
office and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the
terms of such series of the Preferred Stock as set forth in this Second
Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation)
and such directors shall not be included in any of the classes created
pursuant to this _Article V_ unless expressly provided by such terms.

  



  

  



  

  

1 _Note to Draft_ : This sentence will be adjusted in accordance with the
Investor Rights Agreement if the 2018 Annual Meeting is not held at the time
of the Special Meeting of Stockholders.

  



    



 



    



  

ARTICLE VI

  

BYLAWS

  



  

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law,
the Board shall have the power to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws.
The affirmative vote of a majority of the Board shall be required to adopt,
amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws. The Bylaws also may be adopted, amended,
altered or repealed by the stockholders; _provided_ , _however_ , that in
addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock
of the Corporation required by law or by this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the affirmative vote
of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class,
shall be required for the stockholders to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the
Bylaws, other than Sections 2.5(d) and Section 9.15, which may be amended,
altered or repealed only as set forth in Section 9.15 of the Bylaws; and
_provided further_ , _however_ , that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the
stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been
valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

called annual or special meeting of such holders and may not be effected by
written consent of the stockholders.

  



  

ARTICLE VIII

  

LIMITED LIABILITY; INDEMNIFICATION

  



  

Section 8.1 _Limitation of Director Liability_. A director of the
Corporation shall not be liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for
monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the
extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not
permitted under the DGCL as the same exists or may hereafter be amended. Any
amendment, modification or repeal of the foregoing sentence shall not
adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation
hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of
such amendment, modification or repeal.

  



  

Section 8.2 _Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_.

  



  

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as the same exists or
may hereafter be amended, the Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless
each person (an " _indemnitee_ ") who is or was made a party or is threatened
to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative (a " _proceeding_ ") by reason of the fact that he or she is
or was a director or officer of the Corporation or, while a director or
officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation
or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, other enterprise or nonprofit
entity, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan, whether
the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a
director, officer, employee or agent, or in any other capacity while serving
as a director, officer, employee or agent, against all liability and loss
suffered and expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees,
judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes and penalties and amounts paid in
settlement) reasonably incurred by such indemnitee in connection with such
proceeding. The Corporation shall to the fullest extent not prohibited by
applicable law pay the expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by an
indemnitee in defending or otherwise participating in any proceeding in
advance of its final disposition; _provided_ , _however_ , that, to the
extent required by applicable law, such payment of expenses in advance of the
final disposition of the proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an
undertaking, by or on behalf of the indemnitee, to repay all amounts so
advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that the indemnitee is not
entitled to be indemnified under this _Section 8.2_ or otherwise. The
rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred by this
_Section 8.2_ shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to
an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and
shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 8.2(a)_, except
for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification and advancement of
expenses, the Corporation shall indemnify and advance expenses to an
indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such
indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the
Board.

  



    



 



    



  

(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on

accrue on a daily basis at the Dividend Rate on the Stated Value of such share
of Series A Preferred Stock. Any dividends payable on the Series A Preferred

dividends declared upon shares of Series A Preferred Stock and any such
Parity Stock will be declared on a proportional basis, with the effect
that the amount of dividends declared per share will be declared and paid
among them in the same ratio as the amount of all accrued but unpaid
dividends as of the Dividend Payment Date for the applicable dividend period
per share of Series A Preferred Stock is to the amount of all accrued and
unpaid dividends as of the end of the applicable dividend period per share of
any Parity Stock.

  



  

(c) _Dividends After Redemption or Conversion_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this _Section 4_ , no share of Series A Preferred Stock shall
accrue any dividends after the date on which (i) such share has been redeemed
or purchased by the Corporation in accordance with the terms hereof, (ii) the
Corporation has validly sought to redeem or purchase such share in accordance
with  _Section 7_ but has been unable to do so because of the failure of the
holder thereof to return the certificate representing such share, so long as
the Corporation has set aside funds for such redemption or payment in
accordance with _Section 7(f)_, or (iii) such share has been converted in
accordance with _Section 8_ below; provided, that, in the case of
the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), all accrued and unpaid dividends
as of such date shall be paid (or, in the case of clause (ii), set aside for

 | 6| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) _Restrictions_. Until the Dividend Cessation Date of all shares of
Series A Preferred Stock, neither the Corporation nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall declare, pay or set aside any dividends on shares of any
other class or series of Capital Stock of the Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries, other than (i) dividends payable on (A) Senior Stock, (B) Parity
Stock in compliance, to the extent applicable, with the provisions of
_Section 4(b)_ , and (C) Common Stock payable solely in the form of additional
shares of Common Stock, and (ii) dividends or distributions by a Subsidiary.
Until the Dividend Cessation Date of all Series A Preferred Stock,
neither the Corporation nor any of its Subsidiaries shall redeem, purchase or
otherwise acquire directly or indirectly any (x) Junior Stock, other than
repurchases of Common Stock of departing directors and officers of the
Corporation, (y) Parity Stock, other than in compliance, to the extent
applicable, with the provisions of _Section 7(d)_.

  



  

(e) _Record Date_. The Board may fix a record date for the determination of
holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment
of a dividend declared thereon, which record date shall be no more than 60
days and no less than ten days prior to the date fixed for the payment
thereof.

  



  

Section 5. _Liquidation Event_.

  



  

(a) _Distributions_. Subject to the rights of the holders of any Senior
Stock or Parity Stock in connection therewith, upon any Liquidation
Event, each holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to be paid,
out of the assets of the Corporation legally available therefor, before any
distribution or payment out of the assets of the Corporation may be made to or
set aside for the holders of any Junior Stock in connection with such
Liquidation Event, an amount per share of Series A Preferred Stock held by
such holder equal to the sum of (i) the Stated Value _plus_ (ii) all accrued
and unpaid dividends, if any, with respect to such share calculated through
the day prior to such payment. Other than as expressly set forth in the
immediately foregoing sentence, upon receipt of the aggregate amount owed to
such holder upon a Liquidation Event (as determined in accordance with the
immediately foregoing sentence), no holder of Series A Preferred Stock, in
its capacity as such, shall be entitled to any further payments upon
the occurrence of any Liquidation Event. All shares of Series A Preferred
Stock which have received the full amount to which they are entitled under
this Certificate of Designations upon the occurrence of a Liquidation Event or
for which the full amount to which they are entitled has been made available
by the Corporation in accordance with _Section 7(f)_ shall,
automatically and without further action on the part of the Corporation or
any holder thereof, be cancelled effective upon receipt or the
making available by the Corporation of such amount in accordance with
_Section 7(f)_; provided that such cancellation shall not impair the right
of a holder of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock to subsequently receive
the amount that has been made available.

  



    

 | 7| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) _Partial Distributions_. If, upon any such Liquidation Event, the assets
of the Corporation to be distributed in respect of the Series A Preferred
Stock and any Parity Stock are insufficient to permit payment in respect
thereof of the aggregate amount to which they are entitled under this
Certificate of Designations upon such Liquidation Event, then the entire
assets available to be distributed to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock
and the Parity Stock shall be distributed _pro rata_ among such holders of
Series A Preferred Stock and Parity Stock based upon the aggregate amounts to
which they would otherwise be entitled upon such Liquidation Event with
respect to such Series A Preferred Stock or Parity Stock, as applicable.

  



  

(c) _Notice of Liquidation Event_. The Corporation shall provide written
notice to the Stockholders' Representative and each holder of Series A
Preferred Stock at least 10 days prior to the consummation of a Liquidation
Event.

  



  

Section 6. _Voting Rights_.

  



  

(a) _Voting Rights Generally_. Other than any voting rights provided by law
or as expressly provided by this Certificate of Designations, the holders of
the Series A Preferred Stock (in their capacities as such) shall not have
voting rights of shareholders under this Certificate of Designations, the
Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws and the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, on account of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock from time to
time held by such holders.

  



  

(b) _Stockholders ' Representative_.

  



  

(i) Each holder of Series A Preferred Stock hereby irrevocably
constitutes and appoints GFI as the sole and exclusive attorney-in-fact
and proxy of such holder of Series A Preferred Stock (the " _Stockholders '
Representative_"), with full power of substitution and resubstitution, to
exercise or abstain from exercising the rights granted to the holders of
Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to _Section 4(d)_ , this _Section 6_ and
_Section 8_ to the fullest extent permitted by law. Any action taken or not
taken by the Stockholders' Representative pursuant to this _Section 6(b)_
shall not be subject to challenge or input from any such holder of Series A
Preferred Stock. Each holder of Series A Preferred Stock hereby revokes any
and all previous proxies with respect to such holder's Series A Preferred
Stock and no subsequent proxies (whether revocable or irrevocable) shall be
given (and if given, such subsequent proxies shall not be effective) by such
holder with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock that conflict with this
proxy. This proxy and power of attorney is intended to be irrevocable and is
coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable proxy
and is granted for good and valuable consideration the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged and shall be valid and binding on
any person to whom the holder of Series A Preferred Stock may transfer any of
its Series A Preferred Stock. The power of attorney granted herein is a
durable power of attorney and shall survive the dissolution, bankruptcy,
death or incapacity of each holder of Series A Preferred Stock. The provisions
of this _Section 6(b)_ shall terminate with respect to a holder of Series A
Preferred Stock once such holder no longer owns any Series A Preferred Stock.
The Stockholders' Representative may appoint one or more successor
representatives to the Stockholders' Representative, subject to the approval
of holders of a majority of the Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding.

  



  

(ii) Each holder of Series A Preferred Stock hereby irrevocably
delegates all power and authority to the Stockholders' Representative to
exercise, on behalf of such holder of Series A Preferred Stock, any and all
rights of such holder in respect of such Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to
_Section 4(d)_ , this _Section 6_ and _Section 8_ , including the granting of
any waivers or the exercise of any consent, approval or voting rights or
powers on behalf of such holder.

  



    

 | 8| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iii) The Stockholders' Representative shall not, in the absence of
bad faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence, have any liability to the
holders of Series A Preferred Stock whatsoever with respect to its actions,
decisions and determinations, and shall be entitled to assume that all
actions, decisions and determinations are fully authorized by each and every
one of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock. The Corporation hereby agrees
that the Stockholders' Representative shall not, in its capacity as
such, have any liability to the Corporation or any of its Affiliates
whatsoever with respect to its actions, decisions or determinations.

  



  

(c) _Consent Rights_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, until the Dividend
Cessation Date of all Series A Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall not,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly (whether by
merger, consolidation, amendment of this Certificate of Designations or
otherwise), without the prior written approval of the Stockholders'
Representative:

  



  

(i) create, or authorize the creation of, or issue or obligate
itself to issue any shares of, (A) Senior Stock, (B) Parity Stock
(including any Series A Preferred Stock, other than the Series A Preferred
Stock issued pursuant to the Merger Agreement), (C) any Capital Stock that
votes as a single class with the Series A Preferred Stock on any of the
matters which require the consent of the holders of a majority of the Series
A Preferred Stock pursuant to this _Section 6_ , or (D) any Capital Stock of a
Subsidiary of the Corporation, other than a wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Corporation; _provided_ , _that_ , this clause (D) shall not apply to Capital
Stock of a Subsidiary of the Corporation issued as consideration for a bona-
fide acquisition by the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries approved by
the Board and the primary purpose of which is not to obtain financing;

  



  

(ii) reclassify, alter or amend any Capital Stock of the Corporation
or its Subsidiaries if such reclassification, alteration or amendment
would render such other Capital Stock senior to or pari passu with the Series
A Preferred Stock in respect of the distribution of assets on the
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation or the payment of
dividends;

  



  

(iii) enter into any agreement with respect to, or consummate, any
merger, consolidation or similar transaction with any other Person
pursuant to which the Corporation or such Subsidiary would not be the
surviving entity in such transaction, if as a result of such transaction, any
capital stock or equity or equity-linked securities of such Person would rank
senior to or pari passu with the Series A Preferred Stock as to the payment
of dividends or in the distribution of assets in the event of any voluntary or
involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the surviving entity or
such Subsidiary;

  



    

 | 9| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iv) assume, incur or guarantee, or authorize the creation,
assumption, incurrence or guarantee of, any indebtedness for borrowed money
(specifically excluding letters of credit, performance or payment bonds, and
capitalized lease obligations) if, after taking into account such assumption,
incurrence or guarantee of such indebtedness for borrowed money, the aggregate
outstanding amount of such indebtedness for borrowed money of the Company and
its Subsidiaries would exceed $5,000,000 on a consolidated basis, other than
(x) any indebtedness for borrowed money under the credit facility being
executed and delivered in connection with the closing of the Merger
Agreement (the " _Existing Facility_ "), or (y) any refinancing thereof in a
principal amount not to exceed the available amount under the Existing
Facility;

  



  

(v) authorize or consummate any Change of Control or Liquidation
Event unless on or prior to the consummation of such Change of Control or
Liquidation Event, all shares of Series A Preferred Stock will be redeemed,
paid or purchased in full at the Redemption Price; or

  



  

(vi) alter, amend, supplement, restate, waive or otherwise modify any
provision of this Certificate of Designations or any other governing document
of the Corporation (including any other Certificate of Designations) in a
manner that would reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the
rights or obligations of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock.

  



  

Section 7. _Redemption Rights_.

  



  

(a) _Redemption Events_.

  



  

(i) The Corporation may, at any time and from time to time, redeem
all or any portion of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock then
outstanding;  _provided_ , that any such redemption shall be on a _pro rata_
basis among the holders of Series A Preferred Stock in accordance with the
number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock then held by such holders.

  



  

(ii) Concurrently with and as a condition to the consummation of a
Change of Control, the Corporation shall repurchase all Series A Preferred
Stock then outstanding.

  



  

(iii) In the event of a Qualifying Equity Sale, the Corporation shall,
as promptly as practicable (but in any event within three (3) Business Days
of the consummation of such Qualifying Equity Sale), use all of the Net Cash
Proceeds from such Qualifying Equity Sale to redeem the maximum number of
shares of Series A Preferred Stock that are redeemable from such Net Cash
Proceeds from such Qualifying Equity Sale at the Redemption Price (as defined
below) per share; _provided_ that any such redemption shall be on a
_pro rata_ basis among the holders of Series A Preferred Stock in accordance
with the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock then held by such
holders.

  



  

(iv) In the event of a Significant Disposition, the Corporation shall,
as promptly as practicable (but in any event within three (3) Business Days
of the consummation of such Significant Disposition), use all of the Net Cash
Proceeds from such Significant Disposition to redeem the maximum number of
shares of Series A Preferred Stock that are redeemable from such Net Cash
Proceeds from such Significant Disposition at the Redemption Price per share;
_provided_ that (x) any such redemption shall be on a _pro rata_ basis among
the holders of Series A Preferred Stock in accordance with the number of
shares of Series A Preferred Stock then held by such holders and (y) if any
portion of the consideration from such Significant Disposition is not in the
form of cash consideration, then for purposes of this clause (iv) any such
non-cash consideration shall be included in the calculation of Net Cash
Proceeds as and when converted to cash.

  



    

 | 10| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) _Redemption Price_. In connection with any redemption, the Corporation
shall pay a price per share of Series A Preferred Stock equal to the Stated
Value thereof plus all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon calculated through
the day prior to such redemption (the " _Redemption Price_ "). There shall be
no premium or penalty payable in connection with any redemption. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, if the Corporation pays or makes
available in accordance with _Section 7(f)_ to the holder of a share of
Series A Preferred Stock the Redemption Price in respect of such share of
Series A Preferred Stock when and as required, such share of Series A
Preferred Stock shall be cancelled notwithstanding failure of the holder
thereof to return the certificate representing such share; provided that such
cancellation shall not impair the right of the holder of such share to
subsequently receive the amount that has been made available.

  



  

(c) _Notice of Redemption_. Except as otherwise provided herein, the
Corporation shall provide written notice (a " _Redemption Notice_ ") to the
Stockholders' Representative and each record holder of Series A Preferred
Stock of any redemption not more than 60 nor less than 10 days prior to the
date on which such redemption is to be made. Such notice shall set forth in
reasonable detail the date on which such redemption is to be made (the "
_Redemption Date_ ") and a calculation specifying the amount owed to such
holder by the Corporation in respect of each share of Series A Preferred Stock
held by such holder as of the Redemption Date. To the extent that any
redemption is being made in connection with the occurrence of one or more
events, the Corporation may make the redemption contingent upon consummation
of such event.

  



  

(d) _Redemptions of Less than All Shares_. If the Corporation is redeeming
less than all of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding, the
Corporation shall redeem such number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and
each class or series of Parity Stock required to be redeemed, if any, such
that the amount payable to each holder of Series A Preferred Stock and Parity
Stock in respect of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock and/or Parity
Stock, as the case may be, upon a Liquidation Event immediately after
consummation of such redemption (and after giving effect to any conversion in
connection with such redemption) bears, as nearly as practicable, the same
proportion to the total amount payable to holders of Series A Preferred Stock
and Parity Stock upon a Liquidation Event in respect of such shares
immediately prior to consummation of such redemption (and after giving effect
to any conversion in connection with such redemption). In the event that, for
any holder of Series A Preferred Stock, fewer than the total number of shares
of Series A Preferred Stock represented by any certificate are redeemed, a
new certificate representing the number of unredeemed shares of Series A
Preferred Stock shall be issued to the holder thereof without cost to such
holder within five Business Days after surrender of the certificate
representing the redeemed shares of Series A Preferred Stock.

  



  

(e) _Other Redemptions or Acquisitions_. The Series A Preferred Stock shall
have no maturity date or scheduled redemption date. Nothing herein shall be
deemed to limit the right of the Corporation to purchase such Series A
Preferred Stock from time to time.

  



    

 | 11| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(f) _Effectiveness of Redemption_. If a Redemption Notice has been duly
given and if, on or before the Redemption Date specified in the
Redemption Notice, all funds necessary for the redemption have been set aside
by the Corporation, separate and apart from its other assets, in trust or
escrow for the pro rata benefit of the holders of shares of Series A Preferred
Stock called for redemption, so as to be and continue to be available
therefor (subject to applicable escheat laws), or deposited by the Corporation
with a bank or trust company in trust or escrow for the pro rata benefit of
the holders of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock called for
redemption, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so
called for redemption has not been surrendered for cancellation, on and after
the Redemption Date, all shares of Series A Preferred Stock so called for
redemption shall be cancelled and shall cease to be outstanding, all
dividends with respect to such shares shall cease to accrue on such Redemption
Date, and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith on such
Redemption Date cease and terminate without further liability to, or
obligation of, the Corporation, except only the right of the holders thereof
to receive the Redemption Price without interest.

  



  

Section 8. _Conversion_.

  



  

(a) _Upon Election by Holders_. Any holder of Series A Preferred Stock may
elect, by written notice to the Corporation (x) at any time and from time to
time on or after the third anniversary of the Closing Date or (y) at any time
and from time to time on or after the occurrence of a Non-Payment Event or
Default Event until such Non-Payment Event or Default Event is cured by the
Corporation, to cause the Corporation to convert, without the payment of
additional consideration by such holder, all or any portion of the issued and
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by such holder, as
specified by such holder in such notice, into a number of shares of Common
Stock determined in accordance with _Section 8(b)_ on the terms described
below. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if a conversion of Series
A Preferred Stock pursuant to this _Section 8(a)_ is to be made in
connection with a transaction involving the Corporation, the conversion of
any shares of Series A Preferred Stock may, at the election of the holder
thereof, be conditioned upon the consummation of such transaction, in which
case such conversion shall not be deemed to be effective until such
transaction has been consummated. A holder of Series A Preferred Stock must do
each of the following in order to convert shares of Series A Preferred Stock:
(i) complete the conversion notice provided by the Conversion Agent,
and deliver an executed copy of such notice to the Conversion Agent; (ii)
deliver a certificate or certificates representing the shares of Series A
Preferred Stock to be converted to the Conversion Agent, or, if such
certificates have been lost, mutilated or destroyed, an affidavit of loss;
(iii) if reasonably required by the Conversion Agent, furnish appropriate
endorsements and transfer documents; and (iv) if required, pay any stock
transfer, documentary, stamp or similar taxes. The date on which a holder of
Series A Preferred Stock complies with the procedures in this _Section 8(a)_
with regard to the conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock is
referred to as the "Conversion Date" applicable to such shares. The Conversion
Agent shall, on behalf of the holder of such Series A Preferred Stock,
convert the Series A Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, in
accordance with the terms of the notice delivered by such holder described
above and this Certificate of Designations. On the Conversion Date, the
shares of Series A Preferred Stock so converted will be canceled and will
cease to be issued and outstanding (and all rights of the holder of such
Series A Preferred Stock (in its capacity as such and only with respect to the
shares of Series A Preferred Stock so converted) shall terminate without
further liability to, or obligation of, the Corporation effective as of the
Conversion Date) and the Common Stock issued upon such conversion in respect
thereof shall be issued and outstanding (and no holder of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock to be converted shall have any rights prior to the Conversion
Date in respect of such Common Stock issued upon conversion). Upon the
conversion of Series A Preferred Stock in connection with the occurrence of a
Non-Payment Event, the holders of such Series A Preferred Stock shall have no
other remedies available for such Non-Payment Event and the Corporation shall
have no further liability for, or obligation to, the holders of such Series A
Preferred Stock in respect of such Non-Payment Event.

  



    

 | 12| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) _Effect of Conversion_. Subject to compliance by a holder of Series A
Preferred Stock with the requirements of _Section 8(a)_ , the Corporation
shall issue to such holder a number of shares of Common Stock determined by
dividing (i) the Stated Value plus accrued and unpaid dividends as of the
Conversion Date for the share(s) of Series A Preferred Stock to be converted
by (ii) the VWAP per share of Common Stock for the 30 consecutive Trading
Days ending on the Trading Day immediately prior to the Conversion Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if a Non-Payment Event or Default Event has
occurred and has not been cured by the Corporation as of the Conversion Date,
the Corporation shall issue to such holder a number of shares of Common Stock
determined by dividing (1) the Stated Value plus accrued and unpaid dividends
as of the Conversion Date for the share(s) of Series A Preferred Stock to be
converted by (2) the product of (x) 90% multiplied by (y) the VWAP per share
of Common Stock for the 30 consecutive Trading Days ending on the Trading Day
immediately prior to the Conversion Date.

  



  

(c) _Obligations of Corporation on Conversion_. As promptly as practicable
(but in any event within three (3) Business Days) after a conversion has been
effected, the Corporation shall, or shall cause the Conversion Agent to, mail
to the converting holder:

  



  

(i) a certificate or certificates representing the number of shares
of Common Stock issuable by reason of such conversion in such name or names
and such denomination or denominations as the converting holder has specified
or, upon the request of the converting holder, evidence of the issuance of
such shares in book-entry form; and

  



  

(ii) a certificate representing any shares of Series A Preferred
Stock which were represented by the certificate or certificates delivered to
the Corporation in connection with such conversion but which were not
converted.

  



  

(d) _Reservation of Common Stock_. The Corporation shall at all times
reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares
of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of issuance upon the conversion of
the Series A Preferred Stock, such number of shares of Common Stock issuable
upon the conversion of all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, and
shall take all action required to increase the authorized number of shares of
Common Stock if at any time there shall be insufficient authorized but
unissued shares of Common Stock to permit such reservation or to permit the
conversion of all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, including
engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder consent of any

(e) _Taxes and Governmental Matters_.

  



  

(i) The issuance of certificates for shares of Common Stock pursuant
to this _Section 8_ shall be made without charge to the holders of such
Series A Preferred Stock for any issuance tax in respect thereof or other cost
incurred by the Corporation in connection with such conversion and the
related issuance of shares of Common Stock; _provided_ that the Corporation
shall not, however, be required to pay any such tax that may be payable in
respect of any transfer involved in the issuance or delivery of shares
of Series A Preferred Stock, Common Stock or other securities in a name other
than that in which the shares of Series A Preferred Stock with respect to
which such shares or other securities are issued or delivered were registered,
or in respect of any payment to any Person other than a payment to the
registered holder thereof, and shall not be required to make any such
issuance, delivery, or payment unless and until the Person otherwise entitled
to such issuance, delivery or payment has paid to the Corporation the amount
of any such tax or has established, to the Corporation\'s satisfaction, that
such tax has been paid or is not payable.

  



  

(ii) The Corporation and the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock
shall treat any conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock into Common Stock
as a transaction described in Section 368(a)(1)(E) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended, and the Treasury regulations promulgated
thereunder, unless otherwise required pursuant to a change in applicable law
occurring after the date hereof.

  



  

(f) _Other Obligations of the Corporation in Respect of Conversions_. Upon
any conversion of any share of Series A Preferred Stock, the Corporation
shall take all such actions as are necessary in order to assure that the
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable, free and clear of all taxes, liens, charges and
encumbrances with respect to the issuance thereof. The Corporation shall use
reasonable best efforts to assist the holder of Series A Preferred Stock
to ensure that shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion may be so
issued without violation of any applicable law or governmental regulation or
any requirements of any domestic securities exchange upon which shares of
Common Stock may be listed (except for official notice of issuance which
shall be delivered as promptly as practicable by the Corporation upon each
such issuance).

  



  

(g) _Fractional Shares_. The Corporation may not issue fractional interests
in shares of Common Stock and, instead, shall pay to the holder in cash the
then-current market value of any fraction of a share as promptly as
practicable (and in any event no later than the date on which the certificate
or certificates representing the Common Stock are issued) following the
relevant Conversion Date.

  



  

(h) _Record Holder of Underlying Securities as of Conversion Date_. The
Person or Persons entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable and/or cash
payable upon conversion of Series A Preferred Stock on a Conversion Date shall
be treated for all purposes as the record holder(s) of such shares of Common
Stock as of the close of business on such Conversion Date. In the event that a
holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall not by written notice designate the
name in which shares of Common Stock to be issued (and/or cash payments in
lieu of fractional shares to be paid) upon conversion of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock should be registered or paid or the manner in which such
shares should be delivered, the Corporation shall be entitled to register and
deliver such shares, and make such payment, in the name of the holder shown
on the records of the Corporation in any manner the Corporation in good
faith deems reasonable.

  



    

 | 14| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 9. _Status of Converted, Redeemed or Otherwise Reacquired
Shares_. Shares of Series A Preferred Stock converted, or redeemed or
otherwise purchased or acquired by the Corporation, in accordance with this
Certificate of Designations, shall be canceled and retired and shall not be
reissued, sold or transferred, and the Corporation may thereafter take such
appropriate action (without the need for stockholder action) as may be
necessary to retire such shares and reduce the authorized number of shares of
Series A Preferred Stock accordingly.

  



  

Section 10. _Preemptive Rights_. Holders of Series A Preferred Stock,
in their capacities as such, shall not have any preemptive rights.

  



  

Section 11. _Transfers_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Certificate of Designations, a holder of Series A Preferred Stock may
transfer all or any portion of shares of such Series A Preferred Stock to any
Person who is not, at the time of such transfer, a Competitor. For the
avoidance of doubt, the restrictions, conditions, and obligations contained in
this Certificate of Designations to which such holder of Series A Preferred
Stock is subject shall continue to be applicable to and binding upon the
transferee(s) of such Series A Preferred Stock and the transferee(s) of such
Series A Preferred Stock shall have agreed in writing to be bound by
the provisions of this Certificate of Designations. To the extent any shares
of Series A Preferred Stock transferred pursuant to this  _Section 11_ are
converted into shares of Common Stock, such shares of Common Stock shall be
entitled to all rights and remain subject to all restrictions, conditions,
and obligations that are binding upon Common Stock at the time of such
conversion.

  



  

Section 12. _Replacement_. Upon receipt of evidence reasonably
satisfactory to the Corporation (an affidavit of the registered holder shall
be satisfactory) of the ownership and the loss, theft, destruction or
mutilation of any certificate evidencing one or more shares of any Series A
Preferred Stock (or any Common Stock issued upon conversion thereof), and in
the case of any such loss, theft or destruction, upon receipt of indemnity
reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation (provided that if the holder is a
financial institution or other institutional investor, its own agreement
shall be satisfactory), or, in the case of any such mutilation upon surrender
of such certificate, the Corporation shall (at its expense) execute and
deliver in lieu of such certificate a new certificate of like kind
representing the number of shares of such Capital Stock represented by such
lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated certificate and dated the date of such
lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated certificate. Dividends shall accrue on
any Series A Preferred Stock represented by such new certificate from the
date with respect to which dividends have been fully paid on such lost,
stolen, destroyed or mutilated certificate.

  



  

Section 13. _Withholding_. All payments and distributions (or deemed
payments and distributions) on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock (and on
the shares of Common Stock received upon the conversion of the Series A
Preferred Stock), including, without limitation, issuance of shares of Common
Stock upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, shall be subject to
withholding and backup withholding of tax to the extent required by law,
subject to applicable exemptions, and amounts withheld, if any, shall be
treated as received by holders. The Corporation shall cooperate as reasonably
requested by the holders to avoid or minimize any withholding taxes that may
become due in connection with any payment or distribution (or deemed payment
or distribution) on the Series A Preferred Stock (or on shares of Common
Stock received upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock);
_provided_ that such cooperation does not cause material detriment to the
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries. The Corporation shall not withhold any
U.S. federal income taxes with respect to a holder if such holder provides a
properly completed and executed Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, unless
otherwise required pursuant to a change in applicable law occurring after the
date hereof. Any payments by the Corporation in respect of the Series A
Preferred Stock shall be made out of funds legally available for payment
thereof and shall only be made to the extent that the payment thereof would
not cause the Corporation to be rendered insolvent or to violate any law to
which the Corporation is subject.

  



    

 | 15| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 14. _Record Holders_. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, the Corporation may deem and treat the record holder of any
share of the Series A Preferred Stock as the true and lawful owner thereof
for all purposes, and the Corporation shall not be affected by any notice to
the contrary.

  



  

Section 15. _Notices_.

  



  

(a) _To Holders_. All public announcements, notices or communications to the
holders of, or otherwise in respect of, the Series A Preferred Stock shall be
given or delivered for purposes of this Certificate of Designations if given
in writing and delivered in person or by first class mail, postage prepaid.
All notices or communications shall also be given or delivered for purposes of
this Certificate of Designations if given or delivered in such manner as may
be permitted in this Certificate of Designations, in the Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws or by applicable law or regulation. Furthermore, if
the Series A Preferred Stock is issued in book-entry form through The
Depository Trust Company or any similar facility, such notices may be given or
delivered to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock in any manner
permitted by such facility and such notices will be deemed given and delivered
in compliance with this Certificate of Designations.

  



  

(b) _To the Corporation_. All notices or communications to the Corporation
shall be deemed given and delivered to the Corporation if given in writing
and delivered in person or by first class mail, postage prepaid to the
Corporation\'s principal place of business.

  



  

Section 16. _Other Rights_. The shares of Series A Preferred Stock
shall not have any rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers or
relative, participating, optional or other special rights, or qualifications,
limitations or restrictions thereof, other than as expressly set forth
herein, in the Certificate of Incorporation or as provided by applicable law
and regulation.

  



  

Section 17. _Remedies_. Except as set forth in the last sentence of
_Section 8(a)_ of this Certificate of Designations, the remedies available
to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock under this Certificate of
Designations shall be in addition to any other remedy to which such holders
are entitled at law or in equity, and the election to pursue any such remedy
shall not restrict, impair or otherwise limit the holders of Series A
Preferred Stock from seeking to pursue any other remedy to which it is
entitled under this Certificate of Designations, at law or in equity. Prior
to conversion, payment of the Redemption Price in respect of a share of Series
A Preferred Stock shall be in full satisfaction of any claim or remedy of a
holder thereof in respect of such share of Series A Preferred Stock.

  



  

Section 18. _Tax Treatment of Series A Preferred Stock_. The
Corporation and the holders shall treat the Series A Preferred Stock as equity
for all applicable U.S. federal income, state and local income tax purposes,
unless otherwise required by a change in applicable law occurring after the
date hereof.

Designations, including, without limitation, by amending its Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws or through any reorganization, transfer of assets,
consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities.

STOCKHOLDERS MEETINGS

  



  

Section 2.1. Annual Meetings. The annual meeting of stockholders shall be
held at such place and time and on such date as shall be determined by the
Board and stated in the notice of the meeting, provided that the Board may in
its sole discretion determine that the meeting shall not be held at any
place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote communication
pursuant to _Section 9.5(a)_. At each annual meeting, the stockholders
shall elect those directors of the Corporation to fill any term of a
directorship that expires on the date of such annual meeting and may transact
any other business as may properly be brought before the meeting.

  



  

Section 2.2. Special Meetings. Subject to the rights of the holders of any
outstanding series of the Preferred Stock, and to the requirements of
applicable law, special meetings of stockholders, for any purpose or purposes,
may be called only by (i) the Chairman of the Board or the Chief Executive
Officer, (ii) the Board pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the
Board, (iii) a Sponsor Designee (as defined in the Investor Rights Agreement
(the " _Investor Rights Agreement_ "), dated [__], entered into by and among
the Corporation, M III Sponsor I LLC, M III Sponsor I LP, and any other
Sponsor Affiliated Transferees (as defined in the Investor Rights Agreement)
thereunder who become party thereto and by and among the Corporation and each
of Infrastructure and Energy Alternatives, LLC, any other Seller Affiliated
Transferees (as defined in the Investor Rights Agreement) thereunder who

Special meetings of stockholders shall be held at such place and time and on

notice of the meeting, provided that the Board may in its sole discretion
determine that the meeting shall not be held at any place, but may instead be

Section 2.3. Notices. Notice of each stockholders meeting stating the place,
if any, date, and time of the meeting, and the means of remote communication,
if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in
person and vote at such meeting, shall be given in the manner permitted by
Section 9.3 to each stockholder entitled to vote thereat by the Corporation
not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting. If
said notice is for a stockholders meeting other than an annual meeting, it
shall in addition state the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is
called, and the business transacted at such meeting shall be limited to the
matters so stated in the Corporation's notice of meeting (or any supplement
thereto). Any meeting of stockholders as to which notice has been given may be
postponed, and any special meeting of stockholders as to which notice has
been given may be cancelled, by the Board upon public announcement (as
defined in Section 2.7(c)) given before the date previously scheduled for
such meeting.

  



    



 



    



  

Section 2.4. Quorum. Except as otherwise provided by applicable law, the
Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation, as the same may be amended or
restated from time to time (the " _Certificate of Incorporation_ ") or these
By Laws, the presence, in person or by proxy, at a stockholders meeting of
the holders of shares of outstanding capital stock of the Corporation
representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting
shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at such meeting,
except that when specified business is to be voted on by a class or series of
stock voting as a class, the holders of shares representing a majority of the
voting power of the outstanding shares of such class or series shall
constitute a quorum of such class or series for the transaction of such
business. If a quorum shall not be present or represented by proxy at any
meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, the chairman of the
meeting may adjourn the meeting from time to time in the manner provided in
_Section 2.6_ until a quorum shall attend. The stockholders present at a
duly convened meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment,
notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a
quorum. Shares of its own stock belonging to the Corporation or to another
corporation, if a majority of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote
in the election of directors of such other corporation is held, directly or
indirectly, by the Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be
counted for quorum purposes; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
limit the right of the Corporation or any such other corporation to vote
shares held by it in a fiduciary capacity.

  



  

Section 2.5. Voting of Shares.

  



  

(a) _Voting Lists_. The Secretary shall prepare, or shall cause the officer
or agent who has charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation to prepare, at
least 10 days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the
stockholders of record entitled to vote at such meeting and showing the
address and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder.
Nothing contained in this _Section 2.5(a)_ shall require the Corporation to
include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on
such list. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for
any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours for a
period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting: (i) on a reasonably
accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain
access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii)
during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the
Corporation. In the event that the Corporation determines to make the list
available on an electronic network, the Corporation may take reasonable steps
to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the
Corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be
produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time
thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. If a meeting
of stockholders is to be held solely by means of remote communication as
permitted by _Section 9.5(a)_, the list shall be open to the examination of
any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably
accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such
list shall be provided with the notice of meeting. The stock ledger shall be
the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the list
required by this _Section 2.5(a)_ or to vote in person or by proxy at any
meeting of stockholders.

  



  

(b) _Manner of Voting_. At any stockholders meeting, every stockholder
entitled to vote may vote in person or by proxy. If authorized by the Board,
the voting by stockholders or proxy holders at any meeting conducted by remote
communication may be effected by a ballot submitted by electronic
transmission (as defined in _Section 9.3_), provided that any such
electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with
information from which the Corporation can determine that the electronic
transmission was authorized by the stockholder or proxy holder. The Board, in
its discretion, or the chairman of the meeting of stockholders, in such
person's discretion, may require that any votes cast at such meeting shall be
cast by written ballot.

  



  

(c) _Proxies_. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of
stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in
writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for
such stockholder by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon
after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer
period. Proxies need not be filed with the Secretary of the Corporation until
the meeting is called to order, but shall be filed with the Secretary before
being voted. Without limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize
another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy, either of the
following shall constitute a valid means by which a stockholder may grant such
authority.

  



  

(i) A stockholder may execute a writing authorizing another person or persons
to act for such stockholder as proxy. Execution may be accomplished by the
stockholder or such stockholder's authorized officer, director, employee or
agent signing such writing or causing such person's signature to be affixed
to such writing by any reasonable means, including, but not limited to, by
facsimile signature.

  



    



 



    



  

(ii) A stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such
stockholder as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of an
electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or
to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like
agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to
receive such transmission, provided that any such electronic transmission
must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be
determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the
stockholder. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable
reproduction of the writing or transmission authorizing another person or
persons to act as proxy for a stockholder may be substituted or used in lieu
of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the
original writing or transmission could be used; provided that such copy,
facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete
reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.

  



  

(d) _Required Vote_. Subject to the rights of the holders of one or more
series of preferred stock of the Corporation (" _Preferred Stock_ "), voting
separately by class or series, to elect directors pursuant to the terms of one
or more series of Preferred Stock, the election of directors shall be
determined by a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders present
in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote
thereon. All other matters shall be determined by the vote of a majority of
the votes cast by the stockholders present in person or represented by proxy
at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon, unless the matter is one upon
which, by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation, these By Laws or
applicable stock exchange rules, a different vote is required, in which case
such provision shall govern and control the decision of such matter.

  



  

(e) _Inspectors of Election_. The Board may, and shall if required by law,
in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more persons as
inspectors of election, who may be employees of the Corporation or otherwise
serve the Corporation in other capacities, to act at such meeting of
stockholders or any adjournment thereof and to make a written report thereof.
The Board may appoint one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace
any inspector who fails to act. If no inspectors of election or alternates are
appointed by the Board, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint one or more
inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before discharging his or
her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of
inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her
ability. The inspectors shall ascertain and report the number of outstanding
shares and the voting power of each; determine the number of shares present
in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and the validity of proxies
and ballots; count all votes and ballots and report the results; determine
and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any
challenges made to any determination by the inspectors; and certify their
determination of the number of shares represented at the meeting and their
count of all votes and ballots. No person who is a candidate for an office at
an election may serve as an inspector at such election. Each report of an
inspector shall be in writing and signed by the inspector or by a majority
of them if there is more than one inspector acting at such meeting. If there
is more than one inspector, the report of a majority shall be the report of
the inspectors.

  



  

Section 2.6. Adjournments. Any meeting of stockholders, annual or special,
may be adjourned by the chairman of the meeting, from time to time, whether
or not there is a quorum, to reconvene at the same or some other place. Notice
need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the date, time, and place,
if any, thereof, and the means of remote communication, if any, by which
stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote
at such adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which
the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the stockholders, or the
holders of any class or series of stock entitled to vote separately as a
class, as the case may be, may transact any business that might have been
transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30
days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned
meeting, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder
of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

  



    



 



    



  

Section 2.7. Advance Notice for Business.

  



  

(a) _Annual Meetings of Stockholders_. No business may be transacted at an
annual meeting of stockholders, other than business that is either (i)
specified in the Corporation's notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto)
given by or at the direction of the Board, (ii) otherwise properly brought
before the annual meeting by or at the direction of the Board or (iii)
otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting by any stockholder of
the Corporation (x) who is a stockholder of record on the date of the giving
of the notice provided for in this _Section 2.7(a)_ and on the record date
for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at such annual meeting
and (y) who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this _Section
2.7(a)_. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 2.7(a)_ to the contrary,
only persons nominated for election as a director to fill any term of a
directorship that expires on the date of the annual meeting pursuant to
_Section 3.2_ will be considered for election at such meeting.

  



  

(i) In addition to any other applicable requirements, for business (other
than nominations) to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a
stockholder, such stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper
written form to the Secretary of the Corporation and such business must
otherwise be a proper matter for stockholder action. Subject to _Section
2.7(a)(iii)_, a stockholder's notice to the Secretary with respect to such
business, to be timely, must be received by the Secretary at the principal
executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on
the 90th day nor earlier than the opening of business on the 120th day before
the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of
stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that the annual meeting is
called for a date that is not within 45 days before or after such anniversary
date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not earlier
than the opening of business on the 120th day before the meeting and not
later than the later of (x) the close of business on the 90th day before the
meeting or (y) the close of business on the 10th day following the day on
which public announcement of the date of the annual meeting is first made by
the Corporation. The public announcement of an adjournment of an annual
meeting shall not commence a new time period for the giving of a
stockholder's notice as described in this Section 2.7(a).

  



  

(ii) To be in proper written form, a stockholder's notice to the Secretary
with respect to any business (other than nominations) must set forth as to
each such matter such stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting
(A) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the
annual meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including the text of
any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event such business
includes a proposal to amend these By Laws, the language of the proposed
amendment) and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual
meeting, (B) the name and record address of such stockholder and the name and
address of the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made,
(C) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the
Corporation that are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and
by the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made, (D) a
description of all arrangements or understandings between such stockholder
and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made and any
other person or persons (including their names) in connection with the
proposal of such business by such stockholder, (E) any material interest of
such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the
proposal is made in such business and (F) a representation that
such stockholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the annual
meeting to bring such business before the meeting.

  



  

(iii) The foregoing notice requirements of this _Section 2.7(a)_ shall be
deemed satisfied by a stockholder as to any proposal (other than nominations)
if the stockholder has notified the Corporation of such stockholder's
intention to present such proposal at an annual meeting in compliance with
Rule 14a-8 (or any successor thereof) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "), and such stockholder has complied
with the requirements of such Rule for inclusion of such proposal in a proxy
statement prepared by the Corporation to solicit proxies for such annual
meeting. No business shall be conducted at the annual meeting of stockholders
except business brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this _Section 2.7(a)_, provided, however, that once
business has been properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance
with such procedures, nothing in this _Section 2.7(a)_ shall be deemed to
preclude discussion by any stockholder of any such business. If the Board or
the chairman of the annual meeting determines that any stockholder proposal
was not made in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 2.7(a)_ or
that the information provided in a stockholder's notice does not satisfy the
information requirements of this Section 2.7(a), such proposal shall not be
presented for action at the annual meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section 2.7(a), if the stockholder (or a qualified
representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual meeting of
stockholders of the Corporation to present the proposed business, such
proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in
respect of such matter may have been received by the Corporation.

  



  

(iv) In addition to the provisions of this _Section 2.7(a)_, a stockholder
shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth
herein. Nothing in this _Section 2.7(a)_ shall be deemed to affect any
rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporation's
proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.

  



    



 



    



  

(b) _Special Meetings of Stockholders_. Only such business shall be
conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been
brought before the meeting pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting.
Nominations of persons for election to the Board may be made at a special
meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the
Corporation's notice of meeting only pursuant to _Section 3.2_.

  



  

(c) _Public Announcement_. For purposes of these By Laws, " _public
announcement_ " shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow

DIRECTORS

  



  

Section 3.1. Powers. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be
managed by or under the direction of the Board, which may exercise all such
powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by
statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these By Laws required
to be exercised or done by the stockholders. Directors need not be
stockholders or residents of the State of Delaware.

  



    



 



    



  

Section 3.2. Advance Notice for Nomination of Directors.

  



  

(a) Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the following
procedures shall be eligible for election as directors of the Corporation,
except as may be otherwise provided in the Investor Rights Agreement or
provided by the terms of one or more series of Preferred Stock with respect
to the rights of holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock to elect
directors. Nominations of persons for election to the Board at any annual
meeting of stockholders, or at any special meeting of stockholders called for
the purpose of electing directors as set forth in the Corporation's notice of
such special meeting, may be made (i) by or at the direction of the Board or
(ii) by any stockholder of the Corporation (x) who is a stockholder of record
on the date of the giving of the notice provided for in this _Section 3.2_
and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote
at such meeting and (y) who complies with the notice procedures set forth in
this _Section 3.2_.

  



  

(b) In addition to any other applicable requirements, for a nomination to be
made by a stockholder, such stockholder must have given timely notice thereof
in proper written form to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a
stockholder's notice to the Secretary must be received by the Secretary at
the principal executive offices of the Corporation (i) in the case of an
annual meeting, not later than the close of business on the 90th day nor
earlier than the opening of business on the 120th day before the
anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders;
provided, however, that in the event that the annual meeting is called for a
date that is not within 45 days before or after such anniversary date, notice
by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not earlier than the
opening of business on the 120th day before the meeting and not later than the
later of (x) the close of business on the 90th day before the meeting or (y)
the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which public
announcement of the date of the annual meeting was first made by the
Corporation; and (ii) in the case of a special meeting of stockholders called
for the purpose of electing directors, not later than the close of business on
the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of
the special meeting is first made by the Corporation. In no event shall the
public announcement of an adjournment of an annual meeting or special meeting
commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder's notice as
described in this _Section 3.2_.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in paragraph (b) to the contrary, in the event
that the number of directors to be elected to the Board at an annual meeting
is greater than the number of directors whose terms expire on the date of the
annual meeting and there is no public announcement by the Corporation naming
all of the nominees for the additional directors to be elected or specifying
the size of the increased Board before the close of business on the 90th day
prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting
of stockholders, a stockholder's notice required by this _Section 3.2_
shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the
additional directorships created by such increase that are to be filled by
election at such annual meeting, if it shall be received by the Secretary at
the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close
of business on the 10th day following the date on which such public
announcement was first made by the Corporation.

  



  

(d) To be in proper written form, a stockholder's notice to the Secretary
must set forth (i) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to
nominate for election as a director (A) the name, age, business address and
residence address of the person, (B) the principal occupation or employment
of the person, (C) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock
of the Corporation that are owned beneficially or of record by the person and
(D) any other information relating to the person that would be required to be
disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in
connection with solicitations of proxies for election of directors pursuant
to Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder; and (ii) as to the stockholder giving the notice (A) the name and
record address of such stockholder and the name and address of the beneficial
owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is made, (B) the class or series
and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation that are owned
beneficially and of record by such stockholder and the beneficial owner,
if any, on whose behalf the nomination is made, (C) a description of all
arrangements or understandings relating to the nomination to be made by such
stockholder among such stockholder, the beneficial owner, if any, on whose
behalf the nomination is made, each proposed nominee and any other person or
persons (including their names), (D) a representation that such stockholder
intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the
persons named in its notice and (E) any other information relating to such
stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination
is made that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other
filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for
election of directors pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Such notice must be
accompanied by a written consent of each proposed nominee to being named as a
nominee and to serve as a director if elected.

  



    



 



    



  

(e) If the Board or the chairman of the meeting of stockholders determines
that any nomination was not made in accordance with the provisions of this
_Section 3.2_, then such nomination shall not be considered at the meeting
in question. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section
3.2_, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder)
does not appear at the meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to present
the nomination, such nomination shall be disregarded, notwithstanding that
proxies in respect of such nomination may have been received by the
Corporation.

  



  

(f) In addition to the provisions of this _Section 3.2_, a stockholder
shall also comply with all of the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth
herein. Nothing in this _Section 3.2_ shall be deemed to affect any rights
of the holders of Preferred Stock to elect directors pursuant to the
Certificate of Incorporation.

  



  

Section 3.3. Compensation. Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of
Incorporation or these By Laws, the Board shall have the authority to fix the
compensation of directors. The directors may be reimbursed their expenses, if
any, of attendance at each meeting of the Board and may be paid either a
fixed sum for attendance at each meeting of the Board or other compensation as
director. No such payment shall preclude any director from serving the
Corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation
therefor. Members of committees of the Board may be allowed like compensation
and reimbursement of expenses for service on the committee.

owner of such uncertificated shares; or (C) with respect to certificated
shares or uncertificated shares, the endorsement or instruction is made by any
other appropriate person or by an agent who has actual authority to act on
behalf of the appropriate person;

  



  

(iii) the Corporation has received a guarantee of signature of the person
signing such endorsement or instruction or such other reasonable
assurance that the endorsement or instruction is genuine and authorized as
the Corporation may request;

(b) Whenever any transfer of shares shall be made for collateral security and
not absolutely, the Corporation shall so record such fact in the entry of

instruction for registration of transfer thereof is presented to the
Corporation, both the transferor and transferee request the Corporation to do
so.

to inspect for any proper purpose the stock ledger and the other books and
records of the Corporation, vote such shares, receive dividends or
notifications with respect to such shares and otherwise exercise all the
rights and powers of the owner of such shares, except that a person who is
the beneficial owner of such shares (if held in a voting trust or by

noted conspicuously on the certificate representing such shares or, in the
case of uncertificated shares, contained in a notice, offering circular or
prospectus sent by the Corporation to the registered owner of such shares
within a reasonable time prior to or after the issuance or transfer of such
shares, may be enforced against the holder of such shares or any successor or
transferee of the holder including an executor, administrator, trustee,
guardian or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person
or estate of the holder.

  



  

(b) A restriction imposed by the Corporation on the transfer or the
registration of shares of the Corporation or on the amount of shares of the
Corporation that may be owned by any person or group of persons, even if
otherwise lawful, is ineffective against a person without actual knowledge of
such restriction unless: (i) the shares are certificated and such restriction
is noted conspicuously on the certificate; or (ii) the shares are
uncertificated and such restriction was contained in a notice, offering
circular or prospectus sent by the Corporation to the registered owner of
such shares prior to or within a reasonable time after the issuance or
transfer of such shares.

  



  

Section 7.9. Regulations. The Board shall have power and authority to make
such additional rules and regulations, subject to any applicable requirement
of law, as the Board may deem necessary and appropriate with respect to the
issue, transfer or registration of transfer of shares of stock or
certificates representing shares. The Board may appoint one or more transfer
agents or registrars and may require for the validity thereof that
certificates representing shares bear the signature of any transfer agent or
registrar so appointed.

  



  

ARTICLE VIII

  



  

INDEMNIFICATION

  



  

Section 8.1. Right to Indemnification. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, the
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each person (hereinafter an "
_Indemnitee_ ")who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party
to or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or completed
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (hereinafter a " _proceeding_ "), by reason of the fact that he
or she is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or, while a director
or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, other enterprise or
nonprofit entity, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan,
whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity
as a director, officer, employee or agent, or in any other capacity while
serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, against all liability and
loss suffered and expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees,
judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes and penalties and amounts paid in
settlement) reasonably incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with such
proceeding; provided, however, that, except as provided in _Section 8.3_
with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the
Corporation shall indemnify an Indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or
part thereof) initiated by such Indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part
thereof) was authorized by the Board.

  



    



 



    



  

Section 8.2. Right to Advancement of Expenses. In addition to the right to
indemnification conferred in _Section 8.1_, an Indemnitee shall also have
the right to be paid by the Corporation to the fullest extent not prohibited
by applicable law the expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys'
fees) incurred in defending or otherwise participating in any such
proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an " _advancement
of expenses_ "); provided, however, that, if the Delaware General Corporation
Law (" _DGCL_ ") requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by
an Indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the
Corporation (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is
rendered by such Indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an
employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon the Corporation's receipt of
an undertaking (hereinafter an " _undertaking_ "), by or on behalf of such
Indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be
determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified under this
_Article VIII_ or otherwise.

  



  

Section 8.3. Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit. If a claim under _Section
8.1_ or _Section 8.2_ is not paid in full by the Corporation within 60 days
after a written claim therefor has been received by the Corporation,
except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case
the applicable period shall be 20 days, the Indemnitee may at any time
thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of
the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit
brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to
the terms of an undertaking, the Indemnitee shall also be entitled to be paid
the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (a) any suit brought by
the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a
suit brought by an Indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of
expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (b) in any suit brought by the
Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an
undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon
a final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal
(hereinafter a " _final adjudication_ ") that, the Indemnitee has not met any
applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Neither the
failure of the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to
such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its
stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such
suit that indemnification of the Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances
because the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in
the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including a
determination by its directors who are not parties to such action, a
committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders)
that the Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall
create a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard
of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the Indemnitee, shall be
a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a
right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or by
the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms
of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled
to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this _Article
VIII_ or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.

  



  

Section 8.4. Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The rights provided to any Indemnitee
pursuant to this _Article VIII_ shall not be exclusive of any other right,
which such Indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under applicable law, the
Certificate of Incorporation, these By Laws, an agreement, a vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

  



  

Section 8.5. Insurance. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its
expense, to protect itself and/or any director, officer, employee or agent of
the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.

  



  

Section 8.6. Indemnitor of First Resort. In all events, the Corporation
hereby agrees that (i) its obligation to an Indemnitee to provide
advancement and/or indemnification to such Indemnitee is primary, (ii) any
obligation of the Investor Holder (as defined in the Certificate of
Incorporation) or Sponsor Holder (as defined in the Certificate of
Corporation) to provide advancement or indemnification hereunder or under any
other indemnification agreement (whether pursuant to contract, by-laws or
charter), or any obligation of an insurer of the Investor Holder (as defined
in the Certificate of Corporation) or Sponsor Holder (as defined in the
Certificate of Corporation) to provide insurance coverage, for the same
expenses, liabilities, judgements, penalties, fines and amount paid in
settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or
payable in connection with or in respect of such expenses, liabilities,
judgements, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement) incurred by such
Indemnitee are secondary and subsequent to the foregoing obligations of the
Corporation and (iii) if the Investor Holder (as defined in the Certificate of
Corporation) or Sponsor Holder (as defined in the Certificate of Corporation)
pays or causes to be paid, for any reason, any amounts otherwise
indemnifiable, hereunder or under any other indemnification agreement
(whether pursuant to contract, by-laws or charter) with such Indemnitee, then
(x) the Investor Holder (as defined in the Certificate of Corporation) or
Sponsor Holder (as defined in the Certificate of Corporation) (as the case
may be), shall be fully subrogated to all rights of such Indemnitee with
respect to such payment and (y) the Corporation shall fully indemnify,
reimburse and hold harmless the Investor Holder (as defined in the Certificate
of Corporation) or Sponsor Holder (as defined in the Certificate of
Corporation) (as the case may be), for all such payments actually made by the
Investor Holder (as defined in the Certificate of Corporation) or Sponsor
Holder (as defined in the Certificate of Corporation) (as the case may be).

  



    



 



    



  

Section 8.7. Indemnification of Other Persons. This _Article VIII_ shall
not limit the right of the Corporation to the extent and in the manner
authorized or permitted by law to indemnify and to advance expenses to persons
other than Indemnitees. Without limiting the foregoing, the Corporation may,
to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board, grant rights to
indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to any employee or agent
of the Corporation and to any other person who is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan, to the
fullest extent of the provisions of this _Article VIII_ with respect to the
indemnification and advancement of expenses of Indemnitees under this
_Article VIII_.

  



  

Section 8.8. Amendments. Any repeal or amendment of this _Article VIII_ by
the Board or the stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in applicable
law, or the adoption of any other provision of these By Laws inconsistent with
this _Article VIII_, will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be
prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in
applicable law permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification
rights to Indemnitees on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto),
and will not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection
existing hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to such
repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision; provided
however, that amendments or repeals of this Article VIII shall require the
affirmative vote of the stockholders holding at least 66.7% of the voting
power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation.

  



  

Section 8.9. Certain Definitions. For purposes of this _Article VIII_, (a)
references to "other enterprise" shall include any employee benefit plan; (b)
references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person
with respect to an employee benefit plan; (c) references to "serving at the
request of the Corporation" shall include any service that imposes duties on,
or involves services by, a person with respect to any employee benefit
plan, its participants, or beneficiaries; and (d) a person who acted in good
faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest
of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be
deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interest of the
Corporation" for purposes of Section 145 of the DGCL.

  



  

Section 8.10. Contract Rights. The rights provided to Indemnitees pursuant to
this _Article VIII_ shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue
as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, agent or
employee and shall inure to the benefit of the Indemnitee's heirs, executors
and administrators.

  



  

Section 8.11. Severability. If any provision or provisions of this _Article
VIII_ shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason
whatsoever: (a) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions of this _Article VIII_ shall not in any way be affected or
impaired thereby; and (b) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of
this _Article VIII_ (including, without limitation, each such portion of
this _Article VIII_ containing any such provision held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the
intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable.

MISCELLANEOUS

  



  

Section 9.1. Place of Meetings. If the place of any meeting of stockholders,
the Board or committee of the Board for which notice is required under these
By Laws is not designated in the notice of such meeting, such meeting shall be
held at the principal business office of the Corporation; provided, however,
if the Board has, in its sole discretion, determined that a meeting shall not
be held at any place, but instead shall be held by means of remote
communication pursuant to _Section 9.5_ hereof, then such meeting shall not
be held at any place.

  



    



 



    



  

Section 9.2. Fixing Record Dates.

  



  

(a) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any
adjournment thereof, the Board may fix a record date, which shall not precede
the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the
Board, and which record date shall not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days
before the date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed by the Board, the
record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a
meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the business day
next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at
the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which the
meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice
of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of
the meeting; provided, however, that the Board may fix a new record date for
the adjourned meeting.

  



  

(b) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any
rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any
change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other
lawful action, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not
precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted,
and which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to such action. If
no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any
such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board
adopts the resolution relating thereto.

  



  

Section 9.3. Means of Giving Notice.

  



  

(a) _Notice to Directors_. Whenever under applicable law, the Certificate of
Incorporation or these By Laws notice is required to be given to any
director, such notice shall be given either (i) in writing and sent by mail,
or by a nationally recognized delivery service, (ii) by means of facsimile
telecommunication or other form of electronic transmission, or (iii) by oral
notice given personally or by telephone. A notice to a director will be
deemed given as follows: (i) if given by hand delivery, orally, or by
telephone, when actually received by the director, (ii) if sent through the
United States mail, when deposited in the United States mail, with postage
and fees thereon prepaid, addressed to the director at the director's address
appearing on the records of the Corporation, (iii) if sent for next day
delivery by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service, when
deposited with such service, with fees thereon prepaid, addressed to the
director at the director's address appearing on the records of the
Corporation, (iv) if sent by facsimile telecommunication, when sent to the
facsimile transmission number for such director appearing on the records of
the Corporation, (v) if sent by electronic mail, when sent to the
electronic mail address for such director appearing on the records of the
Corporation, or (vi) if sent by any other form of electronic transmission,
when sent to the address, location or number (as applicable) for such director
appearing on the records of the Corporation.

  



  

(b) _Notice to Stockholders_. Whenever under applicable law, the Certificate
of Incorporation or these By Laws notice is required to be given to any
stockholder, such notice may be given (i) in writing and sent either by hand
delivery, through the United States mail, or by a nationally recognized
overnight delivery service for next day delivery, or (ii) by means of a form
of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder, to the extent
permitted by, and subject to the conditions set forth in Section 232 of the
DGCL. A notice to a stockholder shall be deemed given as follows: (i) if given
by hand delivery, when actually received by the stockholder, (ii) if sent
through the United States mail, when deposited in the United States mail, with
postage and fees thereon prepaid, addressed to the stockholder at the
stockholder's address appearing on the stock ledger of the Corporation, (iii)
if sent for next day delivery by a nationally recognized overnight delivery
service, when deposited with such service, with fees thereon prepaid,
addressed to the stockholder at the stockholder's address appearing on the
stock ledger of the Corporation, and (iv) if given by a form of electronic
transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given and
otherwise meeting the requirements set forth above, (A) if by facsimile
transmission, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has
consented to receive notice, (B) if by electronic mail, when directed to an
electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive
notice, (C) if by a posting on an electronic network together with
separate notice to the stockholder of such specified posting, upon the later
of (1) such posting and (2) the giving of such separate notice, and (D) if by
any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder. A
stockholder may revoke such stockholder's consent to receiving notice by
means of electronic communication by giving written notice of such
revocation to the Corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if
(1) the Corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two
consecutive notices given by the Corporation in accordance with such consent
and (2) such inability becomes known to the Secretary or an Assistant
Secretary or to the Corporation's transfer agent, or other person responsible
for the giving of notice; provided, however, the inadvertent failure to treat
such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other
action.

  



    



 



    



  

(c) _Electronic Transmission_. " _Electronic transmission_ " means any form
of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper,
that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved and reviewed by a
recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such
a recipient through an automated process, including but not limited to
transmission by telex, facsimile telecommunication, electronic mail, telegram
and cablegram.

  



  

(d) _Notice to Stockholders Sharing Same Address_. Without limiting the
manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively by the Corporation
to stockholders, any notice to stockholders given by the Corporation under any
provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By Laws
shall be effective if given by a single written notice to stockholders who
share an address if consented to by the stockholders at that address to whom
such notice is given. A stockholder may revoke such stockholder's consent by
delivering written notice of such revocation to the Corporation. Any
stockholder who fails to object in writing to the Corporation within 60 days
of having been given written notice by the Corporation of its intention to
send such a single written notice shall be deemed to have consented to
receiving such single written notice.

  



  

(e) _Exceptions to Notice Requirements_. Whenever notice is required to be
given, under the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By Laws, to
any person with whom communication is unlawful, the giving of such notice to
such person shall not be required and there shall be no duty to apply to any
governmental authority or agency for a license or permit to give such notice
to such person. Any action or meeting that shall be taken or held without
notice to any such person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the
same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. In the event that
the action taken by the Corporation is such as to require the filing of a
certificate with the Secretary of State of Delaware, the certificate shall
state, if such is the fact and if notice is required, that notice was given
to all persons entitled to receive notice except such persons with whom
communication is unlawful.

  



  

Whenever notice is required to be given by the Corporation, under any
provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By Laws, to
any stockholder to whom (1) notice of two consecutive annual meetings of
stockholders and all notices of stockholder meetings or of the taking
of action by written consent of stockholders without a meeting to such
stockholder during the period between such two consecutive annual meetings,
or (2) all, and at least two payments (if sent by first-class mail) of
dividends or interest on securities during a 12-month period, have been
mailed addressed to such stockholder at such stockholder's address as shown on
the records of the Corporation and have been returned undeliverable, the
giving of such notice to such stockholder shall not be required. Any action
or meeting that shall be taken or held without notice to such stockholder
shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given.
If any such stockholder shall deliver to the Corporation a written notice
setting forth such stockholder's then current address, the requirement that
notice be given to such stockholder shall be reinstated. In the event that the
action taken by the Corporation is such as to require the filing of a
certificate with the Secretary of State of Delaware, the certificate need not
state that notice was not given to persons to whom notice was not required to
be given pursuant to Section 230(b) of the DGCL. The exception in subsection
(1) of the first sentence of this paragraph to the requirement that notice be
given shall not be applicable to any notice returned as undeliverable if the
notice was given by electronic transmission.

  



  

Section 9.4. Waiver of Notice. Whenever any notice is required to be given
under applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation, or these By Laws, a
written waiver of such notice, signed before or after the date of such meeting
by the person or persons entitled to said notice, or a waiver by electronic
transmission by the person entitled to said notice, shall be deemed equivalent
to such required notice. All such waivers shall be kept with the books of the
Corporation. Attendance at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of
such meeting, except where a person attends for the express purpose of
objecting to the transaction of any business on the ground that the meeting
was not lawfully called or convened.

  



    



 



    



  

Section 9.5. Meeting Attendance via Remote Communication Equipment.

discretion, and subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board
may adopt, stockholders and proxy holders not physically present at a meeting
of stockholders may, by means of remote communication:

  



  

(i) participate in a meeting of stockholders; and

  



  

(ii) be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of stockholders,
whether such meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by means
of remote communication, provided that (A) the Corporation shall implement
reasonable measures to verify that each person deemed present and permitted
to vote at the meeting by means of remote communication is a stockholder or
proxy holder, (B) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to
provide such stockholders and proxy holders a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the
stockholders, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the
meeting substantially concurrently with such proceedings, and (C) if any
stockholder or proxy holder votes or takes other action at the meeting by
means of remote communication, a record of such votes or other action shall be
maintained by the Corporation.

  



  

(b) _Board Meetings_. Unless otherwise restricted by applicable law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these By Laws, members of the Board or any
committee thereof may participate in a meeting of the Board or any committee
thereof by means of conference telephone or other communications equipment by
means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other.
Such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at the
meeting, except where a person participates in the meeting for the
express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business on the ground
that the meeting was not lawfully called or convened.

  



  

Section 9.6. Dividends. The Board may from time to time declare, and the
Corporation may pay, dividends (payable in cash, property or shares of the
Corporation's capital stock) on the Corporation's outstanding shares of
capital stock, subject to applicable law and the Certificate of
Incorporation.

  



  

Section 9.7. Reserves. The Board may set apart out of the funds of the
Corporation available for dividends a reserve or reserves for any proper
purpose and may abolish any such reserve.

provided by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By
Laws, any contract, bond, deed, lease, mortgage or other instrument may be
executed and delivered in the name and on behalf of the Corporation by such
officer or officers or other employee or employees of the Corporation as the
Board may from time to time authorize. Such authority may be general or
confined to specific instances as the Board may determine. The Chairman of
the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Chief Financial
Officer, the Treasurer or any Vice President may execute and deliver any
contract, bond, deed, lease, mortgage or other instrument in the name and on
behalf of the Corporation. Subject to any restrictions imposed by the Board,
the Chairman of the Board Chief Executive Officer, President, the Chief
Financial Officer, the Treasurer or any Vice President may delegate powers to
execute and deliver any contract, bond, deed, lease, mortgage or
other instrument in the name and on behalf of the Corporation to other
officers or employees of the Corporation under such person's supervision and
authority, it being understood, however, that any such delegation of power
shall not relieve such officer of responsibility with respect to the exercise
of such delegated power.

  



  

Section 9.9. Fiscal Year. The fiscal year of the Corporation shall be fixed
by the Board.

  



  

Section 9.10. Seal. The Board may adopt a corporate seal, which shall be in
such form as the Board determines. The seal may be used by causing it or a
facsimile thereof to be impressed, affixed or otherwise reproduced.

be kept within or outside the State of Delaware at such place or places as
may from time to time be designated by the Board.

resign by giving notice thereof in writing or by electronic transmission to
the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President or the
Secretary. The resignation shall take effect at the time specified therein,

specified time is earlier than the time of such receipt. Unless otherwise
specified therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary
to make it effective.

Corporation (if any) as the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer,
President or the Board may direct, from time to time, shall be bonded for the
faithful performance of their duties and for the restoration to the

Corporation required by applicable law or the Certificate of
Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of
the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors,
voting together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders to
adopt, amend, alter or repeal the By Laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power of
all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class,
shall be required for the stockholders to adopt, amend, alter or repeal

that so long as the Investor Rights Agreement, is in effect with respect to M
III Sponsor I LLC and M III I LP, any adoption, amendment, alteration or

(b) 50% of such holder's Earnout Shares will irrevocably vest on the

dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any twenty
(20) trading day period in a consecutive thirty (30) day trading period; and

  



  

(c) On or prior to the tenth anniversary of the date of this
Agreement, all of such holder's then-unvested Earnout Shares will

provisions thereto);

  



  

(b) any Person or any group of Persons acting together which would

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) the stockholders of Buyer and the Board of Directors of Buyer

 _provided_ , that no Change of Control shall be deemed to have occurred

5. If the Earnout Shares have not vested on or prior to the ten-year anniversary of the date of the Merger Agreement, the Earnout Shares shall be forfeited to Buyer without consideration and with no further action required of any Person. Upon any such forfeiture, such Earnout Shares shall transfer to Buyer for cancellation and in exchange for no consideration.

  



  

6. Prior to the vesting of any Earnout Shares hereunder, the holder of such Earnout Shares shall nevertheless retain the right to vote such Earnout Shares.

  



  

7. Until all Earnout Shares have vested or been forfeited hereunder, an amount equal to any dividends or distributions that would have been payable to the holders of Earnout Shares if the Earnout Shares had vested prior to the record date for such dividends or distributions shall be withheld by the Buyer for the benefit of the holders of the Earnout Shares (the "Withheld Amount").  If any securities of the Buyer or any other Person are included in the Withheld Amount, then any dividends or distributions in respect of or in exchange for any of such securities in the Withheld Amount, whether by way of stock splits or otherwise, shall be delivered to the Buyer and included in the "Withheld Amount", and will be released to the Buyer or the holders of the Earnout Shares, as applicable, upon the release of the corresponding securities. If and when the Earnout Shares vest in accordance with _Section 1_, the Buyer shall release to the holders of the Earnout Shares, the aggregate amount of the Withheld Amount attributable to the Earnout Shares that have vested and, if applicable, shall continue to withhold any remaining Withheld Amount that is attributable to the Earnout Shares that have not yet vested until such Earnout Shares vest, in which case such remaining Withheld Amount shall be released to the holders of Earnout Shares. If all or any portion of the Earnout Shares are forfeited to the Buyer in accordance with _Section 5_, then the portion of the Withheld Amount attributable to the portion of the Earnout Shares that have been forfeited to the Buyer, as applicable, shall be forfeited to Buyer without consideration and with no further action required of any person.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

8. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior understandings, agreements, or representations by or among the parties hereto, written or oral, to the extent they relate in any way to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be changed, amended, modified or waived (other than to correct a typographical error) as to any particular provision, except by a written instrument executed by all parties hereto.

  



  

9. No party hereto may assign either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each of the other parties hereto. Any purported assignment in violation of this paragraph shall be void and ineffectual and shall not operate to transfer or assign any interest or title to the purported assignee. This Agreement shall be binding on each of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

  



  

10. This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without regard to the conflict of laws principles thereof. The parties hereto (a) all agree that any action, proceeding, claim or dispute arising out of, or relating in any way to, this Agreement shall be brought and enforced in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks jurisdiction, then in the applicable Delaware state court), or if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction of such action is vested in the federal courts, then the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, and irrevocably submits to such jurisdiction and venue, which jurisdiction and venue shall be exclusive, and (b) waive any objection to such exclusive jurisdiction and venue or that such courts represent an inconvenient forum.

  



  

11. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement in accordance with its terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and agree that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief on the basis that the other parties have an adequate remedy at Law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

  



  

12. Any notice, consent or request to be given in connection with any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be sent by electronic mail (with recipient receipt acknowledgment), express mail or similar private courier service, by certified mail (return receipt requested), by hand delivery or facsimile transmission to Buyer and Seller at the addresses specified in the Merger Agreement and to the holders of Founder Shares at the addresses set forth on Exhibit A.

13. This Agreement shall immediately terminate, without any further action by the parties hereto, at such time, if any, that the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms.

 _Registration Rights Term Sheet_

  



  

This term sheet summarizes the material terms of the registration rights
agreement contemplated by this Agreement. Capitalized terms used but not
defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the
Agreement.

  



     Holders  |

Persons receiving common stock or convertible preferred stock in the Merger
and Sponsor and other pre-IPO investors party to the existing registration
rights agreement (and any investor in Sponsor receiving common stock or
Warrants from Sponsor) (the " _Holders_ ") will have registration rights with
respect to their Registrable Securities (as defined below).

 


 
---|--- 
   Registrable Securities  |  

" _Registrable Securities_ " will include (i) all  Common Shares (including
upon conversion of the Preferred Shares or the exercise of the Warrants);
(iii) the Warrants; and (iii)  and all other securities issued in respect of
such Common Shares or Warrants or into which such Common Shares or Warrants
are later  converted or reclassified, in each case of clauses (i)-(iii),
beneficially owned by Holders, whether now owned or hereafter acquired; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that any such Registrable Securities shall cease to
be Registrable Securities to the extent (A)  a registration statement with
respect to the sale of such Registrable Securities has been declared effective
under the Securities  Act and such Registrable Securities have been disposed
of in accordance with the plan of distribution set forth in such
registration  statement, (B) such Registrable Securities have been disposed
of by the relevant Holder to a party that is not a Holder in accordance  with
Rule 144 (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Rule 144(i)) or Rule 145 of
the Securities Act (or any successor rule) or  (C) such securities may be
sold pursuant to Rule 144 (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Rule 144(i))
(or any similar provisions  in force) without regard to volume or manner of
sale limitations and represent beneficial ownership of less than 1.0% of the
outstanding  Common Stock on an Aggregate Basis.

 



 

" _Aggregate Basis_ " means, as to any calculation,  such calculation made,
aggregating the beneficial ownership of the holders that are Affiliates of
each other (it being understood  that the parties to the Investor Rights
Agreement shall not be deemed to be Affiliates of one another solely due to
their being  parties to the Investor Rights Agreement). " _Affiliate_ " for
purposes of this definition shall have the meaning  set forth in Rule
144(a)(1) and shall include holders otherwise required to be aggregated
pursuant to Rule 144.

 


 
   Demand Registrations  | The Holders shall have customary demand
registration rights with respect to their Registrable Securities at any time
the Shelf Registration Statement (as defined below) is not available for the
sale of such Holders' Registrable Securities. 
  



    



 



    



       |  

From and after the Closing Date, from time to time, at any time  the Shelf
Registration Statement is not available for the sale of such Holders'
Registrable Securities, any Holder may request  registration (each, a "
_Demand Registration_ ") under the Securities Act of any or all of such
Holder's Registrable  Securities (including on a delayed or continuous basis
pursuant to Rule 415, as permitted by SEC Guidance). Upon receiving such 
request, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect
registration of such Registrable Securities under  the Securities Act under a
registration statement on such form as may be permitted under SEC Guidance
(which shall be on Form S-3  or Form S-3ASR, to the extent permitted by SEC
Guidance) and to keep such registration statement effective for so long as is
necessary  to permit the disposition of such Registrable Securities in
accordance with the intended method or methods of disposition stated  in such
demand.

 



 

Oaktree (and its permitted transferees and affiliates) (the " _Oaktree 
Parties_ ") will be entitled to initiate up to six Demand Registrations. The
Sponsors will be entitled to initiate up to  three Demand Registrations. In
each case, (a) the gross proceeds of the offering subject to such Demand
Registration (determined  in good faith by the relevant Holders and their
managing underwriters or counterparties) must be at least $15 million (except
in  the case of registration of all of the remaining Registrable Securities
of either the Sponsors or the Oaktree Parties, as the case  may be) and (b)
the Company will not be required to effect more than one Demand Registration
in any consecutive 90-day period.

 



 

In an underwritten offering (including an underwritten "block  trade")
registered pursuant to a Demand Registration, to the extent there are
underwriter cutbacks, the underwritten offering  shall include: (1) first,
any Registrable Securities that are requested to be included by the Holders
(on a pro rata basis based  on the requesting Holders' beneficial ownership
of Registrable Securities), (2) second, any other securities that are 
requested to be included pursuant to the exercise of piggyback rights by
persons with the right to participate therein and (3)  third, any securities
that are requested to be included in such underwritten offering by the Company
for its own account.

 



 

For purposes of cutbacks within clause (1), calculation of the beneficial
ownership of Registrable Securities shall not include any unvested Earnout
Shares (as defined in the Founder Share Amendment Agreement) and, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall not include any Common Shares underlying the
Preferred Stock prior to the date such Preferred Stock is convertible in
accordance with the Company's Certificate of Incorporation). 

---|--- 
   



  

   

 | -2-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



     Shelf Registrations  |  

The Holders shall have customary shelf registration rights with  respect to
their Registrable Securities.

 



 

Upon the Company becoming eligible, in accordance with SEC Guidance,  for use
of Form S-3 under the Securities Act for secondary offerings (" _S-3 Eligible_
"), the Company shall use  reasonable best efforts to file and make effective
as soon as practicable a shelf registration statement on Form S-3, covering 
the resale of all of the Registrable Securities and shall use reasonable best
efforts to keep such registration statement effective  until there are no
remaining Registrable Securities (the " _Shelf Registration Statement_ ,"
including any registration  statement filed in replacement thereof).

 



 

To the extent the Company becomes a well-known seasoned issuer (as  defined
in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) (a " _WKSI_ ") and is eligible, in
accordance with SEC Guidance to  file an automatic shelf registration
statement, it shall file an automatic shelf registration statement on Form
S-3ASR covering  the resale of all Registrable Securities; provided that if
the Shelf Registration Statement is already effective, such filing shall  be
made only at the request of the holders of at least 25% of the Registrable
Securities included therein.

 



 

Each Holder may request unlimited shelf take-downs from any shelf 
registration statement (subject to a minimum for any underwritten shelf take-
down of $15 million of gross proceeds). Holders may  not include Registrable
Securities in a shelf take-down by any other Holder unless it an underwritten
offering.

 



 

In an underwritten offering of Registrable Securities beneficially  owned by
a Holder that is a shelf take-down (including an underwritten "block trade")
registered pursuant to a Shelf  Registration, to the extent there are
underwriter cutbacks, the underwritten offering shall include: (1) first,
Registrable Securities  of Holders that have requested to be included in such
shelf take-down on a pro rata basis on the basis of the requesting Holders' 
beneficial ownership of the Common Shares and (2) second, any securities that
are registered on the applicable shelf registration  statement and are
requested to be included in such shelf take-down by the Company.

 



 

For purposes of cutbacks within clause (1) calculation of the beneficial 
ownership of Registrable Securities shall not include any unvested Earnout
Shares (as defined in the Founder Share Amendment Agreement)  and, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall not include any Common Shares underlying the
Preferred Stock prior to the date such Preferred  Stock is convertible in
accordance with the Company's Certificate of Incorporation). 

---|--- 
  



    

 | -3-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



     Plan of Distribution  |

The "Plan of Distribution" for any registration statement filed in respect of
a Demand Registration or Shelf Registration shall permit (in addition to firm-
commitment underwritten public offerings), any other lawful means of disposing
of the Registrable Securities, including agented transactions, sales directly
into the market, purchases or sales by brokers, derivative transactions, short
sales, stock loan or stock pledge transactions and sales not involving a
public offering (each, an "Alternative Transaction").

 


 
---|--- 
   Piggyback Registrations  |  

Each Holder will have customary "piggyback" rights (" _Piggyback 
Registration Rights_ ") for all Registrable Securities in respect of
underwritten offerings by the Company from an existing  shelf registration
statement or registrations of Common Shares by the Company (including Demand
Registrations and Shelf Registrations)  other than registrations on Form S-8
or S-4.

 



 

If a piggyback registration is with respect to an underwritten public 
offering (other than an underwritten public offering registered under a Demand
Registration), to the extent there are underwriter  cutbacks, the
underwritten offering shall include: (1) first, any securities proposed to be
included for the account of the Company,  (2) second, any Registrable
Securities proposed to be included by any Holder on a pro rata basis on the
basis of the requesting  Holders' beneficial ownership of the Common Shares,
and (3) third, any securities proposed to be registered for the account  of
any other persons with such priorities among them as the Company shall
determine.

 



 

For purposes of cutbacks within any group, calculation of the beneficial 
ownership of Registrable Securities shall not include any unvested Earnout
Shares (as defined in the Founder Share Amendment Agreement)  and, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall not include any Common Shares underlying the
Preferred Stock prior to the date such Preferred  Stock is convertible in
accordance with the Company's Certificate of Incorporation).

 


 
   Suspension Periods  |

The registration rights granted under the RRA shall be subject to customary
suspension provisions. Suspension periods shall be determined in good faith
by the Buyer's board of directors, not to exceed two periods of not more than
an aggregate of 90 days in any rolling twelve-month period.

 


 
   Lock-Ups  | Holders beneficially owning Registrable Securities
representing beneficial ownership of 1% or more of the outstanding Common
Shares and the Company (and its executive officers and directors) shall be
subject to customary provisions requiring them to enter into lock-up
agreements with the underwriter(s) in respect of underwritten offerings
(including underwritten "block trades"), not to exceed 90 days following the
pricing date of any such underwritten offering. 
  



    

 | -4-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



     Indemnification  |

The RRA will contain customary indemnification provisions for the benefit of
the Holders, underwriters and the Company.

 


 
---|--- 
   Expenses  |

Customary expenses (inclusive of reasonable legal fees) of each Holder for any
registration or underwritten public offering of the Registrable Securities
pursuant to a registration statement filed pursuant to the terms of RRA will
be borne by the Company whether or not such registration, offering or other
transaction is completed. Such expenses shall not include underwriting
discounts or fees.

 


 
   Cooperation  |

Buyer shall be subject to customary cooperation provisions with respect to
registration or offering of the Registrable Securities pursuant to a
registration statement filed pursuant to the terms of RRA. Such cooperation
provisions shall include customary road show and due diligence cooperation
provisions and customary requirements to enter into underwriting agreements
and provide customary assistance with respect to certificates, legal opinions
and comfort letters.

 


 
   Transferees  |

The Holders shall be permitted to transfer their registration rights in
connection with a transfer of Registrable Securities to the extent the
securities so transferred would continue to constitute Registrable Securities
following such transfer.

 


 
   Public Listing  |

Following the listing of the Common Shares on NASDAQ, Buyer will use
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain such listing until each Holder has
sold all of its Registrable Securities.

 


 
   Customary Provisions  |

The term "customary," as used in this Term Sheet shall mean "customary for
registration rights agreements entered into by equity sponsors in connection
with an initial public offering of a portfolio company;" provided that, with
respect to such customary provisions, except as provided in this Term Sheet
with respect to rights granted specifically to Oaktree or the Sponsors, all
holders of Registrable Securities shall be treated equally with respect to
rights granted thereunder. Provisions not otherwise specified in this Term
Sheet shall be customary in the reasonable determination of Seller and Buyer.
