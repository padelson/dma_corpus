the satisfaction or waiver by Parent or Merger Sub of the following
conditions: (i) there being validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the

promulgated thereunder in order to fulfill its obligations under Section
2.3(a), including mailing to stockholders together with the Schedule 14D-9 the
information required by such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as is necessary to
enable Parents designees to be elected to the Company Board. Parent and
Merger Sub will supply the Company with, and will be solely responsible for
any information with respect to them and their nominees, officers, directors
and Affiliates required by such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1, and the
Companys obligations shall be conditioned upon receipt of such information.
The Company shall not be required to take any course of action that would,
upon advice of counsel, be reasonably likely to violate applicable Legal
Requirements.

(c)  _Required Approvals of Continuing Directors_. Following the election or
appointment of Parents designees to the Company Board pursuant to Section
2.3(a) and until the Effective Time, the approval of a majority of the
directors of the Company then in office who were not designated by Parent
(the " _Continuing Directors_ ") (or the approval of the sole Continuing
Director if there shall be only one Continuing Director) shall be required to
authorize (and such authorization shall constitute the authorization of the
Company Board and no other action on the part of the Company, including any
action by any other director of the Company, shall be required to authorize),
(i) any material amendment or termination of this Agreement by the Company,
(ii) any material extension or waiver by the Company of the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or Merger Sub
under this Agreement, or (iii) any waiver of any of the Companys rights
hereunder or any other action that could adversely effect in any material
respect the rights of the Companys stockholders hereunder; _provided_ that if
there shall be no Continuing Directors as a result of such individuals
deaths, disabilities, resignations or refusal to serve, then such actions may
be effected by a majority vote of the Company Board. Following the election or
appointment of Parents designees to the Company Board pursuant to Section
2.3(a) and until the Effective Time, any action by the Company to enforce any
obligation of Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement shall be effected only
by the action of a majority of the Continuing Directors (or the approval
of the sole Continuing Director if there shall be only one Continuing
Director); _provided_ that if there shall be no Continuing Directors as a
result of such individuals deaths, disabilities, resignations or refusal to
serve, then such actions may be effected by a majority vote of the Company
Board.

2.4 _Top-Up Option_.

(a) _Grant of Option_. Subject to the terms and conditions herein, the Company
hereby grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ ")
to purchase up to that number of shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Top-Up
Option Shares_ ") equal to the lowest number of shares of Company Common  



 

11  Stock that, when added to the number of Company Shares collectively directly
or indirectly owned by Parent and Merger Sub, and any of their
respective Affiliates immediately following consummation of the Offer, shall
constitute one share more than 90% of the Common Stock Outstanding (after
giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares), at a purchase
price per Top-Up Option Share equal to the Offer Price, payable in cash,
_provided_ that the number of shares of Company Common Stock beneficially
owned by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the time of exercise of the
Top-Up Option constitutes at least 75% of the number of shares of Company
Common Stock then outstanding and _provided further_ that in no event shall
the Top-Up Option be exerciseable for a number of Company Shares in excess of
the Companys total authorized and unissued Company Shares. 

(b) _Exercise of Option_. Merger Sub may, at its election, exercise the Top-Up
Option, whether in whole or in part,  _provided_ that upon exercise of the
Top-Up Option, Parent and Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates will
directly or indirectly own one share more than 90% of the Common Stock
Outstanding (after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option
Shares), at any time after the Acceptance Date and prior to the earlier of (i)
the Effective Time, and (ii) the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms. In the event Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option,
Merger Sub shall send to the Company a written notice (the " _Top-Up Option
Notice_ "), specifying (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that
will be owned by Parent and Merger Sub and their respective
Affiliates immediately preceding the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares,
(B) the number of Top-Up Option Shares that Merger Sub intends to purchase
pursuant to the Top-Up Option and (C) the place and time for the closing of
the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares by Merger Sub, which shall not be
more than five (5) Business Days after delivery of such notice (the " _Top-Up
Closing_ "). The Company shall, promptly after receipt of the Top-Up Option
Notice, deliver a written notice to Parent and Merger Sub confirming the
number of Top-Up Option Shares and the consideration therefor.

(c)  _Closing_. At the Top-Up Closing, subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, (i) Parent or Merger Sub shall pay the Company the aggregate
purchase price for the Top-Up Option Shares (calculated by multiplying the
number of such Top-Up Option Shares by the Offer Price) at Parents or Merger
Subs option by (A) delivery of immediately available funds by wire transfer
to an account designated by the Company, or (B)(1) the issuance of a
promissory note, bearing simple interest at five percent (5%) per annum and
due on the first anniversary of the Top-Up Closing for the aggregate purchase
price of the Top-Up Option Shares minus the aggregate par value of the Top-Up
Option Shares, _plus_  (2) payment in cash in the amount of the aggregate par
value of the Top-Up Option Shares, and (ii) the Company shall cause to be
issued to Merger Sub a certificate or certificates evidencing the applicable
number of Top-Up Option Shares. Upon the delivery by Merger Sub of the Top-Up
Option Notice and the tender of the consideration for the Top-Up Option Shares
as provided in this Section 2.4(c), Merger Sub shall be deemed to be the
holder of record of the Top-Up Option Shares issuable upon that exercise,
notwithstanding that the stock transfer books of the Company shall then be
closed or that certificates representing Top-Up Option Shares shall not then
be actually delivered to Merger Sub or the Company shall have failed or
refused to designate the account described in this Section 2.4(c)(i)(A).

SECTION 4. CONVERSION AND EXCHANGE OF SECURITIES.

4.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time and upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any
holder of any of the following securities:

(a) _Conversion of Securities_.

(i) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of Company Common Stock to
be canceled pursuant to Section 4.1(b) or any Dissenting Shares) shall be
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash  



 

13  equal to the Offer Price, payable to the holder thereof, without interest
(the _"Merger Consideration_ "), upon the surrender of the certificate
representing such share in accordance with the terms hereof and in the manner
provided herein.

(ii) From and after the Effective Time, each such share of Company Common
Stock converted pursuant to Section 4.1(a)(i) shall no longer be outstanding
and shall be automatically cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate formerly representing each such share shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
(subject to the terms of this Agreement) the Merger Consideration payable with
respect to such Company Common Stock, without interest, upon the surrender of
such certificate in accordance with the terms hereof and in the manner
provided herein, or, if such share of Company Common Stock is a Dissenting
Share, the right, if any, to receive payment from the Surviving Corporation
of the "fair value" or "fair market value" of such Dissenting Share as
determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

(b) _Cancellation_. Each share of Company Common Stock owned by the Company as
treasury stock or owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any direct or indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, in each case, be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist without payment of any consideration therefor.

(c) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become, and shall represent, one (1) fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the
same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall
constitute the only outstanding share of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation. Each certificate evidencing ownership of such shares of common
stock of Merger Sub shall thereafter evidence ownership of shares of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(d) _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock), cash dividends, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring on or after the
date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

4.2 _Dissenting Holders_.

(a) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time eligible under the DGCL to exercise appraisal
or dissenters rights and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the
Agreement and the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has exercised
and perfected appraisal or dissenters rights for such shares in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL and has not effectively withdrawn or lost such
appraisal or dissenters rights (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ")
shall not be converted into or represent the right to consideration for
Company Common Stock set forth in Section 4.1(a), and the holder or holders
of such shares shall be entitled only to such rights as may be granted to such
holder or holders in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL.

(b) _Withdrawal; Loss of Status_. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
4.2(a), if any holder of Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose
(through failure to perfect or otherwise) such holders appraisal rights and
dissenters rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, then, as of the later of the
Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such holders shares shall
automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive the
consideration for such shares set forth in Section 4.1(a)(i), without
interest, upon surrender of the certificate representing such shares.

(c) _Obligations of the Company_. The Company shall (i) comply with the
requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, (ii) give Parent prompt notice of
any written demand (or threatened demand) received by the Company pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL, and of withdrawals of such demands, and provide
copies of  



 

14  any documents or instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the
Company and (iii) give Parent the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any such demands (or the threatened demands). The
Company shall not make any payment or settlement offer with respect to any
such demand unless Parent shall have consented in writing to such payment or
settlement offer.

__4.3 _Equity Awards_. All Company Options will be assumed by Parent at the
Effective Time and converted into an option to acquire, on the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under such Company Options as issued by the
Company, the number of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ "), rounded down to the nearest whole share,
determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to the Company Options immediately prior to the Effective Time by a fraction
(the " _Option Exchange Ratio_ "), the numerator of which shall equal the
Merger Consideration and the denominator of which shall be the average of the
closing prices of Parent Common Stock on the NYSE as reported on www.nyse.com
for the five (5) trading days ending on (and inclusive of) the trading day
that is two (2) trading days prior to (and inclusive of) the Closing Date, at
an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock equal to the per share
exercise price for the shares of Company Common Stock otherwise
purchasable pursuant to such Company Option divided by the Option Exchange
Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. __

4.4 _Surrender of Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the payment
agent for the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ").

(b)  _Exchange Fund_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent or Merger
Sub shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, for the
payment to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
provisions of this SECTION 4, an amount in cash equal to the Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to Section 4.1(a)(i) (the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

(c) _Surrender Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, but no later than five (5) Business Days thereafter, Parent
shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_
"), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in a customary form and shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall only pass upon proper delivery of the Certificates,
together with such letter(s) of transmittal properly completed and duly
executed, to the Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of Certificate(s) in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable
in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this SECTION 4. The payment
of the Merger Consideration with respect to each such Certificate is
conditioned upon (A) the execution and delivery of such transmittal letter and
(B) the delivery of such Certificates related thereto. As soon as practicable
after receipt by the Paying Agent of such Certificate(s), properly endorsed
or otherwise in proper form for transfer and cancellation, together with such
duly executed letter of transmittal, the Paying Agent shall, in exchange
therefor, pay to such holder the Merger Consideration payable in respect of
the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by the Certificate(s)
surrendered, but without interest, and the Certificate(s) so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. If payment of any portion of the Merger Consideration
is to be made to a person, firm, entity, partnership, association or any
business organization or division thereof (each a " _Person_ ") other than the
Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate(s) are registered, it shall
be a condition of payment that the Person requesting such payment (i) shall
have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of
those amounts to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate(s) surrendered, and shall have established to the satisfaction of
the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been paid, or (ii) shall have
established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax is
not applicable. From and after the Effective Time, until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 4.4(c), each Certificate shall be deemed to
represent for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
as provided pursuant to Section 4.1(a)(i) hereof, if any, in respect of such
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby in accordance with
the terms hereof and in the manner provided herein.



 

15 (d) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in the Shares_. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of the shares
of Company Common Stock on the records of the Company. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates shall cease to have any rights
with respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or by
applicable Legal Requirements. After the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall cancel and exchange, as provided in
this SECTION 4, any presented Certificate.

(e) _Termination of Fund; No Liability_. At any time following the first
anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any remaining portion
of the Exchange Fund (including, without limitation, any earnings received
with respect thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent and
that had not been disbursed to the holders of Certificates and thereafter any
holder of Certificates who has not otherwise surrendered such
holders Certificates evidencing such shares of Company Common Stock shall be
entitled to look only to Parent or the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Legal Requirements) and only as
general creditors thereof for any claim to the applicable Merger
Consideration to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to the provisions
of this SECTION 4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a
Certificate for any amounts delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Legal Requirement. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by Company stockholders two (2) years after
the Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior to such time when
the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements, the property of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from payment of any
amounts (or any portion thereof) payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder or former holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as may
be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any other Legal Requirement. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

(g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate(s)
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making and delivery of an
affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof in form reasonably satisfactory
to Parent, Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to pay such holder the
Merger Consideration as provided in this SECTION 4; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that Parent may, in its sole discretion and as a condition precedent to
issuing such instruction to the Paying Agent, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate(s) to deliver an agreement of indemnification
in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent and a bond in such sum as Parent
may reasonably direct as indemnity, against any claim that may be made against
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the
Certificate(s) alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

(h) _Dissenting Shares_. The provisions of this Section 4.4 shall also apply
to Dissenting Shares that lose their status as such, except that the
obligations of Parent under this Section 4.4 shall commence on the date of
loss of such status and the holder of such shares shall be entitled to receive
in exchange for such shares the Merger Consideration provided in this SECTION
4.

4.5 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement
and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to
all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company
and Merger Sub, the officers and directors of the Company and Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time are and will remain fully authorized
in the name of the Company and Merger Sub or otherwise to take, and shall
take, all such action.

standing under the DGCL. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a
corporation or other organization duly organized, validly existing and, where
such concept is applicable, in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization except where the failure to be

have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has the requisite corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct its business
as currently conducted and as proposed to be conducted by it, except where
the failure to be so organized, validly existing and in good standing has not
and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and,
where such concept is applicable, is in good standing in every jurisdiction
where the character of its properties owned, leased or operated, or
the business conducted by it requires such qualification, except where the
failure to be so qualified or in "good standing" has not and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional
shares of capital stock or securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to grant,
extend or accelerate the vesting of or enter into any such option, warrant,
call, right, commitment, agreement, arrangement or understanding. There are no
stockholder agreements, voting trusts, proxies or other similar agreements,

commitments or agreements of any character to which the Company is bound
obligating the Company to accelerate the vesting or exercisability of any
Company Option as a result of the Merger (whether alone or upon the occurrence

(a) _SEC Filings_. The Company has timely filed all reports, schedules, forms,
statements and other documents (including exhibits and all other information
incorporated by reference) and any amendments thereto required to be filed by
it with the SEC since January 1, 2004 (collectively, the " _Company SEC
Reports_ "). As of their respective dates, the Company SEC Reports (i) were
prepared in accordance with, and complied in all material respects with, the
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002, as the case may be, and, in each case, the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Reports and (ii) did not
at the time they were filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing prior to
the date of this Agreement then on the date of such filing) contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or  



 

20  necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None of the
Companys Subsidiaries is required to file any forms, reports or other
documents with the SEC. The Company has made available to Parent complete and
correct copies of all amendments and modifications effected prior to the date
of this Agreement that have not yet been filed by the Company with the SEC
but which are required to be filed and all Contracts and other documents that
previously had been filed by the Company with the SEC and are currently in
effect. To the Companys Knowledge, as of the date hereof, none of the
Company SEC Reports is the subject of ongoing SEC review or outstanding SEC
comment. Since January 1, 2004 the Company has not received any correspondence
from the SEC containing comments regarding any report or registration
statement filed by the Company. The Company and, to the Knowledge of the
Company, each of its officers and directors are in full compliance with, and
have complied, in each case in all material respects with (i) the
applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules
and regulations promulgated under or pursuant to such act and (ii) the
applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the NYSE.

of the Company and each former principal financial officer of the Company, as
applicable) has made all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or Rule
15d-14 under the Exchange Act or Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 with respect to the Company SEC Reports. For purposes of the
preceding sentence, "principal executive officer" and "principal financial
officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002.

accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("
_GAAP_ ") (except as may be indicated in the notes) applied on a consistent
basis throughout the periods involved and (ii) fairly presented in all
material respects or will fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as at the
respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of the Companys
operations and cash flows for the periods indicated, except that any unaudited
interim financial statements are subject to normal and recurring year-end
adjustments which have not been and are not expected to be material in
amount, individually or in the aggregate. The Company does not intend to
correct or restate, and to the Companys Knowledge there is not any basis to
correct or restate any of the Company Financials. The consolidated balance
sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 contained in
the Company SEC Reports is hereinafter referred to as the " _Company Balance
Sheet_." Except as disclosed in the Company Financials, since the date of the

reporting required by Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of its
consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (including any Employee/Service Provider
thereof) nor, to the Companys Knowledge, the Companys independent auditors
have identified or been made aware of (i) any significant deficiency or
material weakness in the system of internal controls utilized by the Company
and its Subsidiaries, (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
the Companys management or other Employees/Service Providers who have a role
in the preparation of financial statements or the internal controls utilized
by the Company and its Subsidiaries or (iii) any claim or allegation regarding
any of the foregoing.

Balance Sheet through the date hereof,

(a) the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective
businesses in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices,
and

(b) there has not occurred (i) any Company Material Adverse Effect, or (ii)

of the same or similar principles, could reasonably be expected to recur in a
subsequent Tax period.

the Company, threatened, Legal Proceeding challenging the use, ownership,
validity, enforceability or registrability of any Company Intellectual

24 (e) To the Knowledge of the Company, the conduct of the business of the
Company and each Subsidiary as currently conducted has not and does not
infringe, dilute, misappropriate, or otherwise violate any Intellectual
Property or other proprietary right owned by any third party, or constitute

There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened (and at no

pending any) Legal Proceeding, against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, alleging that any activities or the conduct of the Companys or
any Subsidiarys business infringes, dilutes, misappropriates, or otherwise
violates or constitutes the unauthorized use of, or will infringe,
dilute, misappropriate, or otherwise violate or constitute the unauthorized
use of the Intellectual Property of any third party (nor does the Company have
Knowledge of any basis therefor). Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is
party to any settlement, covenant not to sue, consent, decree, stipulation,
judgment, or order resulting from any Legal Proceeding which (i) materially

Intellectual Property_ "), and no actions, suits, claims or proceedings have
been brought against any third party by the Company or any Subsidiary
alleging that a third party is infringing, diluting, misappropriating, or
otherwise violating or engaged in the unauthorized use of any Company
Intellectual Property.

to maintain and protect the Company Intellectual Property.

grant access or a license to any of its source code (including in any such
case any conditional right to access or under which the Company or any
Subsidiary has established any escrow arrangement for the storage and
conditional release of any of its source code). The execution of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not result in a release of any source code owned by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or the grant of incremental rights to a Person with
regard to such source code.

(i) None of the Proprietary Products is subject to the provisions of any Open
Source Code license or other Contract (including any general public license,
limited general public license or other similar Contract) which could require
or condition the use or distribution of such Proprietary Product, any
requirement to license such Proprietary Product or any portion thereof for
the purpose of making modifications or derivative works, any requirement to
distribute such Proprietary Product or any portion thereof without charge, on
the disclosure, licensing or distribution of any source code or any portion
of any Proprietary Product or otherwise impose a limitation, restriction or
condition on the right of the Company or any Subsidiary to distribute a
Proprietary Product or any portion thereof. For purposes of this Agreement, "

source software" or "freeware" or is otherwise distributed publicly or made
generally available in source code form under terms that permit
modification and redistribution of such software. Open Source Code includes

Lesser General Public License, Mozilla License, Common Public License, Apache
License, BSD License, Artistic License, or Sun Community Source License.

(j) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in violation of any Contract
to which it is party or otherwise bound, nor will the execution of this
Agreement or the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement result in any violation, loss or impairment of ownership by
the Company or any Subsidiary of, or the right of any of them to use, or
payment of any material additional amounts with respect to any Company
Intellectual Property, nor require the consent of any Governmental Entity or
third party with respect to any such Intellectual Property. Neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary is a party to any Contract under which a third
party would have or would be entitled to receive a license or  



 

25  any other right to any Intellectual Property of Parent or any of Parents
Affiliates as a result of the execution of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(k) Other than (i) "shrink-wrap" and similar publicly-available commercial
binary code end-user licenses and (ii) non-disclosure agreements entered into
in the ordinary course of business, _Section 5.9(k) _of the Company

the Company or its Subsidiaries to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party and under which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

licenses and related agreements with respect thereto (including software and
maintenance and support agreements) of current Proprietary Products to end-
users (in each case, pursuant to written agreements that have been entered
into in the ordinary course of business that do not materially differ in
substance from the Companys standard form(s)), _Section 5.9(l)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter lists all material Contracts pursuant to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has granted to a third Party any rights or

accordance with their terms.

(m) Neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of the
Company, any other party to a Company IP License, is in material breach of
any such Company IP License that is material to the business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The consummation of the Offer or the
Merger will not result or cause (i) the breach by the Company or any of its

outside legal counsel, that such proposal would reasonably constitute a
Superior Proposal; _provided_ that (A) the Company has first given Parent a

41  agreement will not include any provision calling for any exclusivity right
to negotiate with such Person or having the effect of prohibiting the Company
from satisfying its obligations under this Agreement) (a copy of which shall
be promptly provided to Parent after its execution), and (D) the Company Board
shall have determined in good faith after consultation with the Companys
outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be reasonably
likely to constitute a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable
Legal Requirements. As promptly as practicable (and, in any event, within 48
hours) after furnishing any information to such Person, the Company shall
furnish such information to Parent.

no later than 48 hours) keep Parent informed in all material respects of the
status and details (including changes or proposed changes to the economic
terms and any other material amendments or proposed material amendments and
any withdrawals or abandonment) of any such Acquisition Proposal, request,
discussion or inquiry and shall promptly provide to Parent a copy of all
written materials subsequently provided in connection with such Acquisition
Proposal, request, discussion or inquiry.

(c) _Board Recommendation_.

(i) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (A) fail to make
or affirm the Board Recommendation, (B) withdraw, qualify or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or publicly propose to withdraw,
qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Board
Recommendation (it being understood that, subject to Section 8.3(d), publicly
taking a neutral position or no position with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal shall be considered an adverse modification), or (C)
resolve, approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable, or publicly
propose to approve or recommend, an Acquisition Proposal or fail to recommend
against any Acquisition Proposal (any of the actions described in the
foregoing clauses (A), (B) and (C), a " _Change of Recommendation_ ").

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company Board may, at any time prior to the Acceptance Date, make a Change of
Recommendation if (A) the Company promptly notifies Parent and Merger Sub,
in writing at least three Business Days hours before taking that action, of
its intention to do so in response to the receipt by the Company of an
Acquisition Proposal, attaching the most current version of any proposed
agreement and a detailed summary of the material terms of any such proposal
and the identity of the offeror, including the reasons therefor, (B) the
Company Board, in the exercise of its fiduciary duties consistent with Legal
Requirements, determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel and a nationally recognized financial advisor that (1) the Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, or (2) that failure to take such
action would constitute a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable
Legal Requirements, and (C) Parent or Merger Sub does not make, within three
Business Days of notification by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub
regarding the Companys intention to make a Change of Recommendation, an
offer that is at least as favorable to the stockholders of the Company, as
determined by the Company Board in good faith (after consultation with a
nationally recognized financial advisor), as such Superior Proposal (it
being understood that the Company shall not take any action described in
Section 8.3(c)(ii) during such three-Business Day period, and that any
amendment to the economic terms or other material terms of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new written notification from the Company and an
additional three Business Day period).



 

42 (d) _Compliance with Disclosure Obligations_. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from complying with
Rules 14a-9 (False or Misleading Statements), 14d-9 (Recommendation or
Solicitation by the Subject Company and Others) and 14e-2(a) (Position of
Subject Company) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the
Exchange Act if the Company Board determines, after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel, that failure to so disclose such position
would result in a violation of Legal Requirements; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any such disclosure that (i) does not reaffirm the Board Recommendation,
(ii) with respect to any such disclosure relating to an Acquisition Proposal,
goes beyond a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (iii)
does not expressly reject such Acquisition Proposal, shall be deemed a Change
of Recommendation. 

(e) _Takeover Statutes and Company Rights Plan_. The Company Board shall not,
in connection with any Change of Recommendation, take any action to change
the approval of the Company Board for purposes of causing any state takeover
statute, other state law, or the Rights Agreement to be applicable to or
triggered by the transactions contemplated hereby. For the avoidance of
doubt, this Section 8.3(e) shall not prohibit the Company from effecting a
Change of Recommendation under the circumstances and subject to the conditions
set forth in Section 8.3(c).

(f) _Representatives_. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that
any violation of the restrictions set forth above by any officer, director or
Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be
a breach of this Section 8.3 by the Company.

8.4 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall consult with each
other before issuing any press release or other public announcement, or
scheduling any press conference or conference call with investors or
analysts, with respect to the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement and shall
not issue any such press release prior to such consultation and approval,
except as may be required by Legal Requirements or any listing agreement
related to the trading of the shares of either party on any securities
exchange, in which case the party proposing to issue such press release or
make such public announcement, or schedule a press conference or conference
call with investors or analysts, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
consult in good faith with the other party before issuing any such press
release, making any such public announcement, or scheduling any such press
conference or conference call with investors or analysts; provided, however,
that each of Parent and the Company may make any public statement in response
to specific questions by the press, analysts, investors, stockholders or those
attending industry conferences or financial analyst conference calls, so long
as any such statements are not inconsistent with previous press releases,
public disclosures or public statements made jointly by Parent and the Company
and do not reveal non-public information regarding the other party.

8.5 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts to Complete_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
party or parties hereto in doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Offer and the Merger), including using commercially reasonable efforts to: (i)
cause the Offer Conditions and the conditions to the Merger set forth in
SECTION 9 hereof to be satisfied or fulfilled; (ii) obtain all Necessary
Consents or non-actions or waivers thereof from or by Governmental Entities,
the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods, making all
necessary registrations, declarations and filings (including registrations,
declarations and filings with Governmental Entities, if any) and (iii) execute
or deliver any additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this
Agreement.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of Section
8.5(a) hereof, the parties shall as promptly as reasonably practicable after
the date of this Agreement and in any event with in 10 Business Days after the
date of this Agreement prepare and file all necessary documentation, effect
all necessary  



 

43  applications, notices, petitions and filings, including, without limitation,
the Notification and Report Forms with the FTC and the DOJ, as required by
the HSR Act and any comparable pre-merger notification filings, forms and
submissions with any foreign Governmental Entity that may be required by the
merger notification or control laws and regulations of any applicable foreign
jurisdiction or be deemed desirable by Parent, in each case as Parent may
deem necessary and/or appropriate, and use all reasonable best efforts to
cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the
HSR Act. The parties shall promptly supply each other with any information
which may be required in order to effectuate any such filing, application,
notice or petition. Each of the Company, Merger Sub and Parent will notify the
other promptly upon the receipt of: (A) any comments from any officials of
any Governmental Entity in connection with any filings made pursuant hereto,
and (B) any request by any officials of any Governmental Entity for amendments
or supplements to any filing, application, notice or petition made pursuant
to, or information provided to comply in all material respects with, any Legal
Requirements. Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to any filing, application, notice or petition made
pursuant to this Section 8.5(b), the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the
case may be, will promptly inform the others of such occurrence and cooperate
in filing with the applicable Governmental Entity such amendment
or supplement. Except where prohibited by applicable Legal Requirements, and
subject to Section 8.2, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall
consult with the others prior to taking a position with respect to any such
filing, application, notice or petition, shall permit the other to review and
discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the others in
connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
white papers, arguments, opinions and proposals before making or submitting
any of the foregoing to any Governmental Entity by or on behalf of any party
hereto in connection with any investigations or proceedings in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including under any
antitrust Legal Requirements), coordinate with the other in preparing and
exchanging such information and promptly provide the others (and their
counsel) with copies of all filings, presentations or submissions (and a
summary of any oral presentations) made by such party with any Governmental
Entity in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, _provided_ that with respect to any such filing, presentation
or submission, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub need not supply the
others (or their respective counsel) with copies (or in case of oral
presentations, a summary) to the extent that any applicable Legal Requirements
require such party or its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any
such information. To the extent reasonably practicable, neither the Company,
Parent nor Merger Sub shall, nor shall they permit their respective
Representatives to, participate independently in any meeting or engage in any
substantive communication with any Governmental Entity in respect of any such
filing, investigation or other inquiry without giving the other party prior
notice of such meeting or conversation and to the extent permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements and the applicable Governmental Entity, without
giving the other parties the opportunity to attend or participate.

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of Section
8.5(a) hereof, in the event that any state anti-takeover or other similar
statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the
Merger), the Company, at the direction of the Company Board, shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger) may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, assist Parent and Merger Sub in challenging the
applicability of such state anti-takeover or similar statute or regulation
upon request by Parent, and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute
or regulation on this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Offer and the Merger).

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 8.5, neither Parent nor Merger
Sub or any other subsidiary of Parent shall be obligated to accept or agree
to anything that, in Parents reasonable judgment, would be expected to
directly or indirectly have any of the effects set forth in condition (1) of
_Annex A_.

8.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_. From and after the date of this
Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of
this Agreement, subject to applicable Legal Requirements, each of the  



 

44  Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other party of (a) the
occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event that would be likely to cause
any condition to the obligations of any party to effect the Offer and the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be
satisfied, or (b) the failure of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to
comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement that would reasonably be
expected to result in any condition to the obligations of any party to effect
the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement not to be satisfied; provided, however, that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section 8.6 shall not cure any breach of any
representation or warranty, the failure to comply with any covenant, the
failure to meet any condition or otherwise limit or affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

8.7 _Third-Party Consents_. As soon as practicable following the date hereof,
the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such material
consents, waivers and approvals under any of its or its
Subsidiaries respective Contracts required to be obtained in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and as may be
reasonably requested by Parent, after consultation with the Company, so as to
maintain and preserve the benefits under such Contracts following the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and
the Merger). In connection with seeking such consents, waivers, approvals and
estoppel certificates, the Company shall keep Parent informed of all material
developments and shall, at Parents request, include Parent in any discussions
or communications with any parties whose consent, waiver or approval is sought
hereunder. Such consents, waivers, approvals and estoppel certificates shall
be in a form acceptable to Parent. In the event the Offer is not consummated
by Merger Subs acceptance of tendered Company Shares in accordance therewith
or the Merger does not close for any reason, neither Parent nor Merger Sub
shall have any liability to the Company, its stockholders or any other Person
for any costs, claims, liabilities or damages resulting from the Company
seeking to obtain such consents, waivers and approvals.

8.8 _Employee Matters_.

(a) Following the Closing, Parent shall give employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries credit for purposes of eligibility and vesting under any employee
policy, program, arrangement or benefit plans maintained by Parent or
any Subsidiary for such employees service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date, except to the extent that such
crediting would result in duplication of benefits. Parent shall (i) waive all
limitations as to preexisting conditions exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such
employees under any welfare benefit plans that such employees may be eligible
to participate in after the Effective Time, other than limitations or waiting
periods that are already in effect with respect to such employees and that
have not been satisfied as of the Effective Time under any welfare plan
maintained for such employees immediately prior to the Closing, and (ii)
provide each such employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles
paid in the plan year in effect as of the Closing Date in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any welfare
plans that such employees are eligible to participate in after the Effective
Time, (iii) make provision for the employees of the Company to use or receive
the economic equivalent of the vacation, holiday, sickness and personal days
accrued by the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries under the
benefit plans and policies of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and (iv)
assume or cause to be continued in accordance with their terms all existing
employment, severance, change of control and salary continuation agreements
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any current or former
officer, director, employee or consultant of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or group of such officers, directors, employees or consultants,
in each case, to the extent the Company or any of its Subsidiaries would have
been required to perform such agreement.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, Parent and
Merger Sub shall take all such action or actions as may be necessary or
appropriate to merge the Companys Retirement and Investment Savings Plan
(the " _Company s Plan_" ) with and into Parents 401(k) Savings Plan (the "
_Parent Plan_ " ). Such merger shall be effected in accordance with all
applicable requirements of the Code and  



 

45  ERISA, including the preservation of all accrued benefits (vested or
unvested) under the Companys Plan to the full extent required by applicable
law, and the recognition by the Parent Plan of service prior to the Effective
Time with the Company for eligibility and vesting purposes. The Company
acknowledges and agrees that any such merger (1) shall not take place prior to
expiration of any applicable notice period required by law and (2) may be
further delayed by such review of the history and prior operation of the
Companys Plan as Parent may reasonably determine appropriate to conduct to
ensure the continued tax qualification of the Parent Plan subsequent to the
merger of Parent Plan and the Companys Plan.

(c) Except as agreed by Parent and the Company and set forth in _Section
8.8(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees
that each employee of the Company who continues employment with the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing shall be provided health and
welfare benefits that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than those
provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries under
Parent employee plans.

(d) The Company Board (acting through its Compensation Committee) shall take
all such steps as may be required to cause any compensation arrangements
entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
Offer or the Merger during the Pre-Closing Period to be approved or ratified
(to the extent not previously so approved or ratified), including, but
not limited to, any employment agreements, as "employment compensation,
severance or other employee benefit arrangement" by the Compensation Committee
comprised solely of "independent directors" (in accordance with Rule
14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act, for purposes of satisfying the
requirements of the non-exclusive safe-harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) of
the Exchange Act.

8.9 _Indemnification_.

(a) _Indemnity_. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
will fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company pursuant
to the indemnification agreements between the Company and its directors and
officers in effect as of the date hereof and listed in  _Section 8.9(a)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter (including, to the extent indemnifiable
thereunder, for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby)
(the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), subject to Legal Requirements. Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall,
maintain in effect in the Surviving Corporations (or any successors)
certificate of incorporation and bylaws provisions with respect to
indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses in favor of each
individual who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, a
director or officer of the Company, with respect to acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, that are at least as favorable to the present or former
directors and officers of the Company as those contained in the Company
Governing Document as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

(b) _Insurance_. For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time,
Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain directors and
officers liability insurance with one or more reputable unaffiliated third-
party insurers covering those persons who are covered by the Companys
directors and officers liability insurance policy as of the date hereof for
events occurring prior to the Effective Time on terms and conditions that are,
in the aggregate, no less favorable to the insured than those applicable to
the current directors and officers of the Company under policies maintained by
the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event will the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend in the aggregate in excess of one hundred
twenty-five percent (125%) of the annual premium currently paid by the Company
for such coverage (such amount, the " _Maximum Payment_ "), (and to the extent
such premium would exceed the Maximum Payment for such coverage, the
Surviving Corporation shall use all reasonable efforts to cause to be
maintained the maximum amount of coverage as is available for such Maximum
Payment); and _provided further_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the
foregoing, that Parent may satisfy its obligations under this Section 8.9(b)
by purchasing a "tail" policy under the Companys existing directors and
officers insurance policy, which (i) has an effective term of six (6) years
from the Effective Time, (ii) covers those persons who are currently covered
by the Companys directors and officers insurance policy in effect as of the
date hereof for actions  



 

46  and omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time and (iii) contains
terms and conditions that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable to
the insured than those of the Companys directors and officers insurance
policy in effect as of the date hereof.

(c) _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Section 8.9 is intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by the Indemnified Parties and their
heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding on Parent and
the Surviving Corporation and their respective successors and assigns. In the
event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or its successor or assign (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successor and assign of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, honor the obligations set forth with respect to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, in this Section 8.9.

8.10 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action necessary to
cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

8.11 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board or
an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a
resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the
disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a covered person
of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act of shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Options pursuant to the Offer or the Merger
shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act.

8.12 _Company Rights Plan_. The Company shall not redeem any rights under the
Rights Agreement or amend or modify (other than to render such rights
inapplicable to or otherwise not triggered by (i) the Offer or the Merger or
(ii) any action permitted under this Agreement) or terminate the Rights
Agreement prior to the Effective Time unless, and only to the extent that, it
is required to do so by order of a court of competent jurisdiction. 

8.13 _Stockholder Litigation_. In connection with any stockholder litigation
which may be brought against the Company or its directors relating to the
Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company shall keep Parent and Merger Sub, and any counsel which Parent and
Merger Sub may retain, informed of the status of such litigation and will
provide Parents and Merger Subs counsel the right to participate in the
defense of such litigation to the extent Parent and Merger Sub are not
otherwise a party thereto, and the Company shall not enter into any settlement
or compromise of any such stockholder litigation without Parents and Merger
Subs prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

8.14 _Further Assurances_. From time to time, as and when requested by any
party hereto and at such partys expense, any other party shall execute and
deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents and
instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other
actions as the requesting party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to
evidence and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

8.15 _Parent Payment_.

(a) Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Merger Sub
shall deliver to the Company a promissory note for $7,500,000 to represent
Merger Subs obligation to reimburse the Company for its payment of the
termination fee under Section 8.1(c)(iii) of the GWT Agreement, without
deduction or offset of any nature upon termination of this Agreement
as provided in Section 8.15(b) (the " _EMC Payment Amount_ ") and in the
promissory note.



 

47 (b) If this Agreement is validly terminated by Parent pursuant to Section
10.1(e)(i), Section 10.1(e)(ii) or Section10.1(e)(iii), or by the Company
pursuant to Section 10.1(d)(ii), then Merger Sub shall not be obligated to
reimburse the Company any portion of the EMC Payment Amount, and Merger Subs
promissory note for the EMC Payment Amount automatically shall be canceled in
full. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 10.1 for any
reason not specifically listed in the immediately preceding sentence, other
than a termination by the Company pursuant to Section 10.1(d)(i), Merger Sub
shall reimburse the Company for an amount in cash equal to 50% of the EMC
Payment Amount pursuant to Merger Subs promissory note, which automatically
shall be canceled with respect to the remaining 50% of the amount of such
note. Any payment by Merger Sub on Merger Subs promissory note as provided in
this Section 8.15 shall be the Companys sole and exclusive remedy, and
Parents and Merger Subs sole and exclusive liability, on account of the
termination of this Agreement giving rise to such payment.

a breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub set
forth in this Agreement or (B) any of the representations and warranties of

however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that such breach
by Parent or Merger Sub or such inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of Parent or Merger Sub are curable by Parent or Merger Sub
through the exercise of commercially reasonable efforts, then the Company

10.1(d)(i) until the earlier of (x) the expiration of any current Offer (as

such breach by the Company or such inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the Company are curable by the Company through the exercise of
commercially reasonable efforts (it being understood that a failure to comply

no extension or waiver of this Agreement or any portion thereof shall be made
which by law requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company
without obtaining such approval. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto
to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or
failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement

any subsequent or other failure.

11.4 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto, in
whole or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior
written consent of the other parties, and any attempt to make any such
assignment without such consent shall be null and void, except that Merger
Sub may assign, in its sole discretion, any or all of its rights, interests
and obligations under this Agreement to any direct wholly owned Subsidiary of

11.7 _Severability_. In the event that any one or more of the provisions
contained herein is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect for
any reason in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of
any such provision in every other respect and of the remaining provisions
hereof shall not be in any way impaired or affected (so long as the economic
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party), it being intended that each of
parties rights and privileges shall be enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, and any such invalidity,
illegality and unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction (so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party). If any court of
competent jurisdiction determines that any provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such court has the power to fashion and
enforce another provision (instead of the provision held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable) that is valid, legal and enforceable and carries
out the intentions of the parties hereto under this Agreement and, in the
event that such court does not exercise such power, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith in an attempt to agree to another provision (instead
of the provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) that is valid,
legal and enforceable and carries out the parties intentions to the greatest
lawful extent under this Agreement. 

11.8 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as specifically set forth in Section
8.9, nothing herein expressed or implied is intended or shall be construed to

this Agreement or any other certificate, document, instrument or agreement
executed in connection herewith nor be relied upon other than the parties
hereto and their permitted successors or assigns.

11.9 _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction_. This Agreement, and all
matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement and any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, the validity
hereof and the rights and obligations of the parties hereunder, shall be
construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of The Commonwealth of
Massachusetts applicable to contracts made and to be performed entirely in
such Commonwealth (without giving effect to the conflicts of laws provisions
thereof); provided, however, that the Merger shall be governed by the DGCL.
The parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of
any court of competent civil jurisdiction sitting in The Commonwealth of
Massachusetts over any action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby and each party hereto hereby
irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such action may be heard
and determined in such courts. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably waive
any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
such action brought in such court or any claim that such action brought in
such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a judgment in such action may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by any
applicable Legal Requirement. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
consents to process being served by any party to this Agreement in any action
by delivery of a copy thereof in accordance with the provisions of Section
11.3 and consents to the exercise of jurisdiction of the courts of The
Commonwealth of Massachusetts over it and its properties with respect to any
action, suit or proceeding arising out of or in connection with this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby or the enforcement of any rights
under this Agreement.

other agreements among the parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to

constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof,
it being understood that the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full
force and effect until the Closing and shall survive any termination of this
Agreement.



 

52 11.11 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur to Parent and Merger Sub in the event that the provisions
contained in this Agreement were not performed by the Company in accordance
with its specific terms or were otherwise breached by the Company. It is
accordingly agreed that Parent or Merger Sub shall be entitled to seek an
injunction or injunctions, without the posting of any bond, to prevent
breaches of this Agreement by the Company and to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions of this Agreement, including, but, not limited to,
the provisions of Section 7.1, Section 8.1, Section 8.3, all obligations of
the Company with respect to the Merger, and the exercise of the Top-Up Option
by Parent or Merger Sub, in any court of the United States or any state
having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity.

11.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

54 ANNEX A

CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER

Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Offer, but subject to compliance
with Section 2.1 of the Agreement, Merger Sub (i) shall not be required to
accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the
SEC (including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to
the obligation of Merger Sub to pay for or return tendered Company Shares
promptly after termination or withdrawal of the Offer)), pay for any tendered
Company Shares, (ii) may delay the Acceptance Date and (iii) may allow the
Offer to expire on its expiration date or amend the Offer as to Company
Shares not then paid for at or prior to the scheduled expiration of the Offer
(as it may be extended pursuant to Section 2.1(c) of the Agreement), unless
(A) all waiting periods (and extensions thereof) applicable to the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement (including the Offer and the
Merger) under the HSR Act or any applicable antitrust, competition or merger
control laws shall have expired or been terminated,  _provided, however_ ,
that solely with respect to non-U.S. antitrust, competition or merger control
laws and excluding for purposes of this proviso any European Commission
filings and examinations, this condition shall be deemed satisfied unless the
failure of such waiting periods to have expired or been terminated would have
a suspensory effect or would reasonably be expected to result in material
limitations on the ownership or operations of Parent or the Company or would
subject Parent or the Company to the payment of a material fine or penalty,
(B) the Minimum Condition shall have been satisfied and (C) none of the
following shall be true:

(1) any statute, rule, regulation, legislation, judgment, order or injunction
shall be enacted, enforced, promulgated, amended, issued or deemed applicable
to the Offer by any Governmental Entity (other than the application of the
waiting period provisions of the HSR Act to the Offer or the Merger), that has
had or would reasonably be expected to have, any of the
following consequences:

(A) make illegal, delay materially or otherwise directly or indirectly
restrain or prohibit the making of the Offer, the acceptance for payment of
or payment for some or all of the Company Shares by Merger Sub or the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger;

(B) obtain material damages in connection with the Offer or Merger;

(C) restrain, prohibit or limit the ownership or operation by Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, or materially restrict
the exercise or use, of all or any material portion of the business or assets
of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, or compel
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates to
dispose of, license or hold separate all or any material portion of the
business or assets of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of
their respective Affiliates, or seek to impose any material limitations on
the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to conduct its business or own such
assets; or

(D) impose material limitations on the ability of Parent, Merger Sub or any of
Parents other Affiliates effectively to acquire, hold or exercise full rights
of ownership of the Company Shares or any shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation acquired by Parent, Merger Sub or any of Parents other
Affiliates on all matters properly presented to the Companys stockholders.

(2) there shall be instituted or pending or overtly threatened in writing any
action or proceeding by any Governmental Entity that has resulted or is
reasonably likely to result in any of the consequences referred to in clauses
(A) through (D) of paragraph (1) above;

(3)(i) any of the representations and warranties of the Company in Sections
5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, and 5.21 in this Agreement shall not be true, complete and
correct in all material respects on the date hereof or as of the expiration
date of the Offer as though such representation or warranty had been made at
the time of the expiration of the Offer (except that those representations and
warranties which address matters only as of a particular date shall not
remain true, complete and correct as of such date), and (ii) any of the other
representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement shall not be
true, complete and correct in all respects on the date hereof or as of the
expiration date of the Offer as though such representation or warranty had
been made at the expiration of the Offer (except that those representations
and warranties  



 

55  which address matters only as of a particular date shall not remain true,
complete and correct as of such date); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the condition set forth in Clause (3)(ii) shall not be deemed to exist unless
the effect of all such failures of representations and warranties to be true
and correct (for purposes of this proviso, determining the truth or
correctness of such representations without giving effect to any
qualifications with respect to materiality or Company Material Adverse
Effect), taken together, would reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

(4)(A) the Company shall have failed to perform or comply in any material
respect with any of its obligations under Section 8.3 of the Agreement, or
(B) the Company shall have failed to perform or comply in any material respect
with any of its agreements, obligations or covenants under the Agreement and
such failure to perform or comply with such other agreements, obligations or
covenants shall not have been cured to the good faith reasonable satisfaction
of Parent;

(5) any Company Material Adverse Effect shall have occurred or exist
following the execution and delivery of the Agreement and be continuing;

(6) any Triggering Event shall have occurred and be continuing;

(7) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms; or

(8) immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer, the Company shall not
have delivered to Parent a certificate executed on behalf of the Company by
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company
certifying that the conditions set forth in paragraphs (3), (4) and (5) in
this _Annex A_ are satisfied as of such time and date.

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub
and, subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, may be waived by
Parent or Merger Sub, in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in
the sole discretion of Parent or Merger Sub. The failure by Parent or Merger
Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a
waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right
which may be asserted at any time and from time to time.

The capitalized terms that are used in this _Annex A_ shall have the
respective meanings ascribed thereto in the Agreement and Plan of Merger
(the " _Agreement_ "), dated as of April 8, 2008, by and among EMC
Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation (" _Parent_ "), Emerge Merger
Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("
_Merger Sub_ "), and Iomega Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "

additional shares of Company Common Stock and all additional options,

Agreement through the Expiration Date (including by way of stock dividend or
distribution, split-up, recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares and
the like).

Agreement in connection with the Offer, the Stockholder shall not cause
or permit any Transfer of any of the Shares to be effected.

3\. _Agreement to Vote Shares_.

(a) At every meeting of the stockholders of the Company called, and at every
adjournment or postponement thereof, and on every action or approval by

any Person to vote or give instructions in any manner inconsistent with the
terms of this Section 3\.

4\. _Agreement to Tender_. The Stockholder shall tender (and shall not
withdraw), pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the Offer,
the Shares, provided, however, that the Stockholder will not be obligated to
(i) exercise any options to acquire Company Common Stock and (ii) solely with
respect to the Shares identified on Schedule A, will not be obligated to
tender such Shares pursuant to the Offer if such tender will subject the
Stockholder to liability under Section 16 of the Exchange Act. No later than
two (2) business days prior to the initial expiration date of the Offer, the
Stockholder shall (i) deliver to the depositary designated in the Offer (A) a
letter of transmittal with respect to the Shares complying with the terms of

to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall (or shall require the
Stockholder to attempt to) limit or restrict the Stockholder in his or her
capacity as a director or officer of the Company or any designee of the
Stockholder who is a director or officer of the Company from acting in such
capacity or voting in such persons sole discretion on any matter (it being
understood that this Agreement shall apply to the Stockholder solely in the
Stockholders capacity as a stockholder of the Company).

7\. _Irrevocable Proxy_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
the Stockholder shall deliver to Parent a proxy in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit A_ (the " _Proxy_ "), which shall be irrevocable to the fullest
extent permissible by law, with respect to the Shares.

8\. _No Ownership Interest_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed to vest in Parent any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of
ownership of or with respect to any Shares. All rights, ownership and economic
benefits of and relating to the Shares shall remain vested in and  



 

3  belong to the Stockholder, and Parent shall have no authority to manage,
direct, superintend, restrict, regulate, govern, or administer any of the
policies or operations of the Company or exercise any power or authority to
direct the Stockholder in the voting of any of the Shares, except as otherwise
provided herein.

(e) _No Waiver_. The failure of either party hereto to exercise any right,
power or remedy provided under this Agreement or otherwise available in

contracts made and to be performed entirely in such Commonwealth (without

7 (h) _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM

ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF. 

(i) _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement

will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document. 

(j) _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents and instruments and
other agreements between the parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to
herein, and other Exhibits hereto constitute the entire agreement between the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof.

(k) _Severability_. In the event that any one or more of the provisions
contained herein is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect for
any reason in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of
any such provision in every other respect and of the remaining provisions
hereof shall not be in any way impaired or affected (so long as the economic
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party), it being intended that each of
parties rights and privileges shall be enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, and any such invalidity,
illegality and unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction (so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party). If any court of
competent jurisdiction determines that any provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such court has the power to fashion and
enforce another provision (instead of the provision held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable) that is valid, legal and enforceable and carries out
the intentions of the parties hereto under this Agreement and, in the event
that such court does not exercise such power, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith in an attempt to agree to another provision (instead
of the provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) that is valid,
legal and enforceable and carries out the parties intentions to the greatest
lawful extent under this Agreement.

(l)  _Interpretation_.

(i) Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." As used in this Agreement, the term "affiliate" shall have the
meaning set forth in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



 

8 (ii) The article and section headings contained in this Agreement are solely
for the purpose of reference, are not part of the agreement of the parties
hereto and shall not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement.

(m) _Expenses_. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party
incurring the expenses.

(n) _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts
and by the different parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which
when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all of which together
shall constitute one and the same instrument.

(o)  _Facsimile_. The delivery of signature pages to this Agreement (in
counterparts or otherwise) by facsimile transmission or other electronic
transmission shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

 _EXHIBIT A_

IRREVOCABLE PROXY

The undersigned stockholder (the " _Stockholder_ ") of Iomega Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), hereby irrevocably (to the fullest
extent permitted by law) appoints the directors on the Board of Directors of
EMC Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation (" _Parent_ "), and each of
them, as the sole and exclusive attorneys and proxies of the undersigned, with
full power of substitution and resubstitution, to vote and exercise all voting
and related rights (to the full extent that the undersigned is entitled to do
so) with respect to all of the shares of capital stock of the Company that now
are or hereafter may be beneficially owned by the undersigned, and any and all
other shares or securities of the Company issued or issuable in respect
thereof on or after the date hereof (collectively, the " _Shares_ ") in
accordance with the terms of this Irrevocable Proxy until the Expiration Date
(as defined below). Upon the undersigneds execution of this Irrevocable
Proxy, any and all prior proxies given by the undersigned with respect to any
Shares are hereby revoked and the undersigned agrees not to grant any
subsequent proxies with respect to the Shares until after the Expiration
Date. 

This Irrevocable Proxy is irrevocable to the fullest extent permitted by law,
is coupled with an interest and is granted pursuant to that certain Tender
and Voting Agreement of even date herewith by and among Parent and the
undersigned stockholder (the " _Tender and Voting Agreement_ "), and is
granted in consideration of Parent entering into that certain Agreement
and Plan of Merger of even date herewith (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), among
Parent, Emerge Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and the Company. The Merger
Agreement provides for, among other things, (i) an offer by Merger Sub to pay
Three Dollars and Eighty-five Cents ($3.85) in cash (the " _Offer Price_ ")
for each of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par
value $0.03-1/3 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") and
(ii) the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, pursuant to which all
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company will be converted into
the right to receive the consideration set forth in the Merger Agreement.

As used herein, the term " _Expiration Date_ " shall mean the earlier to
occur of (i) such date and time as the Merger Agreement shall have been
terminated for any reason, (ii) such date and time as the Merger shall become
effective in accordance with the terms and provisions of the
Merger Agreement, or (iii) such date and time as any amendment or change to
the Merger Agreement is effected without the Stockholders consent that (A)
decreases the Offer Price or (B) materially and adversely affects the
Stockholder. 

The attorneys and proxies named above, and each of them, are hereby authorized
and empowered by the undersigned, at any time prior to the Expiration Date,
to act as the undersigneds attorney and proxy to vote the Shares, and to
exercise all voting, consent and similar rights of the undersigned with
respect to the Shares (including, without limitation, the power to execute
and deliver written consents) at every annual, special, adjourned or
postponed meeting of stockholders of the Company and in every written consent
in lieu of such meeting: (i) in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement,
and in favor of each of the other actions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement;    (ii) against approval of any proposal made in opposition to, or in
competition with, consummation of the Offer, the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; and (iii) against any of
the following actions (other than those actions that relate to the Offer, the
Merger and any other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement): (A)
any merger, consolidation, business combination, sale of assets,
reorganization or recapitalization of the Company or any subsidiary of the
Company with any party, (B) any sale, lease or transfer of any significant
part of the assets of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, (C) any
reorganization, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or winding up of
the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, (D) any material change in the
capitalization of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, or the
corporate structure of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, or (E)
any other action that is intended, or could reasonably be expected to, impede,
interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage or adversely affect the Offer,
the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

The attorneys and proxies named above may not exercise this Irrevocable Proxy
on any other matter. The undersigned stockholder may vote the Shares on all
other matters.

Any obligation of the undersigned hereunder shall be binding upon the
successors and assigns of the undersigned.

This Irrevocable Proxy shall terminate, and be of no further force and
effect, automatically upon the Expiration Date.

***** IRREVOCABLE PROXY **** Exhibit B

AMENDMENT TO RIGHTS AGREEMENT

This AMENDMENT TO RIGHTS AGREEMENT (this " _Amendment_ "), dated as of April
8, 2008, is made and entered into by and between Iomega Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), and American Stock Transfer and Trust
Co., as rights agent (the " _Rights Agent_ "). Capitalized terms not otherwise
defined in this Amendment shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms in

and Shenzhen ExcelStor Technology Limited, a PRC company;

WHEREAS, the Company proposes to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger
(the " _Merger Agreement_ ") with EMC Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation
(" _Parent_ "), and Emerge Merger Corporation, a Delaware corporation and
a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), pursuant to which:

Parent (the " _Tender and Voting Agreements_ " and, collectively with the

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has determined that, in
connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, it is necessary and
desirable to amend the Rights Agreement to exempt, among other things, the
Merger Agreement, the Tender and Voting Agreements, the execution thereof and
the transactions contemplated thereby, including, without limitation, the
Offer and the Merger, from the application of the Rights Agreement, in each
case as set forth in this Amendment; and

WHEREAS, (i) Section 27 of the Rights Agreement provides that the Company
may, in its sole and absolute discretion, supplement or amend any provision of

("Parent"), Emerge Merger Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), or any of their respective
Affiliates or Associates, either individually, collectively or in any
combinations, shall be deemed to be or become an "Acquiring Person" solely by
virtue of, or as a result of (i) the execution and delivery of the Agreement
and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 8, 2008, by and among the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub (including any amendment or supplement thereto, the
"Merger Agreement") or the Tender and Voting Agreements (collectively with the
Merger Agreement, the "Transaction Documents"), or (ii) the announcement,
commencement, performance or consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the Transaction Documents, including, without limitation, the Offer or the
Merger (each as defined in the Merger Agreement) (the foregoing actions being

Company that a Permitted Event has occurred."

 



     | (c) | Section 3(a) of the Rights Agreement is amended to add the
following sentence at the end thereof:

undersigned duly appointed officer of the Company certifies that this
Amendment has been executed and delivered in compliance with the terms of
Section 27 of the Rights Agreement.

3\. _Interpretation_. The term "Agreement" as used in the Rights Agreement
shall be deemed to refer to the Rights Agreement as amended hereby. 4\. _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this
Amendment is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or
unenforceable, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith in an attempt
to agree to another provision (instead of the provision held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable) that is valid, legal and enforceable and carries
out the parties intentions to the greatest lawful extent under this
Amendment, it being understood that the remaining provisions shall at all
times remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected,
impaired or invalidated.

5\. _Waiver of Notice_. __ The Rights Agent and the Company hereby waive any
notice requirement under the Rights Agreement pertaining to the matters
covered by this Amendment.

first written above. Except as expressly amended herein, all other terms and
conditions of the Rights Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Rights Agent shall not be subject to, nor
required to interpret or comply with, or determine if any Person has complied
with, any Transaction Document even though reference thereto may be made in
this Amendment and the Rights Agreement.

7\. _Termination_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein,
this Amendment shall terminate and be of no further force or effect in the
event of the termination of the Merger Agreement for any reason.

8\. _Governing Law_. This Amendment shall be deemed a contract made under the
laws of the State of Delaware, and for all purposes of this Amendment shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of such State applicable
to contracts made and to be performed entirely within such State. 

9\. _Counterparts_. This Amendment may be executed in any number of
counterparts (including by facsimile), each of which shall be an original and
all of which shall constitute one and the same document.

executed as of the day and year first above written.
