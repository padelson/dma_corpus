-9- _ARTICLE II_

 

PURCHASE AND SALE

 

2.1 _Purchase and Sale of Securities_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions in this Agreement, at the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause
the Seller Subsidiary to, sell, assign and transfer to Purchaser, and
Purchaser shall purchase, the Securities free and clear of all Liens.

 

2.2 _Purchase Price_. The aggregate purchase price for the Securities shall be
$187,500,000 (the " _Aggregate Purchase Price_ "), as adjusted pursuant to
provisions of _Section 2.3_ below (as so adjusted, the " _Purchase Price_ ").

 

2.3 _Purchase Price Adjustments_.

 

(a) _Post-Closing Estimates_. Within one hundred and twenty (120) days
following the Closing Date (the " _Preparation Period_ "), Seller shall
prepare and deliver to Purchaser a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ")
setting forth Sellers calculation of (i) the Closing Cash, (ii) the Closing
Indebtedness and (iii) the Closing Working Capital, in each case along with
reasonable supporting detail to evidence the calculation of such amount.
During the Preparation Period, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company
and Company Subsidiary to, provide Seller and its representatives with
reasonable access to its officers, employees, agents and other personnel to
the extent reasonably necessary to enable the Seller to prepare, deliver and
verify the Closing Statement and the information contained therein.
The Closing Statement shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the
accounting methodologies, practices, estimation techniques, assumptions and
principles used in the preparation of the Financial Statements and, in the
case of the Closing Working Capital, such accounting methodologies,
practices, estimation techniques, assumptions and principles used in
establishing the Target Working Capital. Purchaser and its representatives
shall have ninety (90) days following its receipt of the Closing Statement
and the supporting detail (the " _Review Period_ ") to review the same. During
the Review Period, Seller shall provide Purchaser and its representatives with
reasonable access, during normal business hours and in a non-disruptive
manner, to its and the Sellers officers, employees, agents and other
personnel to the extent reasonably necessary to enable the Purchaser to review
and verify the Closing Statement and the information contained therein. On
or before the expiration of the Review Period, Purchaser shall deliver to
Seller a written statement accepting or objecting to the Closing Statement
(the " _Closing Statement Response Notice_ "). If Purchaser does not deliver a
Closing Statement Response Notice to Purchaser within the Review Period,
Purchaser shall be deemed to have accepted the Closing Statement in its
entirety.

 

(b) _Disputes_. In the event that Purchaser objects to all or any portion of
the Closing Statement within the Review Period, Purchaser and Seller shall
promptly meet and in good faith attempt to resolve such objections. Any such
objections which cannot be resolved between Purchaser and Seller within thirty
(30) days following Sellers receipt of the Closing Statement Response Notice
shall be resolved in accordance with this _Section 2.3(b)_. Should Seller and
Purchaser not be able to resolve such objections set forth in the Closing
Statement Response Notice within the thirty (30) day period described above,
either Party may submit the matter to an internationally recognized accounting
firm mutually acceptable to the Parties (the " _Accounting Referee_ ") for
review and resolution, with instructions to complete the same as promptly as
practicable, but in any event within thirty (30) days of the submission of the
dispute to the Accounting Referee, and to resolve any objections consistent
with the terms of this Agreement, including making the calculations in
accordance with the definitions of Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness and
Closing Working Capital, as applicable, as set forth in this Agreement. The
Accounting Referee shall only have authority to make determinations in respect
of those specific items for which an objection has been raised in the Closing
Statement Response Notice, and all determinations shall be based solely on the
presentations of Purchaser and Seller and their respective representatives,
and 



 

-10-  not by independent review. In resolving any disputed item, the Accounting
Referee: (i) shall be bound by the principles set forth in this _Section
2.3(b)_, (ii) shall not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest
value for such item claimed by either Party or less than the smallest value
for such item claimed by either Party and (iii) shall not increase the total
purchase price adjustment more than the increase proposed by the Seller nor
decrease the total purchase price adjustment more than the decrease proposed
by the Purchaser, as applicable. The Accounting Referee shall deliver a
statement setting forth its resolution of the dispute within thirty (30) days
of the submission of the dispute to the Accounting Referee, which resolution,
absent manifest error, shall be binding and conclusive on the parties and not
subject to appeal; _provided_ , _however_ , that such determination may be
reviewed, corrected or set aside by a court of competent jurisdiction (as set
forth in _Section 9.10_), but only if and to the extent that the Accounting
Referee is found by such court of competent jurisdiction to have made
mathematical errors with respect to its determination or failed to follow the
principles set forth in this _Section 2.3(b)_. The Closing Statement shall be
modified if necessary to reflect such determination by the Accounting
Referee. The Accounting Referee may not award damages or penalties. The fees
and costs of the Accounting Referee, if one is required, shall be payable by
Purchaser, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, based upon the
percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each
party bears to the amount actually contested by such party, as determined by
the Accounting Referee.

 

(c) _Post-Closing Adjustments_. The Purchase Price payable by Purchaser to
Seller shall be (i) increased by the amount of Closing Cash as finally
determined by this _Section 2.3_, (ii) increased or decreased by the amount,
if any, by which Closing Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to
this _Section 2.3_ exceeds Target Working Capital or Target Working Capital
exceeds Closing Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to this
_Section 2.3_, respectively (provided that no adjustment to the Purchase
Price shall be made pursuant to this clause (ii) if such adjustment would
result in an increase or decrease of less than two hundred fifty thousand
dollars ($250,000.00)), and (iii) decreased by the Closing Indebtedness as
finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.3_. The foregoing adjustments
shall be aggregated for purposes of determining any amounts that may be due
from Purchaser to Seller or Seller to Purchaser pursuant to this _Section
2.3(c)_ (any adjustment to the purchase price pursuant to this  _Section
2.3(c)_, the " _Final Closing Adjustment_ "). __

(d) _Payments_. In the event that the Final Closing Adjustment is a negative
adjustment to the Purchase Price, Seller shall pay to Purchaser an amount in
cash equal to the Final Closing Adjustment within five (5) Business Days of
the final determination of the Final Closing Adjustment. In the event the
Final Closing Adjustment is a positive adjustment to the Purchase Price,
Purchaser shall pay to Seller an amount in cash equal to the Final Closing
Adjustment within five (5) Business Days of the final determination of the
Final Closing Adjustment. Any Final Closing Adjustment shall be made by wire
transfer in immediately available funds. With respect to any accounts
receivable included in Closing Working Capital that are payable to the Seller
or one of its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and the Company
Subsidiary), the Seller shall cause amounts received in respect of such
receivables to be paid to Purchaser (or, at Purchasers option, to the Company
or the Company Subsidiary) promptly upon receipt and, at Purchasers cost and
expense, Seller shall take such reasonable actions to collect any such
receivables as Purchaser shall request. With respect to any accounts payable
included in Closing Working Capital that are payable by Seller or one of its
Subsidiaries (other than the Company and the Company Subsidiary), the
Purchaser shall assume and pay such payables when due.

 

2.4 _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the sale
and purchase of the Securities contemplated by this Agreement shall take
place at a closing (the " _Closing_ ") to be held at the offices of Simpson
Thacher and Bartlett LLP, 1155 F Street N.W., Washington, DC 20004 at 9:00 a.m.
local time on the second Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions to the obligations of the parties hereto set forth in _ARTICLE
VI_ or at such other place or at such other time or on such other date as
Seller and Purchaser may mutually agree upon in writing.

(i) a certificate of the Secretary of Seller certifying as to (i) true,
correct and complete copies of the certified Certificate of Formation of the
Company and the Limited Liability Company Agreement of the Company, (ii) the
organizational documents of the Company Subsidiary and (iii) the resolutions
of the Board of Directors of Seller approving this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

2.6 _Closing Deliveries by Purchaser_. At the Closing, Purchaser shall deliver
or cause to be delivered to Seller:

 

(a) the Aggregate Purchase Price by wire transfer in immediately available
funds to the Purchase Price Bank Account;

 

(b) executed counterparts to the Transition Services Agreement;

(d) executed counterparts to the Professional Services Agreement;

 

(e) executed counterparts to the Release; and

 

(f) a certificate of a duly authorized officer of Purchaser certifying as to
the matters set forth in _Section 6.2_. 

2.7 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. Seller and Purchaser agree to allocate two
million, six hundred thousand dollars ($2,600,000) to the shares of the
Company Subsidiary (the " _Subsidiary Price_ ") and to allocate the remainder
of the Purchase Price (and all other capitalizable costs) among the other
Assets of the Company for all Tax purposes in accordance with an allocation
schedule (the " _Allocation Schedule_ ") prepared by Seller, such Allocation
Schedule subject to Purchasers review and consent and

 



 

-12-  prepared in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder and consistent with the methodology agreed
to in writing by Seller and Purchaser prior to the Closing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the event that Seller and Purchaser cannot reach agreement
with respect to the Allocation Schedule within ninety (90) days of the
Closing, the Accounting Referee shall resolve any disputed portion of the
Allocation Schedule; _provided further_ , that the Subsidiary Price shall be
adjusted to the amount allocated by the ITA, if different. The costs related
to having the Accounting Referee prepare the Allocation Schedule shall
be borne equally by Purchaser and Seller. Seller and Purchaser agree to file
or cause to be filed all Tax Returns in respect of the assets of the Company
in a manner consistent with the Allocation Schedule and to take no position
for Tax purposes inconsistent with the Allocation Schedule, in each case
unless required otherwise by a final determination of a competent taxing
authority.

 

2.8 _Withholding_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 2.8(b)_, Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the Aggregate Purchase Price (but calculated based on the
Subsidiary Price) such amounts as Purchaser is required to deduct or withhold
therefrom under Israeli Law, unless Seller provides Purchaser, at least three
(3) Business Days before Closing, with an ITA Withholding Certificate (as
defined below) in respect of such payment, in which case Purchaser shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the Aggregate Purchase Price only such
amounts as Purchaser is required to deduct and withhold pursuant to such
ITA Withholding Certificate. To the extent that such amounts are so withheld
by Purchaser, except as otherwise provided in this _Section 2.8_, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to Seller. Purchaser shall hold such withheld amounts in trust for
the Seller until paid to the Israeli Taxing Authority (" _ITA_ ") and shall
cause any such withheld amounts to be paid to the ITA in accordance with
Israeli Law in any event not earlier than three (3) Business Days prior to
the last day on which such payment is required. Except as set forth in
_Section 2.8(b)_, upon receipt of an ITA Withholding Certificate from Seller,
Purchaser shall promptly release to Seller any such withheld amounts not
required by such ITA Withholding Certificate to be paid to the ITA. If
Purchaser so withholds amounts and pays them to the ITA with respect to the
Seller, Purchaser shall furnish to the Seller evidence of such withholding
and payment.

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 2.8(a)_, to the extent that the Valid
Withholding Certificate expressly provides that Purchaser is permitted to
remit such withheld amounts to a trustee instead of the ITA and, after such
transfer, Purchaser would have no liability under Israeli Law with respect to
Israeli withholding Tax or other costs in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, then Purchaser shall release to the
Withholding Trust any such withheld amounts (or such applicable portion
thereof) in accordance with an ITA Withholding Certificate received at least
three (3) Business Days prior to the last day on which the amounts so withheld
must be paid to the ITA; _provided_ that the costs, expenses and Liabilities
of any such trustee or arrangement shall be borne solely by Seller. 

(c) For the purpose of this Agreement, an " _ITA Withholding Certificate_ "
shall mean any certificate or other ruling, order or decision issued by the
ITA in respect of Israeli withholding Tax in respect of the sale of the
Securities pursuant to this Agreement and shall include a ruling allowing the
transfer of any such Israeli withholding Tax amount to a trust or similar
arrangement (" _Withholding Trust_ "). Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate in
good faith to obtain any such ITA Withholding Certificate.

Employees at reasonable hours to review information and documentation and ask
questions relative to the properties, books, contracts, commitments and other

the preceding sentence apply. All requests for access to the
offices, properties, Books and Records of Seller and its Subsidiaries shall
be made to such representatives of Seller or its Subsidiaries as Seller shall

treated as confidential information by the Parties and their Affiliates and

Governmental Authority required for the satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in _Section 6.1(b)_, (ii) obtain all other Consents (it being
understood that the failure to obtain any such Consents contemplated by this
clause (ii) shall not cause the condition set forth in _Section 6.3(b)_ to be
deemed not to be satisfied and it being further understood that neither Seller
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to expend any money or agree to
any restrictions in order to obtain any Consents) necessary in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents, (iii) defend any suits, claims, actions, investigations or

actions necessary to obtain any Consents required under or in connection with
any Antitrust Regulation, and to enable all waiting periods under any
Antitrust Regulation to expire or to be terminated, and to avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment under any Antitrust Regulation asserted by any
Governmental Authority, in each case, to cause the transactions contemplated
hereby to occur prior to the Outer Date, including but not limited to (A)

reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on the business,
operation, assets, liabilities, earnings, condition (financial or
otherwise) or results of operations of Purchaser or the Company and the
Company Subsidiary, taken as a whole, or the Business) and (C) contesting,

reasonably practicable to any inquiries received from, and requests for
additional information and documentary material by, any Governmental

Purchaser shall not take any action inconsistent with their obligations under
this Agreement or that would materially hinder or delay the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

5.4 _Public Disclosures_. Unless otherwise required by Law or the rules and
regulations of any stock exchange or quotation services on which such Partys
(or such Partys parents) stock is traded or quoted, prior to the Closing
Date, no news release or other public announcement pertaining to the

measures to permit, to the extent reasonably practicable, the compliance with
such obligations in a manner that avoids any such harm or consequence.

or until the expiration of the relevant representation or warranty under any
of the Transaction Documents and any related claim of indemnification related
thereto.

consideration to business demands of such officers, employees, other
personnel and agents) or books, records or other documents may reasonably be
required in connection with any legal, administrative or other Proceeding in
which the requesting Party may from time to time be involved, regardless of

Agreement is intended to create a Company Plan or amend any Company Plan. This

-35-  Subsidiaries or on behalf of another Person, solicit or hire any employee of
the Company or the Company Subsidiary or any former employee of the Company or

are a material and substantial part of the transactions contemplated hereby.
In the event any court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that the

relieve Seller of liability hereunder except to the extent Seller is actually
prejudiced thereby, and Seller shall inform Purchaser in reasonable detail of
each communication or meeting which Purchasers representatives do not attend
and shall promptly provide copies of each filing and draft filing to
Purchaser. Purchaser and its Affiliates shall cooperate with Seller, as

personnel and premises to the extent necessary for a reasonable review or a
Tax audit of such Tax Returns and relevant to an obligation under this
_Section 5.12_.

anything herein to the contrary, neither Seller, its Subsidiaries nor any
other Person shall have any liability whatsoever to Purchaser arising out of
or relating to the failure to obtain any consents or waivers that may be
required in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or by the
other Transaction Documents or because of the termination of any Contract
as a result thereof. Purchaser further agrees that no representation,
warranty or covenant of Seller contained herein shall be breached or deemed
breached, and no condition shall be deemed not satisfied, as a result of (a)
the failure to obtain any such consent or waiver, (b) any such termination or
(c) any Proceeding commenced or threatened by or on behalf of any Person
arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any such consent or any
such termination. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, cooperate with Purchaser, upon the request of Purchaser, in
any reasonable manner in connection with Purchaser obtaining any such consents
and waivers; _provided_ that such cooperation shall not include any
requirement of Seller, its Subsidiaries or any other Person to expend money or
commence, defend or participate in any litigation to any third party.

 

5.16 _Director and Officer Indemnification_. From and after the Closing Date,
the Company and the Company Subsidiary shall indemnify each present and

such capacity to the fullest extent provided under Delaware or Israeli Law,
as applicable, and in addition, to the fullest extent provided in their
respective charters, by-laws or limited liability company agreement, as

full force and effect for a period of not less than six (6) years from the
Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any claim or claims are
asserted or made within such six (6)-year period, all rights to

shall be determined based upon a hypothetical closing of the taxable year at
the end of the day on the Closing Date with the Closing Date being included
in the Pre-Closing Portion, except that exemptions, allowances or deductions
that are calculated on an annual basis shall be apportioned on a time basis;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any Taxes that are not based on income,
purchases or receipts shall be determined by reference to the relative number
of days in the Pre-Closing Portion or the Post-Closing Portion, as applicable.

 

7.2 _Certain Limitations_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything contained in any Transaction Document to the
contrary, Seller shall not be obligated to indemnify any Purchaser
Indemnified Parties (A) for Purchaser Losses under _Section 7.1(a)(i)_ of
this Agreement (other than in respect of the Seller Specified Reps) and for

Agreement and for any breach of a covenant contained in this Agreement insofar
as it directly relates to the Transition Services Agreement or the

in the aggregate in excess of twenty eight million, one hundred twenty five
thousand dollars ($28,125,000) (the " _Cap_ ") or (B) with respect to all
Purchaser Losses under _Section 7.1(a)_ and for any breach of the
Transition Services Agreement or the Professional Services Agreement
(including breaches involving fraud or willful breach) collectively in the
aggregate in excess of the Purchase Price (the " _Aggregate Cap_ ");
_provided_ , that neither the Cap nor the Aggregate Cap shall apply in the
case of fraud or willful breach involving this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in any Transaction Document to the
contrary, Purchaser shall not be obligated to indemnify any Seller Indemnified
Parties (A) for Seller Losses under _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ of this Agreement

Letter, Seller shall not be liable for any Purchaser Losses unless and until
the aggregate amount of all Purchaser Losses incurred by Purchaser exceeds
two million dollars ($2,000,000) (the " _Deductible_ ") and then Seller shall
be liable for aggregate amount of all Purchaser Losses (excluding the amount
of the Deductible); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) all Purchaser Losses up
to the Deductible shall be calculated and included in the Deductible only to
the



 

-46-  extent Purchaser Losses resulting from any single claim or aggregate claims
arising out of substantially the same facts, events or circumstances exceed
the Lower Threshold and (ii) all Purchaser Losses in excess of the Deductible
shall be calculated and included as Purchaser Losses for any purpose under
this Article VII only to the extent Purchaser Losses resulting from any single
claim or aggregate claims arising out of substantially the same facts, events
or circumstances exceed the Higher Threshold; _provided_ , _further_ , that,
for purposes of determining whether a Purchaser Loss applies to the Lower
Threshold or the Higher Threshold, such determination shall be made based on
timing of Purchaser Indemnified Partys discovery of the event underlying such
Purchaser Loss; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Deductible, the Lower
Threshold and the Higher Threshold shall not apply to indemnification claims
for Purchaser Losses under _Section 7.1(a)(i)_ for breach of Seller Specified
Reps or under _Sections 7.1(a)(ii)_ or _7.1(a)(iii)_ , or for fraud or willful
breach.

 

(d) The representations and warranties of Seller and Purchaser contained in
_ARTICLE III_ (as modified by the Disclosure Letter) and  _ARTICLE IV_ ,
respectively, of this Agreement shall survive the Closing until the twelve
(12)-month anniversary of the Closing Date, other than the representations set

and  _Section 4.1_, _Section 4.2_, _Section 4.4_ and _Section 4.6_
(collectively, the " _Purchaser Specified Reps_ ") which shall survive until

limitations with respect to the matters contained therein or, if no such
applicable statute of limitations exists, indefinitely. The covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing until the
date or dates specified therein or, if not so specified, until the expiration

therein or, if no such applicable statute of limitations exists, indefinitely.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no time limitations shall apply to any claims
based on fraud or willful breach.

(e) The obligations to indemnify, defend and hold harmless a Party pursuant
to _Section 7.1(a)_ or _7.1(b)_ shall terminate if the applicable
representation, warranty or covenant terminates pursuant to _Section 7.2(d)_;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that such obligations to indemnify and hold
harmless shall not terminate with respect to any item as to which the Seller
Indemnified Party or Purchaser Indemnified Party, as the case may be, to be
indemnified (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall have, before the
expiration of the applicable survival period, made a claim by delivering a
written notice (stating in reasonable detail the basis of such claim) to the
Indemnifying Party.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything contained herein or elsewhere to the contrary,
all "material," "materially" or Company Material Adverse Effect qualifiers
contained in the representations and warranties (or definitions used in the
representations and warranties) set forth in _ARTICLE III_ (other than clause
(ii) of _Section 3.16(a)_) and  _ARTICLE IV_ of this Agreement and in the
certificates delivered pursuant to _Section 6.2(a)_ or _Section 6.3(a)_
shall be ignored and not given any effect for purposes of the indemnification
provisions hereof, including, without limitation, for purposes of determining
whether or not a breach of a representation or warranty has occurred, in
determining whether the limitations in this _Section 7.2_ have been satisfied
(including the Deductible) and/or in determining the amount of any
indemnifiable Purchaser Losses.

(g) Except with respect to intentionally concealed matters, no information or
knowledge acquired, or investigations conducted, by Purchaser or its
representatives, of the Business, the Company, the Company Subsidiary or
otherwise, shall in any way limit, or constitute a waiver of, or a defense to,
any claim for indemnification by Purchaser or any Purchaser Indemnified Party
under this Agreement.



 

-47- 7.3 _Notice of Loss; Procedures for Third-Party Claims_.

 

(a) _Notice of Loss_. An Indemnified Party shall give the indemnifying party
hereunder (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") notice of any matter which an
Indemnified Party has determined has given or could give rise to a right of
indemnification under this Agreement promptly following such determination,
stating in reasonable detail the nature and basis of the claim and the amount
thereof, the method of computation thereof, and containing a reference to the
provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification
is claimed or arises. Failure of the Indemnified Party to give such notice
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability on account of this
indemnification, except if and to the extent the Indemnifying Party is
actually prejudiced thereby.

 

(b) _Third Party Claim Procedures_. Promptly after the receipt by any
Indemnified Party of a notice of any claim, action, suit or Proceeding by any
third party that may be subject to indemnification hereunder, such Indemnified
Party shall give written notice of such claim to the Indemnifying Party,
stating in reasonable detail the nature and basis of the claim and the
amount thereof, to the extent known, along with copies of the relevant
documents evidencing the claim, the basis for indemnification sought and the
method of computation of the amount to which the Indemnified Party claims to
be entitled hereunder. Failure of the Indemnified Party to give such notice
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability on account of this
indemnification, except if and to the extent the Indemnifying Party is
actually prejudiced thereby. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver
to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after the Indemnified Partys receipt
thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received
by the Indemnified Party relating to the claim and reasonably cooperate with
the Indemnifying Party in evaluating and defending such claims. The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense of the
Indemnified Party against the third party claim if (i) it gives notice of its
intention to do so to the Indemnified Party prior to the substantial
completion of discovery relating to such third party claim and (ii) the
Indemnifying Party acknowledges its indemnity obligation hereunder in respect
of such Losses relating thereto, subject to the terms hereof. So long as the
Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of the third party claim in
accordance herewith and notified the Indemnified Party in writing thereof, (A)
the Indemnified Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and
expense and participate in the defense of the third party claim, (B) the
Indemnified Party shall not file any papers or consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the third party claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) and (C) the Indemnifying Party will not
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect
to the third party claim (other than a judgment or settlement that is solely
for money damages payable by the Indemnifying Party and is accompanied by a
release of all claims against the Indemnified Party) without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). Whether or not the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the
defense, such Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to indemnify the
Indemnified Party hereunder for any settlement entered into without
the Indemnifying Partys prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. The parties will use commercially reasonable
efforts to minimize Losses from third party claims and will act in good faith
in responding to, defending against, settling or otherwise dealing with such
claims.

7.4 _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. Any payment made pursuant to the
indemnification obligations under _Section 5.12_ or this _ARTICLE VII_ shall
be treated as an adjustment to the purchase price. Any indemnity payment under
this Agreement shall be (i) decreased by any (A) amounts actually recovered
from third parties or amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party
under third party insurance policies with respect to such Loss or (B) tax
benefits actually realized by the Indemnified Party in respect of such Loss
to the extent such benefits reduce the Tax liability of the Indemnified Party
for the tax year in which the payment is received or in any of the two (2)
succeeding tax years, and (ii) increased by the cost incurred by the
Indemnified Party in pursuing such contribution or indemnification from third
parties and available insurance claims (including increased insurance
premiums).

 



 

-48- 7.5 _Remedies Exclusive_. Following the Closing, the remedies set forth in
this  _ARTICLE VII_ shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy and shall
be in lieu of any other remedies that may be available to the Indemnified
Parties under any other agreement or pursuant to any statutory or common law
(including Environmental Law), other than claims arising out of fraud and
willful breach or for specific performance, with respect to any Losses or
remedy of any kind or nature incurred directly or indirectly resulting from or
arising out of the Transaction Documents, the transactions contemplated
thereby, the Securities or the Business. Seller and Purchaser each hereby
waive any provision of any applicable Law to the extent that it would limit or
restrict the agreement contained in this  _Section 7.5_.

7.6 _Mitigation_. Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate with each other with
respect to resolving any claim or liability with respect to which either such
Party is obligated to indemnify Indemnified Parties hereunder, including by
making commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate or resolve any such claim
or liability.

 

 _ARTICLE VIII_

Closing shall not have been consummated on or prior to the Outer Date;

_Section 8.1(b)_ shall not be available to any Party whose action or failure

cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before
such date; and _provided_ , _further_ , that neither Purchaser nor Seller
shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
8.1(b)_ in the event the other party has initiated Proceedings to specifically

withdrawn, reversed or otherwise made inapplicable); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
8.1(c)_ shall have complied with _Section 5.3_ hereunder to prevent the
entry of and to remove or avoid the imposition of such Order;

(d) by Seller prior to the Closing, upon written notice to Purchaser, if (i)
Purchaser shall have materially breached any of the covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement to be complied with by Purchaser unless, to the
extent such breach is capable of being cured, Purchaser shall have cured such
breach within fifteen (15) days of receiving notice from Seller of such
breach or (ii) there exists a breach of any representation or warranty of
Purchaser contained in this Agreement such that the closing condition set
forth in  _Section 6.2(a)_ would not be satisfied and such breach is
incapable of being cured by the Outer Date; or

(e) by Purchaser prior to the Closing, upon written notice to Seller, if (i)
Seller shall have materially breached any of the covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement to be complied with by Seller, Seller Subsidiary,
the Company or the Company Subsidiary unless, to the extent such



 

-49-  breach is capable of being cured, Seller shall have cured such breach within
fifteen (15) days of receiving notice from Purchaser of such breach or (ii)
there exists a breach of any representation or warranty of Seller contained
in this Agreement such that the closing condition set forth in _Section
6.3(a)_ would not be satisfied and such breach is incapable of being cured by
the Outer Date.

 

8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of any termination of the Agreement
as provided in _Section 8.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become wholly
void and of no further force and effect and there shall be no liability on the
part of Purchaser or Seller, except that the obligations of Purchaser and
Seller under _Sections 5.2(b)_ and _5.4_ , this  _Section 8.2_ and _ARTICLE
IX_ of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the provisions of this _Section 8.2_ shall not relieve either
party of any liability for fraud or willful breach of this Agreement
occurring prior to such termination.
