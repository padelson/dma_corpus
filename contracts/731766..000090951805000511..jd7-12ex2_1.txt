vii   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER    This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER
(this "Agreement"), dated as of July 6, 2005, is by and among UnitedHealth
Group Incorporated, a Minnesota corporation ("Parent"), Point Acquisition
LLC, a limited liability company organized under the laws of the State of
Delaware and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and
PacifiCare Health Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company").  
W I T N E S S E T H:   WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent
and the Company and the Managing Member of Merger Sub have approved and
declared advisable this Agreement and the merger of the Company with and into
Merger Sub (the "Merger"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement;   WHEREAS, for United States Federal income tax
purposes, it is intended that the Merger qualify as a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code"), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
and that this Agreement constitutes, and hereby is adopted as, a plan of
reorganization;   WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make
certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection
with the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger;
and   WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
Parent (and/or one of its Subsidiaries) is entering into employment
agreements with the individuals set forth on Exhibit A hereto (such
employment agreements referred to, collectively, as the "New Employment
Agreements," and such individuals, the "Covered Employees" ) in order to
provide for the continued service and employment of such persons.   NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties hereto agree as
follows:      ARTICLE I   The Merger   Section 1.01 The Merger. Upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in
accordance with the General Corporation Law (the "DGCL") and the Limited
Liability Company Act of the State of Delaware (collectively, "Delaware
Law"), the Company shall be merged with and into Merger Sub at the Effective
Time. At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of the Company shall cease, and Merger Sub shall continue
as the surviving entity in the Merger (the "Surviving Entity") and shall
succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of the Company in
accordance with Delaware Law.   Section 1.02 Closing. The closing of the
Merger (the "Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m. on a date to be
specified by the parties (the "Closing Date"), which shall be no later than
the second business day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their terms are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
those conditions at such time), at the offices of Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP,
767 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10153, unless another time, date or place is
agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.   Section 1.03 Effective Time.
Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the
Closing Date, the parties shall file with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") executed in
accordance with the relevant provisions of Delaware Law and, as soon as
practicable on or after the Closing Date, shall make all other filings or
recordings required under Delaware Law. The Merger shall become effective at
such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware, or at such other time as Parent and the
Company shall agree upon and shall specify in the Certificate of Merger (the
time the Merger becomes effective being the "Effective Time").   Section
1.04 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
Delaware Law.   Section 1.05 Certificate of Formation; Operating
Agreement.   (a) The Certificate of Formation of Merger Sub, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of
Formation of the Surviving Entity until thereafter changed or amended as
provided therein or by Delaware Law or other applicable Law.   (b) The
Operating Agreement of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the Operating Agreement of the Surviving Entity
until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law;
provided, however, that the Operating Agreement of the Surviving Entity shall
be amended as necessary to comply with the obligations of the
Surviving Entity set forth in Section 6.04 hereof.    2   Section 1.06
Managers. The managers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the managers of the Surviving Entity until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly
designated, as the case may be.   Section 1.07 Officers. The officers of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of
the Surviving Entity until the earlier of their resignation or removal or
until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case
may be.   Section 1.08 Alternative Merger Structure. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, if requested in writing by Parent at least
three business days prior to the Closing Date, the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be effected (subject to the conditions contained herein) by (i)
Merger Sub converting into a Delaware corporation (the "Corporate Merger
Subsidiary") and (ii) Corporate Merger Subsidiary merging with and into the
Company (the "Reverse Merger"), provided that such revision to the structure
does not preclude satisfaction of the closing conditions set forth in Section
7.02(e) and Section 7.03(c), without any waiver thereof. In such event, the
Company shall be the Surviving Entity, the conversion of the outstanding
Company securities will occur as provided in the following Article, and each
issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Corporate Merger Subsidiary
shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Entity in the Reverse Merger. The other provisions of this
Agreement will continue to apply in the event of the Reverse Merger, mutatis
mutandis (with all references to Merger Sub deemed to mean the Corporate
Merger Subsidiary). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Section 1.08, no revision to the structure of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall (i) result in any change in the
Merger Consideration, (ii) be materially adverse to the interests of Parent,
the Company, Merger Sub, the holders of shares of Parent Common Stock or the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, or (iii) unreasonably impede or
delay consummation of the Merger. The parties agree to amend this Agreement
to the extent necessary to provide for more specific mechanics of the
alternative structure described in this Section 1.08.     ARTICLE II  
Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Entities; 
Exchange of Certificates; Company Equity Awards   Section 2.01 Effect on
Capital Stock. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any holder of
any shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company
(together with the associated Company Rights, the "Company Common Stock") or
any membership interests of Merger Sub:   (a) Membership Interests of Merger
Sub. The issued and outstanding membership interests of Merger Sub shall
remain outstanding and shall constitute the only issued and outstanding
equity interests of the Surviving Entity.    3   (b) Cancellation of
Treasury Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the
Company (as treasury stock or otherwise), automatically shall be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and no shares of Parent Common Stock, cash
or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.   (c)
Conversion of Company Common Stock. Subject to Section 2.02(e), each issued
and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than shares to be
canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b), and other than as provided
in Section 2.02(k) with respect to shares as for which appraisal rights have
been perfected), shall be converted into the right to receive:   (i) 1.10
(the "Exchange Ratio") validly issued, fully paid and  nonassessable shares
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of  Parent ("Parent Common
Stock") (the "Stock Consideration"); and   (ii) $21.50 in cash (the "Cash
Consideration " and, together with  the Stock Consideration, the "Merger
Consideration").   As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company
Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any
such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Certificate") shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional share
of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.02(e), in each case to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon
surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.02(b), without
interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common
Stock or Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number
of shares or a different class, by reason of the occurrence or record date of
any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction, the
Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction.   Section 2.02
Exchange of Certificates.   (a) Exchange Agent. As of the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock, with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. or such other bank or trust company
as may be designated by Parent, with the Company\'s prior written consent,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, as exchange agent (the
"Exchange Agent" ), for exchange in accordance with this Article II, through
the Exchange Agent, (i) certificates (or evidence of shares in book-entry
form) representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to
Section 2.01(c) in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock,
(ii) cash sufficient to pay the Cash Consideration and (iii) from time to
time as needed, additional cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to Section 2.02(e) hereof and any dividends and other
distributions pursuant to Section 2.02(c) hereof (such    4  shares of
Parent Common Stock and Cash Consideration, together with any dividends or
other distributions with respect thereto with a record date after the
Effective Time and any cash payments in lieu of any fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock, being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange
Fund").   (b) Exchange Procedures. As promptly as practicable after
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each
holder of record of a Certificate whose shares of Company Common Stock were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.01(c), (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and which shall be in customary form and shall have such other
provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in
surrendering the Certificates in exchange for certificates (or evidence of
shares in book-entry form) representing the Stock Consideration portion of
the Merger Consideration and cash representing the Cash Consideration portion
of the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions to which
holders of Certificates are entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash in
lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holders
are entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e). Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as may be
reasonably required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) a certificate (or
evidence of shares in book-entry form) representing that number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of this Article II after taking into account all
the shares of Company Common Stock then held by such holder under all
such Certificates so surrendered and (B) a check for the cash that such
holder is entitled to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article II
after taking into account all the shares of Company Common Stock then held by
such holder under all such Certificates so surrendered, including for the
Cash Consideration portion of the Merger Consideration, any dividends or
other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e), and the
Certificate so surrendered shall then be canceled. In the event of a transfer
of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, (w) a certificate (or evidence of shares in
book-entry form) representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common
Stock, (x) a check for the Cash Consideration portion of the Merger
Consideration, (y) any dividends or other distributions to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and (z) cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e), may be issued to a person other than
the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if,
upon presentation to the Exchange Agent, such Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person
requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock to a person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02(b), each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration, any
dividends or other distributions to which the holder of such Certificate is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional share
of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.02(e). No interest will be paid or will accrue on the Merger Consideration
or on any cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to Section 2.02(c)
or (e).    5   (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No
dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the share of Parent Common Stock
that the holder thereof has the right to receive upon the surrender thereof,
and no cash payment in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.02(e), in each case
until the holder of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate in
accordance with this Article II. Following surrender of any Certificate,
there shall be paid to the holder thereof (i) at the time of such surrender,
the amount of cash payable in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and the
amount of dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time and
paid with respect to Parent Common Stock prior to such surrender and (ii) at
the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a
payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock.   (d) No Further Ownership Rights in Company
Common Stock. All shares of Parent Common Stock issued and cash paid upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this
Article II (including any dividends or other distributions paid pursuant to
Section 2.02(c) and cash paid in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to
Section 2.02(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificates, and at the close of business on
the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Entity of the shares
of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Subject to the last sentence of Section 2.02(f), if, at any
time after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Entity or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II.   (e) No Fractional Shares.  
(i) No certificates, scrip or evidence of shares in book-entry  form
representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be  issued upon
the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividends  or other
distributions of Parent shall relate to such fractional share  interests and
such fractional share interests will not entitle the  owner thereof to vote
or to any rights of a stockholder of Parent.   (ii) In lieu of such
fractional share interests, Parent shall pay  to each former holder of shares
of Company Common Stock an amount in  cash equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (A) the fractional  share interest to which such former holder
(after taking into account  all shares of Company Common Stock held at the
Effective Time by such  holder) would otherwise be entitled and (B) the per
share closing  price of Parent Common Stock on the Closing Date (or, if such
date is  not a trading day, the trading day immediately preceding the
Closing  Date) on the NYSE Composite Transactions Tape (or, if not
reported    6   thereby, as reported by any other authoritative source).
As promptly  as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if
any,  to be paid to holders of fractional interests, the Exchange Agent 
shall so notify Parent and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to 
deposit such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the  Exchange
Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional  interests subject to
and in accordance with the terms hereof.   (f) Termination of Exchange Fund.
Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of
the Certificates for nine months after the Effective Time shall be delivered
to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Certificates who have not
previously complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent
for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, any dividends or
other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in
lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with this
Article II. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered immediately
prior to the date on which any Merger Consideration (and all dividends or
other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and all cash payable
in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.02(e)) would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority (as defined
below), any such Merger Consideration (and all dividends or
other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and all cash payable
in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.02(e)) in respect thereof
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of
Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously
entitled thereto.   (g) No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any
shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or other distributions with
respect thereto) or cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock or cash from the Exchange Fund, in each case delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.   (h) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest
any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily
basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be
the property of, and shall be paid to, Parent. Any losses resulting from such
investments shall not in any way diminish Parent\'s and Merger Sub\'s
obligation to pay the full amount of the Merger Consideration.   (i) Lost
Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the
Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other
distributions to which the holder of such Certificate would be entitled
pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional share of
Parent Common Stock to which such holder would be entitled pursuant to
Section 2.02(e), in each case in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.    7   (j) Withholding Rights. The Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to
any holder of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, or under any provision of state or foreign tax Law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
taxing authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for the purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the former holder of the shares of
Company Common Stock. Any such withholding shall be applied first against the
Cash Consideration to the full extent thereof and then against the Stock
Consideration. If withholding is required from shares of Parent Common Stock,
the Exchange Agent shall sell in the open market such shares of Parent Common
Stock on behalf of the former holder of Company Common Stock as is necessary
to satisfy such withholding obligation and shall pay such cash proceeds to
the appropriate taxing authority.   (k) Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding
Section 2.01(c), any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and held by a person who has not voted in favor
of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has properly demanded
appraisal for such shares in accordance with Delaware Law (the "Dissenting
Shares") shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger
Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise
loses its rights to appraisal or it is determined that such holder does not
have appraisal rights in accordance with Delaware Law. If, after the
Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses its right
to appraisal, or if it is determined that such holder does not have appraisal
rights, such shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.
The Company shall give Parent and Merger Sub prompt notice of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of shares, and Parent and Merger Sub
shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands except as required by applicable Law. The Company
shall not, except with prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, unless and to the
extent required to do so under applicable Law.   Section 2.03 Company
Equity Awards.   (a) Except as provided in Section 5.01(a)(ii)(2) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, all stock options (the "Company Stock Options")
outstanding, whether or not exercisable and whether or not vested, at the
Effective Time granted under the Company\'s 1996 Stock Option Plan for
Officers and Key Employees, 1996 Non-Officer Directors Stock Plan, Amended
1997 Premium Priced Stock Option Plan, 2000 Employee Plan, 2000 Non-Employee
Directors Stock Plan and the 2005 Equity Inventive Plan (collectively, the
"Company Stock Plans"), shall remain outstanding following the Effective
Time. At the Effective Time, all of the Company Stock Options shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of the
Company or the holder thereof, be assumed in full by Parent, which shall have
assumed the Company Stock Plans as of the Effective Time by virtue of this
Agreement and without any further action by Parent. From and after the
Effective Time, all references to the Company in the Company Stock Plans and
in any agreement granting Company Stock Options shall be deemed to refer to
Parent. Each Company Stock Option assumed by Parent (each, a "Substitute
Stock Option") shall be converted automatically into options to   
8  purchase shares of Parent Common Stock upon the same terms and conditions
as are in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to such
Company Stock Option, except that (i) each such Substitute Stock Option shall
represent the right to acquire, that whole number of shares of Parent Common
Stock (rounded down to the next whole share) equal to the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option multiplied by the
Option Exchange Ratio and (ii) the option price per share of Parent Common
Stock under each Substitute Stock Option shall be an amount equal to the
option price per share of Company Common Stock subject to the related Company
Stock Option in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the
Option Exchange Ratio (the option price per share, as so determined, being
rounded up to the next 100th of a cent). Each Substitute Stock Option shall
otherwise have the same terms and conditions (including with respect to
vesting and exercisability), as such Company Stock Option. For purposes of
this Agreement, the "Option Exchange Ratio" shall be the sum of (x) plus (y),
where (x) is the Exchange Ratio and (y) is the number equal to the quotient
of the Cash Consideration divided by the Parent Trading Price. The "Parent
Trading Price" means the per share closing trading price of Parent Common
Stock on the NYSE Composite Transactions Tape (or, if not reported thereby,
as reported by any other authoritative source), on the trading day
immediately prior to the Closing Date. Except as provided in Section
5.01(a)(ii)(2) of the Company Disclosure Letter, Parent acknowledges and
agrees that all outstanding Company Stock Options shall vest in full as of
the Effective Time under the terms of the Company Stock Plans as a result of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (b) Except as provided
in Section 5.01(a)(ii)(2) of the Company Disclosure Letter, each share of
Company Common Stock outstanding as of the Effective Time granted under the
Company Stock Plans which is subject to forfeiture risk ("Company Restricted
Shares") shall be deemed fully vested as of the Effective Time in accordance
with the terms of such plans and, in full settlement thereof (net of
applicable withholding in accordance with the practices of the Company prior
to the date of this Agreement), shall be converted into the right to receive
the per share Merger Consideration contemplated by Section 2.01 of this
Agreement, which shall be paid by Parent as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time. Except as provided in Section 5.01(a)(ii)(2) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, each deferred stock unit ("Company DSUs") and restricted
stock unit ("Company RSUs") deferred under the Company Stock Plans, the Third
Amended and Restated Stock Unit Deferred Compensation Plan and the Third
Amended and Restated Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan (collectively,
the "Company Deferred Stock Plans") shall become distributable (whether or
not then vested) and, in full settlement thereof (net of applicable
withholding in accordance with the practices of the Company prior to the date
of this Agreement), shall be converted into the right to receive the per
share Merger Consideration contemplated by Section 2.01 of this Agreement,
which shall be paid by Parent as promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time. Each share of Company Common Stock to which holders of Company
Restricted Shares, Company DSUs and Company RSUs are entitled as of
the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in accordance with Sections 2.01 and 2.02 of this
Agreement. To the extent that amounts are withheld from the consideration
otherwise payable to holders of Company Restricted Shares, Company DSUs or
Company RSUs pursuant to this Section 2.03, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holders
in respect of which the withholding was made.    9   (c) As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver, or
cause to be delivered, to each holder of a Substitute Stock Option a notice
setting forth such holder\'s rights pursuant thereto. Except as provided
herein, Parent shall comply with the terms of all such Substitute Stock
Options and ensure that the conversion and assumption provided in this
Section 2.03 with respect to any Company Stock Option that qualifies as an
"incentive stock option" (as defined in section 422 of the Code) shall
be effected in a manner consistent with the requirements of section 424(a) of
the Code. Parent shall take all actions with respect to the Company Stock
Plans, and the Company Stock Options that are necessary to implement the
provisions of this Section 2.03, including all corporate action necessary to
reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for
delivery upon exercise of Substitute Stock Options pursuant to the terms set
forth in this Section 2.03. Parent shall register the shares of Parent Common
Stock subject to Substitute Stock Options by filing on the Closing Date a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) or another
appropriate form, with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
(the "SEC") and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain
the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements
with respect thereto for so long as Substitute Stock Options remain
outstanding.   (d) Parent and the Company agree that, in order to most
effectively compensate and retain Company Insiders in connection with the
Merger, both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that
Company Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Exchange Act"), to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law in connection with the conversion of
shares of Company Common Stock and other equity securities including
derivative securities (i.e., Company Stock Options, Company DSUs and Company
RSUs) into shares of Parent Common Stock and Substitute Stock Options in the
Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the
provisions of this Section 2.03(d). The Board of Directors of the Company
(the "Company Board"), or a committee of Non-Employee Directors (as such term
is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act)
thereof, shall adopt a resolution providing that the disposition by Company
Insiders of Company Common Stock, Company DSUs and Company RSUs in exchange
for Merger Consideration and the disposition by Company Insiders of Company
Stock Options upon conversion into Substitute Stock Options, in each case
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, are intended to
be exempt from liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act.
"Company Insiders" shall mean those officers and directors of the Company who
are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act. Actions described in this Section 2.03(c) shall be taken in accordance
with the interpretative letter, dated January 12, 1999, issued by the SEC\'s
Division of Corporation Finance to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP
relating to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.   (e) Except as set forth in
Section 5.01(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter, since January 1, 2004,
the Company, including the Company Board and any committee acting on behalf
of the Company Board, has not, and will not hereafter, except for the Company
Stockholder Approval and the Merger, take any action to accelerate the
vesting or exercisability, or otherwise amend, modify or change the terms, of
any Company Stock Option, Company Restricted Shares, Company DSUs or Company
RSUs.    10   ARTICLE III   Representations and Warranties of the
Company   Except as set forth in the disclosure letter (with specific
reference to the Section or Subsection of this Agreement to which the
information stated in such disclosure relates; provided that any fact or
condition disclosed in any section of such disclosure letter in such a way as
to make its relevance to a representation or representations made elsewhere
in this Agreement or information called for by another section of such
disclosure letter reasonably apparent shall be deemed to be an exception to
such representation or representations or to be disclosed on such other
section of such disclosure letter notwithstanding the omission of a reference
or cross reference thereto) delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the

requisite power and authority to carry on its business as now
being conducted. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified
or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of
its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other than in
such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in
good standing, individually or in the aggregate has not resulted in, and
would not reasonably be expected to result in, material direct or indirect
costs or liabilities to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
The Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies of its
Certificate of Incorporation (the "Company Certificate") and By-laws (the
"Company By-laws") and the certificate of incorporation and by-laws (or
comparable organizational documents) of each of its Subsidiaries, in each
case as amended to the date of this Agreement. The Company has made available
to Parent and its representatives correct and complete copies of the minutes
of all meetings of stockholders, the Company Board and each committee of the
Company Board and the board of directors of each of its Subsidiaries held

Company Disclosure Letter lists all the Subsidiaries of the Company and, for

such Subsidiary is qualified or licensed to do business. All the outstanding
shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each such
Subsidiary have been validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and
are owned directly or indirectly by the Company free and clear of all
pledges, claims, liens, charges, encumbrances or security interests of any
kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, "Liens"), and free of any
restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital
stock or other equity interests. Except for the capital stock or other equity
or voting interests of its Subsidiaries and publicly traded securities held

entity, the Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock
or other equity or voting interests in any person.    11   Section 3.03

Agreement and the Merger by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Company Stockholder
Approval"), to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company and the consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, and no other corporate

by the Company will not, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach
of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) under, or
give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of
any obligation or to the loss of a benefit under, or result in the creation
of any Lien in or upon any of the properties or other assets of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries under, (i) the Company Certificate or the Company
By-laws or the comparable organizational documents of any of its
Subsidiaries, (ii) any loan or credit agreement, bond, debenture, note,

Company and each of its Subsidiaries, has been since December 31, 2002 and is
in compliance with all statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, regulations,
judgments, orders and decrees of any Governmental Authority, including the
federal Medicare statute, the Federal Civil False Claims Act and the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or the regulations

regulations, applicable to it, its properties or other assets or its business
or operations (collectively, "Laws"), except for instances of non-compliance
that individually or in the aggregate have not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. None of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries has received, since December 31, 2002, a notice or
other communication alleging or relating to a possible material   
19  violation of any Laws applicable to its businesses or operations. The

violation of, default (with or without notice or lapse of time or both)
under, or event giving to others any right of termination or cancellation of,
with or without notice or lapse of time or both, any Permit. There is no
event which has occurred that, to the Knowledge of the Company, would
reasonably be expected to result in the revocation, cancellation, non-renewal
or adverse modification of any such Permit which revocation, cancellation,
non-renewal or adverse modification individually or in the aggregate would
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Assuming
all Closing Consents (as defined below) are made or obtained, the Merger, in
and of itself, would not cause the revocation or cancellation of any such
Permit.   (b) Since December 31, 2002, (i) neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has received, nor otherwise has any Knowledge of, any
written notice from any Governmental Authority or has become a party to any
enforcement action, order, decree, stipulation or open and pending financial

or any of its Subsidiaries is under investigation or the subject of an
inquiry by any such Governmental Authority for such alleged material
noncompliance) with any applicable material Law, (y) asserts any risk-based
capital deficiency or (z) would be reasonably likely to result in a material
fine, assessment or cease and desist order, or the suspension, revocation or
material limitation or restriction of any Permit; and (ii) neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any agreement or
settlement with any Governmental Authority with respect to its non-compliance
with, or violation of, any applicable Law. Since December 31, 2002, to the
Knowledge of the Company, no third party service provider acting on behalf of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has received any written notice from
any Governmental Authority or has become a party to any enforcement action,
order, decree or stipulation that alleges any material noncompliance (or that
such third party service provider is under investigation or the subject of an
inquiry by any such Governmental Authority for such alleged material
noncompliance) with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
of 1996 and the regulations promulgated thereunder or applicable state
privacy or information security laws and regulations.   (c) Since December
31, 2002, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries has timely filed all
material regulatory reports, schedules, statements, documents, filings,
submissions, forms, registrations and other documents, together with any
amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that each was required
to file with any Governmental Authority, including state health and insurance
regulatory authorities ("Company Regulatory Filings") and any applicable
Federal regulatory authorities, and have timely paid all Taxes, fees and
assessments due and payable in connection therewith, except where the failure
to make such filings on a timely basis or payments would not be material to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. All such
Company Regulatory Filings complied in all material respects with applicable
Law.    20   (d) All premium rates, rating plans, policy forms and
terms established or used by the Company\'s Subsidiaries that are required to
be filed with and/or approved by Governmental Authorities have been in all
material respects so filed and/or approved, the premiums charged conform in
all material respects to the premiums so filed and/or approved and comply in

Governmental Authority.   (e) The Company and its Subsidiaries have
implemented policies, procedures and/or programs designed to assure that its
producers, agents, brokers and employees are in material compliance with all
applicable Laws, including laws, regulations, directives and opinions of
Governmental Authorities relating to advertising, licensing, sales and
compensation disclosure practices, unfair trade practices and conflict of
interest policies. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and to the
Knowledge of the Company, each agent acting on behalf of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries has marketed, administered, sold and issued insurance and
healthcare products in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable Laws.   (f) The Company and, to the Knowledge of the Company,
each of its executive officers and directors are in compliance with, and have
complied, in all material respects with (i) the applicable provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and regulations promulgated
under such act or the Exchange Act ("Sarbanes-Oxley") and (ii) the applicable

Company has previously disclosed to Parent all of the information required to
be disclosed by the Company\'s chief executive officer and chief financial
officer to the Company Board or its audit committee pursuant to the
certification requirements relating to Annual Reports on Form 10-K and
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.   (g) The Company has established and

and procedures are effective.   (h) The Company has disclosed, based on its
most recent evaluation, to the Company\'s auditors and the audit committee of
the Board of Directors of the Company and to Parent (i) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal

the Company\'s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information for its financial statements and (ii) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Company\'s internal controls over financial reporting.   (i) To
the Knowledge of the Company, the Company\'s principal executive officer and
its principal financial officer will be able to give the certifications
required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Sections
302, 906 and 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, without qualification, when next due.

has effected any securitization transaction or other "off-balance sheet
arrangement" (as defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K of the SEC).    
21   Section 3.12 Employee Benefit Plans.   (a) Section 3.12(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a correct and complete list of: all
"employee benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")), and all other
employee benefit plans, programs, agreements, policies, arrangements or
payroll practices, including bonus plans, employment, consulting or other

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Employees") (collectively, the
"Company Plans").   (b) Correct and complete copies of the following
documents, with respect to each of the Company Plans (other than a

(v) material written communications to employees generally.   (c) The
Company Plans have been maintained in accordance with their terms and with
all provisions of ERISA, the Code and other applicable Laws, and neither the
Company (or any of its Subsidiaries) nor any "party in interest"
or "disqualified person" with respect to the Company Plans has engaged in
a non-exempt "prohibited transaction" within the meaning of Section 4975 of
the Code or Section 406 of ERISA, except as individually or in the aggregate
have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. No fiduciary has any liability for breach of fiduciary duty
or any other failure to act or comply in connection with the administration
or investment of the assets of any Company Plan, except as individually or in
the aggregate have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.   (d) The Company Plans intended to
qualify under Section 401 of the Code are so qualified and any trusts
intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501 of the
Code are so exempt, except as individually or in the aggregate have not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.   (e) None of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any trade or
business (whether or not incorporated) that is treated as a single employer,
with any of them under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code (each an
"ERISA affiliate") has any current or contingent liability with respect to
(i) a plan subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971
of the Code    22  or (ii) any "multiemployer plan" (as defined in
Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA). Each Company Plan that is intended to meet the
requirements for tax-favored treatment under Subchapter B of Chapter 1 of
Subtitle A of the Code meets such requirements, with such exceptions that
individually or in the aggregate have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (f) All contributions
(including all employer contributions and employee salary reduction
contributions) required to have been made under any of the Company Plans
(including workers compensation) or by Law (without regard to any waivers
granted under Section 412 of the Code), to any funds or trusts established
thereunder or in connection therewith have been made by the due date thereof
(including any valid extension).   (g) There are no pending actions, claims
or lawsuits that have been asserted or instituted against the Company Plans,
the assets of any of the trusts under the Company Plans or the sponsor or
administrator of any of the Company Plans, or against any fiduciary of the
Company Plans with respect to the operation of any of the Company Plans
(other than routine benefit claims), nor does the Company have any Knowledge
of facts that could form the basis for any such action, claim or lawsuit,
other than such actions, claims or lawsuits that individually or in the
aggregate have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.   (h) None of the Company Plans provides for post-
employment life or health insurance, benefits or coverage for any participant
or any beneficiary of a participant, except as may be required under the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA"),
or applicable state law, and at the expense of the participant or the
participant\'s beneficiary. Each of the Company and any ERISA affiliate which
maintains a "group health plan" within the meaning Section 5000(b)(1) of the
Code has complied with the notice and continuation requirements of Section
4980B of the Code, COBRA, Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and the
regulations thereunder, except where the failure to comply individually or in
the aggregate has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.   (i) Except as set forth in Section
3.12(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter (to the extent applicable, in each
case broken down as to each item, and the individual and amount involved),
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Company Stockholder
Approval or the Merger, will (i) result in any payment becoming due to any
Employee, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Company
Plan, (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of
any such benefits under any Company Plan or (iv) result in any obligation to
fund any trust or other arrangement with respect to compensation or benefits
under a Company Plan. Except as set forth in Section 3.12(i) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, since January 1, 2005, the Company, including the Company
Board, any committee thereof and any officer of the Company, has not taken
any action to increase the compensation or benefits payable after the date
hereof to any officer having the title of senior vice president or higher of
the Company.    23   (j) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has a contract, plan or commitment, whether legally binding or not, to create
any additional Company Plan or to modify any existing Company Plan, except as
required by applicable Law or tax qualification requirement.   (k) Any
individual who performs services for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than through a contract with an organization other than such
individual) and who is not treated as an employee of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries for federal income tax purposes by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is not an employee for such purposes, except as individually
or in the aggregate, together with any breach or breaches of Section 3.12(c)
hereof (without regard to any materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect
qualifiers therein), has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (l) Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any contract, agreement or other arrangement
providing for the payment of any amount which would not be deductible by
reason of Section 162(m) or Section 280G of the Code.   Section 3.13
Taxes.   (a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has timely filed, or
has caused to be timely filed on its behalf (taking into account any
extension of time within which to file), all material tax returns required to

all material respects. All taxes shown to be due on such tax returns, and all
material taxes otherwise required to be paid by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, have been timely paid.   (b) All taxes due and payable by the
Company and its Subsidiaries have been adequately provided for in the
financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all periods
ending through the date hereof. No material deficiency with respect to taxes
has been proposed, asserted or assessed against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that has not been paid in full or fully resolved in favor of the
taxpayer. No reductions have been made to the December 31, 2004 current tax
reserve and valuation allowance previously reported to Parent.   (c) The
federal income tax returns of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries have
been examined by and settled with (or received a "no change" letter from) the
Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") (or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
the applicable statute of limitations has expired) for all years through
December 31, 1997. All material assessments for taxes due with respect to
such completed and settled examinations or any concluded litigation have
been fully paid.   (d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
any obligation under any agreement (either with any person or any taxing
authority) with respect to material taxes.   (e) Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has constituted either a "distributing corporation"
or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of

Section 355 of the Code since the effective date of Section 355(e) of the
Code.    24   (f) Since December 31, 1997, neither the Company nor any of

group of which the Company is the common parent or (ii) any material
liability for the taxes of any Person (other than the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries).   (g) No audit or other administrative or court proceedings
are pending with any taxing authority with respect to any Federal, state or
local income or other material taxes of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, and no written notice thereof has been received by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries and, to the Knowledge of the Company, none is
threatened. No issue has been raised by any taxing authority in any presently
pending tax audit that could be material and adverse to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries for any period after the Effective Time. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has any outstanding agreements, waivers or
arrangements extending the statutory period of limitations applicable to any
claim for, or the period for the collection or assessment of, any Federal,
state or local income or other material taxes.   (h) No written claim that
could give rise to material taxes has been made within the previous five
years by a taxing authority in a jurisdiction where the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries does not file tax returns that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is or may be subject to taxation in that jurisdiction.   (i)
The Company has made available to Parent correct and complete copies of (i)
all income and franchise tax returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for
the preceding three taxable years and (ii) any audit report issued within the
last three years (or otherwise with respect to any audit or proceeding in

corporation" within the meaning of Section 897 of the Code at any time during
the five-year period ending on the Closing Date.   (m) Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action, has failed to take any
action or has any Knowledge of any fact or circumstance that would reasonably
be likely to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization under

which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of
its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other than in
such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good
standing individually or in the aggregate, has not resulted in and would not
reasonably be expected to result in, material direct or indirect cost or
liabilities to Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Parent has
made available to the Company complete and correct copies of its Articles
of Incorporation (the "Parent Articles") and By-laws (the "Parent By-laws")
and the articles of incorporation and by-laws (or comparable organizational

4.02(a), at the close of business on June 24, 2005, no shares of capital
stock or other voting securities of Parent were issued, reserved for issuance
or outstanding. All outstanding shares of capital    33  stock of Parent

part of Parent and Merger Sub and no other corporate proceedings on the part
of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by the other party hereto, constitutes
a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable
against Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms (subject to

the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and compliance with the provisions of
this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub will not, conflict with, or result in

of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods
then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to the absence of
footnote disclosure and to normal and recurring year-end audit
adjustments).   (b) Except (i) as set forth in the financial statements
included in Parent\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed prior to the date
hereof for the year ended December 31, 2004 or (ii) as incurred in the
ordinary course of business since December 31, 2004, neither Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) that individually or in the
aggregate have had or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.   Section 4.06 Information Supplied. None of the information
supplied or to be supplied by Parent or Merger Sub specifically for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in (a) the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form
S-4 is filed with the SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented and at
the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading or (b) the Proxy
Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the stockholders of the
Company and at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements

the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as applicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation or warranty is made by
Parent or Merger Sub with respect to statements made or incorporated by
reference in the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement based on
information supplied by the Company specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement or portions
thereof that relate only to the Company and its Subsidiaries.    36  
Section 4.07 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since the date of the most
recent audited financial statements included in the Parent SEC Documents
filed by Parent and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement,
except (a) for liabilities incurred in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby to the Company or (b) as disclosed in the
Parent SEC Documents filed by Parent and publicly available prior to the date
of this Agreement, there has not been any change, effect,
event, circumstance, occurrence or state of facts that individually or in the
aggregate has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.   Section 4.08 Litigation. There is no suit, action, claim,
proceeding or investigation pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that individually or in
the aggregate has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, nor is there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule
or order of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator outstanding against, or,
to the Knowledge of Parent, investigation by any Governmental Authority
involving, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that individually or in the
aggregate has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.   Section 4.09 Compliance with Laws.   (a) Parent and each
of its Subsidiaries has been since December 31, 2002 and is in compliance
with all Laws applicable to it, its properties or other assets or its
business or operations, except for instances of non-compliance that
individually or in the aggregate have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. None of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries has received, since December 31, 2002, a notice or other
communication alleging or relating to a possible material violation of
any Laws. Parent and its Subsidiaries have in effect all material Permits
necessary to carry on their businesses as now conducted, and there has
occurred no material violation of, default (with or without notice or lapse
of time or both) under, or event giving to others any right of termination or
cancellation of, with or without notice or lapse of time or both, any such
Permit. There is no event which has occurred that, to the Knowledge of
Parent, would reasonably be expected to result in the revocation,
cancellation, non-renewal or adverse modification of any such Permit which
revocation, cancellation, non-renewal or adverse modification individually or
in the aggregate would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. Assuming all Closing Consents are made or obtained, the
Merger, in and of itself, would not cause the revocation or cancellation of
any such Permit.   (b) Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each of its
executive officers and directors are in compliance with and have complied, in
all material respects, with (i) the applicable provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley
and (ii) the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and
regulations of the NYSE. Parent has previously disclosed to the Company all
of the information required to be disclosed, by Parent\'s chief executive
officer and chief financial officer, to the Parent Board or its audit
committee thereof pursuant to the certification requirements relating to
Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.    37  
(c) Parent has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
(as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act) and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective.   (d) Parent
has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation, to Parent\'s auditors and
the audit committee of the Board of Directors of Parent and to the Company
(i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal controls over financial reporting that existed as of
December 31, 2004 or later which are reasonably likely to adversely affect in
any material respect Parent\'s ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information for its financial statements and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in Parent\'s internal controls over
financial reporting.   (e) To the Knowledge of Parent, Parent\'s principal
executive officer and its principal financial officer will be able to give
the certifications required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted
pursuant to Sections 302, 906 and 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, without
qualification, when next due.   Section 4.10 No Business Activities. Merger

Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action, has failed to take
any action or has Knowledge of any fact or circumstance that would reasonably
be likely to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization under

materiality, Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse
Effect, as the case may be, becoming untrue or inaccurate in any respect or

or inaccurate in any material respect or (ii) the failure of it (and, in the
case of Parent, of Merger Sub) to comply with or satisfy in any respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement; provided, however that no such notification shall affect
the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or
remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the
parties under this Agreement. The Company and Parent shall promptly provide
the other copies    43  of all filings made by such party with any
Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Failure by the Company to comply with Section 5.01(c)(i)
shall not result in a failure by the Company to satisfy the conditions set
forth in Section 7.02(b), unless the event or matter giving rise to the
obligation to advise Parent pursuant to 5.01(c)(i) hereto involves a breach
of a representation or warranty hereunder which results in a failure to

incurable or has not been cured in all material respects as contemplated by
Section 8.01(c). Failure by Parent to comply with Section 5.01(c)(i) shall
not result in a failure by Parent to satisfy the conditions set forth in
Sections 7.03(b), unless the event or matter giving rise to the obligation to
advise the Company pursuant to 5.01(c)(i) involves a breach of
a representation or warranty hereunder which results in a failure to satisfy
the condition set forth in Section 7.03(a) and which breach is incurable or
has not been cured in all material respects as contemplated by Section
8.01(d).   Section 5.02 No Solicitation by the Company.   (a) The Company
shall not nor shall it authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries, any of
its or their respective directors, officers or employees or any investment
banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other advisor, agent or
representative retained by the Company or any Subsidiary in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(collectively, "Representatives") to, directly or indirectly through another
person, (i) solicit, initiate, cause, knowingly encourage, or knowingly
facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes or
is reasonably likely to lead to a Company Takeover Proposal or (ii) other
than solely informing persons of the provisions contained in this Section
5.02, participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Company
Takeover Proposal, or furnish to any person any information in connection
with, or in furtherance, of any Company Takeover Proposal. Without limiting
the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth
in the preceding sentence by any Representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be a breach of this Section 5.02(a) by the Company. The
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and instruct its
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing
discussions or negotiations with any person previously conducted with respect
to any Company Takeover Proposal and request the prompt return or destruction
of all confidential information previously furnished. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval
(and in no event after obtaining such Company Stockholder Approval), in
response to an unsolicited bona fide written Company Takeover Proposal made
after the date hereof that the Company Board determines in good faith (after
receiving the advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation (the Parent acknowledges and agrees that each of the financial
advisors engaged by the Company in connection with entering into
this Agreement satisfy this requirement) and outside counsel) constitutes or
is reasonably likely to constitute a Company Superior Proposal, the Company
may if the Company Board determines in good faith (after receiving the advice
of its outside counsel) that there is a reasonable probability that failure
to take such action would result in the Company Board breaching its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, and subject
to compliance with Section 5.02(c) and after giving Parent prompt written
notice of such determination, (A) furnish information with respect to the
Company and its    44  Subsidiaries to the person making such Company
Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement not less restrictive of such person than the Confidentiality
Agreement (other than the ninth paragraph thereto), provided that all such
information (to the extent that such information has not been previously
provided or made available to Parent) is provided or made available to
Parent, as the case may be, prior to or substantially concurrent with the
time it is provided or made available to such person, as the case may be, and
(B) participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such
Company Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such Company
Takeover Proposal.   For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Takeover
Proposal" shall mean any inquiry, proposal or offer, whether or not
conditional, and whether or not withdrawn, (a) for a merger, consolidation,
dissolution, recapitalization or other business combination involving the
Company, (b) for the issuance of 20% or more of the equity securities of the
Company as consideration for the assets or securities of another person or
(c) to acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the
equity securities of the Company or assets (including equity securities of
any Subsidiary of the Company) that represent 20% or more of the total
consolidated assets of the Company, other than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.   For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Superior
Proposal" shall mean any bona fide written offer made by a third party, that
if consummated would result in such person (or its stockholders) owning,
directly or indirectly, greater than 50% of the shares of Company Common
Stock then outstanding (or of the surviving entity in a merger or the direct
or indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or all or
substantially all of the total consolidated assets of the Company (i) on
terms which the Company Board determines in good faith (after receiving the
advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and of its
outside counsel and in light of all relevant circumstances, including all the
terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement) to be more
favorable to the stockholders of the Company than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) which is reasonably likely to be
completed, taking into account any approval requirements and all other
financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal.   (b)
Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw
(or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), or propose to withdraw (or modify
in a manner adverse to Parent), the approval, recommendation or declaration
of advisability by such Company Board or any such committee thereof of this
Agreement or the Merger (it being understood that taking a neutral position
or no position for more than ten business days after receipt of a Company
Takeover Proposal (or if such Company Takeover Proposal is initially received
within ten business days of the Company Stockholder Meeting no later than
five business days after receipt of such Company Takeover Proposal)
with respect to such a Company Takeover Proposal shall be considered an
adverse modification) or (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly
to recommend, adopt or approve, any Company Takeover Proposal (any action
described in this clause (i) being referred to as a "Company Adverse
Recommendation Change") or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve
or recommend, or allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or
enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement
constituting or related to, any Company Takeover Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement pursuant to Section 5.02(a)).    45  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Board may make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change (x) following receipt of any Company Takeover Proposal
made after the date hereof with respect to which the Company Board determines
in good faith (after receiving the advice of a financial advisor
of nationally recognized reputation and of its outside counsel) constitutes
a Company Superior Proposal or (y) if a Parent Material Adverse Effect
has occurred, and, in the case of either (x) or (y), the Company Board
determines in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel)
that there is a reasonable probability that failure to take such action would
result in the Company Board breaching its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law; provided, however, that no
Company Adverse Recommendation Change may be made in response to a Company
Takeover Proposal until after the fourth business day following Parent\'s
receipt of written notice from the Company (an "Adverse Recommendation
Notice") advising Parent that the Company Board has determined that such
Company Takeover Proposal is a Company Superior Proposal, that the Company
Board intends to make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change and
containing all information required by Section 5.02(c), together with copies
of any written offer or proposal in respect of such Company Superior Proposal
(it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or
other material terms of such Company Superior Proposal shall require a new
Adverse Recommendation Notice and a new four (4) business day period). It is
understood and agreed that when a Company Adverse Recommendation Change has
been made not in response to or as a result of a Company Superior Proposal,
then no Adverse Recommendation Notice is required but the Company shall,
nonetheless, give Parent notice of such Company Adverse Recommendation Change
promptly after such change but prior to public disclosure of such change. In
determining whether to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to a Company Superior Proposal, the Company Board shall take into
account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent
(in response to an Adverse Recommendation Notice or otherwise) in
determining whether such third party Company Takeover Proposal still
constitutes a Company Superior Proposal.   (c) In addition to the
obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this
Section 5.02, the Company shall promptly advise Parent orally and in writing,
and in no event later than forty eight hours after receipt of any request for
information or other inquiry that the Company reasonably believes could lead
to any Company Takeover Proposal, the terms and conditions of any such
request, Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry (including any changes thereto)
and the identity of the person making any such request, Company Takeover
Proposal or inquiry. The Company shall promptly keep Parent informed of the
status and details (including changes to the terms thereof) of any such
request, Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry.   (d) Nothing contained in
this Section 5.02 shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing
to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) or
Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii)
making any required disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if, in the
good faith judgment of the Company Board (after receiving the advice of its
outside counsel), failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with its
obligations under applicable Law.     46   ARTICLE VI   Additional
Agreements   Section 6.01 Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Proxy
Statement; Company Stockholders Meeting.   (a) As soon as practicable
following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file with
the SEC the Proxy Statement and Parent shall prepare and Parent shall file
with the SEC the Form S-4, in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a
prospectus. Each of the Company and Parent will respond promptly to any
comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC on the Proxy Statement or the
Form S-4. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after such filing and maintain the Form S-4\'s
effectiveness for so long as necessary to consummate the Merger. The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to
be mailed to the stockholders of the Company as promptly as practicable after
the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act (but in no event
later than three (3) business days after the date the Form S-4 is declared
effective). Parent shall also take any action required to be taken under any
applicable state securities Laws in connection with the issuance of shares of
Parent Common Stock in the Merger, and the Company shall furnish all
information concerning the Company and the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock as may be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with any
such action. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 will
be made by Parent, and no filing of, or amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement will be made by the Company, without providing the other party and
its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. If at any
time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the Company or
Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should
be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to either the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement, so
that either such document would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. The
parties shall notify each other promptly of the receipt of any comments from
the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of
the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or the Form S-4
or for additional information and shall supply each other with copies of (i)
all correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand,
and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the
Proxy Statement, the Form S-4 or the Merger and (ii) all orders of the
SEC relating to the Form S-4.   (b) The Company shall, as soon as
practicable following the date of this Agreement, establish a record date for
and promptly take any and all actions in connection therewith, and as soon as
practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective, duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold, a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company
Stockholders Meeting") solely for the purpose of obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval. Subject to Section 5.02(b), the Company shall, through
the Company Board, recommend to its stockholders adoption    47  of this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company\'s obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 6.01(b)
shall not be affected by (i) the commencement, public proposal, public
disclosure or communication to the Company of any Company Takeover Proposal
or (ii) any Company Adverse Recommendation Change.   Section 6.02 Access to
Information; Confidentiality.   (a) Each party shall afford to the other
parties hereto, and the other parties\' Representatives, reasonable access
during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time or
the termination of this Agreement to all its and its Subsidiaries\'
properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records and, during
such period, each party shall furnish promptly to the others (a) a copy of
each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by
such party during such period pursuant to the requirements of Federal or
state securities Laws and (b) consistent with its legal obligations all other
information concerning such party and its Subsidiaries\' business, properties
and personnel as the other party may reasonably request; provided, however,
that either party may restrict the foregoing access to the extent that any
law, treaty, rule or regulation of any Governmental Authority applicable to
such party requires such party or its Subsidiaries to restrict access to any
properties or information. Except for disclosures expressly permitted by the
terms of the confidentiality agreement, dated as of May 24, 2005, between
Parent and the Company (as it may be amended from time to time, the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), each party shall hold, and shall cause its
Representatives to hold, all information received from the other party,
directly or indirectly, in confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement. No investigation pursuant to this Section 6.02(a) or information
provided, made available or received by any party hereto pursuant to this
Agreement will affect any of the representations or warranties of the parties
hereto contained in this Agreement or the conditions hereunder to
the obligations of the parties hereto.   (b) In addition to and without
limiting the foregoing, from the date hereof until the Effective Time, the
Company shall furnish to Parent, within fifteen (15) business days after the
end of each month, the monthly reporting package set forth in Section 6.02(b)
of the Company Disclosure Letter.   Section 6.03 Reasonable Best
Efforts.   (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done,
and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (for purposes of this Section 6.03,
transactions "contemplated by this Agreement" or transactions "contemplated
hereby" shall include, without limitation, the Other Agreements contemplated
by this Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby), including using
reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following: (a) the taking of all
acts necessary to cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly
as practicable, (b) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions,
waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Authorities and the making
of all necessary registrations and filings (including filings with
Governmental Authorities) and    48  the taking of all steps as may be
necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by any Governmental Authority, (c) the obtaining of all necessary
consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (d) the avoidance of
impediments under any insurance, health, antitrust, merger control,
competition, trade regulation or other Law that may be asserted by
any Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement and the Merger and
other transactions contemplated hereby necessary to enable the conditions to
Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable and (e) the execution and
delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of the
Merger and the other transactions to be performed or consummated by such
party in accordance with this Agreement. In connection with and without
limiting the first sentence of this Section 6.03, each of the Company and the
Company Board and Parent and the Parent Board shall (i) take all action
reasonably necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar
statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger
or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if
any state takeover statute or similar statute becomes applicable to this
Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, take all action reasonably necessary to ensure that the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the
contrary in this Agreement, nothing shall be deemed to require Parent to (A)
agree to, or proffer to, divest or hold separate any assets or any portion of
any business of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or, assuming the
consummation of the Merger, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) not
compete in any geographic area or line of business, (C) restrict the manner
in which, or whether, Parent, the Company, the Surviving Entity or any of
their respective Affiliates may carry on business in any part of the world or
restrict the exercise of the full rights of ownership; (D) agree to any terms
or conditions that would impose any obligations on Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or, assuming the consummation of the Merger, the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, to maintain facilities, operations, places of business,
employment levels, products or businesses, or any other restriction,
limitation, obligation or qualification or (E) make any payments, which, in
the case of any of clauses (A) through (E), (i) would have, or would be
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material
adverse effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or on
Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (it being agreed that in
the case of measuring the effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries in this
clause (i), (x) "Subsidiaries" shall not include the Company or its
Subsidiaries, (y) "material adverse effect" shall be the level of, and shall
be measured as to, what would have, or would be reasonably likely to have, a
"material adverse effect" on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, and not the level or measure of what would have, or would be
reasonably likely to have, a "material adverse effect" on Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and (z) the effect shall be with respect to
Parent and its Subsidiaries) or (ii) would, or would be reasonably likely to,
materially impair the benefits reasonably expected to be derived by Parent
from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger,
provided, however, that for purposes of determining whether a material
adverse effect under clause (i) above or a material impairment under clause
(ii) above has occurred, the parties agree to exclude from any such
determination the aggregate amount of the effects (1) of the actions of the
type described in clauses (A), if any, (B), if any, (C), (D)    49  and
(E) above, that were imposed, required, agreed to or consented to by
state Governmental Authorities in any of the Precedent Health Care
Transactions, such exclusion to be limited to the extent such effects are
comparable to or lesser than those that were imposed, required, agreed to or
consented to by state Governmental Authorities in such Precedent Health Care
Transactions (giving consideration to all relevant factors, including the
comparability of such Precedent Health Care Transactions to the Merger and
the amount, degree, scope and duration of such effects of any such actions in
the aggregate); or (2) resulting from or arising out of changes in the
business plans or operations of (x) Parent or its Subsidiaries that have a
material affect on Parent\'s or its Subsidiaries\' ability to satisfy or
comply with statutory requirements of the filings under applicable Law
relating to the consents, approvals, authorizations, orders, permits, waivers
or waiting period expirations or terminations required in connection with the
Merger and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (y) the
Company or its Subsidiaries, which in any case under clause (x) or (y), are
proposed by Parent or its Subsidiaries to be effective on and after the
Effective Time, but not changes in the business plans or operations requested
or demanded by Governmental Authorities whose consent, approval,
authorization, order, permit, waiver or waiting period expiration or
termination is required in connection with the Merger and other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (clauses (i) and (ii), as qualified by the
foregoing proviso, being a "Negative Regulatory Action "). In the event any
action of a type described in clauses (A), if any, (B), if any, (C), (D)
or (E) above was imposed, required, agreed to, or consented to by
state Governmental Authorities in more than one of the Precedent Health
Care Transactions, it is agreed and understood that the action of such type
having the greatest adverse effect in any of the Precedent Health Care
Transactions shall be used for purposes of determining both (I) comparability
of the Precedent Health Care Transactions to the Merger and the amount,
degree, scope and duration of effects, and (II) the effects which are
excluded from the determination of whether a material adverse effect under
clause (i) above or a material impairment under clause (ii) above has
occurred. It is understood and agreed that Parent or its Subsidiaries
(including the Company and its Subsidiaries) shall be required to take the
actions described in clauses (A), (B), (C), (D) and (E) of the second
preceding sentence to the extent such actions would not constitute a Negative
Regulatory Action.   (b) Each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable
best efforts to (1) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection
with any filing or submission with a Governmental Authority in connection
with the Merger and in connection with any investigation, approval process or
other inquiry by or before a Governmental Authority relating to the Merger,
including any proceeding initiated by a private party, and (2) keep the other
party informed in all material respects and on a reasonably timely basis of
any written or material oral communication received by such party from, or
given by such party to any Governmental Authority, or party to a proceeding,
regarding the Merger. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, each of the parties hereto shall have the right to review in
advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult the other on, all
the information relating to the other parties and their respective
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Merger. The parties agree and acknowledge
that the "Future Plans for Domestic Insurer" section (or equivalent section)
of any Form A (or equivalent filing or application) and any
amendments thereto and supplemental information filed in relation thereto to
be filed with any Governmental Authority by Parent or its Subsidiaries in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby shall be reviewed and
approved by the Company prior to any such filing, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.    50   (c) Each party to this
Agreement shall give the other party to this Agreement reasonable prior
notice of any written or material oral communication with, and any proposed
understanding, undertaking or agreement with, any Governmental Authority
relating to the Merger. Neither of the parties to this Agreement shall
independently participate in any meeting, or engage in any substantive
conversation, with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filings or
submissions with or investigation, approval process or other inquiry by any
Governmental Authority without giving the other prior notice of the meeting
or conversation and, unless objected to by such Governmental Authority, the
opportunity to attend or participate. The Company will not make any
material proposals relating to, or enter into, any material understanding,
undertaking or agreement with any Governmental Authority relating to the
Merger without the Parent\'s prior review and approval, and the Parent will
not make any such material proposal or enter into any such material
understanding, undertaking or agreement relating to the Merger without the
Company\'s prior review and approval, provided, however, that if such
understanding, undertaking or agreement is to take effect only upon the
consummation of the Merger, Parent shall have no obligation to obtain the
Company\'s prior approval but shall consult in advance with the Company with
respect thereto.   (d) Subject to Section 6.03(a), each of Parent and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if
any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. In connection therewith
and subject to Section 6.03(a), if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding is instituted or threatened to be instituted by (i) any
Governmental Authority (other than a state or federal Governmental Authority,
which is covered by clause (ii) below) whose action or proceeding is
reasonably likely to have or result in a Negative Regulatory Action or
materially delay the completion of the Merger, or (ii) any state or federal
Governmental Authority, which in any case under clause (i) or (ii) challenges
any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as inconsistent with or
violative of any Law, each of Parent and the Company shall (by negotiation,
litigation or otherwise) cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts to
contest, resist or avoid any such action or proceeding, including
any administrative or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed
or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents, materially delays or materially restricts consummation of the
Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including by
pursuing reasonable avenues of administrative and judicial appeal. It is
understood and agreed that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth herein, in the event such an administrative or judicial action or
proceeding is instituted, then the parties shall be obligated to contest and
resist such action or proceeding by reasonable litigation and proceedings,
including reasonable administrative and judicial action, vacating, lifting,
reversing and overturning any decree, judgment, injunction or other order,
and pursuing reasonable avenues of administrative and judicial appeal, and
such actions shall be deemed to be "reasonable best efforts" for all purposes
hereunder.   (e) Parent agrees that prior to Parent or any of its
subsidiaries entering into any agreement ("Reportable Agreement ") to acquire
by merger or consolidation with, or by purchase of a substantial portion of
the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner, any health insurance or
managed healthcare business or any corporation, partnership, association or
other business organization or division thereof engaged in the health
insurance or managed healthcare business which business is located in
California or Texas or has significant operations in California or Texas (a
"Reportable Acquisition ") where a Relevant Filing (as defined below) is
required to be made in California    51  or Texas in connection with such
Reportable Acquisition, Parent shall consult in good faith with the Company
prior to Parent or its subsidiaries entering into such Reportable Agreement
regarding whether or not such Reportable Acquisition would, or would
reasonably be expected to, impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or
materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any Required Consent (as
defined below). If Parent determines in its reasonable discretion (after
consulting with the Company) that such Reportable Acquisition would not, and
would not reasonably be expected to, impose any material delay in
the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any
Relevant Consent, then Parent may enter into the Reportable Agreement with
respect to such Reportable Acquisition. If Parent enters into such Reportable
Agreement, then Parent agrees to (i) promptly after entering into such
Reportable Agreement file with the appropriate Governmental Authority such
Relevant Filing and promptly thereafter inquire of such Governmental
Authority as to whether or not such Reportable Acquisition would, or would
reasonably be expected to, impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or
materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any Relevant Consent and (ii)
promptly withdraw from any such Reportable Acquisition, terminate such
Reportable Agreement and not pursue such Reportable Acquisition if any such
Governmental Authority indicates (whether by action or inaction) that such
Reportable Acquisition would, or would reasonably be expected to, impose any
material delay in the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not
obtaining, any Relevant Consent. A "Relevant Filing" shall mean a Form A (or
equivalent), Form E (or equivalent), a Form 1011(c) (or equivalent), a merger
or a "material modification" filing. A "Relevant Consent" shall mean any
authorization, consent, order, declaration or approval of any Governmental
Authority in California or Texas necessary to consummate the Merger or other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. It is agreed and understood by
the parties that this Section 6.03(e) is in addition to and does not in any
manner limit Parent\'s covenants or obligations set forth elsewhere in this
Agreement or the Other Agreements.   Section 6.04 Indemnification,
Exculpation and Insurance.   (a) All rights to indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors,
officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified
Parties") as provided in the Company Certificate, the Company By-laws,
existing indemnification agreements or as provided under applicable Law (in
each case, as in effect on the date hereof) shall be assumed by the Surviving
Entity in the Merger, without further action, as of the Effective Time and
shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless, and
provide advancement of expenses to the Indemnified Parties to the same extent
such persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as
of the date hereof by the Company pursuant to the Company Certificate, the
Company By-laws, existing indemnification agreements or as provided under
applicable Law. The Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement or
certificate of incorporation, as appropriate, of the Surviving Entity
shall contain, and Parent shall cause the Limited Liability Company
Operating Agreement or certificate of incorporation, as appropriate, of the
Surviving Entity to contain, provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification and exculpation of present and former directors and officers
of the Company than are presently set forth in the Company Charter and
Company By-laws.    52   (b) For a period of six years after the
Effective Time, Parent shall maintain in effect the Company\'s current
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance in respect of acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including for acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) covering the
Indemnified Parties currently covered by the Company\'s directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance policy (a correct and complete copy of
which has been previously made available to Parent), on terms with respect to
such coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such policy in
effect on the date hereof; provided, however, that Parent may substitute
therefor policies of Parent with containing terms with respect to coverage
and amount no less favorable to such Indemnified Parties; provided, further,
however, that in satisfying its obligation under this Section 6.04(b) Parent
shall not be obligated to pay aggregate premiums in excess of 300% of the
amount paid by the Company in its last full fiscal year, it being understood
and agreed that Parent shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such
coverage as may be obtained for such 300% amount.   (c) The covenants
contained in this Section 6.04 are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective
heirs and legal representatives, and shall not be deemed exclusive of any
other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to
Law, contract or otherwise.   Section 6.05 Fees and Expenses. All fees and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated,
except that each of the Company and Parent shall bear and pay one-half of (a)
the costs and expenses incurred in connection with filing, printing and
mailing the Form S-4 and (b) the filing fees for the premerger notification
and report forms under the HSR Act.   Section 6.06 Public Announcements.
Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing, and give
each other the reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any press
release or other public statements with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and shall not issue any
such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or
by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or national securities quotation system. The parties agree that the
initial press release to be issued with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form previously agreed to by
the parties.   Section 6.07 Affiliates. Prior to the Effective Time the
Company shall deliver to Parent a letter identifying all persons who will be
at the time this Agreement is submitted for adoption by the stockholders of
the Company, "affiliates" of the Company for purposes of Rule 145 under the
Securities Act and applicable SEC rules and regulations. The Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause each such person to deliver to
Parent at least ten days prior to the Closing Date a written agreement
substantially in the form attached as Exhibit B.   Section 6.08 Stock
Exchange Listing. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for
listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the
Closing Date.    53   Section 6.09 Tax-Free Reorganization Treatment. The
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall execute and deliver to each of Skadden
Arps, special counsel to the Company, and Weil Gotshal, special counsel to
Parent and Merger Sub, representation letters, substantially in the forms
attached hereto as Exhibits C and E (in the case of the Merger) or Exhibits D
and F (in the case of the Reverse Merger), at such time or times as
reasonably requested by each such law firm in connection with its delivery of
the opinion referred to in Section 7.02(e) or Section 7.03(c), as the case
may be or any similar opinion that may be required in connection with the
Proxy Statement or Form S-4. Prior to the Effective Time, none of the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub shall take or cause to be taken any action
which would cause to be untrue any of the representations in such
representation letters. Each party shall, and shall cause each of
its respective subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to cause the
Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code.   Section 6.10 Stockholder Litigation. The Company shall
promptly advise Parent orally and in writing of any stockholder litigation
against the Company and/or its directors relating to this Agreement, the
Merger and/or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall keep
Parent fully informed regarding any such stockholder litigation. The Company
shall give Parent the opportunity to consult with the Company regarding the
defense or settlement of any such stockholder litigation, shall give due
consideration to Parent\'s advice with respect to such stockholder litigation
and shall not settle any such litigation prior to such consultation and
consideration, provided, however, that the Company further will not, without
Parent\'s prior written consent, settle any such stockholder litigation (a)
for an amount greater than five million dollars ($5,000,000) in excess of the
Company\'s coverage under applicable third party insurance policies,
individually, or ten million dollars ($10,000,000) in excess of the
Company\'s coverage under applicable third party insurance polices in
the aggregate or (b) that involves or has the effect of imposing any material
remedy or restriction upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than
monetary damages.   Section 6.11 Employee Matters.   (a) Parent agrees to
honor, or cause the Surviving Entity to honor, from and after the Effective
Time any bonus payments for the Company\'s 2005 fiscal year (or any portion
thereof) and, if the Closing occurs in 2006, the Company\'s 2006 fiscal year
(or any portion thereof) under the bonus plans set forth in Section 6.11(a)
of the Company Disclosure Letter in accordance with their terms as in effect
immediately before the Effective Time and as set forth in Section 6.11(a) of
the Company Disclosure Letter.   (b) Following the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause to be provided to individuals who are employed by the Company and
its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and who remain
employed with the Surviving Entity or any of Parent\'s Subsidiaries (the
"Affected Employees"), compensation and employee benefits no less favorable
in the aggregate than, at Parent\'s election from time to time, those
provided (i) pursuant to the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' compensation
and employee benefit policies, plans and programs immediately prior to the
Effective Time or (ii) to similarly situated employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, (x) during the
12 month period following the Effective Time, Affected Employees shall be
provided with the severance benefits provided under the Company\'s Severance

the service with the Company and its Subsidiaries (including service
recognized by the Company and its Subsidiaries) prior to the Effective Time

provided, however, that such recognition shall not result in a duplication of

payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any
analogous deductible or out-of-pocket requirements to the extent applicable
under any such plan.   (e) Effective as of the Effective Time, the Company

401(k) plan. Parent shall provide, or cause the Surviving Entity to provide,
that the Affected Employees are eligible to participate in a defined

affiliates shall honor the senior executive employment agreement between the
Company and the Affected Employee in accordance with its terms as in effect
on the date hereof on the basis of the Company having terminated the Affected
Employee without cause as such term is defined in such agreement, or (ii) the
Affected Employee shall be offered a new employment agreement with Parent or
an affiliate of Parent which contains terms and conditions that are
substantially similar to those contained in the employment agreements
provided to the category of Affected Employees identified in Section
6.11(g)(2) of the Company Disclosure Letter.    55   Section 6.12

Confidentiality Agreement pursuant to its terms or by written agreement of
the parties thereto. During such period, the Company shall enforce, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the provisions of any
such agreement, including by seeking to obtain injunctions to prevent any

the Company, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and
customary in scope and substance for comfort letters delivered by independent

expected to result in material damages or material harm to the business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (it being agreed that in the case of measuring
the results on Parent and its Subsidiaries in this clause (i),
(x) "Subsidiaries" shall not include the Company or its Subsidiaries, (y)
"material damages" or "material harm" shall be the level of, and shall be
measured as to, what could result in, or could reasonably be expected to
result in, "material damages" or "material harm" to the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and not the level or measure
of what could result in, or could reasonably be expected to result in,
"material damages" or "material harm" on Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole and (z) the result shall be with respect to Parent and its
Subsidiaries), (ii) seeking to (A) prohibit or limit in any respect the

its Subsidiaries or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to maintain
facilities, operations, places of business, employment levels, products or
businesses or other obligation relating to the operation of their respective
businesses or (iii) seeking to obtain from the Company, Parent or Merger Sub
any damages, payments, covenants or legally binding assurances, which suit,
action or proceeding in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above would have,
or would be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Negative Regulatory Action.   (d) Restraint. No Restraint that would
reasonably be expected to result, directly or indirectly, in any of the
effects referred to in Section 7.02(c) shall be in effect.   (e) Tax
Opinion. Parent shall have received from Weil Gotshal, special counsel to
Parent, on the Closing Date, an opinion in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent and dated as of the Closing Date, to the effect that
the Merger will qualify for United States Federal income tax purposes as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The
issuance of such opinion shall be conditioned upon the receipt by
Weil Gotshal of customary representation letters from each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company, in each case, substantially in the form of Exhibits C
and E (or D    58  and F). Each such representation letter shall be dated
on or before the date of such opinion and shall not have been withdrawn or

Consents. The consents, authorizations, orders, permits and approvals listed

likely to constitute, individually or in the aggregate, a Negative Regulatory
Action.   Section 7.03 Conditions to Obligation of the Company. The
obligation of the Company to effect the Merger is further subject to the
satisfaction or waiver on or prior to the Closing Date of the following
conditions:   (a) Representations and Warranties. The representations
and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement (other
than the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in
Section 4.07) shall be true and correct as of the date of this Agreement and
as of the Closing Date as though made on the Closing Date (without regard to
materiality or Parent Material Adverse Effect qualifiers contained therein),
except to the extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to
an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date, except where the
failure of the representations and warranties to be true and correct
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The representations and
warranties of Parent and Merger Sub in Section 4.07 shall be true in all
respects. The Company shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of
Parent by an executive officer of Parent to such effect.   (b) Performance
of Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub. Parent and Merger Sub shall have
performed in all material respects all obligations required to be performed
by them under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date, and the Company
shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of Parent by an executive
officer of Parent to such effect.   (c) Tax Opinion. The Company shall have
received from Skadden Arps, special counsel to the Company, on the Closing
Date, an opinion in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company
and dated as of the Closing Date, to the effect that the Merger will qualify
for United States Federal income tax purposes as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The issuance of such opinion shall
be conditioned upon the receipt by Skadden Arps of customary representation
letters from each of Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company, in each case,
substantially in the form of Exhibits C and E (or D and F). Each such
representation letter shall be dated on or before the date of such opinion
and shall not have been withdrawn or modified in any material respect. The
opinion condition referred to in this Section 7.03(c) shall not be waivable
after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, unless further stockholder
approval of the Company\'s stockholders is obtained with appropriate
disclosure.    59   Section 7.04 Frustration of Closing Conditions. None
of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub may rely on the failure of any condition
set forth in Sections 7.01, 7.02 or 7.03, as the case may be, to be satisfied
if such failure was caused by such party\'s failure to use its reasonable
best efforts to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, as required by and subject to Section 6.03.   ARTICLE
VIII   Termination, Amendment and Waiver   Section 8.01 Termination. This
Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether
before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval:   (a) by
mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;   (b) by either Parent or
the Company:   (i) if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or

7.01(f), 7.02(c) or 7.02(f) shall not have been satisfied but all  other
conditions to Closing shall have been satisfied (or in the case  of
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing,  shall be
capable of being satisfied on May 5, 2006), then the  Termination Date shall
be extended to and including August 7, 2006 if  either of the Company or
Parent notifies the other party in writing on  or prior to May 5, 2006 of its
election to extend the Termination Date  to August 7, 2006; provided,
further, that the right to terminate this  Agreement under this Section
8.01(b)(i) shall not be available to any  party whose action or failure to
act has been a principal cause of or  resulted in the failure of the Merger
to be consummated on or before  such date;   (ii) if any Restraint having
the effect of permanently  restraining, enjoining, or otherwise prohibiting
the Merger and the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in
effect and  shall have become final and nonappealable;   (iii) if the
Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been  obtained upon a vote at the
Company Stockholders Meeting duly convened  therefor or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof;   (c) by Parent, if the Company shall have breached or
failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform
(A) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section
7.02(a) or (b) and (B) is incapable of being cured, or is not cured, by the
Company within 30 calendar days following receipt of written notice from
Parent of such breach or failure to perform;    60   (d) by the Company,
if Parent shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the

is incapable of being cured, or is not cured, by Parent within 30 calendar
days following receipt of written notice from the Company of such breach or
failure to perform; or   (e) by Parent, within 45 days of the date on
which, (i) a Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred or
(ii) the Company Board or any committee thereof shall have failed to publicly
confirm its recommendation and declaration of advisability of this Agreement
and the Merger within ten (10) business days after a written request by

three (3) business days after receipt of such request).   Section 8.02
Termination Fee.   (a) In the event that:   (i) this Agreement is
terminated by either Parent or the Company  pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i),
and (A) a vote to obtain the Company  Stockholder Approval has not been held,
(B) after the date of this  Agreement a Company Takeover Proposal shall have
been made or  communicated to the Company or shall have been made directly to
the  stockholders of the Company generally (and at least one such Company 
Takeover Proposal shall not have been withdrawn prior to the event  giving
rise to the right of termination under Section 8.01(b)(i)) and  (C) within
twelve (12) months after such termination the Company shall  have reached a
definitive agreement to consummate, or shall have  consummated, either (x) a
Company Takeover Proposal with a Person who  after the date of this Agreement
has made a Company Takeover Proposal  prior to the event giving rise to the
right of termination under  Section 8.01(b)(i) or (y) a Material Company
Takeover Proposal with a  Person who since the date of this Agreement has not
made a Company  Takeover Proposal prior to such event;   (ii) this
Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company  pursuant to Section
8.01(b)(iii) and (A) after the date of this  Agreement a Company Takeover
Proposal shall have been made or  communicated to the Company or shall have
been made directly to the  stockholders of the Company generally (and at
least one such Company  Takeover Proposal shall not have been withdrawn prior
to the event  giving rise to the right of termination under Section
8.01(b)(iii))  and (B) within twelve (12) months after such termination the
Company  shall have reached a definitive agreement to consummate, or shall
have  consummated, either (x) a Company Takeover Proposal with a Person who 
after the date of this Agreement has made a Company Takeover Proposal  prior
to the event giving rise to the right of termination under  Section
8.01(b)(iii) or (y) a Material Company Takeover Proposal with  a Person who
since the date of this Agreement has not made a Company  Takeover Proposal
prior to such event;    61   (iii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent
pursuant to Section  8.01(c) and (A) the Company\'s breach or failure
triggering such  termination shall have been willful, (B) after the date of
this  Agreement a Company Takeover Proposal shall have been made or 
communicated to the Company or shall have been made directly to the 
stockholders of the Company generally and (C) within twelve (12)  months
after such termination the Company shall have reached a  definitive agreement
to consummate, or shall have consummated, either  (x) a Company Takeover
Proposal with a Person who after the date of  this Agreement has made a
Company Takeover Proposal prior to the event  giving rise to the right of
termination under Section 8.01(c) or (y) a  Material Company Takeover
Proposal with a Person who since the date of  this Agreement has not made a
Company Takeover Proposal prior to such  event;   (iv) this Agreement is
terminated by Parent pursuant to Section  8.01(e) (other than if the Change
in Recommendation which resulted in  the right of termination under Section
8.01(e) occurred following a  Parent Material Adverse Effect),  then the
Company shall (1) in the case of a Termination Fee payable pursuant
to clauses (i), (ii), or (iii) of this Section 8.02(a), upon the earlier of
the date of such definitive agreement and such consummation of a Material
Company Takeover Proposal or (2) in the case of a Termination Fee payable
pursuant to clause (iv) of this Section 8.02(a), on the date of such
termination, pay Parent a fee equal to two hundred forty-three million six
hundred thousand dollars (the "Termination Fee") by wire transfer of same-day
funds. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, in the event that the Company
proposes to terminate this Agreement at a time when the Termination Fee is
payable, the Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee as described above
prior to such termination by the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing in
Section 8.02(a)(i) or Section 8.02(a)(ii), if a Termination Fee would have
been payable under Section 8.02(a)(i) or Section 8.02(a)(ii) but for the fact
that the person (or any of its Affiliates) with whom the Company shall have
reached a definitive agreement to consummate, or shall have consummated, a
Material Company Takeover Proposal within twelve (12) months after
termination of this Agreement withdrew a Company Takeover Proposal prior to
the event giving rise to the right of termination of this Agreement under
Section 8.01(b)(i) or Section 8.01(b)(ii), then the Company shall upon the
earlier of such definitive agreement and such consummation of a Material
Company Takeover Proposal pay Parent the Termination Fee by wire transfer of
same-day funds. In the case of a Termination Fee payable pursuant to clause
(iii) of this Section 8.02(a), the parties hereby agree that the Termination
Fee (including the right to receive such fee or the payment of such fee)
shall not limit in any respect any rights or remedies available to Parent and
Merger Sub relating to any willful breach or failure to perform
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this
Agreement resulting, directly or indirectly, in the right to receive the
Termination Fee.   (b) The Company acknowledges and agrees that the
agreements contained in Section 8.02(a) are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement. If the Company fails
promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to Section 8.02(a), and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment
against the Company for the Termination Fee, the Company shall pay to Parent
its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and
expenses) incurred in connection with such suit, together with interest on
the amount of the Termination Fee from the date such payment was required to
be made until the date of payment at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made.    62   (c) For
purposes of this Agreement, "Material Company Takeover Proposal" shall mean
any inquiry, proposal or offer, whether or not conditional, (a) for a merger,
consolidation, dissolution, recapitalization or other business combination in
which the stockholders of the Company immediately prior to such transaction
will fail to own immediately after such transaction 60% or more of the
Company\'s (if the Company is the publicly traded parent company
following such transaction) equity securities or if the Company is not the
publicly traded parent company following such transaction 60% or more of the
parent company\'s equity securities into which Company equity securities are
converted in such transaction, (b) for a transaction that provides that the
directors of the Company immediately prior to the consummation of such
transaction will not constitute 70% or more of the directors of the Company
immediately after such transaction (if the Company is the publicly traded
parent company following such transaction) or if the Company is not the
publicly traded parent company following such transaction, 70% or more of the
directors of the parent company into which Company equity securities are
converted in such transaction, (c) for the issuance of 40% or more of the
equity securities of the Company as consideration for the assets or
securities of another person or (d) to acquire in any manner (other than (i)
in the context of the issuance of equity securities of the Company as
consideration for the assets or the securities of another person or (ii) a
transaction of a type listed in clause (a) above), directly or indirectly,
20% or more of the equity securities of the Company or assets (including
equity securities of any Subsidiary of the Company) that represent 20% or
more of the total consolidated assets of the Company, other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In determining the percentage of
equity securities of the Company or of the parent company\'s
equity securities owned by the stockholders of the Company following a
transaction covered by clause (a), such calculation shall be made on a fully
diluted basis and there shall be excluded any equity securities (or
securities convertible into equity securities) issued to co-venturers,
private equity firms and/or other persons providing financing (debt and/or
equity) for such transaction, with any such equity securities (or securities
convertible into equity securities) treated as being held by persons other
than the stockholders of the Company, regardless of the legal form of the
transaction. For purposes of clause (c) above, there shall be included in the
calculation of equity securities issued by the Company (which shall be made
on a fully-diluted basis) any equity securities (or securities convertible
into equity securities) issued to co-venturers, private equity firms and/or
other persons providing financing (debt and/or equity) for such transaction,
regardless of the legal form of the transaction.   Section 8.03 Effect of
Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the
Company or Parent as provided in Section 8.01, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the
part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, other than the provisions of the
penultimate sentence of Section 6.02(a), Sections 6.05 and 8.02, this Section
8.03 and Article IX, which provisions shall survive such termination;
provided that nothing herein shall relieve any party from any liability for
any willful breach.    63   Section 8.04 Amendment. This Agreement may be
amended by the parties hereto at any time before or after receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval; provided, however, (i) that after such approval
has been obtained, there shall be made no amendment that by Law requires
further approval by the stockholders of the Company without such approval
having been obtained and (ii) no amendment shall be made to this Agreement
after the Effective Time. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.  
Section 8.05 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto or (c) subject to the proviso to the first sentence
of Section 8.04, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert
any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a
waiver of such rights.   Section 8.06 Procedure for Termination or
Amendment. A termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01 or an
amendment of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.04 shall, in order to be
effective, require, in the case of Parent or the Company, action by the

committee or other designee of the Parent Board or the Company Board, as
applicable, to the extent permitted by Law.   ARTICLE IX   General
