holder thereof as provided in and subject to  the  provisions of Section
1.4, either: (1) a number of shares of Frontier Common  Stock equal to the
Per Share Stock Consideration; or (2) cash in an amount  equal  to the Per
Share Consideration (the "Per Share Cash Consideration"). The Per  Share
Stock Consideration and the Per Share Cash Consideration are referred  to 
herein collectively as the "Merger Consideration." Shares of WBC Common
Stock  held by Frontier immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
deemed  canceled and retired without additional consideration and shall be
excluded  from  any calculation based upon the number of shares of WBC
Common Stock outstanding  pursuant to this Section and excluded from the
election and exchange procedures  set forth in Section 1.4.

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 



 



 

 

For  purposes of this Section 1.3(A):

 

 

"Aggregate  Consideration" shall mean the sum, expressed as a dollar amount,
of (x) the  Total Stock Consideration and (y) the Total Cash Amount.

 

 

"Per  Share Consideration" shall mean the quotient, expressed as a dollar
amount and  rounded to the nearest tenth-thousandth, obtained by dividing the
Aggregate  Consideration by the total number of shares of WBC Common Stock
outstanding  as  of the close of business on the Execution Date.

 

 

"Per  Share Stock Consideration" shall mean the quotient, rounded to the
nearest  ten-thousandth, obtained by dividing the Per Share Consideration by
the Frontier  Average Share Price

 

 

"Per  Share Cash Consideration" shall mean the quotient, expressed as a
dollar amount  and rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth, obtained by
dividing the Aggregate  Consideration by the total number of shares of WBC
Common Stock outstanding as  of the close of business on the Execution Date.

 

 

"Total  Cash Amount" shall mean an amount equal to $42,864,003 subject to the
following  paragraph defining the Total Stock Amount.

 

 

"Total  Stock Amount" shall mean 5,916,430 shares of Frontier Common Stock
plus the  product of 0.90 times the increase in the number of shares of WBC
Common Stock  outstanding by virtue of the exercise of any stock option,
warrant, or other  derivative security between the Execution Date and the
Effective Time (the "Base  Stock Amount"); provided, however, that (i) if
the Frontier Average Share Price  is less than $21.00 then the number of
shares of Frontier Common Stock and/or  the Total Cash Amount may (under the
circumstances and subject to the  limitations set forth in Section 8.1(G)
only) be increased by Frontier so that  the Merger Consideration is not less
than $19.41 (and only to the extent  necessary), and (ii) if the Frontier
Average Share Price is more than $27.00  then the number of shares of
Frontier Common Stock shall equal the Base Stock  Amount multiplied by the
quotient of $27.00 as the numerator and the Frontier  Average Share Price as
the denominator so that the Merger Consideration is  not  more than $23.54
(and only to the extent necessary). An illustration of the  calculations of
the Merger Consideration and the Aggregate Consideration and  the  effect of
the foregoing "Collar" is attached as Exhibit F to this  Agreement.

 

 

"Total  Stock Consideration" shall mean the product, expressed as a dollar
amount,  obtained by multiplying (x) the Total Stock Amount and (y) the
Frontier Average  Share Price.

 

 

(B) Notwithstanding  Section 1.3(A) above, at least fifty percent (50%) of
the Aggregate  Consideration shall be paid in Frontier Common Stock. If and
to the extent  that  such limitation would not otherwise be satisfied, then
a portion of the amount  otherwise payable under Section 1.3(A) shall instead
be paid to such holders  on  a pro rata basis in Frontier Common Stock
(based on the Frontier Average  Share Price).

 

 

(C) All  of the shares of WBC Common Stock converted into the Merger
Consideration  pursuant to this ARTICLE I shall no longer be outstanding and
shall  automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
a  certificate (each a "Certificate") previously representing any such shares
of  WBC Common Stock shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect
to  such  securities, except the right to receive (1) the Merger
Consideration, (2) any  dividends and

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

other  distributions in accordance with Section 2.2(B) hereof, and (3) any
cash to  be  paid in lieu of any fractional share of Frontier Common Stock
in accordance  with  Section 2.2(E) hereof.

 

 

(D) The  calculations required by Section 1.3(A)  shall be prepared jointly
by Frontier  and WBC prior to the Effective Time.

 

 

**1.4** **_ELECTION  PROCEDURES._**

 

 

(A) An  election form and other appropriate and customary transmittal
materials (which  shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to  the  Certificates theretofore representing shares of WBC
Common Stock shall pass,  only upon proper delivery of such Certificates, or
customary affidavits and  indemnification regarding the loss or destruction
of such certificates, to  the  Exchange Agent) in such form as WBC and
Frontier shall mutually agree (the  "Election Form") shall be mailed with the
Proxy Statement on the date of mailing  of the Proxy Statement or on such
other date as Frontier and WBC shall mutually  agree (the "Mailing Date") to
each holder of record of WBC Common Stock as of  the close of business on the
fifth business day prior to the Mailing Date (the  "Election Form Record
Date").

 

 

(B) Each  Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner
through  appropriate and customary documentation and instructions) to (x)
elect to  receive (1) the Per Share Stock Consideration in respect of all of
such holder's  WBC Common Stock ("Stock Election Shares"); (2) the Per Share
Cash  Consideration in respect of all of such holder's WBC Common Stock
("Cash  Election Shares"); or (3) the Per Share Stock Consideration in
respect of that  portion to such holder's shares of WBC Common Stock equal to
the Stock  Percentage (as defined below), rounded to the nearest whole share
(the "Mixed  Stock Shares"), and the Per Share Cash Consideration in respect
of that portion  of such holder's shares of WBC Common Stock equal to the
Cash Percentage (as  defined below), rounded to the nearest whole share (the
"Mixed Cash Shares," and  together with the Mixed Stock Shares, the "Mixed
Election Shares"); or (y) to  make no election with respect to such holder's
WBC Common Stock ("No Election  Shares"). Any WBC Common Stock with respect
to which the Exchange Agent has not  received an effective, properly
completed Election Form on or before 5:00 p.m.,  Pacific Time, on the date
prior to the Determination Date (or such other time  and date as Frontier and
WBC may mutually agree) (the "Election Deadline") shall  also be deemed to be
"No Election Shares." The term "Cash Percentage" shall mean  the quotient,
rounded to the nearest thousandth, obtained by dividing (x) the  quotient
obtained by dividing the Total Cash Amount by the Per Share  Consideration,
by (y) the total number of shares of WBC Common Stock outstanding  as of the
close of business on the Determination Date. "Stock Percentage" shall  mean
the amount equal to one (1) minus the Cash Percentage.

 

 

(C) Frontier  shall make available one or more Election Forms as may
reasonably be requested  from time to time by all persons who become holders
(or beneficial owners)  of  WBC Common Stock between the Election Form
Record Date and the close of business  on the business day prior to the
Election Deadline, and WBC shall provide to  the  Exchange Agent all
information reasonably necessary for it to perform as  specified herein.

 

 

(D) Any  such election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange
Agent shall  have actually received a properly completed Election Form by the
Election  Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed properly completed only
if  accompanied by one or more certificates (or customary affidavits and 
indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such certificates or
the  guaranteed delivery of such certificates) representing all shares of WBC
Common  Stock covered by such Election Form, together with duly executed
transmittal  materials included in the Election Form. Any Election Form may
be revoked or  changed by the person submitting such Election Form at or
prior to the  Election

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

Deadline.  In the event an Election Form is revoked prior to the Election
Deadline, the  shares of WBC Common Stock represented by such Election Form
shall become No  Election Shares and Frontier shall cause the certificates
representing WBC  Common Stock to be promptly returned without charge to the
Person submitting  the  Election Form upon written request to that effect
from the holder who submitted  the Election Form. Subject to the terms of
this Agreement and of the Election  Form, the Exchange Agent shall have
reasonable discretion to determine whether  any election, revocation or
change has been properly or timely made and to  disregard immaterial defects
in the Election Forms, and any good faith decisions  of Frontier regarding
such matters shall be binding and conclusive.

 

 

(E) Within  ten (10) business days after the Election Deadline, unless the
Effective Time  has not yet occurred, in which case as soon thereafter as
practicable, Frontier  shall cause the Exchange Agent to effect the
allocation among the holders of  WBC  Common Stock of rights to receive
Frontier Common Stock or cash in the Merger  as  follows:

 

 

(1) _Cash  Election Shares Plus Mixed Cash Shares More Than Total Cash
Amount_. If the  aggregate cash amount that would be paid upon the conversion
in the Merger  for  the Cash Election Shares and the Mixed Cash Shares is
greater than the Total  Cash Amount, then:

 

 

(i) all  Stock Election Shares, Mixed Stock Shares and No Election Shares
shall be  converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock 
Consideration;

 

 

(ii) the  Exchange Agent shall then select first from among the Cash Election
Shares  and  then (if necessary) from the Mixed Cash Election Shares, by a
pro rata selection  process, a sufficient number of shares ("Stock Designated
Shares") such that the  aggregate cash amount that will be paid in the Merger
equals as closely as  practicable, but in no event less than, the Total Cash
Amount, and all Stock  Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive the Per Share  Stock Consideration; and

 

 

(iii) the  Cash Election Shares and Mixed Cash Shares that are not Stock
Designated Shares  will be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Cash  Consideration.

 

 

(2) _Cash  Election Shares Plus Mixed Cash Shares Less Than Total Cash
Amount_. If the  aggregate cash amount that would be paid upon the conversion
in the Merger  for  the Cash Election Shares and the Mixed Cash Shares is
less than the Total Cash  Amount, then:

 

 

(i) all  Cash Election Shares and Mixed Cash Shares shall be converted into
the right  to  receive the Per Share Cash Consideration;

 

 

(ii) the  Exchange Agent shall then select first from among the No Election
Shares and  second (if necessary) from among the Stock Election Shares and
finally (if  necessary) from the Mixed Stock Election Shares, by a pro rata
selection  process, a sufficient number of shares ("Cash Designated Shares")
such that the  aggregate cash amount that will be paid in the Merger equals
as closely as  practicable the Total Cash Amount, and all Cash Designated
Shares shall be  converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash
Consideration;  and

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 



 



 

 

(iii) the  Stock Election Shares, No Election Shares and Mixed Stock Shares
that are not  Cash Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive the Per  Share Stock Consideration.

 

 

(3) _Cash  Election Shares Plus Mixed Cash Shares Equal to Total Cash
Amount_. If the  aggregate cash amount that would be paid upon conversion in
the Merger for  the  Cash Election Shares and the Mixed Cash Shares is equal
or nearly equal (as  determined by the Exchange Agent) to the Total Cash
Amount, then subparagraphs  (1) and (2) above shall not apply, and all Cash
Election Shares and Mixed Cash  Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Cash  Consideration, and all Stock Election Shares,
Mixed Stock Shares, and No  Election Shares shall be converted into the right
to receive the Per Share  Stock  Consideration.

 

 

(F) The  pro rata selection process to be used by the Exchange Agent shall
consist of  such equitable pro ration processes as shall be determined by
Frontier and  reasonably satisfactory to WBC.

 

 

**1.5** **_WBC  OPTIONS_**. **** Notwithstanding anything to the  contrary
in this Agreement, and in addition to the Aggregate  Consideration:

 

 

(A) _Unexercised  Options_.

 

 

(1) At  the Effective Time, each WBC Option that is unexercised by the
Effective Time  shall be converted into a fully vested option to acquire a
number of shares  of  Frontier Common Stock equal to the product (rounded
down to the nearest whole  number) of (x) the number of shares of WBC Common
Stock subject to the WBC  Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and
(y) the Exchange Ratio  (defined below), at an exercise price per share
(rounded up to the nearest  whole  cent) equal to (A) the exercise price per
share of WBC Common Stock of such  WBC  Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time divided by (B) the Exchange  Ratio; provided, however, that
the exercise price and the number of shares  of  Frontier Common Stock
purchasable pursuant to the WBC Options shall be  determined in a manner
consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of  the  Code; provided,
further, that in the case of any WBC Option to which Section  422  of the
Code applies, the exercise price and the number of shares of Frontier  Common
Stock purchasable pursuant to such option shall be determined in  accordance
with the foregoing, subject to such adjustments as are necessary  in  order
to satisfy the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code. Except as 
specifically provided above, following the Effective Time, each WBC Option 
shall  continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions as were
applicable  under such WBC Option immediately prior to the Effective Time.
For purposes  of  this Agreement, the "Exchange Ratio" shall be equal to the
fraction having a  numerator equal to the Per Share Consideration and having
a denominator equal  to  the Frontier Average Share Price.

 

 

(2) As  soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Frontier will prepare
and file  with the SEC a Registration Statement on Form S-8 covering shares
of Frontier  Common Stock to be issued upon the exercise of stock options
assumed by Frontier  pursuant to this Section 1.5(A).

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 



 



 

 

(3) At  or prior to the Effective Time, WBC, the WBC Board and the
compensation  committee of the WBC Board, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and  take  any actions which are necessary to effectuate the
provisions of this Section  1.5(A). WBC shall take all actions necessary to
ensure that, from and after  the  Effective Time, Frontier will not be
required to deliver WBC Common Stock or  other capital stock of WBC to any
Person pursuant to or in settlement of WBC  Options.

 

 

(B) The  names of the holders, dates of issuance and expiration, the number
of shares  subject to each such option, and the exercise price for all WBC
Options as  of  the Execution Date are set forth in _Schedule_ _1.5_
_(B)_.  All such WBC Options shall be  100% vested and exercisable at the
Effective Time pursuant to the 2005 Stock  Incentive Plan, the 1998 Stock
Option and Restricted Stock Award Plan, the  1993  Director Stock Option
Plan and the 1992 Stock Option Plan (collectively, the  "WBC Stock Option
Plans").

 

 

**1.6** **_DISSENTING  SHARES_**. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement,  each Dissenting Share whose holder, as of the Effective Time
of the Merger,  has  not effectively withdrawn or lost his or her
dissenters' rights under Ch. 23B.13  RCW (the "Appraisal Laws") shall not be
converted into or represent a right to  receive the Per Share Cash
Consideration or Frontier Common Stock, but the  holder of such Dissenting
Share shall be entitled only to such rights as are  granted by the Appraisal
Laws, unless and until such holder shall have failed  to  perfect or shall
have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to payment under  the Appraisal
Laws, in which case each such share shall be deemed to have been  converted
at the Effective Time into the right to receive cash and/or Frontier  Common
Stock (based on the Per Share Stock Consideration defined in  Section 1.3(A))
without any interest  thereon, in the same proportions determined under
Section 1.5(A) with respect  to  WBC Options that are unexercised by the
Effective Time. Each holder of  Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled to
payment for his WBC Common Stock  pursuant to the provisions of the Appraisal
Laws shall receive payment for  such  Dissenting Shares from Frontier (but
only after the amount thereof shall have  been agreed upon or finally
determined pursuant to the Appraisal  Laws).

 

 

**1.7** **_TAX  CONSEQUENCES_**. It is intended that the Merger shall
constitute a  reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue  Code  of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and that this
Agreement shall constitute a plan  of reorganization for the purposes of
Section 368 of the Code.

 

 

**ARTICLE  II. EXCHANGE OF SHARES**

 

 

**2.1** **_FRONTIER  TO MAKE SHARES AND CASH AVAILABLE_** **.** On or
before  the Effective Time, Frontier shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited,  with  American Stock Transfer and Trust Company (the "Exchange
Agent"), for the  benefit of the holders of WBC Common Stock as of the
Effective Time, for  exchange in accordance with this ARTICLE  II: (A)
certificates or electronic indicia of ownership representing the  shares of
Frontier Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 1.3 and Section
2.2(A)  in exchange for outstanding shares of  WBC Common Stock; (B) cash in
the amount of the Total Cash Consideration;  and (C) the cash in lieu of
fractional shares to be paid in  accordance with Section 2.2(E). Such cash 
and shares of Frontier Common Stock, together with any dividends or 
distributions with respect to such Frontier Common Stock, are hereinafter 
referred to as the "Exchange Fund."

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 



 



 

 

**2.2** **_EXCHANGE  OF SHARES_ _._**

 

 

(A) As  soon as practicable after the Effective Time, and in no event more
than five  (5)  business days thereafter, the Exchange Agent shall mail to
each holder of record  of a Certificate or Certificates who theretofore has
not submitted such holder's  Certificate or Certificates with an Election
Form, a form letter of transmittal  (which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and  title  to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates or  customary affidavits and
indemnification regarding the loss or destruction  of  such certificates or
the guaranteed delivery of such certificates to the  Exchange Agent) and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the  Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. After completion of  the  allocation
procedure set forth in Section 1.4 and upon surrender of a Certificate  or 
Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together 
with  a properly executed letter of transmittal or Election Form, as the case
may  be,  the holder of such Certificate or Certificates shall be entitled
to receive  in  exchange therefor (x) a certificate representing that number
of whole shares  of  Frontier Common Stock which such holder of WBC Common
Stock became entitled  to  receive pursuant to the provisions of ARTICLE  I
hereof and/or (y) a check representing the aggregate Per Share Cash 
Consideration and/or the amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares, if
any,  which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the
Certificate or  Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of
ARTICLE I, and the Certificate or  Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. No interest will be  paid or accrued on the Per Share
Cash Consideration, the cash in lieu of  fractional shares or the unpaid
dividends and distributions, if any, payable  to  holders of Certificates.

 

 

(B) No  dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective Time 
with respect to Frontier Common Stock and payable to the holders of  record
thereof shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate  until
the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with  this
ARTICLE II. After the surrender of a  Certificate in accordance with this
ARTICLE  II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any
such  dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which 
theretofore has become payable with respect to shares of Frontier Common
Stock  represented by such Certificate.

 

 

(C) If  any certificate representing shares of Frontier Common Stock is to be
issued  in  a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in
exchange therefor  is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance
thereof that the  Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or
accompanied by an  appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in
proper form for transfer,  and that the person requesting such exchange shall
pay to the Exchange Agent  in  advance any transfer or other taxes required
by reason of the issuance of a  certificate representing shares of Frontier
Common Stock in any name other  than  that of the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered, or required for  any other reason, or shall
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent  that such tax has been
paid or is not payable.

 

 

(D) After  the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books  of  WBC of the shares of WBC Common Stock which were issued
and outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time,  Certificates representing such shares are presented for
transfer to the Exchange  Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for
certificates representing shares  of Frontier Common Stock or cash or both,
as provided in this ARTICLE II.

 

 

(E) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained herein, no
certificates or scrip representing  fractional shares of Frontier Common
Stock shall be issued upon the surrender  for

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

exchange  of Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to
Frontier Common  Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional
share, and such  fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to  any  other rights of a shareholder of Frontier. In
lieu of the issuance of any such  fractional share, Frontier shall pay to
each former shareholder of WBC who  otherwise would be entitled to receive a
fractional share of Frontier Common  Stock an amount in cash determined by
multiplying (1) the Frontier Average  Share  Price by (2) the fraction of a
share of Frontier Common Stock which such holder  would otherwise be entitled
to receive pursuant to Section 1.3 hereof.

 

 

(F) Frontier  (through the Exchange Agent, if applicable) shall be entitled
to deduct and  withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any  holder of shares of WBC Common Stock such amounts as
Frontier is required under  the Code or any state, local or foreign tax law
or regulation there under to  deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment. Any amounts  so  withheld shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been  paid  to the holder of WBC Common Stock in
respect of which such deduction and  withholding was made by Frontier.

 

 

(G) Any  portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of  WBC  for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall
be paid to Frontier.  Any  shareholders of WBC who have not theretofore
complied with this ARTICLE II shall thereafter look only to  Frontier for
payment of the Merger Consideration, the cash in lieu of fractional  shares
and/or the unpaid dividends and distributions on the Frontier Common  Stock
deliverable in respect of each share of WBC Common Stock such shareholder 
holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any 
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Frontier, Frontier 
Bank, WBC, Whidbey Island Bank, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall 
be  liable to any former holder of shares of WBC Common Stock for any
amount  properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned  property, escheat or similar laws.

 

 

(H) In  the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the  making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate  to  be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Frontier,
the posting by such  person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Frontier
may direct as indemnity  against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate,  the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed  Certificate the Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant  to  this Agreement.

_Schedule _ _5.1_ _(P)_ _(2)_   each ERISA Plan which  is an "employee
pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of  ERISA ("Pension
Plan") and which is intended to be qualified under the Code has  received a
favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service  (or  has
applied for a favorable determination letter and is waiting for a response, 
or

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

utilizes  a prototype that allows for reliance on the opinion letter of the
sponsor of  the  prototype or volume submitter document), and it is not
aware of any  circumstances reasonably likely to result in the revocation or

receive such a favorable  determination letter. There is no material pending
or, to its knowledge,  threatened litigation relating to the ERISA Plans.
Neither WBC nor Whidbey  Island Bank has engaged in a transaction with
respect to any ERISA Plan that  could subject WBC or Whidbey Island Bank to a
tax or penalty imposed by either  Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i)

(3) No  liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has been or is
expected  to  be incurred by WBC or Whidbey Island Bank with respect to any
ongoing, frozen  or  terminated "single-employer plan," within the meaning
of Section 4001(a)(15) of  ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by any of
them, or the single-employer  plan of any entity which is considered one
employer with WBC or Whidbey Island  Bank under Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA
or Section 414 of the Code (a "ERISA  Affiliate"). Neither WBC nor Whidbey
Island Bank presently contributes to a  Multiemployer Plan and they have not
contributed to such a plan within the  past  five calendar years. No notice

ERISA. WBC and Whidbey  Island Bank have not provided and are not required to
provide, security to  any  Pension Plan or to any single-employer plan of an
ERISA Affiliate pursuant  to  Section 401(a)(29) of the Code.

 

 

(5) Under  each Pension Plan which is a single-employer plan, as of the last
day of the  most recent plan year, the actuarially determined present value
of all "benefit  liabilities," within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of
ERISA (as determined  on the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in
the plan's most recent  actuarial valuation) did not exceed the then current
value of the assets of  such  plan, and there has been no material change in
the financial condition of such  plan since the last day of the most recent
plan year.

 

 

(6) WBC  and Whidbey Island Bank have no obligations for retiree health and
life benefits  under any plan, except as set forth in _Schedule_ _5.1_ _(P)_

amend or terminate any such plan without  incurring any liability there
under.

committed an  unfair labor practice (within the meaning of the National Labor
Relations Act)  or seeking to compel it to bargain with any labor
organization as to wages  and  conditions of employment, nor is there any
strike or other labor dispute  involving it pending nor, to WBC's or Whidbey

Loans held for resale to  investors), were made or purchased and are
administered or serviced, as  applicable, in accordance with customary

regulations relating to such Loans.

 

 

(4) Except  as set forth in _Schedule 5.1(R)(4)_ , no agreement pursuant to
which any  Loans or other assets have been sold by WBC or its Subsidiaries
entitled the  buyer of such Loans or other assets, unless there is material
breach of a  representation or covenant by WBC or its Subsidiaries, to cause
WBC or Whidbey  Island Bank to repurchase such loan or

insured by the Bank Insurance Fund of the FDIC to the fullest  extent

following the date of this Agreement,  advise Frontier of the date on which
the Meeting is to be convened, which date  shall be reasonably acceptable to

prior to the Effective  Time, before or after approval of the matters
presented in connection with  the  Merger by the holders of WBC Common
Stock, under each of the following  conditions:

 

 

(A) _MUTUAL  CONSENT_. By the mutual consent of Frontier and WBC, if the
Board of  Directors of each so determines by vote of a majority of the
members of its  entire board.

 

 

(B) _DELAY_.  By Frontier or WBC in the event the Merger is not consummated
by June 30,  2008, unless the failure of the consummation of the transactions
to occur shall  be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this
Agreement to  perform its obligations hereunder in a timely manner;
_provided,  however_ , that a party may not terminate the Agreement pursuant
to this  Section 8.1(B)  if it is in material breach of any of  the
provisions of the Agreement; _provided, further,_ that Frontier may  not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(B), if such delay 
results from amendments to the Registration Statement or a resolicitation of 
proxies as a consequence of a Frontier Transaction, or any other acquisition 
or  sale transaction, or any offering of securities, in which Frontier is 
involved.

 

 

(C) _NO  REGULATORY APPROVALS_. By Frontier or WBC, in the event that any of
the  required regulatory approvals set forth in Section 7.1(B) are denied (or
should any such  required approval be conditioned upon a material deviation
from the transactions  contemplated); _provided however_ , that either party
may extend the term  of this Agreement for a sixty (60) day period to
prosecute diligently and  overturn such denial provided that such denial has
been appealed within fourteen  (14) business days of the receipt thereof.

 

 

(D) _BREACH  OF WARRANTY_. By Frontier or WBC (provided that the terminating
party is not  then in material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other  agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a
material breach of any  of  the representations or warranties set forth in
this Agreement on the part of  the  other party, which breach is not cured
within thirty days following written  notice to the party committing such
breach, or which breach, by its nature,  cannot be cured prior to the
Effective Time; _provided, however,_ that  neither party shall have the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to  this  Section 8.1(D)  unless the
breach of representation or  warranty, together with all other such breaches,
would entitle the party  receiving such representation not to consummate the

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

transactions  contemplated hereby under Section 7.2(B)  (in the case of a
breach of representation or warranty by WBC or Whidbey Island  Bank) or
Section 7.3(B) (in the case of  a breach of representation or warranty by
Frontier or Frontier  Bank).

 

 

(E) _BREACH  OF COVENANT_. By either Frontier or WBC (provided that the
terminating party  is not then in material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or  other agreement contained herein) if there shall have
been a material breach  of  any of the covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement on the part  of  the other party, which breach shall not have
been cured within thirty days  following receipt by the breaching party of
written notice of such breach from  the other party hereto, or which breach,
by its nature, cannot be cured prior  to  the Effective Time.

 

 

(F) _SUPERIOR  PROPOSAL_. By WBC, in the event that the Board of Directors of
WBC determines  in good faith, after consultation with its financial adviser
and outside  counsel, that in light of a Superior Proposal (as defined in
Section 9.3) it would not be consistent with its  fiduciary duties to WBC and
to WBC \'s shareholders under applicable law to  continue with the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement; _provided,  however,_ that
the Board of Directors of WBC may terminate this Agreement  pursuant to this
Section 8.1(F)  solely in order to concurrently enter  into a letter of
intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other  similar
agreement (each, an "Acquisition Agreement") related to a Superior  Proposal;
provided further, however, that this Agreement may be terminated  pursuant to
this Section 8.1(F)  only after the fifth day following  Frontier's receipt
of written notice advising Frontier that the Board of  Directors of WBC is
prepared to accept a Superior Proposal, and only if, during  such five-day
period, if Frontier so elects, WBC and its advisors shall have  negotiated in
good faith with Frontier to make such adjustments in the terms  and 
conditions of this Agreement as would enable Frontier to proceed with the 
transactions contemplated herein on such adjusted terms.

 

 

(G) _WALK-AWAY_.  By WBC upon its written notice to Frontier promptly before,
but in no event  later than five (5) Business Days prior to, the commencement
of the Meeting,  in  the event that the Frontier Average Share Price is less
than $21.00 at any  time  during the Measurement Period; _provided, however_
, that this Agreement  may be terminated by WBC pursuant to this Section
8.1(G) only if, after receipt  of written notice advising Frontier that the
Board of Directors of WBC is  prepared to terminate this Agreement, Frontier
does not, at least one day prior  to the Meeting, agree to increase the Total
Stock Amount and/or the Total Cash  Amount if and to the extent necessary
based on the Frontier Average Share Price  as of the Effective Time, and
consummate the Corporate Merger in a manner that  would yield Aggregate
Merger Consideration, on a per-share basis using the  Frontier Average Share
Price measured as of the Effective Time, of not less  than  $19.41. For
purposes of this Section 8.1(G), the "Measurement Period" means that  ten
(10) Business Day period ending on the sixth Business Day prior to the 
date  on which the Meeting is scheduled to occur. If either party declares or
effects  a stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up,
combination,  exchange of shares or similar transaction between the Execution
Date and the  Determination Date, the prices for the Frontier Common Stock
shall be  appropriately adjusted for purposes of applying this Section 
8.1(G).

 

 

(H) _SHAREHOLDER  APPROVAL_. By either Frontier or WBC if the approval of the
shareholders of  WBC required for the consummation of the Corporate Merger
shall not have been  obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required
vote at a duly held  meeting of such shareholders or at any adjournment or
postponement  thereof.

 

 

(I) _FRONTIER  CONDITIONS PRECEDENT_. By Frontier as a result of (1) a
Material Adverse  Change in WBC as set forth in Section 7.2(E), or (2) the

Change in  Frontier as set forth in Section 7.3(E),  or if the condition set
forth in Section 7.3(F) cannot be satisfied.

 

 

(K) _NO  FAIRNESS OPINION_. By WBC in the event the fairness opinion
described in  Section 7.3(G) is not confirmed at the time referenced in
such  Section.

 

 

**8.2** **_EFFECT  OF TERMINATION_.**

(C) In  the event that an Acquisition Proposal with respect to WBC shall have
been  made  known to WBC and shall have been publicly announced or otherwise
become public,  or shall have been made to the shareholders of WBC, and
thereafter (1) this  Agreement is terminated by either Frontier or WBC
pursuant to either (i) Section  8.1(B) hereof and prior to such  termination
the shareholders of WBC shall not have previously approved the  Merger, or
(ii) Section 8.1(H) hereof as  a result of the failure of the shareholders of
WBC to approve the Merger and  (2)  within twenty-four (24) months of such
termination WBC enters into any  Acquisition Agreement providing for any
transaction described in clause (1)  or  clause (2) of Section 9.3(D), then
upon  the first occurrence of an event contemplated by this clause (2) WBC
shall  pay  Frontier the Termination Fee Amount.

more than  one  (1) time, irrespective of any subsequent actions by WBC or
any Third Party.  The  Termination Fee Amount is intended as an alternative

the agreements or conditions of  the  other party contained herein. Any

shall be valid only if set forth in a written  instrument signed on behalf of
such party or its Subsidiaries, but such  extension or waiver or failure to
insist on strict compliance with an  obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition shall not operate as a waiver  of,  or estoppel with respect to,
any subsequent or other failure.

participate in the pension, employee  benefit and similar plans (including

401(k) Plan as  soon  as practicable after the receipt of the determination
letter. Neither Frontier,  nor Frontier Bank, shall have any obligation to

Participants in the WBC 401(k) Plan who  become employees of Frontier or its
Subsidiaries will be permitted, subject  to  the terms of the WBC 401(k)
Plan, to rollover such distributions to Frontier's  401(k) Plan.

fiduciary duties to WBC's shareholders under  applicable law that such
Acquisition Proposal may result in a Superior Proposal  (as defined below),
(b) prior to providing any information or data to any person  in connection
with an Acquisition Proposal by any such person, WBC's Board of  Directors
receives from such person an executed confidentiality agreement  containing
terms at least as stringent as those contained in the Confidentiality 
Agreement, and (c) prior to providing any information or data to any person 
or  entering into discussions or negotiations with any person, WBC's Board
of  Directors notifies Frontier promptly of such inquiries, proposals, or
offers  received by, any such information requested from, or any such
discussions or  negotiations sought to be initiated or continued with, any of
its  Representatives.

 

 

(C) WBC  and Whidbey Island Bank each agrees that it will, and will cause
its  Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities,  discussions, or negotiations existing as of the Execution Date
with any parties  conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal, and shall use  reasonable best efforts to cause all persons other
than Frontier who have been  furnished confidential information regarding WBC
or Whidbey Island Bank in  connection with the solicitation of or discussions
regarding an Acquisition  Proposal within the 12 months prior to the date
hereof promptly to return or  destroy such information. WBC and Whidbey
Island Bank agree not to release  any  third party from the confidentiality
and standstill provisions of any agreement  to which WBC or Whidbey Island
Bank is or may become a party, and shall  immediately take all steps
necessary to terminate any approval that may have  been heretofore given
under any such provisions authorizing any person to make  an Acquisition
Proposal.

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 



 



 

 

(D) For  purposes of this Section 9.3:

 

 

(1) The  term "Acquisition Proposal" means any tender offer or exchange offer
or any  proposal for a merger, reorganization, consolidation, share
exchange,  recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other business
combination  involving WBC or Whidbey Island Bank or any proposal or offer to
acquire a  substantial equity interest in (other than as part of a public
offering to  raise  capital that does not require shareholder approval), or
(other than in the  ordinary course of business) a substantial portion of the
assets of, WBC or  Whidbey Island Bank, other than the transaction
contemplated or permitted by  this Agreement.

 

 

(2) The  term "Superior Proposal" means, with respect to WBC or Whidbey
Island Bank, any  written Acquisition Proposal made by a person other than
Frontier which is  for  (i) (a) a merger, reorganization, consolidation,
share exchange, business  combination, recapitalization or similar
transaction involving WBC or Whidbey  Island Bank, (b) a sale, lease,
exchange, transfer, or other disposition of  at  least 25% of the assets of
WBC or Whidbey Island Bank, taken as a whole, in  a  single transaction or a
series of related transactions, or (c) the acquisition,  directly or
indirectly, by a person of beneficial ownership of 25% or more  of  the WBC
Common Stock or Whidbey Island Bank Common Stock whether by merger, 
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, tender, or exchange
offer  or otherwise, and (ii) which is otherwise on terms which the Board of
Directors  of WBC in good faith concludes (after consultation with its
financial advisors  and outside counsel), taking into account, among other
things, all legal,  financial, regulatory, and other aspects of the proposal
and the person making  the proposal, (a) would, if consummated, result in a
transaction that is more  favorable to its shareholders (in their capacities
as shareholders), from a  financial point of view, than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement,  and (b) is reasonably capable of being
completed.

 

 

**9.4** **_EMPLOYMENT  AND CHANGE OF CONTROL AGREEMENTS_** **.** As of the 
Effective Time, Frontier shall assume and honor and shall cause Frontier
Bank  to  assume and to honor in accordance with their terms the change of
control  provisions of WBC's and Whidbey Island Bank's employment and
severance  agreements with Michal D. Cann, Richard A. Shields, John L.
Wagner, Joseph  W.  Niemer, Lynn Garrison, Scott Boyer, Shelly Angus, Bryan
McDonald and Dale Smith,  as described in _Schedule 9.4_ and as may be
amended as of the Closing by  the Noncompetition/Nonsolicitation Agreement,
(collectively, the " _Employment  Agreements_ "). Frontier acknowledges and
agrees that the Merger will  constitute a merger, sale or a change in control
of WBC and Whidbey Island  Bank  for all purposes under such Employment
Agreements.

 

 

**9.5** **_DIRECTORS  OF_** ** _WBC_** **.** After the  Effective Time, one
current director of WBC (as determined by Frontier) shall  be  appointed to
the Frontier board of directors until the next shareholders' meeting, at
which time such appointee will, subject to the Frontier board's  fiduciary
obligations, stand for election for a two-year term expiring in 2010.  The
composition of Frontier's board of directors will be increased by one and 
will not be decreased in a manner that would limit Frontier's ability to 
accommodate the WBC representative so designated. Compensation for such
director  (including compensation for committee assignments and like duties)
will be  consistent with Frontier's compensation practices for other
similarly situated  directors of Frontier.

 

 

**9.6** **_WBC  MANAGEMENT_** **.** After the Effective Time, WBC's chief 
executive officer will serve as the regional manager of the division of
Frontier  that serves such branches of WBC and Frontier as will be determined
by  Frontier's chief executive officer, most of which are expected to be in 
the

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

current  WBC market. The regional manager will execute a
Noncompetition/Nonsolicitation  Agreement with Frontier that will continue
until the later of the termination  of  the regional manager's employment
with Frontier or the second anniversary of the  Effective Time. The salary,
reporting and remaining terms of his employment  will  be mutually agreed
upon by the parties; however, there will be no employment  contract and the
regional manager will be an at-will employee and serve at  the  pleasure of
Frontier's senior officers and board of directors.

 

 

**9.7** **_AT-WILL  EMPLOYEES_** **.** After the Effective Time, a
substantial  majority of the employees of WBC will have the opportunity to
continue their  at-will employment with Frontier, if and to the extent that
mutually suitable  job opportunities are available. WBC employees whose
positions are eliminated  as  a result of the Merger, and who remain
employees of WBC through Closing or,  where required by Frontier for post-
merger systems integration and conversion  activities ("conversion"), through
conversion, will be eligible to receive upon  Closing or conversion severance
pay and/or stay bonuses. The specific terms  and  conditions and personnel
of the stay bonus/severance program will be determined  by Frontier prior to
closing, in consultation with WBC's senior  management.

 

 

**ARTICLE  . GENERAL PROVISIONS**

 

 

**10.1** **_CLOSING;  EFFECTIVE TIME_** **.** Subject to the terms and 
conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will

after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of the latest

by,  and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of Washington,

**DIRECTOR 'S  AGREEMENT**

 

 

This  Director's Agreement (this "Agreement"), dated as of
__________________, 2007,  is between FRONTIER FINANCIAL CORPORATION, a
Washington corporation  ("Frontier"), FRONTIER BANK, a Washington state
chartered bank ("Frontier  Bank"), and _________________________
("Director"), a director of WASHINGTON  BANKING COMPANY, a Washington
corporation ("WBC") and/or WHIDBEY ISLAND  BANK.

 

 

_Recitals_

 

 

1. Pursuant  to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of September _____,  2007 (the "Merger Agreement"), between Frontier, Frontier Bank, WBC and Whidbey  Island Bank ("WBC Bank"), WBC will be merged into Frontier, with Frontier as the  surviving corporation, and WBC Bank will be merged into Frontier Bank, with  Frontier Bank as the continuing corporation.

 

 

2. As  material inducement to Frontier and Frontier Bank to enter into the Merger  Agreement, Frontier has required each Director of WBC and WBC Bank to enter  into  an agreement providing for a covenant not to compete with the business of  Frontier or Frontier Bank and a covenant not to solicit any employees of  Frontier or Frontier Bank following the consummation of the transactions  contemplated by the Merger Agreement, in each case as specified  herein.

 

 

3. In  light of the foregoing recitals, Director has agreed to be bound by the terms  of  this Agreement.

 

 

_Agreement_

 

 

In  consideration of Frontier's and Frontier Bank's performance under the
Merger  Agreement, Director agrees that for a period of two (2) years after
the  effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), Director will not,
without  Frontier or Frontier Bank's prior written consent, directly or
indirectly, (i)  become involved in, as a principal shareholder, director,
officer, founder,  employee, consultant or other agent (each of the foregoing
relationships,  hereinafter referred to as an "Affiliate") of any Financial
Institution (as  defined below) in any the Washington State counties of
Island, San Juan, Skagit,  Snohomish and Whatcom (the "Counties"), or (ii)
have any responsibility for a  Financial Institution's organization or
operation within any of the Counties;  provided, however, that Director may
acquire and passively own an interest  not  exceeding 2% of the total equity
interest in any Financial Institution in any  of  the Counties that is
traded on NASDAQ or another U.S. stock  exchange.

 

 

Director  also agrees that for a period of two (2) years after the Effective
Date,  Director will not, directly or indirectly, (a) solicit or attempt to
solicit  (i)  any employee of Frontier, Frontier Bank, or any of their
subsidiaries  (including, but not limited to, any employees of WBC or WBC
Bank who became  an  employee of Frontier as a result of the Merger), to
leave their employment  or  (ii) any customers of Frontier, Frontier Bank,
or any of their subsidiaries  (including, but not limited to, any customer of
WBC or WBC Bank who became  a  customer of

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

Frontier  or Frontier Bank as a result of the Merger) to remove or transfer
any of their  business from Frontier, Frontier Bank, or any of their
subsidiaries, or (b)  otherwise materially interfere with or impair the
relationship, contractual  or  otherwise, between Frontier, Frontier Bank,
or any of their subsidiaries and  any  of their customers or employees. The
foregoing sentence is not, however,  intended to limit Director's discretion
to allocate his own personal investments  as he chooses so long as such
allocation is not made for the purpose of  providing material support to a
competitor of Frontier. Solicitation prohibited  under this section includes
solicitation by any means, including, without  limitation, meetings,
telephone calls, letters or other mailings, electronic  communication of any

**NONCOMPETITION/NONSOLICITATION  AGREEMENT**

 

 

This  Noncompetition/Nonsolicitation Agreement dated September _____, 2007
(this  "Agreement") is entered into by and between FRONTIER FINANCIAL
CORPORATION,  FRONTIER BANK and their subsidiaries (collectively,
"Frontier"), and MICHAL D.  CANN ("Executive").

 

 

**WHEREAS** ,  Frontier, Washington Banking Company ("WBC") and Whidbey
Island Bank ("WBC  Bank") are entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger
("the Merger  Agreement"), pursuant to which WBC will be merged into Frontier
Financial  Corporation and WBC Bank will be merged into Frontier Bank (the
"Merger");  and

 

 

**WHEREAS** ,  Executive is currently employed as President and Chief
Executive Officer of  WBC  and/or WBC Bank and has knowledge of certain
Confidential Information of WBC,  and Frontier Financial Corporation and
Frontier Bank are executing the Merger  Agreement conditioned upon
Executive's agreement not to compete with Frontier in  any county in which
WBC Bank has branch offices or loan production offices,  and  not to solicit
employees and customers of Frontier (including the employees  and  customers
of WBC who become employees and customers of Frontier following the  Merger),
for a specified period of time following the Merger, all as further 
described below; and

 

 

**NOW,  THEREFORE** , Frontier and Executive agree as follows:

 

 

1. **_Effective  Time_**. This Agreement shall become effective at the effective time  of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), as set forth in the Merger  Agreement.

 

 

2. **_Noncompetition,  Nonsolicitation and Nondisparagement_** **.** In  consideration for this Agreement and to protect the business and goodwill  purchased by Frontier pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Executive agrees that  he  will not, directly or indirectly, do any of the following:

 

 

2.1 For  a one-year period commencing on the first day after the effective
time of the  Merger (the "Effective Time"), (a) become involved in, as a
principal  shareholder, director, officer, founder, employee, consultant or
other agent  (each of the foregoing relationships, hereinafter referred to as
an "Affiliate")  of any Financial Institution (as defined below) in any of
the Washington state  counties of Island, San Juan, Skagit, Snohomish and
Whatcom (individually and  collectively, the "Counties"), or (b) have any
responsibility for a Financial  Institution's organization or operation in
any of the Counties; provided,  however, that Executive may acquire and
passively own an interest not exceeding  2% of the total equity interest in
any Financial Institution in any of the  Counties that is traded on NASDAQ or
another U.S. stock exchange. For purposes  of this Agreement, the term
"Financial Institution" means any bank holding  company or financial holding
company, state or national bank, state or federal  savings and loan
association, mutual savings bank, or state or federal credit  union, trust
company or mortgage company (including without limitation, any  organizing
entity of any such Financial Institution) located in any of the  Counties.

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 



 



 

 

2.2 For  a two-year period commencing on the first day after the effective
time of the  Merger (the "Effective Time"), (a) solicit or attempt to solicit
(i) any  employees of Frontier to leave their employment, or (ii) any
customers of  Frontier to remove or transfer any of their business from
Frontier, or (b)  otherwise interfere with, disrupt or attempt to disrupt the
relationship,  contractual or otherwise, between Frontier and any of
Frontier's customers or  employees. Solicitation prohibited under this
section includes solicitation  by  any means, including, without limitation,
meetings, letters or other mailings,  electronic communications of any kind,
and Internet communications; provided,  however, that solicitation prohibited
under this paragraph does not include  solicitation through general
advertising that is not specifically directed  to or  targeting the
employees of Frontier or Frontier Bank.

 

 

3. **_Nondisparagement_** **. ** Executive shall not, during the term or after the termination or  expiration of this Agreement or Executive's employment, make disparaging  statements, in any form, about Frontier or its officers, directors, agents,  employees, products or services.

 

 

4. **_Intellectual  Property/Confidential Information_**. Further, anything to the  contrary herein notwithstanding, neither Executive nor any firm, company, trust  or other entity of which Executive is an Affiliate shall, during the term or  after the termination or expiration of this Agreement, (i) use, register or  claim any right or interest in any Intellectual Property or Confidential  Information of Frontier, including but not limited to the Intellectual Property  and Confidential Information of WBC acquired pursuant to the Merger Agreement,  or (ii) use the trade name "Washington Banking Company," "Whidbey Island Bank," or any similar name or derivation thereof, in connection with the banking,  financial, lending or mortgage industries.

 

 

5. **_No  Employee Contract Rights_**. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall  be construed to abrogate, limit or affect the powers, rights and privileges  of  Frontier to remove Executive as an employee of Frontier, with or without  cause.

 

 

6. **_Enforcement  of Covenants_**.

 

 

6.1 Frontier  and Executive stipulate that, in light of all of the facts and
circumstances  of  the relationship between Frontier and Executive, the
covenants referred to  in  Sections 2, 3 and 4 (including without limitation
their scope, duration and  geographic extent) are fair and reasonably
necessary for the protection of  Frontier's Confidential Information (as
defined below), goodwill and other  protectable interests. If a court of
competent jurisdiction should decline  to  enforce any of those covenants
and agreements, Frontier and Executive request  the court to reform these
provisions to restrict Executive's use of Confidential  Information and
Executive's ability to compete with Frontier to the maximum  extent, in time,
scope of activities and geography, that the court finds  enforceable.

 

 

6.2 Executive  acknowledges that Frontier will suffer immediate and
irreparable harm that  will  not be compensable by damages alone, if
Executive repudiates or breaches any  of  the provisions of Sections 2, 3 or
4. For this reason, under these  circumstances, Frontier, in addition to and
without limitation of any other  rights, remedies or damages available

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

to  it at law or in equity, will be entitled to obtain temporary, preliminary
and  permanent injunctions in order to prevent or restrain the breach, and
Frontier  will not be required to post a bond as a condition for the granting
of this  relief.

 

 

6.3 In  the event Executive breaches this Agreement, which breach is not
corrected  within 15 days of notice by Frontier to Executive of such breach,
Executive  shall in addition to the remedies available to Frontier under
Section 6.2,  forfeit all right to receive all benefits or other payments
remaining unpaid  from Frontier pursuant to Section 8.2 or otherwise on the
date of any such  breach.

 

 

7. **_Adequate  Consideration_**. Executive specifically acknowledges the receipt of  adequate consideration for the covenants contained in Sections 2, 3 and 4 above  and that Frontier is entitled to require him to comply with said Sections 2,  3  and 4, which Sections will survive termination of this Agreement.

 

 

8. **_Employment  Agreement Superseded_**. Executive's Employment Agreement with WBC  dated as of May 6, 2005 (the "Employment Agreement") is terminated, superseded  and replaced as of the Effective Time by the following provisions:

 

 

8.1 _Definitions_.  The following definitions shall govern and be controlling
for purposes of this  Agreement:

 

 

8.1.1 "Cause"  shall include termination because Executive: (i) materially
breached this  Agreement; (ii) willfully breached or habitually neglected or
breached the  duties which he was required to perform under the terms of his
employment with  Frontier or the policies of Frontier; (iii) commits act(s)
of dishonesty, theft,  embezzlement, fraud or misrepresentation against
Frontier or its subsidiaries;  (iv) willfully and continually failed to
comply with any law, rule, or  regulation (other than traffic violations or
similar offenses) or final cease  and desist order of a regulatory agency
having jurisdiction over Frontier;  (v)  fails to follow the reasonable
directions of Frontier's board of directors,  which failure is not corrected
within thirty (30) days after receipt by  Executive of written notice
outlining the corrective action required; or (vi)  knowingly provides
misleading or false information to shareholders, the board  of  directors,
auditors, accountants, or regulatory authorities.

 

 

8.1.2 "Change  of Control" means the Merger.

 

 

8.1.3 "Confidential  Information" includes, without limitation, any
information in whatever form that  Frontier considers to be confidential,
proprietary, information and that is  not  publicly or generally available
relating to Frontier's: trade secrets (as  defined by the Uniform Trade
Secrets Act); know-how; concepts; methods; research  and development;
product, content and technology development plans; marketing  plans;
databases; inventions; research data and mechanisms; software (including 
functional specifications, source code and object code); procedures; 
engineering; purchasing; accounting; marketing; sales; customer lists; 
advertisers; joint venture partners; financial status; contracts or
employees.  Confidential Information includes information developed by
Executive, alone  or  with others, or entrusted to Frontier by its customers
or others.

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 



 



 

 

8.1.4 "Good  Reason" shall include, but not be limited to: (i) a material
reduction in  Executive's compensation defined as a reduction equal to or
greater than five  percent (5%) of Executive's then annual base salary, which
reduction is not of  general application to substantially all employees of
Frontier, (ii) a material  reduction in Executive's duties, responsibilities,
or reporting relationship,  but not merely a change in title, or (iii)
relocation of Executive's primary  workplace from Oak Harbor to a location
outside Island, San Juan, Snohomish,  Skagit or Whatcom counties.

 

 

8.1.5 "Intellectual  Property" means any material trademarks, service marks,
brand names,  certification marks, trade dress or other indications of
origin, the goodwill  associated with the foregoing and applications in any
jurisdiction to register,  the foregoing, including any extension,
modification or renewal of any such  registration or application; patents,
applications for patents (including  divisions, continuations, continuations
in part and renewal applications),  and  any renewals, extensions or
reissues thereof, in any jurisdiction; trade secrets  and registrations or
applications for registration of copyrights in any  jurisdiction, and any
renewals or extensions thereof.

 

 

8.1.6 "Limitation  Amount" means an amount equal to two times the lesser of
(i) Executive's  annualized compensation based upon the annual rate of pay
for services provided  to Frontier for his taxable year preceding his taxable
year in which his  employment with Frontier terminates (adjusted for any
increase during that  year  that was expected to continue indefinitely if
his employment did not terminate);  or (ii) the maximum amount that may be
taken into account under a qualified  plan  pursuant to section 401(a)(17)
of the Code for the year in which Executive's  employment terminates. For
2007, such maximum amount is two times $225,000  (adjusted annually for
increases in the cost of living) or  $450,000.

 

 

8.2 _Payment  Obligations_.

 

 

8.2.1 If  Executive is an employee of WBC at the Effective Time and is
retained by  Frontier as an employee after the Effective Time, (i) Frontier
will pay  Executive 50% of his Severance Benefit (calculated pursuant to
section 5 of  his  Employment Agreement), less statutory payroll deductions,
in cash upon Closing  of the Merger; and (ii) if Executive remains an
employee of Frontier on the  first anniversary of the Effective Time or
within 12 months after the Change  of  Control, Frontier terminates
Executive's employment other than termination for  Cause, or Executive
terminates his employment with Frontier for Good Reason,  Executive shall
receive the balance of his Severance Benefit, less statutory  payroll
deductions, within 30 days following such anniversary date or the date  of
termination of employment; _provided_ , _however_ , that any amount  in
excess of the Limitation Amount, will be paid to him no sooner than the 
first  day of the seventh calendar month following the termination of his 
employment.

 

 

8.2.2 If  Executive is an employee of WBC at the Effective Time but is not
retained by  Frontier as an employee after the Effective Time, Frontier will
pay Executive  100% of his Severance Benefit (calculated pursuant to section
5 of his  Employment Agreement), less statutory payroll deductions, in cash
upon Closing  of the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that any

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

amount  in excess of the Limitation Amount, will be paid to him no sooner
than the  first  day of the seventh calendar month following the termination
of his  employment.

 

 

8.3 Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if it is
determined by legal counsel  (or other tax advisor to Executive) that the
total of the Severance Benefit,  together with any other payments or benefits
paid by Frontier to Executive,  would constitute an "excess parachute
payment" within the meaning of section  280G of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986 (the "Code"), as amended, and the net  after-tax amount that Executive
would realize from such compensation,  considering Executive's federal and
state income tax brackets and the excise  tax, would be greater if the
compensation payable hereunder were limited, then  the compensation payable
hereunder shall be limited in the manner determined  by  such counsel or
advisor, to maximize Executive's net after-tax  income.

 

 

8.4 Where  required, the provisions of this Agreement are intended to comply
with the  requirements of section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding any other
provision  of  this Agreement, this Agreement shall be interpreted and
administered in  accordance with the requirements of section 409A of the
Code.

 

 

8.5 Any  payment to Executive under Section 8.2 hereof shall be conditioned
upon receipt  by Frontier of an executed release of all claims against
Frontier, satisfactory  to Frontier and its counsel.

 

 

9. **_Miscellaneous  Provisions_**.

 

 

9.1 _Independent  Legal Counsel_. Executive acknowledges that he has had the
opportunity to  review and consult with his own personal legal counsel
regarding this  Agreement.

 

 

9.2 _Binding  Effect_. This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of
Frontier's and  Executive's heirs, legal representatives, successors and
assigns.

 

 

9.3 _Costs  of Legal Actions and Proceedings_. In any dispute between the
parties arising  out of or under this Agreement, whether or not a lawsuit is
commenced, the  nonprevailing party shall pay the prevailing party's
reasonable attorneys' fees  and costs.

 

 

9.4 _Governing  Law_. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with
and governed and  enforced in all respects by the laws of the state of
Washington. The parties  agree that venue of any legal action between the
parties arising out of or  in  connection with this Agreement shall be with
the competent state or federal  court in Washington State, unless otherwise
elected by Frontier, its  successors or assigns.

 

 

9.5 _Entire  Agreement_. This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the
parties with  respect to its subject matter, and supersedes all prior
representations and  understandings, whether oral or written. It may be
changed only by an agreement  in writing signed by the party against whom
enforcement of any waiver,  amendment, modification, extension or discharge
is sought.

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 



 



 

 

9.6 _Waiver_. **** No  waiver of any term, condition or provision shall be
effective for any purpose  whatsoever unless such waiver is in writing and
signed by the  parties.

 

 

9.7 _Severability_.  The provisions of this Agreement are severable. The

any of the Counties; provided,  however, that Executive may acquire and
passively own an interest not exceeding  2% of the total equity interest in

necessary for the protection of  Frontier's Confidential Information (as
defined below), goodwill and other  protectable interests. If a court of
competent jurisdiction should decline  to  enforce any of those covenants
and agreements, Frontier and Executive request  the court to reform these
provisions to restrict Executive's use of Confidential  Information and
Executive's ability to compete with Frontier to the maximum  extent, in time,
scope of activities and geography, that the court finds  enforceable.

 

 

6.2 Executive  acknowledges that Frontier will suffer immediate and
irreparable harm that  will  not be compensable by damages alone, if

4. For this reason, under these  circumstances, Frontier, in addition to and
without limitation of any other  rights, remedies or damages available

Frontier  will not be required to post a bond as a condition for the granting
of this  relief.

 

 

6.3 In  the event Executive breaches this Agreement, which breach is not
corrected  within 15 days of notice by Frontier to Executive of such breach,

Section 6.2,  forfeit all right to receive all benefits or other payments
remaining unpaid  from Frontier pursuant to Section 8.2 or otherwise on the
date of any such  breach.

 

 

7. **_Adequate  Consideration_**.

relocation of Executive's primary  workplace from Oak Harbor to a location
outside Island, San Juan, Snohomish,  Skagit or Whatcom counties.

 

 

8.1.5 "Intellectual  Property" means any material trademarks, service marks,
brand names,  certification marks, trade dress or other indications of
origin, the goodwill  associated with the foregoing and applications in any
jurisdiction to register,  the foregoing, including any extension,
modification or renewal of any such  registration or application; patents,
applications for patents (including  divisions, continuations, continuations
in part and renewal applications),  and  any renewals, extensions or
reissues thereof, in any jurisdiction; trade secrets  and registrations or
applications for registration of copyrights in any  jurisdiction, and any
renewals or extensions thereof.

 

 

8.1.6 "Limitation  Amount" means an amount equal to two times the lesser of
(i) Executive's  annualized compensation based upon the annual rate of pay
for services provided  to Frontier for his taxable year preceding his taxable
year in which his  employment with Frontier terminates (adjusted for any
increase during that  year  that was expected to continue indefinitely if
his employment did not terminate);  or (ii) the maximum amount that may be
taken into account under a qualified  plan  pursuant to section 401(a)(17)
of the Code for the year in which Executive's  employment terminates. For
2007, such maximum amount is two times $225,000  (adjusted annually for
increases in the cost of living) or  $450,000.

 

 

8.2 _Payment  Obligations_.

 

 

8.2.1 If  Executive is an employee of WBC at the Effective Time and is
retained by  Frontier as an employee after the Effective Time, (i) Frontier
will pay  Executive 50% of his Severance Benefit (calculated pursuant to
section 5 of  his  Employment Agreement), less statutory payroll deductions,
in cash upon Closing  of the Merger; and (ii) if Executive remains an
employee of Frontier on the  first anniversary of the Effective Time or
within 12 months after the Change  of  Control, Frontier terminates
Executive's employment other than termination for  Cause, or Executive
terminates his employment with Frontier for Good Reason,  Executive shall
receive the balance of his Severance Benefit, less statutory  payroll
deductions, within 30 days following such anniversary date or the date  of
termination of employment; _provided_ , _however_ , that any amount  in
excess of the Limitation Amount, will be paid to him no sooner than the 
first  day of the seventh calendar month following the termination of his 
employment.

 

 

8.2.2 If  Executive is an employee of WBC at the Effective Time but is not
retained by  Frontier as an employee after the Effective Time, Frontier will
pay Executive  100% of his Severance Benefit (calculated pursuant to section
5 of his  Employment Agreement), less statutory payroll deductions, in cash
upon Closing  of the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that any

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

amount  in excess of the Limitation Amount, will be paid to him no sooner
than the  first  day of the seventh calendar month following the termination
of his  employment.

 

 

8.3 Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if it is
determined by legal counsel  (or other tax advisor to Executive) that the
total of the Severance Benefit,  together with any other payments or benefits
paid by Frontier to Executive,  would constitute an "excess parachute
payment" within the meaning of section  280G of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986 (the "Code"), as amended, and the net  after-tax amount that Executive
would realize from such compensation,  considering Executive's federal and
state income tax brackets and the excise  tax, would be greater if the
compensation payable hereunder were limited, then  the compensation payable
hereunder shall be limited in the manner determined  by  such counsel or
advisor, to maximize Executive's net after-tax  income.

 

 

8.4 Where  required, the provisions of this Agreement are intended to comply
with the  requirements of section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding any other

upon receipt  by Frontier of an executed release of all claims against
Frontier, satisfactory  to Frontier and its counsel.

opportunity to  review and consult with his own personal legal counsel
regarding this  Agreement.

parties with  respect to its subject matter, and supersedes all prior
representations and  understandings, whether oral or written. It may be
changed only by an agreement  in writing signed by the party against whom

**NONCOMPETITION/NONSOLICITATION  AGREEMENT**

 

 

This  Noncompetition/Nonsolicitation Agreement dated September _____, 2007
(this  "Agreement") is entered into by and between FRONTIER FINANCIAL
CORPORATION,  FRONTIER BANK and their subsidiaries (collectively,
"Frontier"), and RICHARD A.  SHIELDS ("Executive").

 

 

**WHEREAS** ,  Frontier, Washington Banking Company ("WBC") and Whidbey
Island Bank ("WBC  Bank") are entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger
("the Merger  Agreement"), pursuant to which WBC will be merged into Frontier
Financial  Corporation and WBC Bank will be merged into Frontier Bank (the
"Merger");  and

 

 

**WHEREAS** ,  Executive is currently employed as Executive Vice President
and Chief Financial  Officer of WBC and/or WBC Bank and has knowledge of
certain Confidential  Information of WBC, and Frontier Financial Corporation
and Frontier Bank are  executing the Merger Agreement conditioned upon
Executive's agreement not to  compete with Frontier in any county in which
WBC Bank has branch offices or  loan  production offices, and not to solicit
employees and customers of Frontier  (including the employees and customers
of WBC who become employees and customers  of Frontier following the Merger),
for a specified period of time following  the  Merger, all as further
described below; and

 

 

**NOW,  THEREFORE** , Frontier and Executive agree as follows:

 

 

1. **_Effective  Time_**. This Agreement shall become effective at the effective time  of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), as set forth in the Merger  Agreement.

 

 

2. **_Noncompetition,  Nonsolicitation and Nondisparagement_** **.** In  consideration for this Agreement and to protect the business and goodwill  purchased by Frontier pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Executive agrees that  he  will not, directly or indirectly, do any of the following:

 

 

2.1 For  a one-year period commencing on the first day after the effective
time of the  Merger (the "Effective Time"), (a) become involved in, as a
principal  shareholder, director, officer, founder, employee, consultant or
other agent  (each of the foregoing relationships, hereinafter referred to as
an "Affiliate")  of any Financial Institution (as defined below) in any of
the Washington state  counties of Island, San Juan, Skagit, Snohomish and
Whatcom (individually and  collectively, the "Counties"), or (b) have any
responsibility for a Financial  Institution's organization or operation in
any of the Counties; provided,  however, that Executive may acquire and
passively own an interest not exceeding  2% of the total equity interest in
any Financial Institution in any of the  Counties that is traded on NASDAQ or
another U.S. stock exchange. For purposes  of this Agreement, the term
"Financial Institution" means any bank holding  company or financial holding
company, state or national bank, state or federal  savings and loan
association, mutual savings bank, or state or federal credit  union, trust
company or mortgage company (including without limitation, any  organizing
entity of any such Financial Institution) located in any of the  Counties.

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 



 



 

 

2.2 For  an 18-month period commencing on the first day after the effective
time of  the  Merger (the "Effective Time"), (a) solicit or attempt to
solicit (i) any  employees of Frontier to leave their employment, or (ii) any
customers of  Frontier to remove or transfer any of their business from
Frontier, or (b)  otherwise interfere with, disrupt or attempt to disrupt the
relationship,  contractual or otherwise, between Frontier and any of
Frontier's customers or  employees. Solicitation prohibited under this
section includes solicitation  by  any means, including, without limitation,
meetings, letters or other mailings,  electronic communications of any kind,
and Internet communications; provided,  however, that solicitation prohibited
under this paragraph does not include  solicitation through general
advertising that is not specifically directed  to or  targeting the
employees of Frontier or Frontier Bank.

 

 

3. **_Nondisparagement_** **. ** Executive shall not, during the term or after the termination or  expiration of this Agreement or Executive's employment, make disparaging  statements, in any form, about Frontier or its officers, directors, agents,  employees, products or services.

 

 

4. **_Intellectual  Property/Confidential Information_**. Further, anything to the  contrary herein notwithstanding, neither Executive nor any firm, company, trust  or other entity of which Executive is an Affiliate shall, during the term or  after the termination or expiration of this Agreement, (i) use, register or  claim any right or interest in any Intellectual Property or Confidential  Information of Frontier, including but not limited to the Intellectual Property  and Confidential Information of WBC acquired pursuant to the Merger Agreement,  or (ii) use the trade name "Washington Banking Company," "Whidbey Island Bank," or any similar name or derivation thereof, in connection with the banking,  financial, lending or mortgage industries.

 

 

5. **_No  Employee Contract Rights_**. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall  be construed to abrogate, limit or affect the powers, rights and privileges  of  Frontier to remove Executive as an employee of Frontier, with or without  cause.

 

 

6. **_Enforcement  of Covenants_**.

 

 

6.1 Frontier  and Executive stipulate that, in light of all of the facts and
circumstances  of  the relationship between Frontier and Executive, the
covenants referred to  in  Sections 2, 3 and 4 (including without limitation
their scope, duration and  geographic extent) are fair and reasonably
necessary for the protection of  Frontier's Confidential Information (as
defined below), goodwill and other  protectable interests. If a court of
competent jurisdiction should decline  to  enforce any of those covenants
and agreements, Frontier and Executive request  the court to reform these
provisions to restrict Executive's use of Confidential  Information and
Executive's ability to compete with Frontier to the maximum  extent, in time,
scope of activities and geography, that the court finds  enforceable.

 

 

6.2 Executive  acknowledges that Frontier will suffer immediate and
irreparable harm that  will  not be compensable by damages alone, if
Executive repudiates or breaches any  of  the provisions of Sections 2, 3 or
4. For this reason, under these  circumstances, Frontier, in addition to and
without limitation of any other  rights, remedies or damages available

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

to  it at law or in equity, will be entitled to obtain temporary, preliminary
and  permanent injunctions in order to prevent or restrain the breach, and
Frontier  will not be required to post a bond as a condition for the granting
of this  relief.

 

 

6.3 In  the event Executive breaches this Agreement, which breach is not
corrected  within 15 days of notice by Frontier to Executive of such breach,
Executive  shall in addition to the remedies available to Frontier under
Section 6.2,  forfeit all right to receive all benefits or other payments
remaining unpaid  from Frontier pursuant to Section 8.2 or otherwise on the
date of any such  breach.

 

 

7. **_Adequate  Consideration_**. Executive specifically acknowledges the receipt of  adequate consideration for the covenants contained in Sections 2, 3 and 4 above  and that Frontier is entitled to require him to comply with said Sections 2,  3  and 4, which Sections will survive termination of this Agreement.

 

 

8. **_Employment  Agreement Superseded_**. Executive's Employment Agreement with WBC  dated as of May 6, 2005 (the "Employment Agreement") is terminated, superseded  and replaced as of the Effective Time by the following provisions:

 

 

8.1 _Definitions_.  The following definitions shall govern and be controlling
for purposes of this  Agreement:

 

 

8.1.1 "Cause"  shall include termination because Executive: (i) materially
breached this  Agreement; (ii) willfully breached or habitually neglected or

determined by legal counsel  (or other tax advisor to Executive) that the

paid by Frontier to Executive,  would constitute an "excess parachute

CORPORATION,  FRONTIER BANK and their subsidiaries (collectively,
"Frontier"), and JOSEPH W.  NIEMER ("Executive").

 

 

**WHEREAS** ,  Frontier, Washington Banking Company ("WBC") and Whidbey
Island Bank ("WBC  Bank") are entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger
("the Merger  Agreement"), pursuant to which WBC will be merged into Frontier
Financial  Corporation and WBC Bank will be merged into Frontier Bank (the

other agent  (each of the foregoing relationships, hereinafter referred to as
an "Affiliate")  of any Financial Institution (as defined below) in any of
the Washington state  counties of Island, San Juan, Skagit, Snohomish and
Whatcom (individually and  collectively, the "Counties"), or (b) have any
responsibility for a Financial  Institution's organization or operation in
any of the Counties; provided,  however, that Executive may acquire and
passively own an interest not exceeding  2% of the total equity interest in
any Financial Institution in any of the  Counties that is traded on NASDAQ or
another U.S. stock exchange. For purposes  of this Agreement, the term
"Financial Institution" means any bank holding  company or financial holding
company, state or national bank, state or federal  savings and loan
association, mutual savings bank, or state or federal credit  union, trust
company or mortgage company (including without limitation, any  organizing
entity of any such Financial Institution) located in any of the  Counties.

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 



 



 

 

2.2 For  an 18-month period commencing on the first day after the effective
time of  the  Merger (the "Effective Time"), (a) solicit or attempt to
solicit (i) any  employees of Frontier to leave their employment, or (ii) any

covenants referred to  in  Sections 2, 3 and 4 (including without limitation

necessary for the protection of  Frontier's Confidential Information (as
defined below), goodwill and other  protectable interests. If a court of
competent jurisdiction should decline  to  enforce any of those covenants
and agreements, Frontier and Executive request  the court to reform these
provisions to restrict Executive's use of Confidential  Information and
Executive's ability to compete with Frontier to the maximum  extent, in time,
scope of activities and geography, that the court finds  enforceable.

 

 

6.2 Executive  acknowledges that Frontier will suffer immediate and
irreparable harm that  will  not be compensable by damages alone, if
Executive repudiates or breaches any  of  the provisions of Sections 2, 3 or
4. For this reason, under these  circumstances, Frontier, in addition to and

to  it at law or in equity, will be entitled to obtain temporary, preliminary
and  permanent injunctions in order to prevent or restrain the breach, and
Frontier  will not be required to post a bond as a condition for the granting
of this  relief.

 

 

6.3 In  the event Executive breaches this Agreement, which breach is not
corrected  within 15 days of notice by Frontier to Executive of such breach,
Executive  shall in addition to the remedies available to Frontier under
Section 6.2,  forfeit all right to receive all benefits or other payments
remaining unpaid  from Frontier pursuant to Section 8.2 or otherwise on the
date of any such  breach.

 

 

7. **_Adequate  Consideration_**. Executive specifically acknowledges the receipt of  adequate consideration for the covenants contained in Sections 2, 3 and 4 above  and that Frontier is entitled to require him to comply with said Sections 2,  3  and 4, which Sections will survive termination of this Agreement.

 

 

8. **_Employment  Agreement Superseded_**. Executive's Employment Agreement with WBC  dated as of September 28, 2005 (the "Employment Agreement") is terminated,  superseded and replaced as of the Effective Time by the following  provisions:

 

 

8.1 _Definitions_.  The following definitions shall govern and be controlling
for purposes of this  Agreement:

 

 

8.1.1 "Cause"  shall include termination because Executive: (i) materially
breached this  Agreement; (ii) willfully breached or habitually neglected or
breached the  duties which he was required to perform under the terms of his
employment with  Frontier or the policies of Frontier; (iii) commits act(s)
of dishonesty, theft,  embezzlement, fraud or misrepresentation against

comply with any law, rule, or  regulation (other than traffic violations or

having jurisdiction over Frontier;  (v)  fails to follow the reasonable
directions of Frontier's board of directors,  which failure is not corrected
within thirty (30) days after receipt by  Executive of written notice
outlining the corrective action required; or (vi)  knowingly provides
misleading or false information to shareholders, the board  of  directors,
auditors, accountants, or regulatory authorities.

 

 

8.1.2 "Change  of Control" means the Merger.

 

 

8.1.3 "Confidential  Information" includes, without limitation, any

8.1.4 "Good  Reason" shall include, but not be limited to: (i) a material
reduction in  Executive's compensation defined as a reduction equal to or
greater than five  percent (5%) of Executive's then annual base salary, which
reduction is not of  general application to substantially all employees of
Frontier, (ii) a material  reduction in Executive's duties, responsibilities,
or reporting relationship,  but not merely a change in title, or (iii)
relocation of Executive's primary  workplace from Oak Harbor to a location
outside Island, San Juan, Snohomish,  Skagit or Whatcom counties.

 

 

8.1.5 "Intellectual  Property" means any material trademarks, service marks,
brand names,  certification marks, trade dress or other indications of
origin, the goodwill  associated with the foregoing and applications in any
jurisdiction to register,  the foregoing, including any extension,

8.1.6 "Limitation  Amount" means an amount equal to two times the lesser of
(i) Executive's  annualized compensation based upon the annual rate of pay
for services provided  to Frontier for his taxable year preceding his taxable
year in which his  employment with Frontier terminates (adjusted for any
increase during that  year  that was expected to continue indefinitely if
his employment did not terminate);  or (ii) the maximum amount that may be
taken into account under a qualified  plan  pursuant to section 401(a)(17)

increases in the cost of living) or  $450,000.

 

 

8.2 _Payment  Obligations_.

 

 

8.2.1 If  Executive is an employee of WBC at the Effective Time and is
retained by  Frontier as an employee after the Effective Time, (i) Frontier
will pay  Executive 50% of his Severance Benefit (calculated pursuant to
section 5 of  his  Employment Agreement), less statutory payroll deductions,
in cash upon Closing  of the Merger; and (ii) if Executive remains an
employee of Frontier on the  first anniversary of the Effective Time or
within 12 months after the Change  of  Control, Frontier terminates
Executive's employment other than termination for  Cause, or Executive
terminates his employment with Frontier for Good Reason,  Executive shall
receive the balance of his Severance Benefit, less statutory  payroll
deductions, within 30 days following such anniversary date or the date  of
termination of employment; _provided_ , _however_ , that any amount  in
excess of the Limitation Amount, will be paid to him no sooner than the 
first  day of the seventh calendar month following the termination of his 
employment.

 

 

8.2.2 If  Executive is an employee of WBC at the Effective Time but is not
retained by  Frontier as an employee after the Effective Time, Frontier will
pay Executive  100% of his Severance Benefit (calculated pursuant to section
5 of his  Employment Agreement), less statutory payroll deductions, in cash
upon Closing  of the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that any

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

amount  in excess of the Limitation Amount, will be paid to him no sooner
than the  first  day of the seventh calendar month following the termination
of his  employment.

 

 

8.3 Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if it is
determined by legal counsel  (or other tax advisor to Executive) that the
total of the Severance Benefit,  together with any other payments or benefits
paid by Frontier to Executive,  would constitute an "excess parachute
payment" within the meaning of section  280G of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986 (the "Code"), as amended, and the net  after-tax amount that Executive
would realize from such compensation,  considering Executive's federal and
state income tax brackets and the excise  tax, would be greater if the
compensation payable hereunder were limited, then  the compensation payable
hereunder shall be limited in the manner determined  by  such counsel or
advisor, to maximize Executive's net after-tax  income.

 

 

8.4 Where  required, the provisions of this Agreement are intended to comply
with the  requirements of section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding any other
provision  of  this Agreement, this Agreement shall be interpreted and
administered in  accordance with the requirements of section 409A of the
Code.

 

 

8.5 Any  payment to Executive under Section 8.2 hereof shall be conditioned
upon receipt  by Frontier of an executed release of all claims against
Frontier, satisfactory  to Frontier and its counsel.

 

 

9. **_Miscellaneous  Provisions_**.

 

 

9.1 _Independent  Legal Counsel_. Executive acknowledges that he has had the
opportunity to  review and consult with his own personal legal counsel
regarding this  Agreement.

 

 

9.2 _Binding  Effect_. This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of
Frontier's and  Executive's heirs, legal representatives, successors and
assigns.

 

 

9.3 _Costs  of Legal Actions and Proceedings_. In any dispute between the
parties arising  out of or under this Agreement, whether or not a lawsuit is
commenced, the  nonprevailing party shall pay the prevailing party's
reasonable attorneys' fees  and costs.

 

 

9.4 _Governing  Law_. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with
and governed and  enforced in all respects by the laws of the state of
Washington. The parties  agree that venue of any legal action between the
parties arising out of or  in  connection with this Agreement shall be with
the competent state or federal  court in Washington state, unless otherwise
elected by Frontier, its successors  or assigns.

 

 

9.5 _Entire  Agreement_. This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the
parties with  respect to its subject matter, and supersedes all prior
representations and  understandings, whether oral or written. It may be
changed only by an agreement  in writing signed by the party against whom
enforcement of any waiver,  amendment, modification, extension or discharge
is sought.

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 



 



 

 

9.6 _Waiver_. **** No  waiver of any term, condition or provision shall be
effective for any purpose  whatsoever unless such waiver is in writing and
signed by the  parties.

 

 

9.7 _Severability_.  The provisions of this Agreement are severable. The
invalidity of any provision  will not affect the validity of other provisions
of this Agreement.

 

 

9.8 _Notice_.  Any notice to be delivered under this Agreement shall be given

addressed to  Frontier or to Executive at their last known address.

counterparts, each of which will  be deemed an original, but all of which
taken together will constitute one  and  the same instrument.

 

 

IN  WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have set their hands as of the date
first  written above.

Frontier  Financial Corporation

 

332  S.W. Everett Mall Way

 

P.O.  Box 2215

 

Everett,  WA 98203

 



 

Ladies  and Gentlemen:

 



 

I  have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed an
"affiliate" of  Washington Banking Company ("WBC"), as the term "affiliate"
is defined for  purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the rules
and regulations  (the "Rules and Regulations") under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the "Act"). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan
of Merger among Frontier  Financial Corporation ("Frontier"), Frontier, WBC
and Whidbey Island Bank (the "Agreement"), WBC will be merged into Frontier
(the "Merger"). As a result of  the Merger, I will receive shares of common
stock of Frontier ("Frontier Common  Stock") in exchange for shares of common
stock of WBC ("WBC Common Stock") owned  by me.

 



 

In  connection with the above, I represent and warrant to Frontier and
agree  that:

 



 

A. I  will not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of the shares of
Frontier  Common Stock that I receive in the Merger in violation of the Act
or the Rules  and Regulations.

 



 

B. I  have no present plan or intent to dispose of Frontier Common Stock
acquired  by  me pursuant to the Merger.

 



 

C. I  have been advised that the issuance of shares of Frontier Common Stock
to me  pursuant to the Merger has been or will be registered with the
Securities and  Exchange Commission under the Act on Form S-4. I have also
been advised,  however, that since I may be deemed to be an affiliate of WBC
at the time the  Agreement is submitted for a vote of the shareholders of
WBC, I may not sell,  transfer or otherwise dispose of the shares of Frontier
Common Stock issued  to  me in the Merger unless (i) such sale, transfer or
other disposition has been  registered under the Act, (ii) such sale,
transfer or other disposition is  made  in conformity with the volume and
other limitations of Rule 145 under the Act,  or (iii) in the opinion of
counsel acceptable to Frontier, some other exemption  from registration under
the Act is available with respect to any such proposed  sale, transfer or
other disposition of the shares of Frontier Common  Stock.

 



 

D. I  have carefully read this letter and the Agreement and have discussed
their  requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell,
transfer  or otherwise dispose of the shares of Frontier Common Stock, to the
extent  I  felt necessary, with my counsel or counsel for WBC.

 



 

E. I  understand that Frontier is under no obligation to register the shares
of  Frontier Common Stock for sale, transfer or other disposition by me or on
my  behalf under the Act or to take any other action necessary in order to
make  compliance with an exemption from registration available, except that
Frontier  has agreed to use its best efforts to maintain the availability of
Rule 145  for  use by affiliates such as me.

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 



 



 



 

F. I  understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to the
registrar of  the  certificates for the shares of Frontier Common Stock and
there will be placed  on  the certificates for the shares of Frontier Common
Stock, or any substitutions  therefore, legends stating in substance:

 



 

The  shares represented by this certificate were issued in a merger (the
acquisition  of Washington Banking Company) to which Rule 145 promulgated
under the  Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), applies and may be
sold or  otherwise transferred only in compliance with the limitation of such
Rule 145,  or upon receipt by Frontier of an opinion of counsel acceptable to
it that  some  other exemption from registration under the Act is available,
or pursuant to  a  registration statement under the Act.

 



 

G. I  hereby agree that, for a period of one (1) year following the effective
date  of  the Merger, I will obtain an agreement similar to this agreement
from each  transferee of the shares of Frontier Common Stock sold or
otherwise transferred  by me, but only if such transfer is effected other
than in a merger involving  a  registered public offering or as a sale
pursuant to Rule 145.

 



 

It  is understood and agreed the legend set forth in Paragraph F above will
be  removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such legend if
such  legend is not required for purposes of the Act or this Agreement. It
is  understood that such legend and stop order referred to above will be
removed  if  (i) one year shall have elapsed from the date the undersigned
acquired Frontier  Common Stock received in the Merger and the provisions of
Rule 145(d)(2) are  then available to the undersigned; (ii) two years shall
have elapsed from the  date the undersigned acquired Frontier Common Stock
received in the Merger  and  the provisions of Rule 145(d)(3) are then
available to the undersigned; or  (iii)  Frontier has received either an
opinion of counsel, which opinion and counsel  shall be reasonably
satisfactory to Frontier, or a "no action" letter obtained  by the
undersigned from the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission,  to 
the effect that the restrictions imposed by Rule 145 under the Act no longer 
apply to the undersigned.

 



 

This  letter agreement shall be binding on my heirs, legal representatives
and  successors.

 



 

Very  truly yours,

Ladies  and Gentlemen:

 



 

We  have acted as counsel to Frontier Financial Corporation ("Frontier") and
its  subsidiaries (collectively "Frontier"), in connection with the Agreement
and  Plan of Merger (the "Agreement"), dated as of September _____, 2007,
between  Frontier, Frontier Bank, Washington Banking Company and Whidbey
Island Bank,  and  the transactions contemplated by the Agreement.

 

 

This  firm has represented Frontier and Frontier Bank in connection with
the  negotiation of the Agreement and matters related to such negotiation and
with  respect to certain limited matters as to which we have been consulted
by them.  We are familiar with the corporate proceedings taken by Frontier
and Frontier  Bank in connection with the Agreement, and we are rendering
this opinion  pursuant to Section 7.3(D) of the Agreement. Capitalized terms
used, but not  defined, in this opinion letter shall have the meanings
assigned to them in  the  Agreement.

 

 

In  rendering the opinions expressed below, we have examined and relied upon
such  records, documents, instruments, certificates of public officials and 
certificates of officers and employees of and accountants for Frontier and 
Frontier Bank as we have deemed appropriate, including:

existence  or authorization dated ______________, 2007, issued by the
Washington Department  of Financial Institutions with respect to Frontier
Bank.

 

 

Whenever  any statement in this opinion letter is qualified by the phrase "to
our  knowledge" or "known to us" or similar phrases, it is intended to
indicate that,  during the course of our representation of Frontier in
connection with the  transactions contemplated by the Agreement, no
information that would give  us  actual knowledge of the inaccuracy of such
statement has come to the attention  of the attorneys presently in this firm
who are actively engaged in the  representation of Frontier. We have not
undertaken any independent investigation  or review (including any
investigation or review of our files) in connection  with any such matters to
determine the accuracy of any such statement, and  any  limited inquiry
undertaken by us during the preparation of this opinion letter  should not be
regarded as such investigation or review.

 

 

In  conducting our examination, we have assumed, without investigation, the 
genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the 
correctness of all certificates, the authenticity of all documents and 
instruments submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original
documents  and instruments of all such documents and instruments submitted to
us as  certified or photostatic or facsimile copies and the authenticity of
the  originals of such copies, and the accuracy and completeness of all
records  made  available to us by Frontier. We also have assumed, without
investigation, that  (i) each party to such documents and instruments has the
power and capacity  to  execute, deliver and perform all of its obligations
under the documents and  instruments, has duly authorized the execution,
delivery and performance of  its  obligations under the Agreement, and has
duly executed and delivered the  documents and instruments; (ii) all terms,
provisions, and conditions of, or  relating to, the Agreement are correctly
and completely reflected in the  Agreement, and all statements,
representations, and warranties as to factual  matters made by officers and
employees of and accountants for, Frontier and  by  public officials are
accurate; and (iii) the Agreement is binding upon and  enforceable in
accordance with its terms against Washington Banking Company  and  Whidbey
Island Bank.

 

 

The  opinions expressed below are subject to the following  qualifications:

 

 

A. Our  opinion as to the legal, valid and binding nature of the Agreement
and the  enforceability of the Agreement in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 below is
subject to  the  following: (i) the effect of applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization,  receivership, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium
or other similar laws affecting  the rights of creditors generally, including
without limitation such laws and/or  regulations specifically applicable to
institutions the deposits of which are  insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation ("Insured Institutions"),  now or subsequently in
effect; (ii) limitations imposed by laws and judicial  decisions relating to
or affecting creditors of Insured Institutions, or by  general principles of
equity (regardless of whether enforcement is considered  in  proceedings at
law or in equity), upon the provisions of the Agreement and/or  the other
related documents or upon the availability of injunctive relief or  other
equitable remedies; and (iii) our assumption that Washington Banking  Company
and Whidbey Island Bank and any of their successors in interest will  seek to
enforce any of its rights

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

in  connection with the Agreement only in circumstances and in a manner in
which  it  is commercially reasonable to do so.

 

 

B. We  express no opinion as to: (i) the enforceability of any provision or 
accumulation of provisions that may be deemed to be unconscionable; (ii) any 
antitrust, securities or tax laws; (iii) provisions that purport to
establish  evidentiary standards; (iv) provisions relating to venue,
jurisdiction,  governing law, waiver of remedies (or the delay or omission of
enforcement  of  such provisions), or disclaimers or liability limitations
with respect to third  parties; (v) the enforceability of any requirement in
the Agreement or related  documents specifying that provisions of such
documents may only be waived in  writing, to the extent that an oral
agreement or an implied agreement by trade  practice or course of conduct has
been created modifying any provision of the  Agreement; (vi) provisions for
payment or reimbursement of costs and expenses  (including, without
limitation, attorneys fees) in excess of statutory limits  or  amounts
determined to be reasonable by any court or other tribunal, and any 
provision for payment of attorneys fees other than to the prevailing party; 
(vii) severability and indemnification provisions; (viii) availability of 
equitable remedies; and (ix) any reservation of the right to pursue
inconsistent  or cumulative remedies.

 

 

C. Our  opinions below are limited to the matters expressly set forth in this
opinion  letter, and no opinion is to be implied or may be inferred beyond
the matters  expressly so stated.

 

 

D. We  disclaim any obligation to update this opinion letter for events
occurring  after  the date of this opinion letter.

 

 

E. Our  opinions below are limited to the effect of the laws of the United
States of  America and the State of Washington. We express no opinion with
respect to  the  effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction on the
transactions contemplated  by  the Agreement.

 

 

F. A  Washington court, or federal court applying Washington law, may
consider  extrinsic evidence or the circumstances surrounding the making of
the Agreement  to ascertain the intent of the parties using the language
employed in the  Agreement, regardless of whether or not the language used is
plain and  unambiguous on its face, and may incorporate additional or
supplementary terms  into the Agreement.

 

 

Based  upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:

 

 

1. Frontier  is a corporation validly existing under the laws of the State of Washington  and  has the corporate power to own or lease its properties and assets and to carry  on its business as such properties, assets and business are described in the  Proxy Statement.

 

 

2. Frontier  Bank is a banking corporation validly existing under the laws of the State  of  Washington and has the corporate power to own or lease its properties and assets  and to carry on its business as such properties, assets and business are  described in the Proxy Statement.

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 



 



 

 

3. The  execution and delivery of the Agreement and the consummation of the Merger  have  been duly and validly authorized by the Boards of Directors of Frontier and  Frontier Bank.

 

 

4. The  Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Frontier and Frontier  Bank, enforceable against Frontier and Frontier Bank in accordance with its  terms.

 

 

5. No  consent or approval that has not already been obtained from any federal or  state  regulatory authority is required for the execution and delivery by Frontier  and  Frontier Bank of the Agreement or any of the documents to be executed and  delivered by Frontier and Frontier Bank in connection with the Agreement or  for  the consummation of the Merger.

 

 

6. Neither  the execution delivery or performance of the Agreement by Frontier and Frontier  Bank nor the consummation of the Merger will: (a) violate any provision of  the  articles or bylaws of Frontier or Frontier Bank; or (b) to our knowledge,  violate any order, judgment or decree to which Frontier or Frontier Bank is  a  party or by which any of its properties or assets is bound.

 

 

7. The  shares of Frontier Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Agreement to the  shareholders of Washington Banking Company will, upon issuance in accordance  with the Agreement, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and  non-assessable and issued in compliance with all registration requirements  or  exemptions there from under applicable federal and state securities  laws.

 

 

8. The  Registration Statement registering the shares of Frontier Common Stock to be  issued to shareholders of Washington Banking Company pursuant to the Agreement  has become effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and, to our knowledge, no stop order suspending the  effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and, to our  knowledge, no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending  or contemplated by the Securities and Exchange Commission or any state  securities or other regulatory authority.

 

 

9. To  our knowledge there is no suit, action, investigation or proceeding, legal,  quasi-judicial, administrative or otherwise, pending or threatened against,  or  affecting Frontier or Frontier Bank or any of their directors, officers,  employees or agents, acting in their capacities as such, that is seeking  equitable relief or damages against Frontier or Frontier Bank or any of their  directors, officers, employees or agents acting in their capacities that would  materially affect the ability of Frontier or Frontier Bank to consummate the  transactions contemplated by the Agreement or that seeks to enjoin consummation  of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement.

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 



 



 

 

In  the course of the preparation of the Proxy Statement, we have considered
the  information set forth in the Proxy Statement, and have participated in 
conferences with officers and other representatives of Frontier and Frontier 
Bank, during the course of which the contents of the Proxy Statement and
related  matters were discussed. We have not independently checked the
accuracy or  completeness of, or otherwise verified, and accordingly are not
passing upon,  and do not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy,
completeness or fairness  of the statements contained in the Proxy Statement.
We have relied as to  materiality upon the judgment of officers and
representatives of Frontier and  Frontier Bank. On the basis of the
foregoing, we confirm that nothing has come  to our attention that would lead
us to believe that the Proxy Statement, insofar  as it relates to Frontier
and Frontier Bank, on the mailing date of the Proxy  Statement, contained any
statement that, at the time and in light of the  circumstances in which it
was made, was false or misleading with respect to  any  material fact or
omitted to state any material fact necessary to make such  statements not
false or misleading. We make no statement with respect to (a)  material in
the Proxy Statement insofar as it includes or reflects any  information
relating to or supplied by entities other than Frontier and Frontier  Bank,
or (b) any financial statements or other financial or accounting data 
contained in the Proxy Statement.

 

 

The  foregoing is rendered solely for your benefit in connection with the 
above-described transactions. You may not, without our prior express written 
approval, deliver copies of this letter or extracts from it to any other
person,  and no one other than you is entitled to rely upon this opinion 
letter.

 

 

Very  truly yours,

Ladies  and Gentlemen:

 

 

We  have acted as counsel to Washington Banking Company and Whidbey Island
Bank  (collectively "WBC") in connection with the Agreement and Plan of

**B. Assumptions**

 

 

For  purposes of this opinion letter, we have relied on the following 
assumptions:

 



 

        

    |  

B-1

    |  

All  conditions precedent to the Closing have been satisfied or waived  and
all  the representations and warranties contained in the Agreement are 
accurate.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 



 

        

    |  

B-2

    |  

Our  opinions in C-1 and C-2 as to the valid existence and good standing  of
WBC  and WBC Bank are based exclusively on certificates of public 
officials.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 



 

        

    |  

B-3

    |  

Our  opinion in C-7 are based upon, and assume the accuracy of, WBC's and
WBC  Bank's representations contained in the Agreement and of the books and 
records of WBC and WBC Bank supplied to us, including, without limitation, 
the stock ledger, options ledger, and minutes of meetings (or consents  in 
lieu of minutes) of the directors and shareholders of WBC and WBC  Bank. We
acknowledge, with your concurrence, that we have not  been requested to
conduct an independent investigation of the books  and  records of WBC and
WBC Bank with respect to our  opinions.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 



 

        

    |  

B-4

    |  

Our  opinions in C-7 relating to the fully paid status of the issued and 
outstanding shares of capital stock of WBC and WBC Bank and of the  common 
stock are based, without independent verification by us, on the  certificate
of the Chief Executive Officer of WBC and WBC Bank (the  "Opinion
Certificate"), to the effect that WBC and WBC Bank has received  the
consideration approved by its

    
---|---|--- 
    

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

Board  of Directors for all of the issued shares of capital stock of WBC and
WBC  Bank.

Whenever  any statement in this opinion letter is qualified by the phrase "to
our  knowledge" or "known to us" or similar phrases, it is intended to
indicate that,  during the course of our representation of WBC in connection
with the  transactions contemplated by the Agreement, no information that
would give  us  actual knowledge of the inaccuracy of such statement has
come to the attention  of Marcus J. Williams, Sandy Gallagher-Alford, Laura
Baumann or Ame Lewis.  We  have not undertaken any independent investigation
or review (including any  investigation or review of our files) in connection
with any such matters to  determine the accuracy of any such statement, and
any limited inquiry undertaken  by us during the preparation of this opinion
letter should not be regarded  as  such investigation or review.

 

 

In  conducting our examination, we have assumed, without investigation, the 
genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the 
correctness of all certificates, the authenticity of all documents and 
instruments submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original
documents  and instruments of all such documents and instruments submitted to
us as  certified or photostatic or facsimile copies and the authenticity of
the  originals of such copies, and the accuracy and completeness of all
records  made  available to us by WBC. We also have assumed, without
investigation, that  (i) each party to such documents and instruments has the
power and capacity  to execute, deliver and perform all of its obligations
under the documents  and  instruments, has duly authorized the execution,
delivery and performance of  its  obligations under the Agreement, and has
duly executed and delivered such  documents and instruments; (ii) all terms,
provisions, and conditions of,  or relating to, the Agreement are correctly
and completely reflected in the  Agreement, and all statements,
representations, and warranties as to factual  matters made by officers and
employees of, and accountants for, WBC and by  public officials are accurate,
and (iii) the Agreement is binding upon and  enforceable in accordance with
its terms against Frontier and Frontier  Bank.

The  opinions expressed above are subject to the following  qualifications:

 

 

        

    |  

D-1

    |  

Our  opinion as to the legal, valid and binding nature and the
enforceability  of the Agreement in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 above is subject to
the  following: (i) the effect of applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, 
reorganization, receivership, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or  other 
similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally, including  without
limitation such laws and/or regulations specifically applicable  to 
institutions the deposits of which are insured by the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation ("Insured Institutions"), now or subsequently in 
effect; (ii) limitations imposed by laws and judicial decisions  relating to
or affecting creditors of Insured Institutions, or by  general  principles
of equity (regardless of

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

whether  enforcement is considered in proceedings at law or in equity), upon
the  provisions of the Agreement and/or the other related documents or upon
the  availability of injunctive relief or other equitable remedies; and 
(iii) our assumption that Frontier, Frontier Bank and any of their 
successors in interest will seek to enforce any of its rights in connection 
with  the Agreement only in circumstances and in a manner in which it is
commercially  reasonable to do so.

accumulation of provisions that may be deemed to be unconscionable;  (ii) any
antitrust, securities or tax laws; (iii) provisions  that purport to

of enforcement of such provisions), or disclaimers  or  liability
limitations with respect to third parties; (v) the  enforceability of any
requirement in the Agreement or related documents  specifying that provisions
of such documents may only be waived in  writing, to the extent that an oral
agreement or an implied agreement  by  trade practice or course of conduct
has been created modifying any  provision of the Agreement; (vi) provisions
for payment or  reimbursement of costs and expenses (including, without

D-3

    |  

Our  opinions below are limited to the matters expressly set forth in 
this  opinion letter, and no opinion is to be implied or may be inferred

    |

---|---|--- 
    

 



 

        

    |  

D-5

    |  

A  Washington court, or federal court applying Washington law, may consider 
extrinsic evidence of the circumstances surrounding the making of  the 
Agreement to ascertain the intent of the parties using the language  employed
in the Agreement, regardless of whether or not the language  used  is plain
and unambiguous on its face, and may incorporate additional  or 
supplementary terms into the  Agreement.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

**E. Certain  Factual Matters**

 

 

In  the course of the preparation of the Proxy Statement, we have considered
the  information set forth in the Proxy Statement, and have participated in 
conferences with officers and other representatives of WBC and WBC Bank,
during  the course of which the contents of the Proxy

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

Statement  and related matters were discussed; however, we were not directed
to establish,  and we did not independently establish, matters of fact.

 

 

The  preparation of the Proxy Statement involved many determinations of fact,
points  of information or other non-legal matters, and we did not
independently verify,  and do not assume any responsibility for, the
accuracy, completeness or fairness  of the Proxy Statement. As used in this
Part E, when a statement is qualified  by  the term " _material_ ," such
statements involve judgments and opinions as to  the materiality or lack of
materiality of any matter related to WBC's or WBC  Bank's business, assets,
results of operations or financial condition that are  entirely those of WBC,
WBC Bank and its officers, after having been advised  by  us as to the legal
effect and consequences of such matters, and such opinions  and judgments are
not known to us to be incorrect. We offer no assurance that  the actions
taken in connection with the preparation and review of the Proxy  Statement
were sufficient to cause the Proxy Statement to be accurate, complete  or
fair.

 

 

Based  upon our procedures identified above (relying as to matters of fact to
a large  extent on statements of officers and other representatives of WBC
and WBC Bank)  and without expressing an opinion thereon, nothing has come to
our attention  that has caused us to conclude that the Proxy Statement (as of
the time it  was  declared effective), contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or  omitted to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary  in  order to make the statements therein not
misleading. We make no statement with  respect to (a) material in the Proxy
Statement insofar as it includes or  reflects any information relating to or
supplied by entities other than WBC  or  WBC Bank, or (b) any financial
statements or other financial or accounting  data  contained in the Proxy
Statement.

 

 

The  foregoing is rendered solely for your benefit in connection with the 
above-described transactions. You may not, without our prior express written 
approval, deliver copies of this letter or extracts from this letter to any 
other person, and no one other than you is entitled to rely upon the
opinions  set forth above.

 

 

Very  truly yours,

Re:

**Corporate  Merger/Tax Consequences**

    
---|---|--- 
    

 



 

Ladies  and Gentlemen:

 



 

This  letter responds to your request for our opinion as to  certain of the
federal income tax consequences of the proposed merger (the  "Merger") of
Washington Banking Company ("WBC") into Frontier Financial  Corporation
("Frontier") in exchange for cash and Frontier common stock. The  time at
which the Merger becomes effective is hereafter referred to as the 
"Effective Date." This opinion is being delivered in connection with
Frontier's  registration statement on Form S-4 relating to the proposed
Merger (the "Registration Statement") to which this opinion appears as an 
exhibit.

 

 

We  have acted as legal counsel to Frontier in connection with the Merger. In
acting  as counsel to Frontier in connection with the Merger, we have, in
preparing  our  opinion, as hereinafter set forth, participated in the
preparation of the Merger  Agreement and the preparation and filing of the
Registration Statement. For  the  purpose of rendering this opinion, we have
examined and relied upon originals,  certified copies, or copies otherwise
identified to our satisfaction as being  true copies of the originals of the
following documents, including all exhibits  and schedules attached to them:

 

 

        

1.

    |  

The  Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of September _____, 2007,
between  Frontier, Frontier Bank, WBC and Whidbey Island Bank (the "Merger 
Agreement").

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

        

2.

    |  

Form S-4  Registration Statement and Prospectus of Frontier filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission on or about _______________,  2007.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

        

3.

    |  

The  Proxy Statement of WBC (included as part of the Registration 
Statement).

    
---|--- 
    

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 



 



 

 

        

4.

    |  

Such  other documents, instruments, records and information pertaining  to
the  Merger as we have deemed necessary for rendering our  opinion.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

We  have assumed, without independent investigation or review, the accuracy
and  completeness of the facts and representations and warranties contained
in those  documents or otherwise made known to us through the Effective Date
of the  Merger, and that the Merger will be effected in accordance with the
terms of  the  Merger Agreement.

 

 

Our  opinion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code"),  Treasury Regulations, administrative interpretations, and judicial
precedents  as  of the date hereof. If there is any subsequent change in the
applicable law  or  regulations, or if there are subsequently any new
applicable administrative  or  judicial interpretations of the law or
regulations, or if there are any changes  in the facts or circumstances
surrounding the Merger, the opinion expressed  herein may become
inapplicable.

 

 

Based  upon our review of the facts described above and our analysis of the
law, and  subject to the qualifications and limitations set forth herein, and
the  completion of the transactions described in the manner contemplated by
the  Merger Agreement, it is our opinion that:

 

 

A. The  Merger will be treated as a reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(A)
of the  Code and Frontier and WBC will each be a party to that reorganization
within  the  meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code; provided, however, that
at least fifty  percent (50%) of the sum of (1) the Aggregate Consideration
(as defined in  section 1.3(A) of the Merger Agreement) payable in cash and
Frontier common  stock to the WBC shareholders in the Merger and (2) any
additional cash paid  to  holders of dissenting shares pursuant to Section
1.6 of the Merger Agreement,  is  paid in Frontier common stock.

 

 

B. Provided  the Merger satisfies the condition in the foregoing paragraph
that at least  50%  of the total consideration for the Merger is paid in
Frontier common stock,  it  is further our opinion that the material federal
income tax consequences of  the  Merger will be:

 

 

1. _Parties_.  No gain or loss will be recognized by Frontier or WBC as a result of the  Merger.

 

 

2. _Shareholders  of WBC_. We hereby confirm our opinion set forth in the discussion contained  in the Registration Statement under the caption "The Merger - Certain Federal  Income Tax Consequences".

 

 

We  express our opinion herein only as to those matters specifically set
forth  above  and no opinion should be inferred as to the tax consequences
of the Merger  under  any state, local or foreign law, or with respect to
other areas of United States  federal taxation. We are members of

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

the  Bar of the State of Washington, and we do not express any opinion
herein  concerning any law other than the federal law of the United States.

 

 

Our  opinion is intended solely for the benefit of Frontier and WBC, and
their  respective shareholders, and may not be relied upon for any other
purpose or  by  any other person or entity or made available to any other
person or entity  without our prior written consent.

 

 

We  hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the
Registration  Statement and the reference to us in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus under the  heading "The Merger - Certain Federal Income
Tax Consequences" and "Legal  Opinions." By giving the foregoing consent, we
do not admit that we come within  the category of persons whose consent is
required under Section 7 of the  Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the
rules and regulations of the  Securities and Exchange Commission there under.

 

 

Sincerely,
