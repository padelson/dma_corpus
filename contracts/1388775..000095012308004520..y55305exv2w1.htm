     ##### 

  

    

1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), and will be issued in reliance
upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public
offering. Parent and Purchaser represent and warrant to the Company that
Purchaser is, and will be upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, an "accredited
investor" (as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under
the Securities Act). Purchaser agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up
Shares to be acquired upon exercise thereof are being and will be acquired
for the purpose of investment and not with a view to or for resale in
connection with any distribution thereof within the meaning of the
Securities Act.

Any notice which the Company shall deliver to the holders of Options or Restricted Stock or the participants in any other Company Plan setting forth such holders rights pursuant to this Agreement shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent. 

   

 SECTION 3.3. _Dissenting Shares_. (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by holders of Shares that have properly demanded and perfected their rights to be paid the fair value of such Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and the holders thereof shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or shall effectively waive, withdraw or lose such holders rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, such holders Shares shall not constitute Dissenting Shares and instead shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted, at the Effective Time, into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, as set forth in Section 3.1 of this Agreement, without any interest thereon. 

   

 (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) reasonably prompt notice of any appraisal demands received by the Company, withdrawals thereof and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and received by the Company, and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL.

Such funds may be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; provided, that such investments shall be in short-term obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days or guaranteed by the United States of America and 

    ##### 

  

    

backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America or in
commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively. Any interest or
income produced by such investments will be payable to the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as Parent directs. 

   

 (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of an outstanding certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (the " _Certificates_ "), a form of letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates for payment of the Merger Consideration therefor. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate, and such Certificate shall then be canceled. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates on the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Certificates. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.4(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article III. 

   

 (c) At any time following the date that is six (6) months after the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) which have been made available to the Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of Shares for the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (d) After the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares that were outstanding prior to the Effective Time. After the Effective Time, Certificates presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer shall be canceled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth in, this Article III. 

   

 (e) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the holders compliance with the replacement requirements established by the Paying 

    ##### 

  

    

Agent, including, if necessary, the posting by the holder of a bond in
customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to the Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange
for the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Shares represented by such
Certificate pursuant to this Article III. 

   

 SECTION 3.5. _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to the Offer, the Merger or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement any amount as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax Laws. To the extent that amounts are so properly withheld by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, and are paid to the appropriate Governmental Entity in accordance with applicable Law, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares or other Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

 Except as set forth in the correspondingly numbered Section of the disclosure schedule delivered by Parent and Purchaser to the Company prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure Schedule_ ") (provided, however, that a matter disclosed with respect to one representation or warranty shall also be deemed to disclosed with respect to each other representation or warranty to which the matter disclosed reasonably relates, but only to the extent such relationship is reasonably apparent on the face of the disclosure contained in the Parent Disclosure Schedule with respect to such matter), Parent and Purchaser, jointly and severally, hereby represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

Purchaser was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and has engaged in no business activities except as contemplated by this Agreement.

State of the State of Delaware of the Certificate of Merger as required by
the DGCL). This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
Parent and Purchaser and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery
hereof by the Company, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of
each of Parent and Purchaser enforceable against each of Parent and Purchaser
in accordance with its terms, subject to the effects of bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other
similar laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally, general

Proposal. The Company shall provide Parent promptly (and in any event within

copy of such Acquisition Proposal, indication, inquiry or request (or, where
such Acquisition Proposal is not in writing, a description of the material
terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, indication, inquiry or
request), including any modifications thereto. The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed (orally or, at Parents request, in writing) on a current
basis (and in any event no later than twenty-four (24) hours after the
occurrence of any changes, developments, discussions or negotiations) of
the status of any Acquisition Proposal, indication, inquiry or request
(including the material terms and conditions thereof and of any modification
thereto), and any material developments, discussions and negotiations,
including furnishing copies of any written inquiries, correspondence and
draft documentation, and written summaries of any material oral inquiries or
discussions. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and
in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent orally and in
writing if it determines to begin providing information or to engage
in discussions or negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to
Section 6.3(b) and shall in no event begin providing such information or
engaging in such discussions or negotiations prior to providing such notice.
The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into
any Contract with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement that
would restrict the Companys ability to provide such information to Parent,

    ##### 

  

    

pursuant to the foregoing clause (x) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
the foregoing clause (y) unless (A) the Company shall not have materially
breached this Section 6.3, (B) the Company shall have provided prior written
notice to Parent, at least five (5) Business Days in advance (the " _Notice
Period_ " and such notice, a " _Qualifying Proposal Notice_ ")), of its
intention to take such action with respect to such Superior Proposal, which
notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of any such Superior
Proposal (including the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal),
and shall have contemporaneously provided a copy of any proposed definitive
agreement(s) with respect to such Superior Proposal (the "
_Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "), (C) prior to effecting such Change of
Board Recommendation or terminating this Agreement to enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and
shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, during the Notice Period,
negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior
Proposal, and (D) following any negotiation described in the immediately
preceding clause (C), such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal. In the event of any material revisions to the terms of the
Superior Proposal after the start of the Notice Period, the Company shall be
required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the
requirements of this Section 6.3(d) with respect to such new written
notice, and the Notice Period shall be deemed to have re-commenced on the
date of such new notice. 

   

 (e) The Company agrees that any intentional violations of the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.3 by any of its Representatives set forth in Section 6.3(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be an intentional breach of this Agreement (including this Section 6.3) by the Company. 

   

 (f) Notwithstanding anything in Section 6.3(a) to the contrary, the Company Board may effect a Change of Board Recommendation at any time prior to the Purchase Time, if it determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action is reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) this Section 6.3(f) shall not apply to any Change of Board Recommendation in connection with any Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least five (5) Business Days in advance of its intention to make such a Change of Board Recommendation. 

   

 (g) Nothing contained in this Section 6.3 shall prohibit the Company Board from taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , that any disclosure other than (i) a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, (ii) an express rejection of any applicable Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) an express reaffirmation of its recommendation to its stockholders in favor of the Offer and the Merger, shall be deemed to be a Change in Board Recommendation (including for purposes of Section 8.4(b)). 

   

 (h) The Company shall not take any action to (i) exempt any Person (other than Parent, Purchaser and their respective Affiliates) from the restrictions on "business combinations" contained in Section 203 of the DGCL (or any similar provision of any other 

    ##### 

  

    

Law) or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply, or (ii) exempt any
Person (other than Parent, Purchaser and their respective Affiliates) from
the provisions on "control share acquisitions" contained in any Takeover Law
or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply, in each case unless such

 SECTION 6.5. _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. (a) Parent and Purchaser agree that, and shall cause that, the Surviving Corporations certificate of incorporation and bylaws shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities of the present and former directors, officers and employees of the Company than are currently provided in the Companys Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals until the later of (i) the expiration of the statutes of limitations applicable to such matters and (ii) six (6) years from the Effective Time, and, in the event that any Proceeding is pending or asserted or any clam made during such period, until the disposition of any such Proceeding or claim,unless such amendment, modification or repeal is required by applicable Law in which case Parent agrees, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to make such changes to the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws as to have the least adverse affect on the rights of .the individuals referenced in this Section 6.5. 

   

 (b) Without limiting any additional rights that any Person may have under any agreement or Company Plan described in Section 4.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each present (as of the Effective Time) or former officer and director of the Company (each, together with such persons heirs, executors or administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines, amounts paid in settlement and fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or 

    ##### 

  

    

any of its Subsidiaries, or of another entity if such service was at the
request of the Company, or any action or omission by such person in any such
capacity, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective
Time, to the fullest extent the Surviving Corporation is permitted to do so
under applicable law and the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws as at
the date hereof. In the event of any such proceeding, each Indemnified Party
will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of the
proceeding from the Surviving Corporation to the same extent such Persons
have the right to advancement of expenses from the Company as of the date of
this Agreement pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws
(provided that any Person to whom expenses are advanced shall have provided
an undertaking, but only to the extent required by the DGCL, to repay such
advances if it is finally determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification).

Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (d) This Section 6.5 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and is intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, any Person or entity referred to in clause (a) of this Section 6.5 (whether or not parties to this Agreement). The indemnification provided for in this Section 6.5 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which the Indemnified Party is entitled pursuant to Law or any Contract set forth in Section 6.5(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity resulting from such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume the applicable obligations set forth in this Section 6.5.

 (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in Sections 6.6(a) and (b), if any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under the HSR Act or any Foreign Antitrust Law or if any suit is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ or any other applicable Governmental Entity or any private party challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of the HSR Act or any Foreign Antitrust Law or which would otherwise prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any such objections or suits so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including in order to resolve such objections or suits which, in any case if not resolved, could reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 (d) In the event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Entity or private party challenging the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or any other agreement 

    ##### 

  

    

contemplated hereby, each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall cooperate
in all respects with each other and use its respective reasonable best
efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Unless the Merger is consummated in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL as contemplated by Section 2.7, as soon as practicable after the consummation of the Offer (or, if requested by Parent, prior thereto), the Company shall, subject to the prior review and approval of Parent and Purchaser (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) prepare and file with the SEC the Information Statement in preliminary form as required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

no report filed by the Company with the SEC pursuant to the requirements of
the Exchange Act, shall contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. The audited consolidated financial statements and
unaudited interim financial statements of the Company included in
such reports, shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and shall
fairly present, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at the dates thereof and the
results of their operations and changes in financial position for the periods
then ended, in each case in accordance with GAAP (subject, in the case of
unaudited financial statements, to normal and recurring year-end audit
adjustments which are not, individually or in the aggregate, material
in amount or significance, in each case as permitted by GAAP and the
applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC). 

   

 (b) During the period from the date hereof to the Purchase Time, the Company shall provide or make available to Parent in the electronic data room all material documents and data relating to the results of all assays, preclinical and clinical trials, and any other tests, experiments, analysis or investigations conducted by or on behalf of the Company with respect to each product or product candidate or existing compound of the Company, to the extent such documents and data exist in tangible form and are in the possession of the Company or its Subsidiaries after the execution of this Agreement. 

   

 SECTION 6.10. _Public Announcements_. Each of the Company, Parent and Purchaser agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the prior consent of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as such release or announcement may be required by applicable Law or any rule or regulation of Nasdaq or any other stock exchange to which the relevant party is subject or submits, wherever situated, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow each other party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance, it being understood that the final form and content of any such release or announcement, to the extent so required, shall be at the final discretion of the disclosing party.

to perform in all material respects any of its obligations under this
Agreement; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that, if the sole unsatisfied Offer
Condition is Paragraph 2(c) of _Exhibit A_ to this Agreement, such
termination may be effected by Parent prior to the Outside Date only if the
breach or failure to perform or comply or to be true and correct is not
capable of being cured within thirty (30) days following receipt by the

 (i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(b) or by Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(b); or 

   

 (ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(a)(ii), and (A) at any time on or after the date hereof and prior to such termination a third party shall have made an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not conditional) to the Company Board or the Company or shall have publicly announced an Acquisition Proposal and, in each case, not irrevocably withdrawn such Acquisition Proposal or announcement, or any third party shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an Acquisition Proposal which intention has not been irrevocably withdrawn, and (B) any transaction specified in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" is consummated with such third party or any other third party within 12 months after the date of such termination or pursuant to any agreement for an Acquisition Proposal entered into within 12 months after the date of such termination (or any amendment or substitute agreement); or 

   

 (iii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(a) as a result of  _either_ (x) a failure of the Offer Condition set forth in Paragraph 2(c) of _Exhibit A_ to be satisfied, or (y) a failure of the Minimum Tender Condition to be satisfied at the 

   ##### 

  

    

expiration of the Offer in connection with which Parent has so terminated

specified in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" is consummated with
such third party or any other third party within 12 months after the date of
such termination or pursuant to any agreement for an Acquisition
Proposal entered into within 12 months after the date of such termination (or
any amendment or substitute agreement); 

 

then in any such case, the Company shall pay Parent a termination fee of
$22,500,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "), by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account or accounts designated by Parent. Such payment
shall be made (1) concurrently with such termination in the case of a

 (e) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in Section 8.5(c) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent or Purchaser would not have entered into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to Section 8.5(c), as applicable, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit which results in a judgment in favor of Parent for the fee set forth in this Section 8.5, the Company shall pay any costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest from the date of termination of this Agreement on the amounts owed at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect from time to time during such period plus two percent.

 _EXHIBIT A_  

   

 _CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER_  

    

 Capitalized terms used in this _Exhibit A_ and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Agreement to which it is attached (the " _Merger Agreement_ "). 

  

 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer or the Merger Agreement, Purchaser shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-l(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Purchasers obligation to pay for or return tendered Shares promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer), to pay for any Shares tendered in connection with the Offer and may terminate or, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, amend the Offer, unless, immediately prior to the expiration of the offering period for the Offer, as the same may be extended from time to time (the " _Expiration Date_ "): 

  

 (a) there shall have been validly tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn that number of Shares which, together with the number of Shares, if any, then owned beneficially by GSK, Parent and Purchaser (together with their wholly-owned Subsidiaries), constitutes at least a majority of the total number of then-outstanding Shares on a fully diluted basis (which shall mean, as of any time, the number of Shares outstanding, together with all Shares (if any) which the Company would be required to issue, after giving effect to Sections 3.2(a) and 3.2(b), pursuant to any then outstanding warrants, options, benefit plans or obligations or securities convertible or exchangeable into Shares or otherwise, whether or not then exercisable) (the " _Minimum Tender Condition_ "); and 

   

 (b) the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have expired or been terminated, and any required approvals or consents in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have been obtained under any applicable Foreign Antitrust Laws (and any applicable waiting periods thereunder have expired or been terminated). 

   

 2. Additionally, notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer or the Merger Agreement, Purchaser shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-l(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Purchasers obligation to pay for or return tendered Shares promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer), to pay for any Shares tendered in connection with the Offer and may terminate or, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, amend the Offer if any of the following conditions exist: 

   

 (a) there shall have been any Law, decree, judgment, order or injunction, promulgated, enacted, entered, enforced, issued or amended by any Governmental Entity that would, or is reasonably likely to: (i) restrain, enjoin or otherwise prohibit the making or consummation of the Offer or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; or (ii) impose material limitations on the ability of Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to acquire or hold, transfer or dispose of, or effectively to exercise all rights of ownership of, some or all of the Shares 

   ##### 

  

    

including the right to vote the Shares purchased by Purchaser pursuant to the
Offer on an equal basis with all other Shares on all matters properly
presented to the stockholders of the Company; 

   

 (b) there shall be pending or threatened (and such threat shall not have been withdrawn), any action, proceeding or counterclaim by any Governmental Entity challenging any of the making or consummation of the Offer or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or seeking, directly or indirectly, to result in any of the consequences referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) of Paragraph 2(a) above (provided, that any action, proceeding or counterclaim by a foreign or municipal Governmental Entity shall not cause this condition to fail to be satisfied unless such action, proceeding or counterclaim is reasonably likely to succeed); 

   

 (c) (i) the Company shall have breached or failed to comply in any material respect with any of its obligations, covenants, or agreements under the Merger Agreement, or (ii) any representation or warranty of the Company contained in the Merger Agreement shall not be true and correct; _provided_ , that, for purposes of this Paragraph 2(c): 

   

 (A) all such representations and warranties shall be interpreted without giving effect to the words "materially" or "material" or to any qualification based on such terms or based on the defined term "Material Adverse Effect"; 

   

 (B) any such representation or warranty contained in Section 4.1(b) or Section 4.3 shall be deemed untrue if it shall fail to be true and correct in all but _de minimis_ respects; 

   

 (C) any such representation or warranty (other than any representation or warranty referred to in clause (B) above) shall be deemed untrue if such representation or warranty shall fail to be true and correct in all respects except where the fact, circumstance, change or event giving rise to any such failure of all such representations and warranties to be true and correct has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect; 

   

in each case at any scheduled expiration of the Offer (except for any
representation or warranty that is expressly made as of a specified date, in
which case as of such specified date); or 

   

 (e) the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to its terms or shall have been amended pursuant to its terms to provide for such termination or amendment of the Offer; 

 

which, in the reasonable judgment of Parent or Purchaser, in any case, makes
it inadvisable to proceed with the Offer or with acceptance for payment or
payment for Shares. 

   

 The conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of this _Exhibit A_ are for the benefit of Parent and Purchaser and, regardless of the circumstances, may be asserted by Parent or 

   ##### 

  

    

Purchaser in whole or in part at any applicable time or from time to time
prior to the Expiration Date, except that the conditions relating to receipt
of any approvals from any Governmental Entity may be asserted at any time
prior to payment of the Offer Price for Shares, and all conditions (except
for the Minimum Tender Condition) may be waived by Parent or Purchaser in its
discretion in whole or in part at any applicable time or from time to time, in
each case subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and the
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. The failure of Parent or
Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be
deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an
ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.
