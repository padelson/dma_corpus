and promptly pay for all Shares tendered as of such applicable expiration
date.

forth in Annex A, Purchaser shall accept for payment and pay for all Shares as
promptly as practicable after the expiration date of the Offer, as extended
or amended (the date of acceptance for payment, the " _Acceptance Date_ ").

(e) The Per Share Amount shall, subject to applicable withholding of
Taxes, be paid net to the seller in cash, without interest, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of the Offer. Purchaser shall pay for all Shares
validly tendered and not withdrawn promptly following the acceptance of Shares
for payment pursuant to the Offer. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding
sentence and subject to the applicable rules of the SEC and the terms and
conditions of the Offer, Purchaser expressly reserves the right to delay
payment for Shares in order to comply in whole or in part with applicable
laws. Any such delay shall be effected in compliance with Rule 14e-1(c) under
the Exchange Act. If the payment equal to the Per Share Amount in cash is to
be made to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered
certificate formerly evidencing Shares is registered on the stock transfer
books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the certificate
so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall have paid all
transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the  



 

10  payment of the Per Share Amount to a person other than the registered holder
of the certificate surrendered, or shall have established to the satisfaction
of Purchaser that such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable.

(f) As promptly as reasonably practicable on the date of commencement
of the Offer, Purchaser shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on
Schedule TO (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the "
_Schedule TO_ ") with respect to the Offer. The Schedule TO shall contain or
shall incorporate by reference an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_
") and forms of the related letter of transmittal and other customary
documents (the Schedule TO, the Offer to Purchase and such other documents,
together with all supplements and amendments thereto, being referred to herein
collectively as the " _Offer Documents_ "). Parent, Purchaser and the Company
agree to correct promptly any information provided by any of them for use in
the Offer Documents that shall have become false or misleading, and Parent and
Purchaser further agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO,
as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC, and the other Offer Documents, as
so corrected, to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to
the extent required by applicable federal securities laws to give effect to
the Offer. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment upon the Offer Documents and all amendments and
supplements thereto prior to their filing with the SEC.

2.02 Company Action.

(a) Subject to Section 6.06(e), the Company hereby consents to the
Offer and the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the Company Board
Recommendation.

(b) On the date of commencement of the Offer (and subject to Purchaser
providing drafts of its Offer Documents to the Company at least three Business
Days before commencement of the Offer), the Company shall file with the SEC a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with all
amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") containing the
recommendation of the Company Board described in Section 2.02(a), and shall
disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 as required by Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act and any other applicable federal securities laws with the Offer
Documents. The Company, Parent and Purchaser will correct promptly any
information provided by any of them for use in the Schedule 14D-9 which shall
have become false or misleading, and the Company will take all steps necessary
to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC
and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent and its counsel shall
be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Schedule
14D-9 and all amendments and supplements thereto prior to their filing with
the SEC.

(c) The Company shall cause its transfer agent to furnish Purchaser
with mailing labels or electronic files containing the names and addresses of
all record holders of Shares and with security position listings of Shares
held in stock depositories, each as of a recent date, together with all other
available listings and computer files containing names, addresses and security
position listings of record holders and beneficial owners of  



 

11  Shares. The Company shall furnish Purchaser with such additional
information, including, without limitation, updated listings and computer
files of shareholders, mailing labels and security position listings, and
such other assistance in disseminating the Offer Documents to holders of
Shares as Parent or Purchaser may reasonably request. The Company, the Parent
and the Purchaser agree to disseminate the Offer Documents and Schedule 14D-9
to the holders of Shares together in the same mailing or other form of
distribution. Subject to the requirements of applicable law, and except for
such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other
documents necessary to consummate the Offer or the Merger, Parent and
Purchaser shall treat the information contained in such labels, listings and
files as "Evaluation Material" pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement.

2.03 Top-Up Option.

(a) _Grant of Top-Up Option_. The Company hereby grants to Purchaser
an irrevocable option (the "Top-Up Option") to purchase, at a price per share
equal to the Per Share Amount (the "Per Common Share Price"), a number (but
not less than that number) of newly issued Shares (the "Top-Up Option
Shares") that, when added to the number of Shares owned, directly or
indirectly, by Parent or Purchaser at the time of exercise of the Top-Up
Option, constitutes one Share more than 90% of the number of Shares that will
be outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares.
The Top-Up Option may be exercised, in whole but not in part, at any time on
or after the Acceptance Date and prior to the earlier to occur of (i) the
Effective Time and (ii) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Article VIII; provided, however, that the obligation of the Company to deliver
Top-Up Option Shares upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option is subject to the
conditions that (A) no provision of any applicable law and no judgment,
injunction, order or decree of any Governmental Authority shall prohibit or
require any action, consent, approval, authorization or permit of, action by,
or filing with or notification to any Governmental Authority in connection
with the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Option
Shares in respect of such exercise, (B) upon exercise of the Top-Up Option,
the number of Shares owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Purchaser
constitutes one Share more than 90% of the number of Shares that will be
outstanding immediately after the issuance of the top Up Option Shares, (C)
the number of Top-Up Option Shares issued pursuant to the Top-Up Option shall
in no event exceed the number of authorized and unissued Shares not otherwise
reserved for issuance for outstanding Company Stock Options or other
obligations of the Company, and (D) Purchaser has accepted for payment and
paid for all Shares validly tendered in the Offer and not validly withdrawn.
The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance of the Top-Up Option
Shares is accomplished consistent with all applicable Laws. Purchaser shall,
concurrently with the exercise of the Top-Up Option, give written notice to
the Company that as promptly as practicable following such exercise, Purchaser
shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) consummate the Merger in
accordance with Article 5.16 of the TBCA as contemplated by this Agreement.
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to file to deregister the
Company Common Stock under the U.S. federal securities laws concurrently with
consummating the Merger in accordance with Article 5.16 of the TBCA.



 

12 (b) _Exercise of Top-Up Option_. Upon the exercise of the Top-Up
Option in accordance with Section 2.03(a), Purchaser shall so notify the
Company and shall set forth in such notice (i) the number of Shares expected
to be owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Purchaser immediately
preceding the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares and (ii) a place and time
for the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares. The Company
shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice, notify
Purchaser of the number of Shares then outstanding and the number of Top-Up
Option Shares. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares,
Purchaser shall pay the Company the aggregate price required to be paid for
the Top-Up Option Shares pursuant to this Section 2.03, and the Company shall
cause to be issued to Purchaser a certificate representing the Top-Up Option
Shares, which may include any legends required by applicable securities laws.
The aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-Up Option Shares may be
paid, at the election of Purchaser or Parent, by Purchaser by executing and
delivering to the Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal to
the balance of the aggregate purchase price for the Top-Up Option Shares. Any
such promissory note shall bear interest at the rate of interest per annum
equal to 3%, shall mature on the first anniversary of the date of execution
and delivery of such promissory note and may be prepaid without premium
or penalty.

(c) _Securities Law Compliance_. Parent and Purchaser understand that
the Shares that Purchaser may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will
not be registered under the Securities Act, and will be issued in reliance
upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public
offering. Parent and Purchaser represent and warrant to the Company that
Purchaser is, and will be upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, an "accredited
investor" (as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the
Securities Act). Purchaser agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up
Shares to be acquired upon exercise thereof are being and will be acquired for
the purpose of investment and not with a view to or for resale in connection
with any distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act.

(d) _Adjustment upon Changes in Capitalization_. In the event of any
change in the number of shares of outstanding Company Common Stock by reason
of any stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization, combination, exchange of
shares, merger, consolidation, reorganization or the like or any other change
in the corporate or capital structure of the Company that would have the
effect of diluting Purchasers rights under the Top-Up Option, the number of
Top-Up Option Shares and the Per Common Share Price shall be
adjusted appropriately so as to restore Purchaser to its rights hereunder
with respect to the Top-Up Option; provided, however, that nothing in this
Section 2.03 shall be construed as permitting the Company to take any action
or enter into any transaction otherwise prohibited by this Agreement.

those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions (the " _Closing Date_
").

3.03 Effective Time. As promptly as practicable after the consummation
of the Offer, and the satisfaction or waiver (if permitted) of the conditions
of the Merger set forth in Article VII, the parties shall cause the Merger to
be consummated by executing and delivering articles of merger (the " _Articles
of Merger_ ") to the Secretary of State of the State of Texas for filing under

office of the Secretary of State of the State of Texas, or at such later date
or time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Articles of
Merger in accordance with the TBCA and the TBOC (the time the Merger becomes
effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").

3.04 Effects of the Merger. The Merger will have the effects prescribed
by the TBCA, TBOC and other applicable law.

3.05 Articles of Incorporation and By-laws.

(a) The certificate of formation of Purchaser, as in effect immediately
before the Effective Time, will be the certificate of formation of the
Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time, except for Article One thereof
which shall be amended to read as follows: "The name of this corporation is
Intervoice, Inc." As of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will be
deemed to have voluntarily elected to adopt and be subject to the TBOC
pursuant to Section 402.003 of the TBOC.

(b) The Purchaser By-laws, as in effect immediately before the

Surviving Corporation provided in Sections 6.09(a) and (b).

3.06 Directors and Officers. The directors and officers of Purchaser
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors and officers of

14 3.07 Conversion or Cancellation of Shares. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any shareholder:

(a) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Exception Shares (which
shares shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist with no payment being made
with respect thereto) and Dissenting Shares (which shares shall be treated in
accordance with Section 3.10) shall be converted into and constitute the right
to receive cash in an amount equal to the Per Share Amount, without interest
(the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all shares of Company
Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in this Section 3.07(a) shall no longer be
outstanding and shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder
of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such
shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration.

(b) Each issued and outstanding share of Purchaser Common Stock shall
be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock,
$0.01 par value, of the Surviving Corporation. 

3.08 Exchange of Certificates; Payment of the Merger Consideration.

(a) _Appointment of Disbursing Agent_. At or prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit with a disbursing agent agreed upon by Parent and
the Company (the " _Disbursing Agent_ ") cash in an amount sufficient to allow
the Disbursing Agent to make all payments that may be required pursuant to
this Article III. Parent shall be obligated to, from time to time, deposit
any additional funds necessary to make all payments that may be required by
this Article III. Any such cash remaining in the possession of the Disbursing
Agent twelve months after the Effective Time (together with any earnings in
respect thereof) shall be delivered to Parent and any holder of Certificates
who has not theretofore exchanged such Certificates pursuant to this Article
III shall thereafter be entitled to look exclusively to Parent and/or the
Surviving Corporation, and only as a general creditor thereof, for the
consideration to which such holder may be entitled upon exchange of such
Certificates pursuant to this Article III. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither the Disbursing Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable to any
holder of Certificates for any amount properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, but in
no event later than two Business Days thereafter, Parent shall cause the
Disbursing Agent to mail or deliver to each person who was, immediately prior
to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Company Common Stock, a form of
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of such certificates to the Disbursing Agent) containing instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates in exchange for the
consideration to which such person is entitled pursuant to this Article III.
Upon surrender to the Disbursing Agent of a Certificate for cancellation
together with such letter of transmittal,  



 

15  duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the
holder of such Certificate shall promptly be provided in exchange therefor
cash in the amount to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Article
III, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No
interest will accrue or be paid with respect to any consideration to be
delivered upon surrender of Certificates.

(c) _Transfer to Holder other than Existing Holder_. If any cash
payment is to be made in a name other than that in which the Certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of
such payment that the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other similar Taxes required by reason of the making of such payment in a
name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered,
or required for any other reason relating to such holder or requesting person,
or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Disbursing Agent
that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(d) _Transfers_. At or after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers registered on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation
of Company Common Stock or Certificates that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation or the Disbursing
Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the
Surviving Corporation or the Disbursing Agent may direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Surviving Corporation or the Disbursing Agent shall, in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, pay or cause to be paid the
consideration deliverable in respect of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate pursuant to this Article III.

3.09 Stock Incentives.

(a) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each
holder of options to purchase Company Common Stock granted under a Company
Stock Plan (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ") and each holder of restricted
stock units representing shares of Company Common Stock granted under a
Company Stock Plan (each, a " _Company RSU_ ") to agree, if and to the extent
required by the applicable Company Stock Plan or applicable law, no later than
immediately prior to the Effective Time, that each Company Stock Option and
Company RSU outstanding at the Effective Time shall be canceled automatically
at the Effective Time and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive
an amount of cash (i) in respect of each such Company Stock Option, equal to
the product of (A) the excess, if any, of (x) the Per Share Amount over (y)
the exercise price per share of the Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Stock Option and (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to its cancellation,
regardless of the vested status of such Company Stock Option, and (ii) in
respect of each such Company RSU, equal to the product of (A) the Per Share
Amount and (B) the number of shares of Company Common  



 

16  Stock subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to its cancellation,
regardless of the vested status of such Company RSU.

(b) All amounts payable pursuant to this Section shall be subject to
any required withholding of Taxes and shall be paid at or as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time, but in any event within five
Business Days following the Effective Time, without interest; provided,
however, that if a Company RSU provides for the deferral of compensation
subject to Code Section 409A, any amount payable with respect to such Company
RSU shall be paid on January 2, 2009; provided, further, that if any portion
of a Company RSU that is subject to Code Section 409A is otherwise payable in
accordance with its terms during 2008, such portion shall be paid on the date
during 2008 provided under the agreement governing the Company RSU. The
cancellation of a Company Stock Option or Company RSU in exchange for
the cash payment described in this Section shall be deemed a release of any
and all rights the holder of such Company Stock Option or Company RSU had or
may have had in respect thereof, and any required consents from all such
holders shall so provide. 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate,
any committee administering the Company Stock Plans) shall take or cause to
be taken such actions as are required to cause (i) the Company Stock Plans to
terminate as of the Effective Time, without prejudice to the holders of
Company Stock Options and Company RSUs, and (ii) the provisions in any other
Company benefit plan providing for the issuance, transfer or grant of any
capital stock of the Company or any interest in respect of any capital stock
of the Company to be deleted as of the Effective Time.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board or an appropriate
committee of non-employee directors shall adopt a resolution consistent with
the interpretative guidance of the SEC so that the disposition of Shares,
Company Stock Options or Company RSUs pursuant to this Agreement and the
Merger by any officer or director of the Company who is a covered person of
the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act shall be an exempt
transaction for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act.

3.10 Dissenting Shareholders.

(a) Each Dissenting Share shall not be converted into or represent a
right to receive the Merger Consideration hereunder, and the holder thereof
shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by Articles 5.13 or 5.16
of the TBCA. The Company shall give Parent notice as promptly as reasonably
practicable upon receipt by the Company of any demand for payment pursuant to
Articles 5.12 or Article 5.16 of the TBCA and of withdrawals of such notice
(any shareholder duly making such demand being hereinafter called a "
_Dissenting Shareholder_ "), and Parent shall have the right to participate
in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands. Any
payments made in respect of Dissenting Shares shall be made by Parent and/or
the Surviving Corporation.

(b) If any Dissenting Shareholder shall effectively withdraw or lose
(through failure to perfect or otherwise) such holders right to dissent
under Articles 5.13 or 5.16  



 

17  of the TBCA, each of such holders shares of Company Common Stock shall be
converted solely into a right to receive the Merger Consideration
in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement.

copies of which, or, if none exist, reasonably complete and accurate written
descriptions of which, together with all amendments and supplements thereto
and all waivers of any terms thereof, have been provided to Purchaser), except
licenses and license agreements entered into in the ordinary course
of business. To the Companys knowledge there are no material contracts or
licenses granting any rights to any third party with respect to any of the IP
Assets.

(5) To the Companys Knowledge, none of the IP Assets, or any
intellectual property used, sold or offered for sale by the Intervoice
Companies infringes or otherwise violates any third party intellectual
property rights.

(v) _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. In the case of the Company only,
prior to the execution of this Agreement, the Company has received an opinion
of Goldman, Sachs and Co. to the effect that as of the date of this Agreement
and based upon and subject to the matters set forth therein, the consideration
to be received by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to
the Offer and the Merger is fair to such holders from a financial point of
view.

(w) _Compensation Arrangements._ In the case of the Company only, on
or prior to the date hereof, the Compensation Committee of the Company Board
(the " _Compensation Committee_ ") has (i) approved all amounts payable to
any officer, director or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to each Benefit Arrangement or other arrangement, understanding or
agreement, and each amendment or supplement thereto or modification thereof,
(collectively, the " _Compensation Arrangements_ ") as an "employment
compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement" within the
meaning of Rule 14d-10(d) under the Exchange Act and (ii) 



 

32  taken all other action necessary to satisfy the requirements of the
nonexclusive safe harbor with respect to such Compensation Arrangements in
accordance to Rule 14d-10(d) under the Exchange Act (the approvals and
actions referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) above, the " _Company Compensation
Approvals_ "); all payments made or to be made and benefits granted or to be
granted pursuant to such Compensation Arrangements (A) were, or will be, paid
or granted as compensation for past services performed, future services to be
performed, or future services to be refrained from being performed, by such
officer, director or employee and (B) were not, and will not, be calculated
based on the number of securities tendered or to be tendered in the Offer by
such director, officer or employee. The Company Board has determined that each
of the members of the Compensation Committee are, and the members of the
Compensation Committee are, "independent directors" in accordance with the
requirements of Rule 14(d)-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act.

(x) _Real Property_. In the case of the Company only,

(1) Section 5.03(x)(1) of the Disclosure Schedule contains a true and
complete list of all real property leases, ground leases, licenses,
tenancies, subleases and all other occupancy agreements (the " _Leases_ ") to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party (including all
amendments, modifications, supplements, renewals, extensions and guarantees
related thereto) (the space and real property subject to such leases, the "
_Leased Property_ ") and the Company has made available to Parent a true and
complete copy of each of the Leases. The Company or its Subsidiary has good
and valid title to all its personal property, free and clear of all Liens
(except for Permitted Liens) and has a good and valid title to the leasehold
estate in all Leased Property, free and clear of all Liens (except for
Permitted Liens), sufficient to conduct their business as currently conducted.
The Leases are valid and binding against the Company in accordance with their
terms and are in full force and effect. There is not, under any of
the Leases, any existing default or violation by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, nor to the Companys Knowledge, any existing default or
violation by any counterparty to any Lease, nor to the Companys Knowledge any
event or circumstance which, without notice or lapse of time or both, would
become a default or violation by a party to the Leases or give rise to a right
of termination or cancellation under any of the Leases. Except for any
Permitted Liens, the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has assigned,
transferred, conveyed, mortgaged, or encumbered any interest in any Leased
Property.

(2) The Company has good, valid and indefeasible fee simple title to
the real property identified on Section 5.03(x)(2) of the Disclosure Schedule
(the " _Owned Property_ "), free and clear of all Liens, except for Permitted
Liens. There is no pending, and the Company has not received any written
notice of any threatened, and, to the Companys Knowledge, there is no
contemplated condemnation proceeding affecting the Owned Property or any part
thereof or any pending or threatened sale or other disposition of the Owned
Property or any part thereof in lieu of condemnation. To the Companys
Knowledge, the uses for which the Owned Property is zoned do not restrict, or
in any material manner  



 

33  impair, the use of the Owned Property for purposes of the businesses of the
Company and the construction on the Owned Property complies in all
material respects with all applicable building and zoning codes, deed
restrictions, ordinances and rules in effect at the time such construction was
made. The Company has not received any written notice from any Governmental
Authorities of any material violation of any applicable zoning law and to the
Companys Knowledge, no such material violation exists.

(y) _Insurance_. In the case of the Company only, the Company and its
Subsidiaries maintain, or are entitled to the benefits of, insurance covering
their material properties, operations, personnel and businesses (each, an "
_Insurance Policy_ "). Except with respect to Insurance Policies with respect
to Benefit Arrangements, as described in Section 5.03(l), Section 5.03(y) of
the Disclosure Schedule contains a true and complete list of all of the
Insurance Policies and lists the amounts of the last annual premium paid for
all current policies of directors and officers liability insurance
maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries; all premiums payable under
any Insurance Policy have been paid when due and the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of each Insurance Policy.

(z) _Foreign Corrupt Practices and International Trade Sanctions_. In
the case of the Company only, to the Companys Knowledge, since March 1,
2005, neither the Company, nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their
respective directors, officers, agents, employees or any other persons acting
on their behalf has, in connection with the operation of their respective
businesses, (i) used any corporate or other funds for unlawful contributions,
payments, gifts or entertainment, or made any unlawful expenditures relating
to political activity to government officials, candidates or members of

in noncompliance with any export restrictions, anti-boycott
regulations, embargo regulations or other applicable domestic or foreign

COVENANTS

6.01 Reasonable Best Efforts.

done, all things necessary, proper or desirable, or advisable under applicable
laws, so as to permit consummation of the Offer and the Merger as promptly as
practicable and otherwise to enable consummation of the Transactions, and each
will cooperate fully with, and furnish information to, the other party to that
end. In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 6.01(a), if any objections are asserted with respect
to the Transactions under any antitrust law, or if any suit is threatened to
be instituted, by any Governmental Authority or any private party challenging
any of the Transactions or otherwise brought under any antitrust law or other
applicable law that would otherwise prohibit or materially impair or
materially delay the consummation of the Transactions, each of Parent,
Purchaser and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve
any such objections or suits so as to permit consummation of the Transactions
as soon as practicable, and in any event before the Termination Date.

(b) Parent will execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
delivered, by or on behalf of the Surviving Corporation, at and as of the
Effective Time, such instruments and other agreements as may be required for
the due assumption of the Companys outstanding debt and guarantees to the
extent such may be required by the terms of such debt and guarantees.



 

35 6.02 Shareholder Approvals.

(a) If required by applicable law in order to consummate the Merger,
the Company, acting through the Company Board, shall, in accordance with
applicable law and the Companys Articles of Incorporation and By-laws, duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold an annual or special meeting of its
shareholders as promptly as practicable following consummation of the Offer
for the purpose of considering and taking action on this Agreement and the
Merger (the " _Shareholders  Meeting_"). At the Shareholders Meeting, Parent
and Purchaser shall cause all Shares then owned by them and their
subsidiaries to be voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Purchaser shall
acquire shares of Company Common Stock representing at least 90% of the voting
power of the then outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock pursuant to
the Offer, exercise of the Top-Up Option or otherwise, the parties shall take
all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective,
in accordance with Section 5.16 of the TBCA, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after such acquisition, without a meeting of the shareholders of
the Company.

6.03 Proxy Statement. If approval of the Companys shareholders is
required by applicable law to consummate the Merger, promptly following
consummation of the Offer, the Company shall file the Proxy Statement with
the SEC under the Exchange Act, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC promptly. Each of the Company,
Parent and Purchaser agrees to use its reasonable best efforts, after
consultation with the other parties hereto, to respond promptly to all such
comments of and requests by the SEC and to cause the Proxy Statement and all
required amendments and supplements thereto to be mailed to the holders of
Shares entitled to vote at the Shareholders Meeting at the earliest
practicable time; provided further, that, in the event the Top-Up Option has
not been exercised and there is a subsequent offering period as contemplated
by Section 2.01(c), the Company shall initiate the actions contemplated
hereby no later than the fifth Business Day after the first day of the first
such subsequent offering period if Section 6.02(b) has not theretofore become
applicable.

6.04 Press Releases. Parent and the Company will consult with each
other before issuing any press release with respect to the Offer, the Merger
or this Agreement and will not issue any such press release without the prior
written consent of the other party, which will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed; provided that a party may, without the prior consent of the other
party (but after prior consultation, to the extent practicable in the
circumstances), issue any such press release as may be required by applicable
law, securities exchange or automated quotation system rules. Parent and the
Company will cooperate to develop all public communications and make
appropriate members of management available at presentations related to the
Transactions as reasonably requested by the other party.

6.05 Access; Information.

(a) Company agrees that upon reasonable notice and subject to
applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, it will (and will
cause its Subsidiaries to)  



 

36  afford Parent, and Parents Representatives and accountants, such access
during normal business hours throughout the period before the Effective Time
to the books, records (including, without limitation, Tax Returns and work
papers of independent auditors) and properties and to such other information
as Parent may reasonably request; provided, however, that such access shall
not unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company. All requests for such
access shall be made to such representatives of the Company as the Company
shall designate, who shall be solely responsible for coordinating all such
requests and all access permitted hereunder. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Company shall permit and provide access to Parent to
each of the Dallas, Texas, Mountainview, California, Manchester, England and
Orlando, Florida facilities, such that the Parent can conduct a physical
inventory of the Companys assets located at such facility. Neither Parent nor
any of Parents Representatives shall contact any of the employees, customers
or suppliers of the Company in connection with the Transactions, whether in
person or by telephone, mail or other means of communication, without the
specific prior written authorization of such representatives of the Company as
the Company may designate, which authorization with not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned. The Company will not be required to afford
access or disclose information that would jeopardize attorney-client
privilege, contravene any binding agreement with any third party or violate
any law or regulation. The parties will make reasonable appropriate
substitute arrangements in circumstances where the previous sentence applies.

(b) Each party will hold any information provided in connection with
this Agreement or the Transactions confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement.

6.06 No Solicitation.

(a) The Company shall not, directly or indirectly, through any of its
officers or directors or any employee, representative or agent of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (including any investment banker, attorney or
accountant retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) acting, directly or
indirectly, at the direction of any officer or director of the Company, (i)
initiate, solicit, or knowingly encourage inquiries or proposals with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal other than from Parent, (ii) engage in any
discussions or negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential
information or data to any third party in connection with an Acquisition
Proposal (except to notify such person as to the existence of the provisions
of this Section 6.06), or knowingly take any other action with the purpose
or intention of facilitating any other inquiries or the making of any
proposal that constitutes, or that reasonably may be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) except as permitted by Section 6.06(f) below,
enter into any agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement permitted by
(C) below) with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or approve or resolve to
approve any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the
Acceptance Date, the Company may, in response to an unsolicited Acquisition
Proposal received by the Company which did not result from a breach of this
Section 6.06, furnish information to, or enter into discussions or
negotiations with, or waive any standstill with, any person that has made, an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal if, and only to the extent
that (A) such  



 

37  Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or the Company Board,
after consulting with the Companys outside legal and financial
advisors, determines in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal, after
furnishing such information and entering into such discussions or
negotiations, could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal,
(B) the Company and its Subsidiaries are otherwise in compliance with this
Section 6.06 (including, prior to furnishing such information to, or entering
into discussions or negotiations with, such person, by providing written
notice to Parent to the effect that it is furnishing information to, or
entering into discussions or negotiations with, such person), (C) prior to
furnishing such information, the Company receives from such person an executed
confidentiality agreement with terms substantially similar to and no less
favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement; provided, however, that the Company may enter into discussions or
negotiations solely with respect to entering into such confidentiality
agreement without breaching this Section 6.06, and (D) the Company keeps
Parent informed, on a reasonably current basis, of the status of any such
discussions or negotiations as provided above.

(b) The Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within two Business
Days) notify Parent of the existence of any proposal, discussion, negotiation
or inquiry received by the Company with respect to any Acquisition Proposal,
the material terms and conditions of any proposal, discussion, negotiation or
inquiry that it may receive and the identity of the person making such
proposal or inquiry, and any modification of or amendment thereto, and will
keep Parent reasonably apprised of any related developments, discussions, and
negotiations.

(c) The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
existing discussions or negotiations with any persons (other than Parent)
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 6.06 shall prohibit the Company
or the Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to its shareholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or
(ii) making any disclosure to the Companys shareholders if, in the good faith
judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with outside counsel,
failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with applicable law.

(e) Except as set forth in this Section 6.06(e), neither the Company
Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) approve or recommend, or propose to
approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) cause or permit the
Company to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement or similar agreement with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal or (iii) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or
Purchaser, or publicly propose to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse
to Parent or Purchaser, the Company Board Recommendation. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section 6.06(e), the Company Board may, at any
time, withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board Recommendation (a " _Company
Board Change of Recommendation_ ") if the Company Board has concluded in good
faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal advisors, that the
failure of the Company Board to effect a Company Board Change of
Recommendation would be reasonably  



 

38  likely to be inconsistent with the directors exercise of their fiduciary
obligations to the Companys shareholders under applicable law. 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.06 to the contrary,
at any time prior to the Acceptance Date, the Company Board (or any duly
constituted committee of the Company Board) may, in response to a Superior
Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section 6.06, cause the
Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f) and
concurrently with such termination enter into a definitive agreement providing
for the transactions contemplated by such Superior Proposal; provided,
however, that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.01(f), and any purported termination pursuant to Section 8.01(f)
shall be void and of no force or effect, unless, the Company shall have
complied with all the provisions of this Section 6.06, including the
notification provisions in this Section 6.06(f), and with all applicable
requirements of Section 8.03 (including the payment of the Termination Fee
prior to or concurrently with such termination) in connection with
such Superior Proposal; and provided further, however, that the Company shall
not exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.01(f): (1) until after the fifth Business Day following actual receipt by
Parent of written notice from the Company advising Parent that the Company
has received a Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions
of the Superior Proposal and attaching the most current versions of the
definitive agreement, all exhibits and other attachments thereto and
agreements (such as stockholder agreements) ancillary thereto to effect such
Superior Proposal, and identifying the Person making such Superior Proposal (a
" _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") and stating that the Company Board intends
to cause the Company to exercise its right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.01(f) (it being understood and agreed that, prior to any
termination pursuant to Section 8.01(f) taking effect, any amendment to the
price or any other material term of a Superior Proposal (such amended Superior
Proposal, a " _Modified Superior Proposal_ ") shall require a new Notice of
Superior Proposal and a new five Business Day period with respect to such
Modified Superior Proposal) and (2) unless either (A) on or before the
expiration of the five Business Day period following the actual receipt by
Parent of any Notice of Superior Proposal, Parent does not make
such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal (a " _Matching
Agreement_ ") in response to such Superior Proposal or (B) following receipt
of a Matching Agreement within the five Business Day period, the Company
Board (or any duly constituted committee thereof) concludes in good faith,
after consultation with the Companys outside legal advisors and after taking
into consideration the Matching Agreement, that the Superior Proposal to
which the Notice of Superior Proposal relates continues to be a Superior
Proposal.

6.07 Takeover Laws and Provisions. No party will take any action that
would cause the Transactions to be subject to requirements imposed by any
Takeover Law and each of them will take all necessary steps within its
control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) such Transactions
from, or if necessary challenge the validity or applicability of, any
applicable Takeover Law, as now or hereafter in effect. No party will take
any action that would cause the Transactions not to comply with any Takeover
Provisions and each of them will take all necessary steps within its control
to make such Transactions comply with (or continue to comply  



 

39  with) the Takeover Provisions. No party will take any action that would
cause the Transactions not to comply with the Company Rights Agreement and
each of them will take all necessary steps within its control to make such
Transactions comply with (or continue to comply with) the Company Rights
Agreement. Except as provided above with respect to the Transactions or in
order to enter into a transaction pursuant to and in accordance with the
terms and conditions of Section 6.06(f) that constitutes a Superior Proposal,
the Company Board will not (i) amend the Company Rights Agreement, (ii) redeem
the Company Rights, (iii) take any other action with respect to, or make any
determination under, the Company Rights Agreement or (iv) approve an
Acquisition Proposal for purposes of the Takeover Laws or the Takeover
Provisions.

6.08 Regulatory Applications.

(a) Parent and the Company and their respective Subsidiaries will
cooperate and use all reasonable best efforts to prepare as promptly as
possible all documentation, to effect all filings and to obtain all material
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Authorities necessary to consummate the Transactions (the "
_Requisite Approvals_ ") as promptly as practicable, and will make all
necessary filings in respect of those Requisite Approvals as soon as
practicable. Each of Parent and the Company will have the right to review in
advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult with the other, in
each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information,
with respect to all material written information submitted to any third party
or any Governmental Authority in connection with the Requisite Approvals. In
exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties will act reasonably and as
promptly as practicable. Each party agrees that it will consult with the other
party with respect to obtaining all Requisite Approvals and each party will
keep the other party apprised of the status of material matters relating to
completion of the Transactions.

(b) Parent and the Company will, upon request, furnish the other party
with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers
and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of such other party or any of its Subsidiaries with or to any third
party or Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions and to the
extent permitted by the applicable Governmental Authority or any person
objecting to the Transactions, give the other party the opportunity to attend
and participate in any meetings and conferences with such Governmental
Authority or person objecting to the Transactions.

6.09 Indemnification.

(a) The indemnification provisions of the Constituent Documents of the
Surviving Corporation as in effect at the Effective Time shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective
Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
individuals who at the Effective Time were directors, officers or employees of
the Company. Parent shall assume, be jointly and severally liable for, and
honor, guarantee and stand surety for, and shall cause the  



 

40  Surviving Corporation to honor, in accordance with their respective terms,
each of the covenants contained in this Section 6.09 without limit as
to time.

(b) Without limiting Section 6.09(a), following the Effective Time,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation will indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the present and former directors, officers and employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against all costs
or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and costs of
investigation), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities as
incurred, in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of actions or omissions before, at or after the Effective Time
(including as to, or arising out of or pertaining to, the Transactions), to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Parent shall pay all costs
and expenses in connection with such indemnification promptly as statements
therefor are received. At and as of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
By-laws of the Surviving Corporation to conform with the Constituent Documents
of the Company and with its obligations under this Section 6.09.

(c) For a period of six years following the Effective Time, Parent
will cause to be maintained in effect directors and officers liability
insurance that serves to reimburse the present and former officers and
directors (determined as of the Effective Time) of the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries (as opposed to reimbursing the Company or such
Subsidiary) with respect to claims against such directors and officers arising
from facts or events occurring before, at or after the Effective Time
(including as to, arising out of or pertaining to, the Transactions), which
insurance will contain at least the same coverage and amounts of coverage and
will contain terms and conditions no less advantageous to the
Indemnified Party than those provided in the directors and officers
liability insurance currently provided by the Company; provided _,_ that
officers and directors of the Company or any Subsidiary may be required to
make application and provide customary representations and warranties to
Parents insurance carrier for the purpose of obtaining insurance required to
be provided by Parent pursuant to this Section 6.09(c).

(d) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
Section 6.09(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation described above, will promptly notify Parent; provided that
failure so to notify will not affect the obligations of Parent under Section
6.09(a) unless and to the extent that Parent is actually and materially
prejudiced as a consequence.

(e) If Parent or any of its successors or assigns (1) consolidates
with or merges into any other entity and is not the continuing or surviving
entity of such consolidation or merger or (2) transfers all or substantially
all of its assets to any other entity, then and in each case, Parent will, as
a condition precedent to the consummation of any such transaction, cause
proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent will,
by specificity, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.09.



 

41 (f) The provisions of this Section 6.09 shall survive the Effective
Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by,
each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and legal representatives.

(g) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable
attorneys fees and costs of investigation, that may be incurred by any
Indemnified Party in enforcing all obligations provided in this Section 6.09.

6.10 Employee Matters.

(a) From the Effective Time until December 31, 2008, Parent shall
provide, or cause to be provided, the employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (the " _Covered Employees_ ") with
employee benefits and compensation plans, programs and arrangements (excluding
annual equity grants) substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to those
provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, to such
Covered Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall (1) provide all
Covered Employees with service credit for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting and benefit accruals (other than benefit accruals under
a pension plan) under any employee benefit or compensation plan, program or
arrangement adopted, maintained or contributed to by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries in which Covered Employees are eligible to participate, for all
periods of employment with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or their
predecessor entities) prior to the Effective Time to the extent credited by
the Company for purposes of a comparable plan (provided that there will be no
duplication of benefits) and (2) with respect to any self-insured welfare
benefit plans of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, cause, and with respect to
all other welfare benefit plans, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause,
any pre-existing conditions, limitations, eligibility waiting periods or
required physical examinations to be waived with respect to the Covered
Employees and their eligible dependents to the extent waived under the
corresponding plan (for a comparable level of coverage) in which the
applicable Covered Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If the Companys medical, vision and/or dental benefit plans for Covered
Employees are terminated prior to the end of a plan year, Covered Employees
and their dependents who are then participating in a deductible-based medical,
vision and/or dental plan sponsored by the Company will be given credit for
deductibles and eligible out-of-pocket expenses incurred toward deductibles
and out-of-pocket maximums during the portion of the plan year preceding the
termination date (or transfer date) in a comparable deductible-based medical
and/or dental plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries for the corresponding
Parent benefit plan year but only if such Parent benefit plan year covers the
same twelve month period as the plan year of the corresponding Company benefit
plan covers.

(c) Parent and the Company shall honor, or cause to be honored, in
accordance with their terms, all vested or accrued benefit obligations to, and
contractual rights of, Covered Employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
including any benefits or rights arising as a result of the Transaction or
Merger (either alone or in combination with any other event).



 

42 (d) The Company has established a bonus plan for the fiscal year
ending February 28, 2009 (the _"2009 Bonus Plan"_ ). From the period beginning
on the Effective Time and ending on February 28, 2009 Parent shall cause the
Company to maintain the 2009 Bonus Plan. 

(e) No provision in this Section 6.10 shall (2) create any third-party
beneficiary or other rights in any employee or former employee (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any
other Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns, (2) constitute or create an employment agreement or
(3) constitute or be deemed to constitute an amendment to any employee benefit
plan sponsored or maintained by the Parent, the Company or any Subsidiary.

(f) Neither the Companys Board of Directors nor the Compensation
Committee shall withdraw, nor permit the withdrawal of, the Company
Compensation Approvals.

6.11 Notification of Certain Matters. Parent and the Company will each
give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to it
that would cause or constitute a breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein that would be reasonably
likely to cause a condition in Article VII not to be capable of being
satisfied by the Termination Date.

6.12 Board of Directors; Section 14(f).

(a) Subject to applicable law, effective upon the purchase by Purchaser
of Shares pursuant to the Offer (the " _Appointment Time_ "), a number of
Purchasers designees shall be elected to the Company Board as set forth in
this Section 6.12. Purchaser shall be entitled to designate at least up to
such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company
Board as shall give Purchaser representation on the Company Board equal to the
product of the total number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect
to the directors elected pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the
percentage that the aggregate number of votes represented by Shares
beneficially owned by Purchaser or any affiliate of Purchaser following such
purchases bears to the total number of votes represented by Shares then
outstanding, and the Company shall, at such time, promptly take all actions
necessary to cause Purchasers designees to be elected as directors of the
Company including securing the resignations of incumbent directors (except as
set forth in the last sentence of this subsection (a)). At such time, the
persons designated by Purchaser will, as nearly as practicable, constitute at
least the same percentage as persons designated by Purchaser shall constitute
of the Company Board of (1) each committee of the Board, (2) each board of
directors of each Subsidiary, and (3) each committee of each such board, in
each case only to the extent permitted by applicable law. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, until the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to ensure that (x) at least a majority of the Company Board and
each committee of the Company Board and such boards and committees of the
Subsidiaries, as of the date hereof, who are not employees of the Company
shall remain members of the Company Board and of such boards and  



 

43  committees and (y) a majority of the Company Board shall be independent as
required by the relevant rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc.

 

(b) Subject to applicable law, the Company shall promptly take all
actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder to fulfill its obligations under this Section 6.12, and
shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the
Company and its officers and directors as is required under Section 14(f) and
Rule 14f-1 to fulfill such obligations. Parent or Purchaser shall supply to
the Company, and be solely responsible for, any information with respect to
either of them and their nominees, officers, directors and affiliates
required by such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

(c) Following the election of designees of Purchaser pursuant to this
Section 6.12, prior to the Effective Time, any amendment of this Agreement or
the Articles of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company, any termination of
this Agreement by the Company, any extension by the Company of the time for
the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or
Purchaser, any waiver of any of the Companys rights hereunder, or any action
that would prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Merger, shall
require the concurrence of a majority of the directors of the Company then in
office who neither were designated by Purchaser nor are employees of the
Company or any subsidiary of the Company.

ARTICLE VII

CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER

7.01 Conditions to Each Partys Obligation to Effect the Merger. The
respective obligation of each party to consummate the Merger is subject to the
fulfillment or written waiver by the parties before the Effective Time of
each of the following conditions:

(a) _Shareholder Approval_. If and to the extent required by the TBCA,
this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions shall have been approved
and adopted by the affirmative vote of holders of at least two-thirds of the
outstanding Shares;

(b) _No Order_. No Governmental Authority shall have enacted, issued,
promulgated, enforced or entered any law, rule, regulation, injunction, order,
decree or ruling (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) which is then
in effect and has the effect of making the acquisition of Shares by Parent or
Purchaser or any affiliate of either of them illegal or otherwise restricting,
preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Transactions; and

(c) _Purchase of Shares_. Purchaser shall have accepted for payment
and paid for Shares pursuant to the Offer; provided, however, that this
condition shall be deemed to be satisfied with respect to the obligation of
Parent and Purchaser to effect the Merger if Purchaser fails to accept for
payment or pay for the Shares pursuant to the Offer in violation of the terms
of the Offer or of this Agreement.



 

44 ARTICLE VIII

TERMINATION

8.01 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Effective Time and the Transactions may be abandoned for any reason
provided in paragraphs (a) through (h) below; provided, that if any Shares are
accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer, neither Parent nor Purchaser may
terminate this Agreement or abandon the Merger except pursuant to paragraphs
(a) or (b) below.

(a) By mutual written consent of each of Parent and the Company,
notwithstanding any requisite approval and adoption of this Agreement by the
shareholders of the Company. 

(b) By either Parent or the Company if any Governmental Authority
shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any injunction,
order, decree or ruling (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) which
has become final and nonappealable and has the effect of making consummation
of the Offer or the Merger illegal or otherwise preventing or prohibiting
consummation of the Offer or the Merger; provided that the party seeking to
terminate this Agreement shall have used its reasonable best efforts to remove
or lift such injunction, order, decree or ruling.

(c) By Parent if there shall have been (i) a willful and material
breach of any of the covenants and agreements set forth in Section 6.06 hereof
or (ii) a material breach of any of the covenants or agreements (other than
those identified in clause (i) above) or any of the representations
or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of the Company such
that, with respect to this clause (ii), any of the events set forth in
subclauses (a)(d) of clause (iv) of Annex A would have occurred, which breach
is not cured within 15 days following written notice to the Company, or which
breach, by its nature or timing, cannot be cured prior to the consummation of
the Offer.

(d) By the Company if Parent or Purchaser fails to commence the Offer
as provided in Section 2.01(a).

(e) By Parent or the Company if (i) the Offer expires pursuant to its
terms without any Shares being purchased thereunder or (ii) Parent or
Purchaser shall not have accepted for payment and paid for Shares pursuant to
the Offer in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof on or before
December 31, 2008 (the " _Termination Date_ "), provided, however, that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.01(e) shall not be
available to any party to the extent that such partys failure to comply with
any provision of this Agreement, including without limitation Section 6.01,
has resulted in the failure of any of the conditions set forth on Annex A
hereto.

(f) By the Company, at any time prior to the Acceptance Date (and in no
event after the Acceptance Date), in order to enter into a transaction,
pursuant to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of Section
6.06(f), that constitutes a Superior Proposal.



 

45 (g) by Parent, if (i) the Company Board shall have withdrawn or
modified the Company Board Recommendation in any manner adverse to Parent,
(ii) the Company shall have entered into any agreement with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) the Company Board shall have resolved to do
any of the foregoing.

(h) By the Company if there shall have been a material breach of any
of the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties set
forth in this Agreement on the part of Purchaser or Parent, which breach would
prevent Parent or the Purchaser from performing its obligations under this
Agreement and which is not cured within 15 days following written notice to
Parent, or which breach, by its nature or timing, cannot be cured prior to the
consummation of the Offer.

8.02 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and there shall be no liability on the part of any party hereto or any of
its affiliates, directors, officers or shareholders except that (i) the
Company or Parent may have liability or obligations as set forth in Section
8.03 hereof and (ii) if this Agreement is terminated because of a breach of
this Agreement by Parent or because one or more of the conditions to the
Companys obligations under this Agreement is not satisfied as a result of
Parents failure to comply with its obligations under this Agreement, the
Companys right to pursue all legal remedies will survive such termination
unimpaired. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall relieve the
Company or Parent from liability for any willful breach hereof or willful
misrepresentation herein.

8.03 Termination Fee.

(a) In the event that (i) the Company shall terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.01(f), (ii) Parent shall terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.01(c)(i) or (g), or (iii) Parent or the Company shall
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(e) at any time during which
this Agreement was terminable by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01 (c)(i) or
(g), the Company shall pay to the Parent, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, $14,500,000 in cash (the " _Termination Fee_ ").

(b) In the event that (i) Parent or the Company shall terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(b) (other than an injunction, order, decree
or ruling based on or related to any applicable antitrust or competition law
or regulation), (c)(ii) or (e), (ii) there shall have been publicly disclosed,
directly or indirectly, by the Company or the proponent thereof, at or prior
to the time of such termination a bona fide Acquisition Proposal with respect
to the Company and (iii) a definitive agreement or letter of intent is entered
into by the Company with respect to an Acquisition Proposal within twelve
months of such termination of this Agreement or an Acquisition Proposal
otherwise is consummated within twelve months of such termination of this
Agreement, the Company shall pay the Termination Fee to Parent.

(c) In the event that a Termination Fee is payable to Parent, the
Company shall pay the Termination Fee to Parent (i) if this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 8.03(a) on the date of termination (it being
understood that no termination by the Company shall be effective until the
Termination Fee has been paid by the Company) and  



 

46  (ii) if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.03(b), at the
time of consummation of the Acquisition Proposal.

(d) In the event that the Company shall fail to pay the Termination
Fee, required to be paid pursuant to this _Section 8.03_ when due, such fee
shall accrue interest for the period commencing on the date such fee became
past due, at a rate equal to the then-current prime lending rate as published
in the _Wall Street Journal_. In addition, if the Company shall fail to pay
such fee when due, then the Company shall also pay to the other party all of
the other partys costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses)
in connection with efforts to collect such fee and/or expenses.

(e) The parties acknowledge that the Termination Fee and this Section
8.03 are an integral part of the Offer and the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these
agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement.

represents the entire understanding of Parent and the Company regarding the
Transactions and supersedes any and all other oral or written Agreements

remain in full force and effect and will in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated thereby, so long as the economic or legal substance of

party. Upon any such determination, the parties will negotiate in good faith
in an effort to agree upon a suitable and equitable substitute provision to

upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by, the parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

_CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER_

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer, Purchaser shall not
be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange
Act, pay, and (subject to any such rules or regulations) may, to the extent
expressly permitted by this Agreement, delay the acceptance for payment for,
or the payment for, any Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn,
and, to the extent permitted by the Agreement, may amend or terminate the
Offer if, at the expiration of the Offer, as extended or amended: (i) any
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act shall not have expired or been
terminated prior to the expiration of the Offer; (ii) any approval or consent
of any Governmental Authority which is necessary for the Transactions to be
consummated in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, or any relevant
statutory, regulatory or other governmental waiting periods, whether domestic,
foreign or supranational, the failure of which to be obtained or to be
in full force and effect, and any waiting period the failure of which to have
expired, would, upon the purchase of the Shares pursuant to the Offer, have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company,
shall not have been obtained or be in full force and effect or shall not have
expired; (iii) there shall not have been validly tendered and not withdrawn
prior to the expiration of the Offer a number of Shares which, together with
any other Shares beneficially owned by Parent or its wholly owned
subsidiaries, constitute more than two-thirds of all the Fully Diluted Shares
of the Company (the " _Minimum Condition_ "); or (iv) any of the following
conditions shall occur and be continuing: 

(a) (i) any of the representations and warranties of the Company set
forth in Sections 5.03(b)(1) (other than _de minimis_ variations), 5.03(m),
or 5.03(w) of this Agreement shall not be true and correct in all respects, in
each case at and as of the date of this Agreement and at and as of the
Acceptance Date as though made at and as of the Acceptance Date (except to
the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such
date), or (ii) any of the other representations and warranties of the Company
set forth in this Agreement shall not be true and correct in each case at and
as of the date of this Agreement and at and as of the Acceptance Date as
though made at and as of the Acceptance Date (except to the extent expressly
made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such date), in each instance,
in the case of this clause (ii) only, except as would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Company.

(b) (i) the Company shall have failed to perform or comply in any
respect with Section 6.10(f) of this Agreement, or (ii) the Company shall have
failed to perform or comply in any material respect with any other of its
agreements, obligations or covenants under this Agreement, and such failure to
perform or comply with such other agreements, obligations or covenants shall
not have been cured to the good faith satisfaction of Purchaser;

(c) this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its
terms;



 

A-1 (d) there shall have occurred any event, change, effect or occurrence
which has had or would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Company;

(e) Purchaser and the Company shall have agreed that Purchaser shall
terminate the Offer or postpone the acceptance for payment of Shares
thereunder; or

(f) a Governmental Authority shall have enacted, issued, promulgated,
enforced or entered any law, rule, regulation, injunction, order, decree or
ruling (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) which is then in effect
and has the effect of making the acquisition of Shares by Parent or Purchaser
or any affiliate of either of them illegal or otherwise restricting,
preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Transactions.

The foregoing conditions, other than the Minimum Condition, may be waived by
Purchaser in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in its sole
discretion. The failure by Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the
foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right; the waiver of
any such right with respect to particular facts and other circumstances shall
not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances; and
each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any
time and from time to time.
