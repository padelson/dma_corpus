other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1

PURCHASE AND SALE OF PURCHASED INTERESTS



1.01 Purchase and Sale of Purchased Interests. On the terms and subject to the
conditions hereof, on the Closing Date, (a) the Holdco Seller shall sell,
assign, transfer and convey to the Purchaser (or one of the Purchaser's
Subsidiaries designated by the Purchaser), and the Purchaser shall purchase
and acquire from the Holdco Seller, all of the Purchased Holdco Interests,
free and clear of any Liens and restrictions on transfer (other than any
restrictions on transfer under the Securities Act and any applicable state
securities Laws) and together with all accrued rights and benefits attached
thereto, (b) the Corp Sellers shall sell, assign, transfer and convey to the
Purchaser (or one of the Purchaser's Subsidiaries designated by the
Purchaser), and the Purchaser shall purchase and acquire from the Corp
Sellers, all of the Purchased Syntron Corp Interests, free and clear of any
Liens and restrictions on transfer (other than any restrictions on transfer
under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities Laws) and
together with all accrued rights and benefits attached thereto, and (c) in
consideration of the sale of the Purchased Interests and the covenants and
agreements contained herein, the Purchaser shall deliver to the Sellers the
consideration specified in Section 1.02.



1.02 Purchase Price.



(a) For purposes of this Agreement, the aggregate purchase price (the
"Purchase Price") to be paid for the Purchased Interests shall be an amount
equal to (i) $179,000,000 (the "Base Consideration"), minus (ii) the Final
Indebtedness, plus (iii) the amount, if any, by which the Final Net Working
Capital exceeds the Target Net Working Capital, minus (iv) the amount, if any,
by which the Final Net Working Capital is less than the Target Net Working
Capital, minus (v) the Escrow Amount, plus (vi) the Final Cash, minus (vii)
the Final Transaction Expenses, and minus (viii) the Representative Expense
Amount.



(b) For purposes of this Agreement, the "Preliminary Purchase Price" shall be
an amount equal to (i) the Base Consideration, minus (ii) the Estimated
Indebtedness, plus (iii) the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Net
Working Capital exceeds the Target Net Working Capital, minus (iv) the amount,
if any, by which the Estimated Net Working Capital is less than the Target Net
Working Capital, minus (v) the Escrow Amount, plus (vi) the Estimated Cash,
minus (vii) the Estimated Transaction Expenses, and minus (viii) the
Representative Expense Amount. 



1.03 Estimated Cash, Estimated Indebtedness and Estimated Net Working Capital.



Not less than four (4) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date,
Syntron Corp and Holdco shall deliver to the Purchaser (i) Syntron Corp's and
Holdco's calculation of their good-faith estimate of (a) the amount of Cash as
of the Calculation Time (the "Estimated Cash"), (b) Net Working Capital as of
the Calculation Time (the "Estimated Net Working Capital"), and (c) the amount
of Indebtedness which will be outstanding immediately prior to the Closing
(the "Estimated Indebtedness"), in each case together with reasonably detailed
backup materials and supporting calculations, (ii) a schedule showing the
amount of Transaction Expenses unpaid as of the Closing (including the Option
Surrender Payments) (the "Estimated Transaction Expenses"), which schedule
shall include itemized calculations of each Transaction Expense and the wire
instructions for payment of each such expense (the "Transaction Expenses
Schedule"), and (iii) a statement showing the calculation of the Preliminary
Purchase Price. If, within two (2) Business Days following receipt of the
items set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above, the Purchaser has not
given Syntron Corp and Holdco notice of its objection to any of such items,
the Preliminary Purchase Price shall be as estimated by Syntron Corp and
Holdco pursuant to clause (iii) above. If the Purchaser gives such notice of
objection, Syntron Corp and Holdco, on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the
other hand, will work together in good faith to resolve the issues in dispute.
If all disputed issues are resolved, the amounts as agreed upon by the
Purchaser, Syntron Corp and Holdco shall be used to calculate the Preliminary
Purchase Price. If the Purchaser, Syntron Corp and Holdco are unable to
resolve all such disputed issues within three (3) Business Days following the
Purchaser's receipt of the items set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii)
above, the Adjustment Escrow Amount shall be increased by the amount (up to
$1,000,000) that Syntron Corp's and Holdco's calculation of the Preliminary
Purchase Price exceeds the Purchaser's calculation of the Preliminary Purchase
Price; provided that such $1,000,000 cap shall not limit the Purchaser's right
to recover the full amount of any Excess Amount.



1.04 The Closing Transactions.



Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the parties
shall consummate the following transactions at the Closing:



(a) the Purchaser shall make the following payments:

to the anticipated Closing Date;



(ii) the Purchaser shall repay, on behalf of the Acquired Companies, all
amounts required to be paid under the payoff letters delivered pursuant to
Section 1.04(c) in order to fully discharge the Indebtedness owed to the

accounts designated in such payoff letters, which the parties hereto agree
shall be treated for Tax purposes (A) in the case of amounts paid with respect
to the Holdco Seller's pro rata share of any Indebtedness of Holdco or any of
its Subsidiaries, as if the Purchaser paid such amounts to the Holdco Seller
as part of the Purchase Price paid for the Purchased Holdco Interests and the
Holdco Seller contributed such amounts to Holdco to fund the repayment by
Holdco of such Indebtedness, (B) in the case of Syntron Corp's pro rata share

the repayment by Holdco of such Indebtedness, and (C) in the case of amounts
paid with respect to Indebtedness of Syntron Corp, as if the Purchaser paid
such amounts to the Corp Sellers as part of the Purchase Price paid for the

system no later than five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date; and



(v) the Purchaser shall deliver to the Seller Representative, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds, an amount equal to $1,000,000 (the

as applicable, shall adopt the necessary resolutions and take all other
actions necessary to effect the treatment of the Options contemplated by this
Section 1.04(b). Subject to compliance with the terms of the applicable Option
Surrender Agreements, the Option Surrender Payments payable at the Closing
shall be paid as provided in Section 1.04(a)(iv);

Representative, as unnecessary);



(vii) instruments in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser
evidencing (A) the consummation of the Restructuring Transactions not less

and

(e) the Purchaser shall deliver to the Seller Representative each of the 



(i)a certificate executed by an officer of the Purchaser, in form and

1.05 Final Cash, Final Indebtedness and Final Net Working Capital
Calculations.



(a) Within seventy-five (75) days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser will
deliver to the Seller Representative (i) an unaudited balance sheet of the
Acquired Companies (the "Closing Balance Sheet") as of the Calculation Time
and (ii) a statement showing the calculation of (A) the amount of Cash derived
from the Closing Balance Sheet as of the Calculation Time, (B) the amount of
Indebtedness as of immediately prior to the Closing, (C) the Net Working
Capital derived from the Closing Balance Sheet as of the Calculation Time and
(D) the amount of Transaction Expenses unpaid as of the Closing (together with
the Closing Balance Sheet, the "Preliminary Statement"). If a Preliminary
Statement is not delivered to the Seller Representative by the seventy-fifth
(75th) day following the Closing Date, the Seller Representative shall deliver
a written notice informing the Purchaser of its failure to timely deliver such
Preliminary Statement, and (x) if a Preliminary Statement is not delivered
within ten (10) days following the date such written notice is delivered by
the Seller Representative and (y) the amount, if any, by which the Estimated
Net Working Capital exceeds the Target Net Working Capital is less than
$500,000, then, in the Seller Representative's sole discretion, the Estimated
Cash, the Estimated Indebtedness, the Estimated Net Working Capital and the
Estimated Transaction Expenses shall become final and binding on the parties
hereto. The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared, and the amount of Cash,
the amount of Indebtedness, the Net Working Capital and the Transaction
Expenses shall be determined, on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP,
using, to the extent consistent with GAAP, the same accounting methods,
policies, principles, practices and procedures, with consistent
classifications, judgments and estimation methodology (including without
limitation as to the establishment of reserves), as were used in preparation
of the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Acquired Companies as of
September 30, 2018 (the "Latest Balance Sheet") and in accordance with the
Accounting Principles, and shall not include any changes in assets or
liabilities as a result of purchase accounting adjustments or other changes
arising from or resulting as a consequence of the transactions contemplated
hereby. After delivery of the Preliminary Statement, the Seller Representative
and its accountants shall be permitted reasonable access during normal
business hours and upon reasonable notice to review the Acquired Companies'
books and records and work papers related to the preparation of the
Preliminary Statement; provided that such access does not unreasonably
interfere with the normal operations of the Purchaser or any Acquired Company
and nothing herein shall require the Purchaser or any Acquired Company to
provide access to, or to disclose any information to, the Seller
Representative or any of its Representatives if such access or disclosure
would waive any legal privilege or violate any applicable Law or regulation of
any Governmental Authority or the provisions of any agreement to which the
Purchaser or any Acquired Company is a party. Subject to the foregoing
sentence, the Seller Representative and its accountants may make reasonable
inquiries of the Purchaser, the Acquired Companies and their respective
accountants regarding questions concerning, or disagreements with, the
Preliminary Statement arising in the course of their review thereof, and the
Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to, direct any such
accountants to reasonably cooperate with and respond to such reasonable
inquiries.



(b) If the Seller Representative has any objections to the Preliminary
Statement, the Seller Representative shall deliver to the Purchaser a
statement setting forth in reasonable detail its objections 

thereto (an "Objections Statement"). If an Objections Statement is not
delivered to the Purchaser within thirty (30) days after delivery of the
Preliminary Statement, the Preliminary Statement shall be final, binding and
non‑appealable by the parties hereto. The Seller Representative and the
Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such objections, but if
they do not reach a final resolution within thirty (30) days after the
delivery of the Objections Statement, the Seller Representative and the
Purchaser shall submit such dispute to RSM US LLP ("RSM"); provided that, if
RSM is unable or unwilling to serve in such capacity, the Seller
Representative and the Purchaser shall jointly select an alternative arbiter
from a nationally recognized independent public accounting firm that is not
the independent auditor of the Purchaser, the Seller Representative, any
Seller or any Acquired Company (RSM or the Person so selected, as applicable,
the "Dispute Resolution Auditor"). Each of the Seller Representative and the
Purchaser may furnish to the Dispute Resolution Auditor such information and
documents as it deems relevant, with copies of such submission and all such
documents and information being concurrently given to the other party. The
Dispute Resolution Auditor shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator and
shall consider only those items and amounts which are identified in the
Objections Statement as being items which the Seller Representative and the
Purchaser are unable to resolve. The Dispute Resolution Auditor's
determination will be based solely on the definitions of Cash, Indebtedness,
Net Working Capital and Transaction Expenses contained herein, as determined
in accordance with GAAP and the Accounting Principles. The Seller
Representative and the Purchaser shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Dispute Resolution Auditor to resolve all disagreements
within thirty (30) days. Further, the Dispute Resolution Auditor's
determination shall be based solely on the supporting material provided by the
Purchaser and the Seller Representative in accordance with the terms and
procedures set forth in this Agreement (i.e., not on the basis of an
independent review) and may not assign a value to any particular item greater
than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less than the
lowest value for such item claimed by either party, in each case as presented
to the Dispute Resolution Auditor. The resolution of the dispute by the
Dispute Resolution Auditor shall be final, binding and non‑appealable on the
parties hereto absent fraud or manifest error. The costs and expenses of the
Dispute Resolution Auditor shall be allocated between the Purchaser, on the
one hand, and the Securityholders, on the other hand, based upon the
percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party
bears to the amount actually contested by such party. For example, if the
Seller Representative claims the Net Working Capital is $1,000 greater than
the amount determined by the Purchaser's accountants, the Purchaser contests
only $500 of the amount claimed by the Seller Representative, and the Dispute
Resolution Auditor ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding the
Securityholders $300 of the $500 contested, then the costs and expenses of the
Dispute Resolution Auditor will be allocated 60% (i.e., 300 ÷ 500) to the
Purchaser and 40% (i.e., 200 ÷ 500) to the Securityholders. The amount of
Cash, the amount of Indebtedness, the Net Working Capital and the amount of
Transaction Expenses unpaid as of the Closing, in each case as finally
determined pursuant to this Section 1.05(b), shall be referred to herein as
the "Final Cash," the "Final Indebtedness," the "Final Net Working Capital"
and the "Final Transaction Expenses".



(c) If, after final determination of the Final Cash, the Final Indebtedness,
the Final Net Working Capital and the Final Transaction Expenses pursuant to
this Section 1.05, the Preliminary Purchase Price is less than the Purchase
Price (such shortfall, the "Shortfall Amount"), then the Purchaser, within
five (5) Business Days after both (i) the Final Cash, the Final Indebtedness,
the Final Net Working Capital and the Final Transaction Expenses become final
and binding on the parties pursuant to this Section 1.05, and (ii) the
Purchaser receives payment instructions from the Seller Representative, shall
make payment of the Shortfall Amount by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the Securityholders (as directed by the Seller Representative and to
be paid in accordance with Section 10.02(c)), and the Purchaser and the Seller
Representative shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to
cause the Escrow Agent to make payment, within two (2) Business Days after
delivery of such joint written instructions, to the Seller 

Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, of the entire Adjustment Escrow Amount from the
Adjustment Escrow Account.



(d) If, after final determination of the Final Cash, the Final Indebtedness,
the Final Net Working Capital and the Final Transaction Expenses pursuant to
this Section 1.05, the Preliminary Purchase Price is greater than the Purchase
Price (such excess, the "Excess Amount"), then the Purchaser and the Seller
Representative shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to
cause the Escrow Agent to make payment, within five (5) Business Days after
the Final Cash, the Final Indebtedness, the Final Net Working Capital and the
Final Transaction Expenses become final and binding on the parties pursuant to
this Section 1.05, to the Purchaser, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, of the lesser of (i) the Excess Amount and (ii) the remaining funds in
the Adjustment Escrow Account, in each case from the Adjustment Escrow
Account. In the event that the remaining funds in the Adjustment Escrow
Account are less than the Excess Amount, then any remaining portion of the
Excess Amount shall be recovered (A) first, from the funds then remaining in
the Indemnity Escrow Account, and (B) if the funds then remaining in the
Indemnity Escrow Account are less than the remaining portion of the Excess
Amount, then the Securityholders (in accordance with each Securityholder's
Post-Closing Percentage Interest) shall promptly pay the amount of such
deficiency in cash to the Purchaser. In the event that the remaining funds in
the Adjustment Escrow Account are greater than the Excess Amount, then the
Purchaser and the Seller Representative shall deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent to cause the Escrow Agent to make payment,
within five (5) Business Days after the Final Cash, the Final Indebtedness,
the Final Net Working Capital and the Final Transaction Expenses become final
and binding on the parties pursuant to this Section 1.05, to the Seller
Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, of the remainder of the Adjustment Escrow Amount
in the Adjustment Escrow Account (if any) after the payment to the Purchaser
described above in this Section 1.05(d).



(e) The parties hereto agree that the dispute resolution procedures provided
for in this Section 1.05, shall be the exclusive method for resolving any
disputes with respect to the determination of the Final Cash, the Final
Indebtedness, the Final Net Working Capital, the Final Transaction Expenses
and any Shortfall Amount or Excess Amount; provided that this provision shall
not prohibit the Purchaser or the Seller Representative from instituting
litigation to enforce the determination of the Dispute Resolution Auditor and
shall not limit any remedy of any party hereto under Article 11.



1.06 Withholding. Each of the Purchaser, each Acquired Company and the Escrow
Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts otherwise
payable by it pursuant to this Agreement to any Person, including payments
made under the Escrow Agreement, such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law, and to collect IRS Forms W-8 or
W-9 or any successors thereto to the extent required by Tax Law from the
Securityholders and any other recipients of payments hereunder; provided that,
except for amounts treated as wages for income or employment Tax purposes, the
Purchaser shall provide the Seller Representative five (5) days' advance
written notice of the intention to make any deduction or withholding pursuant
to this Section 1.06 and the Purchaser shall cooperate with any reasonable
request of the Seller Representative to obtain reduction or relief from such
deduction or withholding. In the event that any amount is so deducted and
withheld, and properly remitted to the applicable Governmental Authority, such
amount will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid
to the Person to whom the payment from which such amount was withheld was
made.



1.07 The Closing. The parties shall cause the closing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing") to take place at the offices of
Honigman Miller Schwartz and Cohn LLP located at 660 Woodward Avenue, Detroit,
Michigan at 10:00 a.m. Central time on the third (3rd) Business 

Day following full satisfaction or due waiver of all of the closing conditions
set forth in Article 2 hereof (other than those to be satisfied at the
Closing) or, if the Purchaser and the Seller Representative mutually agree, on
such other date, or at such other time, as the Purchaser and the Seller
Representative agree; provided that in no event shall the Closing occur prior
to January 2, 2019. The date of the Closing is referred to herein as the
"Closing Date" and the Closing shall be deemed effective as of 12:01 a.m.
Central Time on the Closing Date.

accompanying this Agreement (the "Disclosure Schedules"). The Disclosure
Schedules have been arranged in separately titled sections corresponding to,

its properties and to carry on its businesses as now conducted.



(b) Each Acquired Company is qualified to do business and is in good standing
in every jurisdiction in which its ownership of property or the conduct of its
businesses as now conducted requires it to qualify, except where the failure
to be so qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect. The Acquired Companies have made available to the
Purchaser, prior to the date hereof, a true and complete copy of the
Organizational Documents for each Acquired Company. None of the Acquired
Companies is in violation of any of the provisions of its Organizational
Documents.

Acquired Company holds a valid leasehold interest in the Leased Real Property
to which each Real Property Lease relates and, following the Closing Date,

parties thereto, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as the

affecting creditors' rights generally and general principles of equity
affecting the availability of specific performance and other equitable
remedies; no Acquired Company is in breach or violation of, or default under,
any such Real Property Lease, and no event has occurred, is pending or, to the
Acquired Companies' knowledge, is threatened, which, after the giving of
notice, with lapse of time, or otherwise, would constitute any such breach or
default by any Acquired Company or, to the Acquired 

Companies' knowledge, any other party under such Real Property Lease; and no
event has occurred that would give rise to a termination right under such Real
Property Lease to the extent any of the foregoing would, individually or in
the aggregate, be material to the Acquired Companies taken as a whole;



(ii)there are no disputes, oral agreements or forbearance programs in effect

timely basis all Taxes, whether or not shown on a Tax Return, that were due
and payable. All income and other material Taxes that any Acquired Company is

knowledge, threatened against the Purchaser, which would materially and
adversely affect the Purchaser's performance under this Agreement or the

transactions contemplated hereby.

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each Acquired Company shall be
able to pay its debts as they become due and shall own property which has a

understands, acknowledges and agrees that all other representations and
warranties of any kind or nature expressed or implied are specifically
disclaimed by the Sellers, Holdco and Syntron Corp. None of the Sellers,
Holdco, Syntron Corp or any other member of the Seller Group makes or

Purchaser's investigation of the Acquired Companies, the Purchaser has
received certain projections, including projected statements of operating
revenues and income from operations of the Acquired Companies and certain
business plan information. The Purchaser acknowledges that there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections and
other forecasts and plans, that the Purchaser is familiar with such
uncertainties and that the Purchaser is taking full responsibility for making
its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections
and other forecasts and plans so furnished to it, including, without
limitation, the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates,
projections and forecasts. Accordingly, the Purchaser hereby acknowledges that
none of the Sellers (or any of their members), Holdco, Syntron Corp or any of
their respective direct or indirect Affiliates or representatives (or any of
their directors, managers, officers, employees, members, shareholders,
managers, partners or agents) (collectively, the "Seller Group") is making any
representation or warranty with respect to such estimates, projections and
other forecasts and plans, including, without limitation, the reasonableness
of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections and forecasts. The
Purchaser further agrees that, except as expressly set forth in this
Agreement, no member of the Seller Group will have or be subject to any
liability to the Purchaser or any other Person resulting from the distribution
to the Purchaser, or the Purchaser's use of, any such information, or any
information, document or material made available to the Purchaser or its
Affiliates or their respective, counsel, accountants, consultants, advisors,
agents or other representatives in any management presentation used in
connection with meetings between the Purchaser and any Acquired Company, in
the Confidential Information Presentation dated July 2018, in certain "data
rooms" and online "data sites," in management interviews, or in any other form
in expectation or anticipation of the transactions contemplated by this

elsewhere in this Agreement shall, or shall be deemed or construed to,
preclude or impair any claim in respect of, relieve any Person of any
liability or obligation for, or limit any recourse available in respect of,
Actual Fraud.

from the payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement any required
withholding Tax under Section 1445 or Section 1446 of the Code, and the

failure of the condition set forth in Section 2.01(b) to have been met.

Company to terminate, prospectively effective no later than the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date, each Company Plan intended to comply

Representative and its representatives with reasonable access, during normal
business hours, to the books and records of the Acquired Companies with
respect to periods or occurrences prior to or on the Closing Date to the
extent reasonably required in connection with any Tax or financial reporting
matter relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (other than in any matter relating to a potential or
actual dispute arising out of this Agreement); provided that (a) such access
does not unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the Purchaser or
any Acquired Company and (b) nothing herein shall require the Purchaser or any
Acquired Company to provide access to, or to disclose any information to, the
Seller Representative or any of its representatives if such access or
disclosure would (i) waive any legal privilege or (ii) be in violation of
applicable Laws or the provisions of any agreement to which the Purchaser or
any Acquired Company is a party; provided, further, that the Purchaser shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to provide such information in a manner
that does not forfeit such privilege or violate any such Law or term. Unless
otherwise consented to in writing by the Seller Representative, until the
seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall not, and
shall not permit any Acquired Company to, destroy, alter or otherwise dispose
of any of the books and records of any Acquired Company for any period prior
to the Closing Date without first giving reasonable prior notice to the Seller
Representative and offering to surrender to the Seller Representative such
books and records or any portion thereof which the Purchaser or any Acquired
Company may intend to destroy, alter or dispose of; provided that the
foregoing requirement shall cease to apply to the Purchaser in the event of a
sale or disposition of the Acquired Companies by the Purchaser.



7.02 Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification.



(a)For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, the Purchaser shall not,
and shall not permit any Acquired Company to, amend, repeal or otherwise
modify any provision in any Acquired Company's certificate or articles of
incorporation, by-laws, certificate of formation or limited liability company
agreement (or equivalent governing document) relating to the exculpation or
indemnification of any current or former managers, directors and/or officers
of each Acquired Company at or prior to the Closing (each such individual, a
"DandO Indemnitee") from the form of such provisions as of immediately prior to
the Closing (unless required by Law), it being the intent of the parties that
the DandO Indemnitees shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation and
indemnification from the Acquired Companies to the fullest extent permitted by 



(b)At or prior to the Closing, the Acquired Companies shall obtain, maintain
and fully pay for irrevocable "tail" insurance policies (for the avoidance of
doubt, the cost of which shall be borne by the Sellers) naming the DandO
Indemnitees as direct beneficiaries with a claims period of at least six (6)
years from the Closing Date from an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as the Acquired Companies' current insurance carrier with
respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance in an amount and scope
at least as favorable as the Acquired Companies' existing policies with
respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing. The
Purchaser shall not, and shall cause the Acquired Companies not to, cancel or
change such insurance policies in any respect.



(c)In the event that the Purchaser, any Acquired Company or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then in either such case
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Purchaser or such entity, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 7.02.



(d)The Purchaser hereby acknowledges (on behalf of itself and its
Subsidiaries) that the DandO Indemnitees may have certain rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided by current
shareholders, members, or other Affiliates of the Seller Group ("Indemnitee
Affiliates") separate from the indemnification obligations of the Acquired
Companies hereunder. The parties hereto hereby agree (i) that the Acquired
Companies are the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., their obligations to the
DandO Indemnitees are primary and any obligation of any Indemnitee Affiliate to
advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the same expenses or
liabilities incurred by the DandO Indemnitees are secondary), (ii) that the
Acquired Companies shall be required to advance expenses incurred by the DandO
Indemnitees and shall be liable for expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and
amounts paid in settlement, in each case to the extent required by their
certificate or articles of incorporation, by-laws, certificate of formation or
limited liability company agreement and, in each case, to the extent legally
permitted, without regard to any rights the DandO Indemnitees may have against
any Indemnitee Affiliate, and (iii) that the parties hereto (on behalf of
themselves and their respective Subsidiaries) irrevocably waive, relinquish
and release the Indemnitee Affiliates from any and all claims against the
Indemnitee Affiliates for contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of
any kind in respect thereof. The indemnification obligations provided under
this Section 7.02 are primary and the DandO Indemnitees shall not be obligated
to pursue claims that exist under any other agreement or document which may
provide such Person with any rights of indemnification or exculpation.



(e)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7.02, the
Organizational Documents of any Acquired Company or any provision in any
indemnification or other agreement to which any of them is a party or by which
any of them is bound, (i) no exculpation or other provision in the
Organizational Documents of any Acquired Company or any such agreement shall
be deemed to exculpate any DandO Indemnitees from such Person's obligations
under this Agreement, and (ii) no Person shall be entitled to indemnification
or reimbursement or advancement of expenses under any provision of the
Organizational Documents of any Acquired Company or any such agreement for any
matter for which any Purchaser Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement.



(f)The DandO Indemnitees are express and intended third-party beneficiaries of
the provisions of this Section 7.02 and shall be entitled to independently
enforce the terms hereof as if they were each a party to this Agreement.





7.03 Employee Matters. The Purchaser shall indemnify the members of the Seller
Group from and against any loss, liability, damage or expense that may be
incurred by them with respect to any obligation to provide notice, payment or
any other benefit as a result of or arising out of any termination of
employment of any employee of any Acquired Company following the Closing,
including but not limited to any loss, liability, damage or expense under the
WARN Act or under any state, local or foreign Law with respect to any plant or
office closing, layoff or relocation occurring after the Closing as a result
of any action taken by the Purchaser or any Acquired Company following the
Closing, but excluding any costs or expenses to be borne by the Seller Group
under this Agreement.



7.04 RandW Insurance Policy. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, the Purchaser entered into a binder agreement with respect to
the RandW Policy and has delivered a true and complete copy of the RandW Policy
binder agreement to the Seller Representative. The RandW Policy shall include
(and retain throughout the policy's duration) a waiver of any subrogation with
respect to the Sellers in connection with any claims thereunder, other than in
connection with Actual Fraud. The cost of the premiums, together with all
Taxes and application, underwriting or similar fees and expenses due in
connection with the RandW Policy (including those to bind the RandW Policy), shall
be paid by the Purchaser to the applicable insurer. The Purchaser shall take
commercially reasonable actions within its control to maintain the RandW Policy
through its original term and shall not modify the policy exclusions, coverage
(including coverage limits and scope) or any provisions affecting the
collectability of insurance in a manner that would be materially adverse to
the Sellers.

this Section 8.02, Section 9.03(a), Section 9.06, Section 9.07, Article 12 and
Article 13 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall be
enforceable by the parties hereto), and (ii) there shall be no liability or
obligation on the part of the Purchaser, the Sellers, Holdco or Syntron Corp
to any other party hereto with respect to this Agreement; provided that,
notwithstanding clause (ii) of this Section 8.02(a), liability may exist for
breach of, or otherwise with respect to, the provisions of this Agreement
specified in the parenthetical contained in clause (i) of this Section
8.02(a); provided, further, that no termination of this Agreement shall
release, or be construed as releasing, any party from any liability to any
other party for a willful and knowing breach which may have arisen under this
Agreement prior to termination. For purposes of this Section 8.02(a), "willful
and knowing breach" shall mean a material breach that is a consequence of an
act or a failure to take such act by the breaching party with the knowledge
that the taking of such act (or the failure to take such act) would cause a
material breach of this Agreement.



(b)Notwithstanding this Section 8.02 or anything else in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Purchaser affirms that it is not a condition to the Closing or
to any of its obligations under this Agreement that the Purchaser obtain
financing for or related to any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.



ARTICLE 9

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS



9.01 Tax Matters. The provisions of this Section 9.01 shall govern the
allocation of responsibility as between the Purchaser and the Acquired
Companies, on the one hand, and the Seller Representative and the Sellers, on
the other hand, for certain Tax matters following the Closing:



(a)Transaction Tax Deductions, Tax Year-End, and Allocation. The parties
hereto agree that (i) the Transaction Tax Deductions shall be reported in
Holdco's Pre-Closing Tax Period and shall be 

for the benefit of the Sellers to the maximum extent allowable under
applicable Law and (ii) the taxable period of Syntron Corp shall end at the
end of the day on the Closing Date for U.S. federal income Tax purposes (and
the Purchaser shall make any election to include Syntron Corp in an Affiliated
Group filing a consolidated U.S. federal income Tax Return as may be necessary
to cause such taxable period to end at the end of the day on the Closing Date)
and, to the extent permissible under applicable Laws, state and local income
Tax purposes.



(b)Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns.



(i)The Purchaser shall prepare IRS Form 1065 (and any comparable flow through
state and local Tax Returns) of Holdco for the taxable period that includes
the Closing Date (the "Holdco Tax Returns"). All Holdco Tax Returns shall be
prepared in a manner that is consistent with the past custom and practice of
Holdco, except as otherwise required by applicable Law; provided, however,
that, if so elected by the Purchaser, such Holdco Tax Returns shall include an
election under Section 754 of the Code with respect to the acquisition by the
Purchaser of the Purchased Holdco Interests (the "Section 754 Election") to
the extent that Holdco does not already have an election under Section 754 of
the Code in effect as of the Closing Date; provided, further, that the
Purchaser shall be permitted to select in its sole discretion (A) the Person
who shall be designated as Holdco's "partnership representative" within the
meaning of Section 6223(a) of the Code on such Holdco Tax Returns and (B) if
necessary, the individual who will be the "designated individual" within the
meaning of Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 301.6223-1(b)(3) on such
Holdco Tax Returns. Each Holdco Tax Return (and all relevant work papers and
other items required to understand such Holdco Tax Return or other items as
reasonably requested by the Seller Representative) shall be submitted to the
Seller Representative for the Seller Representative's review at least thirty
(30) days prior to the due date of such Holdco Tax Return (as extended if an
extension is filed with respect to such Holdco Tax Return). The Purchaser
shall consider in good faith any reasonable comment provided in writing by the
Seller Representative with respect to any Holdco Tax Return. If the Purchaser
and the Seller Representative cannot, through good-faith negotiation, resolve
any disagreement over any such comment, then their disagreement shall be
resolved by the Dispute Resolution Auditor in accordance with Section 1.05(b),
mutatis mutandis. The resolution of any such dispute shall not delay the
filing of any such Tax Return beyond its due date and, following resolution of
such disagreement, such Tax Return shall be amended if and as necessary to
conform to the resolution of such disagreement.



(ii)The Purchaser shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed,
all other federal, state, local and non-U.S. Tax Returns of the Acquired
Companies for all periods ending prior to or including the Closing Date, the
due date of which is on or after the Closing Date (in each case, to the extent
not already filed prior thereto). All such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a
manner that is consistent with the past custom and practice of the Acquired
Companies, except as otherwise required by applicable Law. At least thirty
(30) days prior to the date on which each such income Tax Return for a Pre-
Closing Tax Period is due and at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date on
which any other Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period is due, the Purchaser
shall submit such Tax Return (and all relevant work papers and other items
required to understand such Tax Return or other items as reasonably requested
by the Seller Representative) to the Seller Representative for the Seller
Representative's review and comment, and the Purchaser shall consider in good
faith such changes to such Tax Returns as are requested by the Seller
Representative prior to filing. If the Purchaser and the Seller Representative
cannot, through good-faith negotiation, resolve any disagreement over any such
comment, then their disagreement shall be resolved by the Dispute Resolution
Auditor in accordance with Section 1.05(b), mutatis mutandis. The resolution
of any such dispute shall not delay the filing of any such Tax Return beyond
its due date and, following resolution of such 

disagreement, such Tax Return shall be amended if and as necessary to conform
to the resolution of such disagreement.



(c)Books and Records; Cooperation. The Purchaser, on the one hand, and the
Seller Representative, on the other hand, shall (i) provide the other party
with such assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection with the
preparation, review of, filing or execution of any Tax Return (including, as
necessary, executing and filing the Tax Returns described in Section 9.01(b))
or any audit or other examination by any taxing authority or judicial or
administrative proceeding relating to Taxes with respect to the Acquired
Companies, and including by executing any powers of attorney or similar
authorizations reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes of this Article
9, and (ii) retain and provide the other party with reasonable access to all
records or information that may be relevant to such Tax Return, audit,
examination or proceeding and make employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided. The Purchaser shall, and shall cause each Acquired Company
to, retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent thereto
relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period until the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations (including any extensions thereof) for the respective
taxable periods.



(d)Transfer Taxes. Each of the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on
the other hand, will be liable for fifty percent (50%) of any stamp Tax, stock
or other transfer Tax, or other similar Tax imposed on the Acquired Companies
or the Sellers as a result of the acquisition by the Purchaser of the
Purchased Interests as contemplated by this Agreement, other than any Chinese
Capital Gains Tax (collectively, "Transfer Taxes"), and any penalties,
interest or additions to Tax with respect to the Transfer Taxes. The parties
hereto agree to cooperate in the filing of any returns with respect to the
Transfer Taxes, including promptly supplying any information in their
possession that is reasonably necessary to complete such returns.



(e)Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter. The Purchaser shall not take any
action with respect to any Acquired Company that would cause the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to constitute part of a transaction that is the
same as, or substantially similar to, the "Intermediary Transaction Tax
Shelter" described in Internal Revenue Service Notices 2001-16 and 2008-111.



(f)Amendments, Elections, and Actions with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods.
Without the prior written consent of the Seller Representative (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Purchaser
will not amend or permit any Acquired Company to amend (i) any Holdco Tax
Return or (ii) any Tax Return relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period. After the
date of this Agreement, neither the Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall, without the written consent of the Seller Representative (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (A) agree to
waive or extend the statute of limitations relating to any Taxes of any
Acquired Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (B) make or change any
election with respect to, or that has any retroactive effect on, any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or (C) voluntarily approach any Tax authority with respect
to any Pre-Closing Tax Period of any Acquired Company or Taxes of any Acquired
Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period. The Purchaser shall not make any
election under Code Section 338 or Code Section 336 (or any similar provision
under state, local or non-U.S. Law) with respect to the acquisition of Syntron
Corp.



(g)Allocation of Certain Taxes.



(i)To the extent it is necessary for purposes of this Agreement to determine
the allocation of Taxes attributable to a Straddle Period, the amount of any
Taxes based on or measured by income, sales, payroll or receipts of the
Acquired Companies for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall 

be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of
business on the Closing Date, and the amount of other Taxes of the Acquired
Companies for a Straddle Period that relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period
shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the
taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of days in such Straddle Period; provided, however, that for purposes
of such allocation, transactions occurring or actions taken on the Closing
Date but after the Closing by the Purchaser or by, or with respect to, any
Acquired Company that are outside the ordinary course of business and not
expressly contemplated by this Agreement shall be treated as occurring after
the Closing Date.



(ii)For purposes of allocating Taxes attributable to any partnerships or other
pass-through entities, the taxable year of any such partnerships or other
pass-through entities shall be treated as ending on the Closing Date (without
regard to any contrary provision of Law).



(iii)For purposes of allocating the items of income, gain, loss, deduction or
credit of Holdco for a Straddle Period, such items shall be allocated between
the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the portion of such Straddle Period beginning
on the day after the Closing Date based on an interim closing of the books of
Holdco as of the close of business on the Closing Date.



(iv)For purposes of computing the Taxes attributable to the two portions of a
taxable period pursuant to this Section 9.01(g), the amount of any item that
is taken into account only once for each taxable period (e.g., the benefit of
graduated tax rates, exemption amounts, etc.) shall be allocated between the
two portions of the period in proportion to the number of days in each
portion.



(h) Allocation of the Purchase Price.



(i)The parties hereto agree that the amount of the Purchase Price allocable to
(and payable by the Purchaser for) the Purchased Syntron Corp Interests is
equal to the Purchased Syntron Corp Interest Purchase Price, and the amount of
the Purchase Price allocable to (and payable by the Purchaser for) the
Purchased Holdco Interests is equal to the Purchased Holdco Interest Purchase
Price.



(ii)Within sixty (60) days after the determination of the Final Net Working
Capital as set forth in Section 1.05 herein, the Purchaser shall deliver to
the Holdco Seller a statement (the "Allocation Statement") setting forth in
reasonable detail the Purchaser's determination of the allocation of the
Purchased Holdco Interest Purchase Price, together with all other items
required to be included as purchase price under the Code, among the assets of
Holdco for Tax purposes, which allocation shall be based upon a third-party
valuation of the assets of Holdco to be obtained by the Purchaser following
the Closing. The Holdco Seller shall have sixty (60) days after receipt of
such Allocation Statement within which to review and consent to the
Purchaser's determination. If the Holdco Seller does not object in writing to
the Allocation Statement in such period it shall become the "Allocation
Schedule". If the Holdco Seller objects in writing to the Allocation Statement
in such period, then the parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any
disagreements with respect to the asset allocation. If the Purchaser and the
Holdco Seller agree to an asset allocation in accordance with the above
procedures, it shall become the Allocation Schedule. If the Purchaser and the
Holdco Seller are unable to agree to an Allocation Schedule within thirty (30)
days of the Holdco Seller's delivery to the Purchaser of its objections to the
Allocation Statement, then (A) the parties hereto shall not be bound by the
Allocation Statement, (B) there shall be no Allocation Schedule for purposes 

of this Agreement, and (C) each party hereto shall be permitted to determine
its own asset allocation for Tax purposes. The parties hereto agree that (x)
under current law and administrative reporting requirements, the IRS Schedule
K-1 (and comparable forms for state and local income Tax purposes) to be
delivered by Holdco to the Holdco Seller attributable to the Holdco Tax
Returns need not include any amounts included in, or attributable to, the
Allocation Statement, and no such amounts are required to be included in the
informational statements required to be filed by the Holdco Seller under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.751-1(a)(3), and (y) if the Purchaser and the
Holdco Seller are unable to agree to an Allocation Schedule in accordance with
the provisions of this Section 9.01(h)(ii), no such amounts shall be included
on such IRS Schedule K-1 or Treasury Regulation Section 1.751-1(a)(3)
statement absent a change in law or in written administrative reporting
requirements.



(iii)If the Purchaser and the Holdco Seller finally agree to an Allocation
Schedule in accordance with Section 9.01(h)(ii), such Allocation Schedule
shall be binding upon the Purchaser, Holdco, the Holdco Seller, Syntron Corp
and their respective Affiliates for all Tax purposes, including for purposes
of Code Section 751 and Code Section 743, and each such Person, as applicable,
(A) shall file, or cause to be filed, all applicable Tax Returns, including
IRS Form 8308 and the informational statements required pursuant to Treasury
Regulation Section 1.751-1(a)(3), in accordance with such Allocation Schedule,
and (B) shall not take or permit its Affiliates to take any position on any
Tax Return or in any proceeding relating to Taxes that is inconsistent with
such Allocation Schedule, unless required by a final determination or
applicable Law.



(iv)Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Purchaser and the
Holdco Seller finally agree to an Allocation Schedule in accordance with
Section 9.01(h)(ii), any subsequent adjustments or amounts properly treated as
adjustments to the Purchase Price shall be incorporated into the Allocation
Schedule as mutually agreed to by the Holdco Seller and the Purchaser, and the
Holdco Seller and the Purchaser shall use good faith efforts to resolve any
dispute with respect thereto.



(i) Carrybacks. No Acquired Company will waive any carryback of any net
operating loss, capital loss or credit on any Tax Return prepared pursuant to
this Section 9.01. Neither the Purchaser nor any of the Acquired Companies
shall make any ratable allocation election under Treasury Regulation
1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) or (iii) with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period. The
Purchaser will cause the Acquired Companies to elect to carry back any item of
loss, deduction or credit from any Transaction Tax Deductions and any losses
from a Pre-Closing Tax Period (which, in the case of a Pre-Closing Tax Period
that is part of a Straddle Period, are not used in the balance of such
Straddle Period) to prior taxable years to the fullest extent permitted by Law
(using any available short-form or accelerated procedures, including the
filing of IRS Form 1139 and any corresponding form for applicable state, local
and foreign purposes, and filing amended Tax Returns to the extent necessary
at the Securityholders' expense), and at the Securityholders' expense, the
Purchaser and the Acquired Companies will prepare and file, or cause to be
prepared and filed, any claim for refund resulting from such carry back as
part of the preparation and filing of the Tax Returns described in Section
9.01(b).



(j) Tax Refunds. The Seller Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders)
shall be entitled to (i) any federal, state, local or other Tax refunds that
are received by the Purchaser or any of the Acquired Companies, and (ii) any
amounts credited in lieu of a refund against any federal, state, local or
other Tax to which the Purchaser or any Acquired Company becomes entitled in a
Tax period ending after the Closing Date, in each case, that are attributable
to Taxes of an Acquired Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period that were paid by
an Acquired Company or the Securityholders prior to the Closing Date or by the
Securityholders after the Closing Date (including pursuant to this Agreement),
except to the extent such Tax 

refunds or credits were included in Net Working Capital (as finally determined
under this Agreement) or are attributable to the carryback of a net operating
loss of an Acquired Company for a taxable period (or portion thereof)
beginning after the Closing Date. The Purchaser shall pay over to the Seller
Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders and to be paid in accordance
with Section 10.02(c)) any such refund or credit, net of any reasonable out-
of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) incurred by the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (including any Acquired Company) in obtaining such refund or
credit, within five (5) days after receipt of such refund or within five (5)
days of filing of the Tax Return reflecting such credit.



(k) Tax Contests.



(i)The Purchaser shall promptly forward, or shall cause to be promptly
forwarded, to the Seller Representative all written notifications from any
taxing authority relating to any Tax liability and/or Tax Return of any
Acquired Company with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period.



(ii)The Seller Representative shall have the right to control, at the sole
expense of the Sellers or the Seller Representative, any audit or examination
by any taxing authority or any other judicial or administrative proceeding
with respect to Taxes, and contest, resolve and defend against any assessment
for additional Taxes, notice of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes of
any Acquired Company (each, a "Tax Matter") for any Pre-Closing Tax Period
(other than a Straddle Period) for which any Seller (or any direct or indirect
owner of a Seller) could reasonably be expected to be liable or responsible;
provided, however, that the Seller Representative shall provide to the
Purchaser (at the Purchaser's expense) reasonable participation rights with
respect to so much of any such Tax Matter that is reasonably likely to affect
the Tax liability of the Purchaser or any Acquired Company for any taxable
period beginning on or after the Closing Date. The Seller Representative, on
behalf of the Securityholders, shall not enter into any settlement of, or
otherwise compromise, any such Tax Matter that would adversely affect the
liability of the Purchaser or any Acquired Company for any Taxes without the
prior written consent of the Purchaser, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.



(iii)The Purchaser shall have the right to control any other Tax Matters
(including Tax Matters for a Straddle Period); provided, however, that the
Purchaser shall provide the Seller Representative (at the expense of the
Sellers or the Seller Representative) reasonable participation rights with
respect to so much of any such Tax Matter that is reasonably likely to affect
the Tax liability of the Sellers (or any direct or indirect owner of a
Seller). The Purchaser shall not enter into any settlement of, or otherwise
compromise, any such Tax Matter that would result in any liability or
responsibility of any Seller (or any direct or indirect owner of a Seller) for
any Taxes without the prior written consent of the Seller Representative,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.



(iv)If, after receiving written notice of a Tax Matter, the Seller
Representative declines to exercise its control rights pursuant to Section
9.01(k)(ii) with respect to such Tax Matter, the Purchaser shall control the
conduct of such Tax Matter.



(1)Other Adjustments. If Taxes for which any Seller (or any direct or indirect
owner of any Seller) is liable or responsible for any Pre-Closing Tax Period
are increased by any audit adjustment and the particular item that produced
such increase in Taxes results in a decrease in the net amount of any other
Taxes of an Acquired Company, the Purchaser or any of the Purchaser's
Affiliates for any prior taxable year, the current taxable year, or the next
two succeeding taxable years (each, an "Audit Adjustment Tax Benefit"), then
the Acquired Company (if an Acquired Company received the Audit Adjustment Tax
Benefit) or the 

Purchaser (if the Purchaser or any of the Purchaser's Affiliates received the
Audit Adjustment Tax Benefit) shall be liable for and shall pay to the Seller
Representative (for the benefit of the Securityholders and to be paid in
accordance with Section 10.02(c)) the amount of such Audit Adjustment Tax
Benefit. Such payment shall be made within five (5) days after the date on
which the applicable Audit Adjustment Tax Benefit is realized.



9.02 Other Agreements.



(a)Subject to the terms of this Agreement (including the limitations set forth
in this Section 9.02), each of the Purchaser, Holdco, Syntron Corp and the
Sellers shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the conditions
to the other parties' obligations to consummate the Closing to be satisfied
and for the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable, and no party shall
take any action designed solely to prevent, impede or delay the Closing.



(b)Each Seller shall, and Holdco shall cause the Acquired Companies to, use
their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, at their expense, all such
waivers, consents or approvals from third parties, and to give all such
notices to third parties, as are required of such Seller or Acquired Company
to be listed in the Disclosure Schedules.



9.03 Confidentiality.



(a)The Purchaser acknowledges that it remains bound by the confidentiality
agreement, dated July 24, 2018, by and between Kadant Inc. and Syntron
Material Handling, LLC (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). From and as of the
Closing, the restrictions on the Purchaser related to non-disclosure of
information of the Acquired Companies contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement shall be deemed to have been terminated by the parties thereto and
shall no longer be binding.



(b)From and after the date hereof, the Sellers shall (and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to) not disclose or make use of any information relating
to the business of the Acquired Companies that is neither generally known by,
nor easily learned or determined by, persons outside the Acquired Companies
(collectively referred to herein as "Proprietary Information"), including: (i)
specifications, manuals, software in various stages of development, and other
technical data; (ii) customer and prospect lists, details of agreements and
communications with customers and prospects, and other customer information;
(iii) sales plans and projections, product pricing information, protocols,
acquisition, expansion, marketing, financial and other business information
and existing and future products and business plans and strategies; (iv) sales
proposals, demonstrations systems and sales material; (v) research and
development; (vi) software systems, computer programs and source codes; (vii)
sources of supply; (viii) identity of specialized consultants and contractors;
(ix) purchasing, operating and other cost data; (x) special customer needs,
cost and pricing data; (xi) employee information (including personnel,
payroll, compensation and benefit data and plans), including all such
information recorded in manuals, memoranda, projections, reports, minutes,
plans, drawings, sketches, designs, data, specifications, software programs
and records; and (xii) the subject matter or terms of this Agreement, in each
case whether or not legended or otherwise identified as Proprietary
Information, as well as such information that is the subject of meetings and
discussions and not recorded. Proprietary Information shall not include
information (A) that was or becomes generally available to the public (other
than as a result of a disclosure by a Seller or an Affiliate thereof), (B)
that becomes available to any Seller or any Affiliate thereof after the
Closing on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Acquired
Companies or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives; provided
that such source is not known by such Seller, Affiliate or Representative to
be bound by a confidentiality agreement with respect to such information, or
otherwise prohibited from disclosing such information to 

such Seller, Affiliate or Representative, or (C) that was or is independently
developed by any Seller or any Affiliate thereof without use of or reference
to the Proprietary Information and without violating the obligations of such
Seller or Affiliate under this Section 9.03. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
Seller shall have any obligation hereunder to keep confidential any of the
Proprietary Information to the extent disclosure thereof is required by Law;
provided, however, that in the event disclosure is required by Law, such
Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to provide the Purchaser with prompt
advance notice of such requirement so that the Purchaser may seek an
appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive
compliance with the terms of this Section 9.03.



(c)The Sellers agree that the remedy at Law for any breach of this Section
9.03 would be inadequate and that the Purchaser shall be entitled to
injunctive relief, without the requirement of posting any bond or other
security, in addition to any other remedy it may have upon breach of any
provision of this Section 9.03.



9.04 No Solicitation or Hiring of Former Employees. Each Seller agrees that,
except as provided by Law, during the period commencing on the Closing Date
and ending on the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date, the Seller
shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates not to), directly or indirectly, (a)
recruit, solicit or induce any person listed on Schedule 9.04 to terminate his
or her employment with, or otherwise cease his or her relationship with, the
Purchaser (or the Acquired Company, as the case may be), or to become an
employee of the Seller or such Affiliate, or (b) hire or employ or use in any
subcontracting arrangement any person listed on Schedule 9.04. The foregoing
provision shall not preclude the Sellers or their Affiliates from conducting
generalized searches for employment (including through the use of general
advertisements, search firms and internet postings) not targeted towards any
Acquired Company or any employees thereof.



9.05 Further Assurances. From time to time, as and when requested by any party
hereto and at such party's expense, any other party shall execute and deliver,
or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments and
shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other actions as such
requesting party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to evidence and
effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, after the Closing, the Sellers shall, at the
Purchaser's request and expense, use commercially reasonable efforts to assist
the Purchaser from time to time in obtaining consent from Grant Thornton to
the incorporation of the reports on the Acquired Company Financials into the
Purchaser's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Without
limitation of the foregoing, each of Andy Blanchard and Paul Downey shall
execute and deliver from time to time such representation letters as Grant
Thornton may reasonably request in connection therewith.



9.06 Provision Respecting Legal Representation. Each of the parties to this
Agreement hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its directors,
members, partners, officers, employees and Affiliates, that Honigman Miller
Schwartz and Cohn LLP ("Honigman") may serve as counsel to each of the
Sellers, on the one hand, and each Acquired Company and each other member of
the Seller Group, on the other hand, in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, and that, following consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, Honigman (or any successor law firm) may
serve as counsel to the Sellers or any director, member, partner, officer,
employee or Affiliate of any Seller, in connection with any litigation, claim
or obligation that is adverse to the Acquired Companies arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(a "Specified Matter") notwithstanding such prior representation of any
Acquired Company, and each of the parties hereto hereby consents to and waives
any conflict of interest with respect to such Specified Matter, to the extent
such conflict arises from Honigman's representation of one or more of the
Acquired Companies prior to the Closing, and each of such parties shall 

cause any Affiliate thereof to consent to and waive any such conflict of
interest. Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby irrevocably
acknowledges and agrees that, solely in the case of a Specified Matter, all
communications prior to the Closing between any Acquired Company and the
Sellers or any other member of the Seller Group, on the one hand, and
Honigman, on the other hand, made in connection with and relating solely to
the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and performance under, or
any pre-Closing dispute or proceeding arising out of or relating to, this
Agreement, any agreements contemplated by this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, are privileged communications between the
Acquired Companies and the Seller Group and such counsel (collectively, the
"Privileged Communications") and thereby property of the Seller Group, and
from and after the Closing none of the Purchaser, any Acquired Company or any
Person purporting to act on behalf of or through the Purchaser or any Acquired
Company, will seek to obtain such communications in any Specified Matter,
whether by seeking a waiver of the attorney-client privilege or through any
other means. As to any such Privileged Communications prior to the Closing
Date, the Purchaser and the Acquired Companies, together with any of their
respective Affiliates, Subsidiaries, successors or assigns, further agree that
no such party may, except to the extent otherwise determined in any related
Legal Proceeding, use or rely on any of the Privileged Communications in any
action after the Closing in which any member of the Seller Group is an adverse
party, without the Sellers Representative's prior written consent.



9.07 Press Releases and Communications. The parties hereto will, and will
cause each of their Affiliates to, and will direct each of their respective
representatives to, maintain the confidentiality of this Agreement and will
not issue, or cause the publication of, any public release or announcement
concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior
written consent of both the Purchaser and the Seller Representative (such
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the foregoing shall not restrict or
prohibit any of the parties hereto from making any release or announcement
required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any securities
exchange (in which case, the party hereto required to make the release or
announcement shall use commercially reasonable efforts to allow the other
party an opportunity to comment on or seek a protective order with respect to
such release or announcement in advance of such issuance), (b) the foregoing
shall not restrict or prohibit the Purchaser from making filings with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission required under applicable securities Laws,
(c) following the initial press release, any party or any party's Affiliates
who is an investment fund may disclose the financial terms of the transactions
contemplated hereby to its Affiliates and any current or potential investor in
such party's fund(s) in connection with fundraising, marketing, informational
or reporting activities in the ordinary course of such party's business, and
(d) the foregoing shall not restrict or prohibit the Purchaser from issuing
any release or making any announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated hereby following the Closing. Each party hereto shall be
responsible for any breach of this Section 9.07 by one or more of its
Affiliates.



9.08 No Claims. Each Seller, by its execution and delivery of this Agreement,
hereby forever waives, releases and discharges (and hereby agrees to cause
each of its Affiliates, representatives (in such capacity), agents, estate,
heirs, successors and assigns to forever waive, release and discharge) with
prejudice each Acquired Company and each of the Affiliates, equityholders,
officers, directors, managers, members, agents, representatives, attorneys,
advisors, predecessors, successors, and assigns of each Acquired Company from

circumstance, occurrence, act or omission that was in existence (or that

under this Agreement as the Seller Representative, in its reasonable
discretion, deems to be in the best interest of the Securityholders; (B)
assert or institute any proceeding; (C) investigate, defend, contest or
litigate any proceeding initiated by the Purchaser (or any of its Affiliates,
and their respective officers, directors, employees or agents following the
Closing), or any other Person, against the Seller Representative, and receive

each case on behalf of the Securityholders, in the name of the Seller

general, to do any and all things and to take any and all actions that the
Seller Representative, in its sole and absolute direction, may consider
necessary or proper or convenient in connection with or to carry out the
activities described in paragraphs (i) through (vii) above and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Related Documents.



(c)All decisions and actions by the Seller Representative (to the extent
authorized by this Agreement) shall be binding upon all of the Securityholders
and no Securityholder shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or
otherwise contest the same.



(d)In the event the Seller Representative becomes unable to perform its
responsibilities hereunder or resigns from such position, the Sellers (acting
by the vote of a majority of the Pre-Closing Percentage Interests of all
Sellers) shall select another representative to fill the vacancy of the Seller
Representative, and such substituted representative shall, following receipt
by the Purchaser of written notice thereof, be deemed to be a Seller
Representative for all purposes under this Agreement and the Related
Documents.



(e)The Purchaser (and the Acquired Companies following the Closing) shall be
entitled to rely conclusively upon the communications, instructions and
decisions of the Seller Representative relating to the foregoing as the
communications, instructions and decisions of the Securityholders. Neither the 

Purchaser nor (following the Closing) any of the Acquired Companies shall be
held liable or accountable in any manner for any act or omission of the Seller
Representative in such capacity.



(f)The Purchaser and (following the Closing) the Acquired Companies shall be
entitled to unconditionally assume that any action taken or omitted, or any
document executed by, Levine Leichtman Capital Partners Private Capital
Solutions, L.P., purporting to act as the Seller Representative under or
pursuant to this Agreement or the Related Documents or in connection with any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement has been unconditionally
authorized by the Securityholders to be taken, omitted to be taken, or
executed on their behalf so that they will be legally bound thereby, and no
Securityholder shall institute any Legal Proceeding against the Purchaser (or
the Acquired Companies following the Closing) or any of their respective
Affiliates alleging that Levine Leichtman Capital Partners Private Capital
Solutions, L.P. did not have the authority to act as the Seller Representative
on behalf of the Securityholders in connection with any such action, omission
or execution. No modification or revocation of the power of attorney granted
by the Securityholders herein to Levine Leichtman Capital Partners Private
Capital Solutions, L.P. to serve as the Seller Representative shall be
effective as against the Purchaser until the Purchaser has received a document
signed by all of the Securityholders effecting said modification or
revocation. The Purchaser and (following the Closing) the Acquired Companies
and their respective Affiliates are hereby relieved from any liability to any
Person for any acts done by the Seller Representative and any acts done by the
Purchaser and (following the Closing) the Acquired Companies in accordance
with any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Seller Representative.



(g)The Seller Representative (in its capacity as such) shall treat
confidentially and not disclose any nonpublic information received from or on
behalf of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Acquired Companies) to anyone except (i) in connection with any
disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement and (ii) on a
need-to-know basis to representatives that are advised of the confidential
nature of such information and are subject to a binding obligation to keep
such information confidential.



10.02 Representative Expense Amount; Post-Closing Disbursements to
Securityholders.



(a)The Representative Expense Amount shall be held by the Seller
Representative in the Representative Expense Account for the benefit of the
Securityholders for reimbursements payable to the Seller Representative under
this Article 10, or, as provided below, the payment of fees, commissions or
other compensation to the Seller Representative; provided that such
reimbursements payable to the Seller Representative are pursuant to fees,
commissions or other compensation borne by all of the Securityholders and are
not the fees, commissions or other compensation of any particular
Securityholder in his, her or its individual capacity.



(b)Following the date on which the Seller Representative has determined (in
its sole discretion) that it is appropriate to release such funds, the Seller
Representative shall pay the then-remaining amount of the Representative
Expense Amount, if any, in accordance with Section 10.02(c).



(c)To the extent that the Securityholders are entitled to any payment after
the Closing Date pursuant to Section 1.05 or Section 10.02(b), such payment
shall be made by the Seller Representative to the Securityholders on a pro-
rata basis according to each Securityholder's Post-Closing Percentage
Interest; provided that to the extent that any Optionholder is entitled to any
such payment, such payment shall be paid by or on behalf of Holdco through its
payroll system to each such Optionholder who has complied with the terms of
the applicable Option Surrender Agreement, net of any applicable withholding
Tax. The Purchaser and its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Acquired Companies) shall be entitled to rely conclusively 

on the Post-Closing Percentage Interests set forth on Exhibit E and, as
between the Securityholders, on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other
hand, any amounts delivered by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to any
Securityholder (or delivered by the Purchaser to the Seller Representative for
delivery) in accordance with such Post-Closing Percentage Interests shall be
deemed for all purposes to have been delivered to the applicable
Securityholder in full satisfaction of the obligations of the Purchaser.



10.3 Compensation; Exculpation.



(a)The Seller Representative shall not be paid a fee for the performance of
services hereunder.



(b)The Seller Representative shall not have by reason of this Agreement a
fiduciary relationship in respect of any Securityholder. The Seller
Representative shall not be liable to the Securityholders for any
apportionment or distribution of payments made by the Seller Representative in
good faith, and if any such apportionment or distribution is subsequently
determined to have been made in error, the sole recourse of any Securityholder
to whom payment was due, but not made, shall be to recover from other
Securityholders any payment in excess of the amount to which they are
determined to have been entitled. Neither the Seller Representative nor any
agent, employee or any other representative employed by it shall incur any
liability to any Securityholder by virtue of the failure or refusal of the
Seller Representative for any reason to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or relating to the performance of its other
duties hereunder, except for actions or omissions constituting Actual Fraud.
In dealing with this Agreement and any Related Documents, and in exercising or
failing to exercise all or any of the powers conferred upon the Seller
Representative hereunder or thereunder, the Seller Representative shall be
entitled to rely on the advice of counsel, public accountants or other
independent experts experienced in the matter at issue, and any error in
judgment or other act or omission of the Seller Representative pursuant to
such advice shall in no event subject the Seller Representative to liability
to any Securityholder unless such actions or omissions constitute Actual
Fraud.



(c)Any action taken by the Seller Representative on behalf of any
Securityholder pursuant to Section 10.01 (an "Authorized Action") shall be
binding on such Securityholder as fully as if such Securityholder had taken
such Authorized Action. Each Securityholder shall severally indemnify and hold
harmless the Seller Representative against all expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement, actually
and reasonably incurred by the Seller Representative in acting as the Seller
Representative hereunder, including in connection with any action, suit or
proceeding to which the Seller Representative is made a party by reason of the
fact that it is or was acting as the Seller Representative pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement.



(d)All of the immunities and powers granted to the Seller Representative under
this Agreement shall terminate upon any termination of this Agreement.



(e)The adoption and execution of this Agreement shall also be deemed to
constitute approval of all arrangements relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to the provisions hereof binding upon the
Securityholders, including this Section 10.03.



ARTICLE 11

INDEMNIFICATION



11.01 Indemnification by the Securityholders. Each Securityholder shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser, on a basis providing for shared
culpability in accordance with each 

Securityholder's Post-Closing Percentage Interest (except as otherwise
provided in Section 11.01(a)), in respect of and against, and will compensate
and reimburse the Purchaser for, any and all Damages incurred or suffered by
any Purchaser Indemnified Party (regardless of whether such Damages relate to
any Third Party Action) resulting from, relating to or constituting:



(a)any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of (i) any
Securityholder (with respect to which such Securityholder's indemnification
obligation (other than with respect to recovery against the funds held in the
Indemnity Escrow Account and, if applicable, the Interim Breach Escrow
Account) shall be several and not joint) and (ii) any Acquired Company, in
each case contained in this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument
furnished to the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement;



(b)any failure to perform any covenant or agreement of any Securityholder or
any Acquired Company (if such covenant or agreement requires performance by
such Acquired Company at or prior to the Closing) contained in this Agreement
or any other agreement or instrument furnished to the Purchaser pursuant to
this Agreement;



(c)any Indebtedness and any Transaction Expenses, in each case to the extent
in excess of the amounts included in the final determination of the Purchase
Price;



(d)(i) any and all Taxes due and payable by any Acquired Company for, or
allocated in accordance with Section 9.01(g) to, any Pre-Closing Tax Period;
(ii) any Taxes for which any Acquired Company has any liability under Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or under any comparable or similar provision of
state, local or foreign Laws as a result of being a member of an affiliated,
consolidated, combined, unitary or similar group on or prior to the Closing
Date (other than any group which includes the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates); (iii) any Taxes of any Person imposed on any Acquired Company as
a transferee or successor, pursuant to any contractual obligation, or
otherwise, which Tax is related to the operations of any Acquired Company on
or prior to the Closing Date or an event or transaction occurring before the
Closing; (iv) any Transfer Taxes allocated to the Sellers pursuant to Section
9.01(d); and (v) any Chinese Capital Gains Tax; provided that the
Securityholders' obligations under this Section 11.01(d) shall not include any
Taxes (A) that result from the manner in which the Purchaser finances its
obligations under this Agreement, (B) that are attributable to any
transactions outside the ordinary course of business occurring on the Closing
Date but after the Closing, (C) to the extent such Taxes are included in the
Net Working Capital and/or the Transaction Expenses, as finally determined
under this Agreement, or (D) that are attributable to a breach of Section
9.01(f);



(e)the Restructuring Transactions and the Distribution; or



(f)any Actual Fraud or Knowing Misrepresentation on the part of any Acquired
Company or any Securityholder in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.



11.02 Indemnification by the Purchaser. The Purchaser shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Securityholders in respect of and against, and will compensate
and reimburse the Securityholders for, any and all Damages incurred or
suffered by any Securityholders (regardless of whether such Damages relate to
any Third Party Action) resulting from, relating to or constituting:



(a)any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of the
Purchaser contained in this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument
furnished to the Seller Representative by the Purchaser pursuant to this
Agreement; or 

(b)any failure to perform any covenant or agreement of the Purchaser contained
in this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument furnished to the Seller
Representative by the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement.



11.03 Indemnification Claims.



(a)Any Person making a claim for indemnification under Section 11.01 or
Section 11.02 (each, an "Indemnitee") shall give written notification to the
party or parties from which indemnification is sought (the "Indemnitor") of
the commencement of any Third Party Action. Such notification shall be given
within twenty (20) days after receipt by the Indemnitee of notice of such
Third Party Action and shall describe in reasonable detail (to the extent then
known by the Indemnitee) the facts constituting the basis for such Third Party
Action and the amount of the claimed damages and, subsequent to such delivery,
upon the request of the Indemnitor, the Indemnitee shall make available to the
Indemnitor such information as the Indemnitee may have with respect to such
Third Party Action (including copies of any summons, complaint or other
pleading which may have been served on such party and any written claim,
demand, invoice, billing or other document evidencing or asserting the same).
No delay or failure on the part of an Indemnitee in so notifying the
Indemnitor in accordance with this Section 11.03 shall relieve the Indemnitor
of any liability or obligation hereunder except to the extent of any damage or
liability caused by or arising out of such delay or failure.

(b)Within twenty (20) days after the delivery of such notification, the
Indemnitor may, upon written notice thereof to the Indemnitee (subject to the
rights of the insurer under the RandW Policy to control the defense of Third
Party Actions covered by such RandW Policy), assume control of the defense of
such Third Party Action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnitee; provided that (i) the Indemnitor may only assume control of such
defense if the Indemnitor acknowledges in writing to the Indemnitee that any
damages, fines, costs or other liabilities that may be assessed against the
Indemnitee in connection with such Third Party Action constitute Damages for
which the Indemnitor shall fully indemnify, subject to the limitations
provided herein, the Indemnitee pursuant to this Article 11 and, in each case
where the Securityholders are the Indemnitor, (A) the ad damnum in such Third
Party Action, together with the estimated costs of defense thereof, and the
Claimed Amount with respect to any unresolved claims for indemnification then
pending, is less than or equal to (1) the current balance of the Indemnity
Escrow Account, or (2) with respect to an Interim Breach Claim, the current
balance of the Interim Breach Escrow Account plus the current balance of the
Indemnity Escrow Account, and (B) an adverse resolution of the Third Party
Action would not have a material adverse effect on the goodwill or reputation
of the Indemnitee or the business, operations or future conduct of the
Indemnitee, and (ii) the Indemnitor may not assume control of the defense of
any Third Party Action involving any Governmental Authority or criminal
liability or in which equitable relief is sought against the Indemnitee or any
of the Subsidiaries. If the Indemnitor does not, or is not permitted under the
terms hereof to, so assume control of the defense of a Third Party Action, the
Indemnitee shall control such defense. The Non-controlling Party may
participate in such defense at its own expense. The Controlling Party shall
keep the Non-controlling Party advised of the status of such Third Party
Action and the defense thereof and shall consider in good faith
recommendations made by the Non-controlling Party with respect thereto. The
Non-controlling Party shall furnish the Controlling Party with such
information as it may have with respect to such Third Party Action (including
copies of any summons, complaint or other pleading which may have been served
on such party and any written claim, demand, invoice, billing or other
document evidencing or asserting the same) and shall otherwise cooperate with
and assist the Controlling Party in the defense of such Third Party Action.
The reasonably incurred and documented fees and expenses of counsel to the
Indemnitee with respect to a Third Party Action shall be considered Damages
for purposes of this Agreement if (x) the Indemnitee controls the defense of
such Third Party Action pursuant to the terms of this Section 11.03(b) or (y)
the Indemnitor assumes control of such defense and counsel for the Indemnitee
reasonably concludes and advises the Indemnitee that the Indemnitor 

and the Indemnitee have conflicting interests or different defenses available
with respect to such Third Party Action. Except as provided in Section
11.03(f), the Indemnitee shall not agree to any settlement of, or the entry of
any judgment arising from, any such Third Party Action without the prior
written consent of the Indemnitor, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. The Indemnitor shall not agree to any settlement of,
or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party Action without the
prior written consent of the Indemnitee, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. This Section 11.03(b) shall not apply with
respect to any Tax Matter, which shall be governed by Section 9.01(k).



(c)In order to seek indemnification under this Article 11, the Indemnitee
shall deliver a Claim Notice to the Indemnitor.



(d)Within twenty (20) days after the delivery of a Claim Notice, the
Indemnitor shall deliver to the Indemnitee a Response, in which the Indemnitor
shall: (i) agree that the Indemnitee is entitled to receive all of the Claimed
Amount (in which case the Indemnitor shall, within two (2) Business Days after
delivery of the Response, pay to the Indemnitee, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, the Claimed Amount; provided that if the
Purchaser is the Indemnitee and is seeking recovery from the Indemnity Escrow
Account and/or the Interim Breach Escrow Account, the Seller Representative
and the Purchaser shall deliver to the Escrow Agent by such date a written
notice executed by the Purchaser and the Seller Representative instructing the
Escrow Agent to disburse to the Purchaser from the Indemnity Escrow Account
and/or the Interim Breach Escrow Account, as applicable, an amount in cash
equal to the Claimed Amount), (ii) agree that the Indemnitee is entitled to
receive a portion of the Claimed Amount (such portion of the Claimed Amount,
the "Agreed Amount") (in which case the Indemnitor shall, within two (2)
Business Days after delivery of the Response, pay to the Indemnitee, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, the Agreed Amount; provided that if
the Purchaser is the Indemnitee and is seeking recovery from the Indemnity
Escrow Account and/or (with respect to an Interim Breach Claim only) the
Interim Breach Escrow Account, the Seller Representative and the Purchaser
shall deliver to the Escrow Agent by such date a written notice executed by
the Purchaser and the Seller Representative instructing the Escrow Agent to
disburse to the Purchaser from the Indemnity Escrow Account and/or (with
respect to an Interim Breach Claim only) the Interim Breach Escrow Account, as
applicable, an amount in cash equal to the Agreed Amount), or (iii) dispute
that the Indemnitee is entitled to receive any of the Claimed Amount. If no
Response is delivered by the Indemnitor within such twenty (20)-day period,
the Indemnitee shall deliver a written notice informing the Indemnitor of its
failure to timely deliver such Response, and if a Response is not delivered
within ten (10) days following the date such written notice is delivered by
the Indemnitee, then the Indemnitor shall be deemed to have agreed that such
portion of the Claimed Amount as may be recovered from the Indemnity Escrow
Account and/or the Interim Breach Escrow Account, as applicable, is owed to
the Indemnitee. Acceptance (or deemed acceptance) by the Indemnitee of partial
payment of any Claimed Amount shall be without prejudice to the Indemnitee's
right to claim the balance of any such Claimed Amount.



(e)Subject to Section 1.05(e), in the event of any Dispute, the Indemnitee
shall promptly consult with the Indemnitor with respect to such points of
disagreement in an effort to resolve the Dispute. Except as otherwise set
forth in this Agreement, if any such Dispute cannot be resolved by the parties
within thirty (30) calendar days after the Indemnitee receives the Response
containing the Dispute from the Indemnitor, then, at the election of one or
both parties, the Dispute shall be resolved in accordance with Section 13.16,
subject to any other terms, conditions and limitations of this Agreement,
including Section 11.05 and Article 13. Promptly (and in any event within
twenty (20) days) following the resolution of the Dispute (whether by mutual
agreement, judicial decision or otherwise), the Indemnitor shall pay to the
Indemnitee, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the amount (if
any) that the Indemnitee is entitled to receive pursuant to such resolution;
provided that if the Purchaser is the Indemnitee and is seeking recovery 

from the Indemnity Escrow Account and/or (with respect to an Interim Breach
Claim only) the Interim Breach Escrow Account, the Seller Representative and
the Purchaser shall promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days)
deliver to the Escrow Agent a written notice executed by the Purchaser and the
Seller Representative instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse to the
Purchaser from the Indemnity Escrow Account and/or (with respect to an Interim
Breach Claim only) the Interim Breach Escrow Account, as applicable, the
amount (if any) that the Purchaser is entitled to receive pursuant to such
resolution.



(f)Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 11.03, if a third
party asserts (other than by means of a lawsuit) that any Purchaser
Indemnified Party is liable to such third party for a monetary or other
obligation which may constitute or result in Damages for which a Purchaser
Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article
11, and the Purchaser reasonably determines that it has a valid business
reason to fulfill such obligation, then (i) the Purchaser shall be entitled to
satisfy such obligation, without prior notice to or consent from the Seller
Representative, (ii) the Purchaser may subsequently make a claim for
indemnification in accordance with the provisions of this Article 11, and
(iii) the Purchaser shall be reimbursed, in accordance with the provisions of
this Article 11, for any such Damages for which it is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Article 11 (subject to the right of the
Seller Representative to dispute the applicable Purchaser Indemnified Party's
entitlement to indemnification, or the amount for which it is entitled to
indemnification, under the terms of this Article 11).



(g)Without limiting Article 10, the Seller Representative shall have full
power and authority on behalf of each Securityholder to take any and all
actions on behalf of, execute any and all instruments on behalf of, and
execute or waive any and all rights of, the Securityholders under this Article
11. For purposes of this Article 11, (i) if any or all of the Securityholders
comprise the Indemnitor, any references to the Indemnitor (except provisions
relating to an obligation to make any payments) shall be deemed to refer to
the Seller Representative, and (ii) if any or all of the Securityholders
comprise the Indemnitee, any references to the Indemnitee (except provisions
relating to an obligation to make or a right to receive any payments ) shall
be deemed to refer to the Seller Representative. The Purchaser and the Seller
Representative shall be the only Persons entitled to assert (and shall act on
behalf of all Indemnitees in the case of) any claim with respect to which a
Purchaser Indemnified Party or a Securityholder Indemnified Party,
respectively, is seeking indemnification under Section 11.01 or Section 11.02.



11.04 Survival of Representations and Warranties, Covenants and Agreements.



(a)Unless otherwise specified in this Section 11.04 or elsewhere in this
Agreement, all provisions of this Agreement shall survive the Closing and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with their terms until the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations; provided, however, that, except in the
case of Actual Fraud or Knowing Misrepresentation, (i) the representations and
warranties of Holdco, Syntron Corp and the Sellers set forth in Article 3 and
Article 5, other than the Fundamental Representations, shall survive until the

expiration of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, either a
Claim Notice based upon a breach of such representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement or an Expected Claim Notice based upon a breach of such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement then the applicable
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall survive until, but only
for purposes of, the resolution of the matter covered by such notice. If the
legal proceeding or written claim with respect to which an Expected Claim
Notice has been given is definitively withdrawn or resolved in favor of the
Indemnitee, the Indemnitee shall promptly so notify the Indemnitor.



11.05 Limitations and Other Matters.



(a)Except in the case of Actual Fraud or Knowing Misrepresentation:



(i)(A) the aggregate liability of the Securityholders under Section 11.01(a),
other than in cases of breaches of or inaccuracies in any of the Fundamental

Representations, shall not exceed the General Rep Deductible/Cap Amount; and

(in cases of breaches of or inaccuracies in any of the Fundamental
Representations) and the remainder of Section 11.01 shall not exceed the
aggregate net proceeds actually received by the Securityholders under this
Agreement (including any amounts held in the Escrow Accounts), and the
liability of any individual Securityholder under Section 11.01 shall not
exceed the portion of such net proceeds that such Securityholder actually
receives (including such Securityholder's share of any amounts held in the
Escrow Accounts), and (B) the aggregate liability of the Purchaser under
Section 11.02(a) (in cases of breaches of or inaccuracies in any of the
Fundamental Purchaser Representations) and Section 11.02(b) shall not exceed
the aggregate net proceeds actually received by the Securityholders under this
Agreement (including any amounts held in the Escrow Accounts). 

(b)With respect to claims for Damages arising under Section 11.01(a) or
Section 11.02(a), the Indemnitor shall not be liable for any such Damages
until the aggregate amount of all such Damages exceeds an amount equal to the
General Rep Deductible/Cap Amount (at which point the Indemnitor shall become
liable for such excess); provided that the limitation set forth in this
sentence shall not apply to (i) claims based on Actual Fraud or Knowing
Misrepresentation or (ii) breaches of or inaccuracies in any of the
Fundamental Representations or the Fundamental Purchaser Representations, as
applicable.



(c)The Purchaser shall not attempt to collect any Damages directly from any
Securityholder unless there are insufficient unclaimed funds remaining in the
Indemnity Escrow Account and the Interim Breach Escrow Account (which funds
remaining in the Interim Breach Escrow Account are available for recovery only
in connection with an Interim Breach Claim) to satisfy such Damages pursuant
to the Escrow Agreement. Except for the remaining funds in the Interim Breach
Escrow Account (which funds are available only for recovery in connection with
an Interim Breach Claim), the remaining funds in the Indemnity Escrow Account
shall serve as the Purchaser's sole source of recovery with respect to claims
for Damages arising under Section 11.01(a), other than in cases of Actual
Fraud, Knowing Misrepresentation or breaches of or inaccuracies in any of the
Fundamental Representations. With respect to claims for Damages arising under
Section 11.01(a) in cases of breaches of or inaccuracies in any of the
Fundamental Representations only or Section 11.01(d) (in each case, solely to
the extent such claims are not expressly excluded under the RandW Policy), the
Purchaser shall be required to recover any such Damages in the following
order: (i) from the Securityholders (in accordance with Section 11.01) until
the retention under the RandW Policy has been satisfied (which amount shall be
first collected from the remaining funds in the Interim Breach Escrow Account
(which funds are available only for recovery in connection with an Interim
Breach Claim), and next from the Indemnity Escrow Account as provided in the
immediately preceding sentence), then (ii) by seeking recovery under the RandW
Policy until the RandW Policy has been Exhausted with respect to such claim, and
then (iii) directly from the Securityholders (in accordance with Section
11.01). For purposes of this Agreement, "Exhausted" means that the Purchaser
has utilized commercially reasonable efforts (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, shall not require actual or threatened litigation) to pursue coverage
and recovery under the RandW Policy or the applicable policy limit (taking into
account the amount of any other pending claims thereunder) has been exhausted.



(d)The amount of any Damages for which an Indemnitor is otherwise liable under
this Article 11 shall be reduced by the amount of any proceeds actually
received by the Indemnitee under (i) any indemnity, contribution or similar
agreement with an unaffiliated third party or (ii) insurance policies
maintained with any unaffiliated third party insurer with respect to the
matter giving rise to such Damages (net of any costs of collection and
increase in insurance premiums). No Indemnitee and none of its Affiliates
shall have any obligation to pursue any claims under any insurance policies;
provided that the Purchaser shall submit a claim under the RandW Policy for any
matter giving rise to indemnification hereunder that is insurable thereunder
(after taking into account any deductibles, retentions or other limitations
applicable to the RandW Policy) and shall use commercially reasonable efforts
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not require actual or threatened
litigation) to pursue coverage and recovery under the RandW Policy for such a
matter.



(e)If the Indemnitee receives an indemnification payment pursuant to this
Agreement and later receives indemnity proceeds or insurance proceeds
(including pursuant to the RandW Policy) in respect of the related Damages, the
Indemnitee shall promptly pay to the Indemnitor an amount equal to the lesser
of (i) the actual amount of such insurance proceeds (net of any costs of
collection and increase in insurance premiums), if any, or (ii) the actual
amount of the indemnification payment previously paid by the Indemnitor with
respect to such Damages (excluding any amount paid by the Securityholders that
is allocable to the retention under the RandW Policy or recoveries in excess of
the RandW Policy's limit). 



(f)The rights to indemnification set forth in this Article 11 shall not be
affected by any investigation conducted by or on behalf of any Purchaser
Indemnified Party or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) by
any Purchaser Indemnified Party, whether before or after the date of this
Agreement, with respect to the inaccuracy or noncompliance with any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation which is the subject of
indemnification hereunder.



(g)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, for purposes of
determining (i) whether there has been a breach of any representation or
warranty set forth in Article 3 or Article 5 and (ii) the amount of Damages
for which any Purchaser Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification
under this Article 11, each such representation or warranty (other than the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.05(a)) shall be deemed
to have been made without any qualifications or limitations as to materiality
(including any qualifications or limitations made by reference to a Material
Adverse Effect).



(h)Except in cases of (i) the Purchase Price dispute resolution provisions in
Section 1.05, (ii) Actual Fraud or Knowing Misrepresentation, and (iii) claims
for specific performance, the rights of the Purchaser and the Securityholders
under this Article 11 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Purchaser
and the Securityholders with respect to claims resulting from or relating to
any misrepresentation, breach of warranty or failure to perform any covenant
or agreement of the other parties hereto contained in this Agreement, the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement, or the performance by the parties
of their respective obligations hereunder.



(i)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Purchaser shall not have any right to indemnification under this Agreement
with respect to any Damages or alleged Damages to the extent (i) such matter
was included as a current liability in the calculation of the Final Net
Working Capital or (ii) such matter was an item included in the Final
Indebtedness or the Final Transaction Expenses (in each case, as finally
determined pursuant to Section 1.05); provided that nothing in this first
sentence of this Section 11.05(i) shall limit the Purchaser's indemnification
rights with respect to Section 11.01(c). For the avoidance of doubt, in no
event shall the Purchaser be entitled to receive any double recovery for the
same amounts under both Section 1.05 and Section 11.01. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, there shall be no recovery for any Taxes or
Damages (A) based on any claim of the unavailability in a Tax period (or
portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date of any net operating loss,
capital loss, Tax credit carryover or other Tax asset or attribute generated
or arising in a Pre-Closing Tax Period, or (B) attributable to a Tax period
(or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date resulting from a breach
of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty set forth in Section 3.07
(other than Sections 3.07(d), 3.07(h), 3.07(j), 3.07(k), 3.07(m) and/or
3.07(o)). The Purchaser may not avoid the limitations on liability set forth
in this Section 11.05 by seeking damages for breach of contract or tort or
pursuant to any other theory of liability.



(j)Any payments made to a party pursuant to this Article 11 shall be treated
as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes to the extent
permitted by Law. Each of the parties shall file all Tax Returns in a manner
consistent with the foregoing.



11.06 Indemnity Escrow Account Release. (a) Except for the Purchaser pursuant
to Section 1.04(a)(iii), no Person (including, without limitation, the
Securityholder Indemnified Parties) shall have any obligation to fund the
Escrow Amount, and (b) except for any amounts with respect to which the
Purchaser shall have, prior to the General Survival Period Termination Date,
previously made a claim pursuant to the procedures set forth in this Article
11 and for which the obligations to indemnify, if any, shall not have been 

previously satisfied from the Indemnity Escrow Account (the "Outstanding
Escrow Claims"), title and all rights to any excess funds remaining in the
Indemnity Escrow Account shall transfer to the Seller Representative (for the
benefit of the Securityholders) on the day after the General Survival Period
Termination Date and the Purchaser and the Seller Representative shall deliver
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to cause the Escrow Agent to
promptly release any amount in the Indemnity Escrow Account in excess of the
Outstanding Escrow Claims to the Seller Representative (for the benefit of the
Securityholders). As soon as any Outstanding Escrow Claim is resolved pursuant
to the procedures set forth in this Article 11, the Purchaser and the Seller
Representative shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to
cause the Escrow Agent to release any remaining amounts in the Indemnity
Escrow Account held solely in respect of such Outstanding Escrow Claim
pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement to the Seller Representative
(for the benefit of the Securityholders).



11.07 Interim Breach Escrow Account Funding and Release. If the Purchaser
shall have made, prior to the Closing, one or more Interim Breach Claims that
are not, in the Purchaser's good faith judgment, fully resolved prior to the
Closing, then the Interim Breach Escrow Amount shall be funded into the
Interim Breach Escrow Account at the Closing in accordance with Section
1.04(a)(iii). Upon final resolution of an Interim Breach Claim, title and all
rights to any excess funds remaining in the Interim Breach Escrow Account
(excluding funds held in respect of any other Interim Breach Claim(s) that
remain outstanding) shall transfer to the Seller Representative (for the
benefit of the Securityholders) on the day after any outstanding Interim
Breach Claim is finally resolved pursuant to the procedures set forth in this
Article 11 and the Purchaser and the Seller Representative shall deliver joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent to cause the Escrow Agent to release
any remaining amounts in the Interim Breach Escrow Account held solely in
respect of such resolved Interim Breach Claim pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement to the Seller Representative (for the benefit of the
Securityholders).

13.04 Assignment. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, except that neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be
assigned or delegated (a) by the Purchaser or, after the Closing, Holdco or
Syntron Corp, without the prior written consent of the Seller Representative,
or (b) by any of the Sellers, the Seller Representative or, prior to the
Closing, Holdco or Syntron Corp, without the prior written consent of the

prior to seeking any remedies against the assigning or transferring party
permitted under or pursuant to this Agreement. Any attempted assignment or
transfer in violation of this Section 13.04 shall be null and void.



13.05 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall
be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or
invalid under applicable Law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the
extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder

any term or provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto
agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to limit
the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any
invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is
valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of
the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be
enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the
power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace
such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable
term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic,
business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term.

subheadings contained in this Agreement and the Exhibits and Disclosure
Schedules hereto are solely for the purpose of reference, are not part of the

this Agreement refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" 

degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase does not
mean simply "if". Definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to

supplemented or modified from time to time. References to a Person are also to
its permitted successors and assigns. References to a federal, state, local or
foreign Law include any rules, regulations and delegated legislation issued
thereunder. All references to "the ordinary course of business" shall be
deemed references to the ordinary course of business consistent with past

the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and
no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any Person. The

Schedules or Exhibits hereto is not intended to imply that the amounts, or
higher or lower amounts, or the items so included, or other items, are or are
not required to be disclosed (including, without limitation, whether such
amounts or items are required to be disclosed as material or threatened) or
are within or outside of the ordinary course of business, and no Person shall
use the fact of the setting of the amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any
item in this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules or Exhibits in any dispute
or controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or
matter not described or included in this Agreement or in any Disclosure
Schedule or Exhibit is or is not required to be disclosed (including whether
the amount or items are required to be disclosed as material or threatened) or
is within or outside of the ordinary course of business for purposes of this
Agreement. The information contained in this Agreement and in the Disclosure
Schedules and Exhibits hereto is disclosed solely for purposes of this
Agreement, and no information contained herein or therein shall be deemed to
be an admission by any party hereto to any third party of any matter
whatsoever (including, without limitation, any violation of Law or breach of
contract).



13.08 Amendment and Waiver. Any provision of this Agreement or the Disclosure
Schedules or Exhibits hereto may be amended only in a writing signed by the
Purchaser, Holdco, Syntron Corp and the Seller Representative. No waiver of
any provision hereunder, or any breach, default or misrepresentation
hereunder, shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by
the party making such waiver, and no such waiver shall extend to or affect in
any way any other provision or prior or subsequent breach, default or
misrepresentation.

remedy, claim or benefit under or with respect to this Agreement or any
provision of this Agreement.

WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF

REGARDLESS OF WHICH PARTY INITIATES SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING. EACH PARTY TO
THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION
OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT THE
PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS
WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES HERETO TO THE IRREVOCABLE
WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the request of any
party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument, each other party hereto

other parties. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument shall
raise the use of Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature or the fact that

extent such defense relates to lack of authenticity.

any one of which need not contain the signature of more than one party, but

damages or posting a bond or other form of security, this being in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement, and (b) the
right of specific performance and other equitable relief is an integral part
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right,
none of the parties hereto would have entered into this Agreement. The parties
hereto agree not to assert that a remedy of specific performance is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable, and not to assert that
a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy or that the
parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at law; provided that the foregoing
shall not prohibit the Purchaser from asserting that this Agreement does not
require it to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (or to take any
other action) and to assert equitable defenses (such as "unclean hands"), but
excluding the assertion that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any party
seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in
accordance with this Section 13.17 shall not be required to provide any bond
or other security in connection with any such order or injunction. If, on or
prior to the End Date, any party hereto brings any action, in each case in
accordance with Section 13.16, to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions hereof by any other party, the End Date shall
automatically be extended (i) for the period during which such action is
pending, plus ten (10) Business Days, or (ii) by such other time period
established by the court presiding over such action, as the case may be;
provided, however, that the Purchaser shall not be required to effect the
Closing during such an extension prior to the date that is three (3) Business
Days following the receipt by the Purchaser of the audited consolidated
balance sheet of Syntron Material Handling Holdings, LLC and its Subsidiaries
as of December 31, 2018 and the related audited statement of income and cash
flows for the fiscal year then ended (such date, the "New End Date"), and such
an extension of the End Date shall be further extended until the New End Date;
provided, further, that in no event shall the End Date be extended pursuant to
this Section 13.17 beyond June 30, 2019. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, in no event shall this Section 13.17 be used to require any
party hereto to remedy any breach of any representation or warranty made
herein unless a covenant made herein separately requires such action.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Equity Purchase
Agreement on the day and year first written above.

(as defined below), and the Indemnity Escrow Amount (as defined below) in
segregated escrow accounts to be held by Escrow Agent pursuant to this
Agreement for the purposes of (i) providing security for any adjustment to the
amount of the Preliminary Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.5 of the
Underlying Agreement, and (ii) securing the indemnification obligations of the
Securityholders (as defined in the Underlying Agreement) set forth in Article
11 of the Underlying Agreement.



C. Escrow Agent has agreed to accept, hold, and disburse the funds deposited
with it and any earnings thereon in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.



D. The Parties acknowledge that (i) Escrow Agent is not a party to and has no
duties or obligations under the Underlying Agreement, (ii) all references in
this Agreement to the Underlying Agreement are solely for the convenience of
the Parties, and (iii) Escrow Agent shall have no implied duties beyond the
express duties set forth in this Agreement.



NOW THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, for
themselves, their successors and assigns, hereby agree as follows:



1. Definitions. The following terms shall have the following meanings when used herein:





"Adjustment Escrow Amount" means the sum of $500,000.00 deposited with Escrow
Agent pursuant to Section 3. 



"Business Day" shall mean any day, other than a Saturday, Sunday or legal
holiday, on which Escrow Agent at its location identified in Section 14 is

"Escrow Funds" shall mean the funds deposited with Escrow Agent pursuant to
Section 3, together with any interest and other income thereon.



"Final Order" shall mean a final and nonappealable judgment, order, award or
determination of a court of competent jurisdiction regarding the disbursement
of Escrow Funds.



"Indemnity Escrow Amount" means the sum of $895,000.00 deposited with Escrow

"Joint Written Direction" shall mean a written direction executed by each of
the Parties and directing Escrow Agent to disburse all or a portion of the
Escrow Funds or to take or refrain from taking any other action pursuant to
this Agreement. A Joint Written Direction directing Escrow Agent to disburse
all or a portion of the Escrow Funds shall be in substantially the form of
Attachment 1.



2. Appointment of and Acceptance by Escrow Agent. The Parties hereby appoint Escrow Agent to serve as escrow agent hereunder. Escrow Agent hereby accepts such appointment and, upon receipt by wire transfer of the Escrow Funds in accordance with Section 3, agrees to hold, invest and disburse the Escrow Funds in accordance with this Agreement.



3. Deposit of Escrow Funds. Simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Purchaser will deposit (a) the Adjustment Escrow Amount, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, into an account designated by Escrow Agent (the "Adjustment Escrow Account"), (b) the Indemnity Escrow Amount, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, into an account designated by Escrow Agent (the "Indemnity Escrow Account"), and (c) the Interim Breach Escrow Amount, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, into an account designated by Escrow Agent (the "Interim Breach Escrow Account"). The Adjustment Escrow Account, the Indemnity Escrow Account, and the Interim Breach Escrow Account shall be segregated accounts and shall not be subject to any lien, attachment, trustee process or any other judicial process of any creditor of any party. Escrow Funds shall remain uninvested.



4. Disbursements of Escrow Funds. 



(a) Escrow Agent shall disburse Escrow Funds at any time and from time to
time, within two (2) Business Days of receipt of, and in accordance with, a
Joint Written Direction. Such Joint Written Direction shall contain complete
payment instructions, including wire transfer instructions or an address to
which a check shall be sent. By signing this Agreement, each of the Parties
agrees to execute and provide Joint Written Directions as are consistent with
the provisions and intent of the Underlying Agreement and this Agreement.



(b) Within two (2) Business Days of receipt of a written notification from
either Party of a Final Order (with a copy of such written notification
provided concurrently to the other Party), which notification will attach a
copy of such Final Order, instructing Escrow Agent that a Party or other
person is entitled to the release of Escrow Funds pursuant to the Underlying
Agreement, Escrow Agent shall release such Escrow Funds in accordance with
such Final Order and accompanying instructions. Any such Final 

Order delivered to Escrow Agent shall be accompanied by a certificate from the
Party delivering the Final Order (with a copy of such certificate provided
concurrently to the other Party) confirming that such Final Order is final and
nonappealable and issued from a court of competent jurisdiction, and that the
accompanying instructions are in accordance with such Final Order. Escrow
Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely upon such certification and
instructions and shall have no responsibility to make any determination as to
whether the Final Order is from a court of competent jurisdiction or is final
and nonappealable.



(c) Prior to any disbursement, Escrow Agent shall have received reasonable
identifying information regarding the recipient so that Escrow Agent may
comply with its regulatory obligations and reasonable business practices,
including without limitation a completed United States Internal Revenue
Service ("IRS") Form W-9 or Form W-8, as applicable. All disbursements of
funds from Escrow Funds shall be subject to the fees and claims of Escrow
Agent and the Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 10 and Section 11.



(d) Each of Purchaser and the Seller Representative may deliver written notice
to Escrow Agent in accordance with Section 14 changing such Party's wire
transfer instructions, which notice shall be effective only upon receipt by
Escrow Agent.



(e) Escrow Agent shall, within five (5) Business Days of the end of each
calendar month, deliver to Purchaser and the Seller Representative a statement
setting forth (i) the aggregate amount of Escrow Funds so released or
disbursed, (ii) the recipient of such disbursement or release, (iii) whether
such disbursement or release was made from the Adjustment Escrow Account, the
Indemnity Escrow Account, or the Interim Breach Escrow Account, and (iv) the
respective balances of the Adjustment Escrow Account, the Indemnity Escrow
Account, and the Interim Breach Escrow Account as of such date after giving
effect to such disbursement or release. Promptly upon receipt of the Escrow
Funds, Escrow Agent shall provide Purchaser and the Seller Representative with
permissions to view the Adjustment Escrow Account, the Indemnity Escrow
Account, and the Interim Breach Escrow Account via the Internet at no
additional cost.



5. Suspension of Performance; Disbursement into Court. If, at any time, (a) a dispute between the Parties exists with respect to the holding or disposition of all or any portion of the Escrow Funds or any other obligations of Escrow Agent hereunder, (b) Escrow Agent is unable to determine, to Escrow Agent's reasonable satisfaction, the proper disposition of all or any portion of the Escrow Funds or Escrow Agent's proper actions with respect to its obligations hereunder, or (c) the Parties have not, within ten (10) days of receipt of a notice of resignation from Escrow Agent, appointed a successor Escrow Agent to act hereunder, then Escrow Agent may, in its sole discretion, take either or both of the following actions:



(i) suspend the performance of any of its obligations (including without
limitation any disbursement obligations) under this Agreement until such
dispute or uncertainty shall be resolved to the reasonable satisfaction of
Escrow Agent or until a successor Escrow Agent shall have been appointed;
and/or



(ii) petition (by means of an interpleader action or any other appropriate
method) any court of competent jurisdiction, in any venue convenient to Escrow
Agent, for instructions with respect to such dispute or uncertainty and, to
the extent required or permitted by law, pay into such court, for holding and
disposition in accordance with the instructions of such court, all remaining
Escrow Funds. 

Escrow Agent shall have no liability to Purchaser or the Seller Representative
or their respective owners, shareholders or members or any other person with
respect to any such suspension of performance or disbursement into court,
specifically including any liability or claimed liability that may arise due
to any delay, or alleged to have arisen out of or as a result of any delay, in
the disbursement of the Escrow Funds or any delay in or with respect to any
other action required or requested of Escrow Agent.



6\. Investment of Funds. Based upon Purchaser's and the Seller
Representative's prior review of investment alternatives, in the absence of
further specific written direction to the contrary at any time that an
investment decision must be made, Escrow Agent is directed to invest and
reinvest the Escrow Funds in the investment identified in Schedule A.



All investments shall be made in the name of Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent may,
without notice to Purchaser and the Seller Representative, sell or liquidate
any of the foregoing investments at any time for any disbursement of Escrow
Funds permitted or required hereunder and shall not be liable for any loss,
cost or penalty resulting from any sale or liquidation of any such investment.
All investment earnings shall become part of Escrow Funds and investment
losses shall be charged against Escrow Funds. With respect to any Escrow Funds
or investment instruction received by Escrow Agent after 11:00 a.m., U.S.
Central Time, Escrow Agent shall not be required to invest applicable funds
until the next Business Day. Receipt of Escrow Funds and investment and
reinvestment of Escrow Funds shall be confirmed by Escrow Agent by an account
statement.



7\. Tax Reporting. Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility for the tax
consequences of this Agreement and Purchaser and the Seller Representative
shall consult with independent counsel concerning any and all tax matters.
Except as otherwise provided in this Section 7, Purchaser and the Seller
Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders (as defined in the Underlying
Agreement)) jointly and severally agree to (a) assume all obligations imposed
now or hereafter by any applicable tax law or regulation with respect to
payments or performance under this Agreement and (b) request and direct Escrow
Agent in writing with respect to withholding and other taxes, assessments or
other governmental charges, and advise Escrow Agent in writing with respect to
any certifications and governmental reporting that may be required under any
applicable laws or regulations. Except as otherwise agreed by Escrow Agent in
writing, Escrow Agent has no tax reporting or withholding obligation except
with respect to Form 1099-B reporting on payments of gross proceeds under
Internal Revenue Code Section 6045 and Form 1099 and Form 1042-S reporting
with respect to investment income earned on Escrow Funds, if any. For each
calendar quarter or portion thereof for which there are amounts in Escrow
Funds, an amount in cash equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the interest
and other income earned during such calendar quarter with respect to Escrow
Funds shall be distributed to Purchaser, to the account identified in writing
by Purchaser, within five (5) Business Days of the end of such calendar
quarter for the purpose of making the applicable tax payments for such income.
To the extent that U.S. federal imputed interest regulations apply, Purchaser
and the Seller Representative shall so inform Escrow Agent and provide Escrow
Agent with all imputed interest calculations, and Escrow Agent shall report
such imputed interest in accordance with the instructions provided by
Purchaser and the Seller Representative. Escrow Agent shall rely solely on
such provided calculations and information and shall have no responsibility
for the accuracy or completeness of any such calculations or information.
Purchaser and the Seller Representative shall provide Escrow Agent a properly
completed IRS Form W-9 or Form W-8, as applicable, for each payee. If
requested tax documentation is not so provided, Escrow Agent is authorized to
withhold taxes as required by the United States Internal Revenue Code and
related regulations. All interest and other income earned from the investment
of Escrow Funds shall be allocated and reported to Purchaser for tax purposes.



8. Resignation or Removal of Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged from the performance of its duties hereunder at any time by giving at least thirty (30) days' prior written 

notice to Purchaser and the Seller Representative specifying a date when such
resignation shall take effect and, after the date of such resignation,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Escrow Agent's sole
obligation will be to hold Escrow Funds pending appointment of a successor
Escrow Agent. Similarly, Escrow Agent may be removed at any time by Purchaser
and the Seller Representative giving at least thirty (30) days' prior written
notice to Escrow Agent specifying the date when such removal shall take
effect. If Purchaser and the Seller Representative fail to jointly appoint a
successor Escrow Agent prior to the effective date of such resignation or
removal, Escrow Agent may petition a court of competent jurisdiction to
appoint a successor escrow agent. The retiring Escrow Agent shall transmit all
records pertaining to Escrow Funds and shall pay all Escrow Funds to the
successor Escrow Agent, after making copies of such records as the retiring
Escrow Agent deems advisable. After any retiring Escrow Agent's resignation or
removal, the provisions of this Agreement shall inure to its benefit as to any
actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Escrow Agent under
this Agreement.



9. Duties and Liability of Escrow Agent. 



(a) Escrow Agent undertakes to perform only such duties as are expressly set
forth herein and no duties shall be implied. Escrow Agent has no fiduciary or
discretionary duties of any kind. Escrow Agent's permissive rights shall not
be construed as duties. Escrow Agent shall have no liability under and no duty
to inquire as to the provisions of any agreement other than this Agreement,
including without limitation any other agreement between the Parties or any
other persons even though reference thereto may be made herein and whether or
not a copy of such agreement has been provided to Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent's
sole responsibility shall be for the safekeeping of Escrow Funds in accordance
with Escrow Agent's customary practices and disbursement thereof in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement. Escrow Agent shall not be charged with
knowledge or notice of any fact or circumstance not specifically set forth
herein or in a notice delivered pursuant to Section 14. This Agreement shall
terminate upon the distribution of all Escrow Funds pursuant to any applicable
provision of this Agreement, and Escrow Agent shall thereafter have no further
obligation or liability whatsoever with respect to this Agreement or Escrow
Funds.



(b) Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted by it in
good faith except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction
determines, which determination is not subject to appeal, that Escrow Agent's
fraud, bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct was the direct cause
of any loss to Purchaser, the Seller Representative, or the Securityholders.
Escrow Agent may retain and act hereunder through its agents.



(c) Escrow Agent may rely upon any notice, instruction, request or other
instrument, not only as to its due execution, validity and effectiveness, but
also as to the truth and accuracy of any information contained therein, which
Escrow Agent believes to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by
the proper person or parties. In no event shall Escrow Agent be liable for
incidental, indirect, special, consequential or punitive damages or penalties
of any kind (including, but not limited to lost profits), even if Escrow Agent
has been advised of the likelihood of such damages or penalty and regardless
of the form of action.



(d) Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for delays or failures in
performance resulting from acts of God, strikes, lockouts, riots, acts of war
or terror, epidemics, governmental regulations, fire, communication line
failures, computer viruses, attacks or intrusions, power failures, earthquakes
or any other circumstance beyond its control. Escrow Agent shall not be
obligated to take any legal action in connection with Escrow Funds, this
Agreement or the Underlying Agreement or to appear in, prosecute or defend any
such legal action. Purchaser and the Seller Representative are aware that
under applicable 

state law, property which is presumed abandoned may under certain
circumstances escheat to the applicable state. Escrow Agent shall have no
liability to Purchaser or the Seller Representative, their respective heirs,
legal representatives, successors and assigns, or any other party, should any
or all Escrow Funds escheat by operation of law.



(e) Escrow Agent may consult legal counsel selected by it in the event of any
dispute or question as to the construction of any of the provisions hereof or
of any other agreement or of its duties hereunder, or relating to any dispute
involving this Agreement, and, except to the extent that doing so would
constitute fraud or bad faith of Escrow Agent, shall incur no liability and
shall be fully indemnified from any liability whatsoever in acting in
accordance with the advice of such counsel. Purchaser and the Seller
Representative agree to perform or procure the performance of all further acts
and things, and execute and deliver such further documents, as may be required
by law or as Escrow Agent may reasonably request in connection with performing
its duties hereunder. When any action is provided for herein to be done on or
by a specified date that falls on a day other than a Business Day, such action
may be performed on the next ensuing Business Day.



(f) If any portion of Escrow Funds is at any time attached, garnished or
levied upon, or otherwise subject to any writ, order, decree or process of any
court, or in case disbursement of Escrow Funds is stayed or enjoined by any
court order, Escrow Agent is authorized, in its sole discretion, to respond as
it deems appropriate or to comply with all writs, orders, decrees or process
so entered or issued, or which it is advised by legal counsel of its own
choosing is binding upon it, whether with or without jurisdiction; and if
Escrow Agent relies upon or complies with any such writ, order, decree or
process, it shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to any other
person or entity by reason of such compliance even if such order is reversed,
modified, annulled, set aside or vacated.



(g) Escrow Agent and any stockholder, director, officer or employee of Escrow
Agent may buy, sell and deal in any of the securities of any other party
hereto and contract with and lend money to any other party hereto and
otherwise act as fully and freely as though it were not Escrow Agent under
this Agreement. Nothing herein shall preclude Escrow Agent from acting in any
other capacity for any other party hereto or for any other person or entity.



(h) In the event instructions, including but not limited to funds transfer
instructions, address change instructions or contact information change
instructions are given to Escrow Agent (other than in writing at the time of
execution of this Agreement), whether in writing, by facsimile or otherwise,
Escrow Agent is authorized but shall not be required to seek confirmation of
such instructions by telephone call-back to the person or persons designated
on Schedule C hereto, and Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation of
anyone purporting to be the person or persons so designated. The persons and
telephone numbers for call-backs may be changed only in writing actually
received and acknowledged by Escrow Agent and shall be effective only after
Escrow Agent has a reasonable opportunity to act on such changes. If Escrow
Agent is unable to contact any of the designated representatives identified on
Schedule C, Escrow Agent is hereby authorized but shall be under no duty to
seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to any one or
more of Purchaser's or the Seller Representative's executive officers
("Executive Officers"), as the case may be, which shall include the titles of
Chief Executive Officer, President and Vice President, as Escrow Agent may
select. Such Executive Officer shall deliver to Escrow Agent a fully-executed
incumbency certificate, and Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation of
anyone purporting to be any such officer. Purchaser and the Seller
Representative agree that Escrow Agent may at its option record any telephone
calls made pursuant to this Section 9(i). Escrow Agent in any funds transfer
may rely upon any account numbers or similar identifying numbers provided by
Purchaser or the Seller Representative to identify (i) the beneficiary, (ii)
the beneficiary's bank, or (iii) an intermediary bank, even when its use may
result in a person other than the beneficiary being paid, or the 

transfer of funds to a bank other than the beneficiary's bank or an
intermediary bank so designated, provided that Escrow Agent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to recover any misdirected funds. Purchaser and the
Seller Representative acknowledge that these optional security procedures are
commercially reasonable.



10. Indemnification of Escrow Agent. Purchaser and the Seller Representative, jointly and severally, shall indemnify and hold harmless Escrow Agent and each director, officer, employee and affiliate of Escrow Agent (each, an "Indemnified Party") upon demand against any and all claims (whether asserted by Purchaser, the Seller Representative or any other person or entity and whether or not valid), actions, proceedings, losses, damages, liabilities, penalties, costs and expenses of any kind or nature (including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and expenses) (collectively, "Losses") arising from this Agreement or Escrow Agent's actions hereunder, except to the extent such Losses are finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, which determination is not subject to appeal, to have been directly caused by the fraud, bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Party. Purchaser and the Seller Representative further agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify each Indemnified Party for all costs, including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the enforcement of Purchaser's and the Seller Representative's respective obligations hereunder. Any Indemnified Party seeking indemnity under this Escrow Agreement (including under this Section 10) shall give prompt written notice to the party or parties obligated to provide indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party") of any suit, claim, proceeding, demand or liability of which such Indemnified Party has received written notice (collectively, a "Claim"), and will reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party's expense, in the defense or settlement thereof. Failure to provide prompt notice shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has actually been prejudiced as a result of such failure. The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any Claim for which indemnification is sought from it under this Escrow Agreement (including under this Section 10) at its own expense and/or to assume the defense thereof at its own expense and shall not be liable for any settlement entered into without its prior written consent so long as the Indemnifying Party is in compliance with its obligations under this Section 10 and has paid to Escrow Agent all Losses that have then been incurred by Escrow Agent for which Escrow Agent is entitled to indemnification pursuant hereto. The Indemnifying Party shall not settle or compromise any action or proceeding defended by the Indemnifying Party in accordance with the foregoing without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. An Indemnified Party shall, in its sole discretion, have the right to select and employ separate counsel with respect to any indemnified Claim, and the reasonable fees of such counsel shall be indemnified by Purchaser and the Seller Representative jointly and severally; provided that Purchaser and the Seller Representative shall not be obligated to pay for more than one law firm for all Indemnified Parties in any individual matter or series of related matters (other than local counsel, to the extent required). The obligations of Purchaser and the Seller Representative under this Section 10 shall survive any termination of this Agreement and the resignation or removal of Escrow Agent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, as between Purchaser and the Seller Representative only, (a) if neither Party's actions or omissions caused Losses for which indemnification is owed pursuant to this Section 10, any indemnification for such Claim shall be payable one-half (1/2) by Purchaser and one-half (1/2) by the Seller Representative, (b) if only one Party's actions or omissions caused Losses for which indemnification is owed pursuant to this Section 10, any indemnification for such Losses shall be payable by such Party, and (c) if both Parties' actions or omissions caused Losses for which indemnification is owed pursuant to this Section 10, any indemnification for such Losses shall be payable by each Party based on the portion of such Losses caused by such Party (e.g., if such Losses were caused sixty percent (60%) by Purchaser and forty percent (40%) by the Seller Representative, Purchaser shall be responsible for payment of sixty percent (60%) of 

such Losses and the Seller Representative for forty percent (40%) of such
Losses).



11. Compensation of Escrow Agent.



(a) Fees and Expenses. Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Seller
Representative, on the other hand, shall each (i) pay to Escrow Agent fifty
percent (50%) of its service fees, as stated on Schedule B attached hereto,
and (ii) reimburse Escrow Agent upon request for fifty percent (50%) of all
reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances, including (A) overnight
delivery service charges and (B) reasonable attorneys' fees incurred or made
by it in connection with carrying out its duties hereunder. Escrow Agent shall
invoice each of Purchaser and the Seller Representative separately in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 11. The obligations of
Purchaser and the Seller Representative under this Section 11 shall survive
any termination of this Agreement and the resignation or removal of Escrow
Agent.



(b) Withholding of Disbursements from Escrow Funds. Escrow Agent shall not be
required to release any Escrow Fund amounts hereunder if, at the time such
Escrow Fund amounts are to be released in accordance with this Agreement,
there are any outstanding and overdue fees and expenses payable to Escrow
Agent by the recipient of such Escrow Fund amounts pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement. Upon payment of all such outstanding fees and expenses, Escrow
Agent shall promptly release such Escrow Fund amounts, as applicable, in
accordance with this Agreement.

12. Representations and Warranties. Purchaser and the Seller Representative each makes the following representations and warranties to Escrow Agent with respect to itself:



(a)it has full power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and
to perform its obligations hereunder, and this Agreement has been duly
approved by all necessary action and constitutes its valid and binding
agreement enforceable in accordance with its terms;



(b) each of the applicable persons designated on Schedule C attached hereto
has been duly appointed to act as its authorized representative hereunder and
individually has full power and authority on its behalf to execute and deliver
any instruction or direction (including a Joint Written Direction), to amend,
modify or waive any provision of this Agreement and to take any and all other
actions as its authorized representative under this Agreement all without
further consent or direction from, or notice to, it or any other person, and
no change in designation of such authorized representatives shall be effective
until written notice of such change is delivered to each other party to this
Agreement pursuant to Section 14; and



(c) the Seller Representative represents and warrants to Escrow Agent that it
has the irrevocable right, power and authority (i) to enter into and perform
this Agreement on behalf of the Securityholders, (ii) to give and receive
directions and notices hereunder, and (iii) to make all determinations that
may be required or that it deems appropriate under this Agreement.

13. Identifying Information. To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. For a non-individual person such as a business entity, a charity, a trust or other legal entity, Escrow Agent requires documentation to verify its formation and existence as a legal entity. Escrow Agent may require financial statements, licenses or identification and authorization documents from individuals claiming authority to represent the entity or other relevant documentation. Purchaser and the Seller Representative agree to provide all information requested by Escrow Agent in connection with any legislation or regulation to which Escrow Agent is subject, in a 

timely manner. Escrow Agent's appointment and acceptance of its duties under

U.S. BANK MONEY MARKET DEPOSIT ACCOUNT

Description and Terms





The U.S. Bank Money Market Deposit Account is a U.S. Bank National Association
("U.S. Bank") interest-bearing money market deposit account designed to meet
the needs of U.S. Bank's Corporate Trust Services Escrow Group and other
Corporate Trust customers of U.S. Bank. Selection of this investment includes
authorization to place funds on deposit and invest with U.S. Bank.



U.S. Bank uses the daily balance method to calculate interest on this account
(actual/365 or 366). This method applies a daily periodic rate to the
principal balance in the account each day. Interest is accrued daily and
credited monthly to the account. Interest rates are determined at U.S. Bank's
discretion, and may be tiered by customer deposit amount.



The owner of the account is U.S. Bank as agent for its Corporate Trust
customers. U.S. Bank's Corporate Trust Services Escrow Group performs all
account deposits and withdrawals. Deposit accounts are FDIC insured per
depositor, as determined under FDIC Regulations, up to applicable FDIC limits.



U.S. BANK IS NOT REQUIRED TO REGISTER AS A MUNICIPAL ADVISOR WITH THE
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION FOR PURPOSES OF COMPLYING WITH THE DODD-
FRANK WALL STREET REFORM and CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT. INVESTMENT ADVICE, IF
NEEDED, SHOULD BE OBTAINED FROM YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISOR.
