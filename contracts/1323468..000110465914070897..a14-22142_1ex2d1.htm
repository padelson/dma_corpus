in an account established pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement,
substantially in the form of _Exhibit C_ attached hereto (the " _Deposit
Escrow Agreement_ "), to be entered into on the date hereof by Seller, Buyer
and the Escrow Agent.

 



       
 

 



 

(i) At the Closing, Buyer and Seller shall notify the Escrow Agent in writing
of the occurrence of the Closing and instruct the Escrow Agent to distribute
the Deposit to Seller as a credit towards the Estimated Purchase Price.

 



 

(ii) Pursuant to the Deposit Escrow Agreement, if (A) the conditions set forth
in _Section 7.1(b)_ and _Section 7.2_ have been satisfied or waived (other
than those conditions to be satisfied by the delivery of documents or taking
of any other action at the Closing by any Party), and (B) this Agreement is

timely deliver the Closing Statement within ninety (90) days after the Closing
Date, Buyer and Seller shall, pursuant to the Closing Escrow Agreement, direct
the Escrow Agent to distribute all of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow
Funds to Seller.

 



 

(ii) Within sixty (60) days following receipt by Seller of the Closing
Statement, Seller may deliver written notice (an " _Objection Notice_ ") to
Buyer of any dispute it has with respect to the preparation or content of the
Closing Statement. Any amount, determination or calculation contained in the
Closing Statement and which is not specifically disputed in a timely delivered
Objection Notice shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. If
Seller does not timely deliver an Objection Notice with respect to the Closing
Statement within such sixty (60) day period, the Closing Statement will be
final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. If an Objection Notice is timely
delivered within such sixty (60) day period, Buyer and Seller shall negotiate

shall cause the Accounting Firm to deliver a written report containing its
calculation of the disputed Objections (which calculation shall be within the
range of dispute between the Closing Statement and the Objection Notice)
within such thirty (30) day period. All Objections that are resolved between
the Parties or are determined by the Accounting Firm will be final, conclusive
and binding on the Parties, absent manifest error. The costs and expenses of
the Accounting Firm shall be allocated by the Accounting Firm and apportioned
between Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, in the same
proportion that the aggregate amount of such resolved disputed items so
submitted to the Accounting Firm that is unsuccessfully disputed by each such
Party (as finally determined by the Accounting Firm) bears to the total amount
of such resolved disputed items so submitted.

 



 

(c) _Access_. Buyer shall, and shall cause each Group Company to, make its
financial records, accounting personnel and advisors available to Seller, its
accountants and other representatives and the Accounting Firm at reasonable
times during the review by Seller and the Accounting Firm of, and the
resolution of any Objections with respect to, the Closing Statement.

 



 

(d) _Adjustments_.

 



 

(i) Upon the determination, in accordance with _Section 2.4(b)_, of the final
calculations of the amounts of Closing Working Capital, Cash and Cash
Equivalents, the Notes Receivable Amount, Closing Indebtedness and Seller
Expenses, the Purchase Price shall be recalculated using such finally
determined amounts in lieu of the amounts used in the Estimated Closing
Statement. The term " _Final Purchase Price_ " means the result of such
recalculation of the Estimated Purchase Price.

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) If the Final Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Purchase Price
(the amount of such deficiency is referred to herein as the " _Deficiency_ ")
and the Deficiency is less than the amount of the Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Amount, then Buyer and Seller shall, pursuant to the Closing Escrow
Agreement, direct the Escrow Agent to (A) distribute the amount of the
Deficiency from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account to or as directed
by Buyer, and (B) distribute the remaining amount of the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Funds to Seller.

 



 

(iii) If the Final Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Purchase Price
and the amount of the Deficiency is equal to or greater than the amount of the
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount, then Buyer and Seller shall, pursuant
to the Closing Escrow Agreement, direct the Escrow Agent to distribute the
entire Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount to or as directed by Buyer (and
shall thereafter cause the Purchase Price Adjustment Account to be closed) and
disburse the balance of the Deficiency from the Indemnification Escrow
Account, and Seller, within three (3) Business Days, shall replenish the
Indemnification Escrow Account with an amount equal to the amount disbursed
therefrom on a dollar-for-dollar basis.

 



 

(iv) If the Final Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated Purchase Price
(the amount of such excess is referred to herein as the " _Positive Adjustment
Amount_ "), then:

 



 

(A) Buyer and Seller shall, pursuant to the Closing Escrow Agreement, direct
the Escrow Agent to distribute all of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow
Funds to Seller; and

 



 

(B) Buyer shall, within three (3) Business Days after the determination of the
Final Purchase Price, pay or cause to be paid by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account of Seller an amount in cash equal to the
Positive Adjustment Amount.

 



 

(v) Any payments made pursuant to _Section 2.4(d)_ shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required
under applicable Law.

 



 

(e) _Accounting Procedures_. The Estimated Closing Statement, the Closing
Statement and the determinations and calculations contained therein shall be
prepared and calculated on a consolidated basis for the Group Companies in
accordance with GAAP and using the same accounting principles, practices,
procedures, policies and methods (with consistent classifications, judgments,
inclusions, exclusions and valuation and estimation methodologies) used and
applied by the Group Companies in the preparation of the Latest Balance Sheet,
except that such statements, calculations and determinations: (i) shall not
include any purchase accounting or other adjustment arising out of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) shall
follow the defined terms contained in this Agreement whether or not such terms
are consistent with GAAP, and (iii) shall, to the extent applicable, be
calculated in accordance with _Exhibit A_ even if such procedures and/or

and procedures.

substantially delay the availability of such funds at Closing.

 



 

Section 5.6 _Solvency_. Immediately after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, none of Buyer or the Group Companies will (a)

salable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its
probable liability on its existing debts as they mature), (b) have
unreasonably small capital with which to engage in its business or (c) have
incurred debts beyond its ability to pay as they become due.

about the Group Companies and their respective businesses and operations as it
and its representatives and advisors have deemed necessary to enable it to
make an informed decision with respect to the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer
has received all materials relating to the business of the Group Companies

additional information necessary to verify the accuracy of any such

with any distribution thereof, or with any present intention of distributing
or selling such Shares. Buyer agrees that the Shares may not be sold,

Section 6.2 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) All Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with or as a result of the
transfer of the Shares from Seller to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement shall
be paid by Buyer (notwithstanding any contrary allocation under applicable
Law) when due. Buyer shall file, to the extent it is required to do so by
applicable Tax Laws, all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with
respect to all such Transfer Taxes. Seller shall file any other Tax Returns
and other documentation with respect to such Transfer Taxes. To the extent
required by applicable Tax Laws, Seller, Buyer and each Group Company will
join in the execution of any such Tax Returns or other documentation. Buyer
and Seller shall cooperate in good faith in a commercially reasonable manner
to minimize, to the extent permissible under applicable Law, the amount of any
such Transfer Taxes.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, when necessary to apportion Tax payments
and Tax refunds for a Straddle Period, with respect to Taxes imposed on a
periodic basis, such as property Taxes, the portion of such Taxes attributable
to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date (the " _Pre-
Closing Straddle Period_ ") will be equal to the product of all such Taxes
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the
Straddle Period from the commencement of such period through and including the
Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire
Straddle Period. In the case of any other Taxes for a Straddle Period,
including (i) sales and use Taxes, (ii) payroll and similar Taxes, and (iii)
Taxes based upon or related to income or receipts, the portion of such Taxes
attributable to a Pre-Closing Straddle Period will be determined on the basis
of a deemed closing of the books and records of the Group Companies as of the
close of business on the Closing Date; provided that exemptions, allowances or
deductions that are calculated with respect to such Straddle Period on an
annual basis shall be allocated between the period ending on and including the
Closing Date and the period beginning after the Closing Date in proportion to
the number of days in each period.

 



 

(c) At Buyers expense, Buyer will prepare and file (or cause to be prepared
and filed) in a timely manner all Tax Returns required to be filed after the
Closing Date by the Group Companies (after giving effect to any valid
extensions of the due date for filing any such Tax Returns) for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period. Such Tax Returns will be prepared in a
manner consistent with this Agreement and the Tax positions taken by the Group
Companies before the Closing with respect to similar Tax Returns, so long as
such Tax positions are in compliance with applicable Laws. To the extent
permitted by Law, all Transaction Tax Deductions shall be reflected as a
deduction on the Income Tax Returns filed by or with respect to the Group
Companies for the Pre-Closing Tax Period. Buyer shall deliver to Seller a copy
of all Tax Returns (together with all supporting schedules and workpapers)
which pertain to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period for Sellers
approval at least forty-five (45) days before the date on which such Tax
Return is required to be filed, or as soon as reasonably possible if the Tax
Return is required (after taking into account all available extensions) to be
filed within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date. Seller may review
such Tax Returns within twenty-five (25) days after the delivery of such Tax
Returns. Seller will be deemed to have approved such Tax Returns as prepared
by Buyer if it does not submit written comments to Buyer within such twenty-
five (25) day review period. If Seller delivers written comments to Buyer
within such twenty-five (25) day review period, Buyer and Seller shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve any dispute in connection with such
comments. In the event Buyer and Seller are unable to agree on any such
revisions within ten (10) days after Seller provides its comments, Buyer and
Seller shall engage the Accounting Firm to resolve the matters in dispute, and
the Accounting Firms determination with respect to such matters shall be
final and binding on the Parties. The Accounting Firm shall resolve the
dispute in a manner consistent with the provisions of this _Section 6.2_
within twenty (20) days after the dispute has been referred to it.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.2(c)_, Buyer
shall be entitled to file on behalf of the Group Companies, or cause to be
filed, the applicable Tax Return without having incorporated the disputed
items to avoid a late filing of such Tax Return. If the Accounting Firms
resolution of the dispute necessitates that a Tax Return filed in accordance
with the previous sentence be amended, then Buyer shall cause an amended Tax
Return to be filed that reflects such resolution. The fees and expenses of
the Accounting Firm shall be borne by each Party in the percentage inversely
proportionate to the percentage of the total items submitted for

 



      
 

 



 

dispute that are resolved in such Partys favor. Not later than five (5) days
prior to the due date (after giving effect to any valid extensions of the due
date) for payment of Taxes with respect to any Tax Return for a Pre-Closing
Period or Straddle Period, Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount of any Seller
Taxes due and payable by the Group Companies with respect to such Tax Return,
provided that Seller shall not be obligated to pay any such Taxes prior to ten
(10) days following the date on which Buyer provides Seller with such Tax
Returns, schedules, and other documentation as reasonably necessary for Seller
to confirm the amount of such Seller Taxes.

 



 

(d) In preparing any Tax Return of the Group Companies for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, Buyer shall, to the extent permitted under applicable Law, claim any
deduction, loss or credit with respect to items that accrued or were paid by
or on behalf of the Group Companies on or before the Closing Date and that are
deductible for Income Tax purposes, including Seller Expenses, and shall, to
the extent permitted under applicable Law, carry back or carry forward any net
operating losses of the Company to another Pre-Closing Tax Period prior to
such amounts being carried forward to a Post-Closing Tax Period.

 



 

(e) Without duplication of amounts paid pursuant to _Section 6.2(h)_, to the
extent not included as an asset (or as an offset to a liability) in the
computation of the Closing Working Capital (as finally determined), any
refund, credit, or reduction in Taxes paid or payable by or with respect to a
Group Company shall, when actually realized (whether by refund, credit,
overpayment, or offset against other Taxes due and payable), be promptly paid
as follows: (i) to Seller if attributable to any Tax period or portion thereof
ending on or before the Closing Date; and (ii) to Buyer if attributable to any
Tax period or portion thereof beginning after the Closing Date. For purposes
of this _Section 6.2(e)_, Tax refunds attributable to a Straddle Period shall
be allocated in a manner consistent with _Section 6.2(b)_.

 



 

(f) Upon the reasonable request of Seller and at Sellers expense, Buyer shall
cause the Group Companies to promptly file amended Tax Returns to obtain any
Tax refund that Seller reasonably believes should be available with respect to
a Pre-Closing Tax Period or the Pre-Closing Straddle Period, including Tax
Returns required to carry back any net operating or other losses or credits
from the final Pre-Closing Tax Period to an earlier Pre-Closing Tax Period, so
long as the Tax positions taken in such return are substantially in compliance
with applicable Laws. Any such Tax refund shall be subject to the obligations
set forth in _Section 6.2(e)_.

 



 

(g) Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer and the Group Companies, on the other
hand, will provide each other, at no charge, with such cooperation (including
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder) and
information (including supporting schedules and workpapers) as any of them may
reasonably request of the other(s) in the preparation or filing of any Tax
Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund, determining a liability for
Taxes or a right to a refund or overpayment of Taxes, the amount of any Seller
Tax Benefits, or in connection with any audit, assessment, suit, proposed
adjustment, deficiency, dispute, administrative, judicial or other proceeding
or similar claim is commenced, proposed or made by any Taxing Authority. Each
of Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with the other Party, and with each of the
Group Companies, by providing any information that the other Party or its
Affiliates

 



      
 

 



 

reasonably requires to determine its information and withholding obligations
on payments made under this Agreement (including on the release of the
Indemnification Escrow Amount).

 



 

(h) Without duplication of amounts paid pursuant to _Section 6.2(e)_, to the
extent that a Group Companys liability for Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax Period
or Pre-Closing Straddle period is less than the amount of Taxes paid by or on
behalf of such Group Company prior to Closing with respect to all or a portion
of such taxable year or period (as determined in accordance with this _Section
6.2_), Buyer shall pay Seller the difference (to the extent not included as an
asset (or as an offset to a liability) in the computation of the Closing
Working Capital, as finally determined) within five (5) days of filing the
relevant Tax Return that reflects such Tax. Promptly following the filing of
each Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Pre-Closing Straddle period, a
responsible Tax officer of Buyer (based on calculations performed by a
nationally recognized accounting firm retained by Buyer to prepare and sign
the Income Tax Return of the Company for each period) shall certify to Seller
the amount (if any) payable by Buyer to Seller pursuant to this _Section
6.2(h)_.

 



 

(i) Except to the extent included as an asset (or as an offset to a liability)
in the computation of the Closing Working Capital, as finally determined,
Buyer shall pay Seller the amount by which (A) the hypothetical liability of
Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Group Companies) for Taxes for or with
respect to each of the five (5) taxable years ending (in sequential order)
after the Closing Date calculated by excluding (x) all Pre-Closing Tax
Attributes and (y) all Transaction Tax Deductions to the extent such items are
not deductible for Tax purposes in a Pre-Closing Tax Period, exceeds (B) the
actual liability of Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Group Companies)
with respect to each of such five (5) taxable years, calculated by taking into
account the relevant Pre-Closing Tax Attributes and all Transaction Tax
Deductions to the extent such items are deductible for Tax purposes by Buyer
or its Affiliates (including the Group Companies) in or with respect to each
of such five (5) taxable years (the excess of the amount described in clause
(A) over the amount described in clause (B), the " _Seller Tax Benefits_ ").
Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the Seller Tax Benefits within
five (5) days following the date on which Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including the Group Companies) actually realizes (whether by refund, credit
or reduction in Taxes otherwise due or payable) any such Seller Tax Benefits.
Promptly following the filing of each Income Tax Return that includes Buyer or
its Affiliates (including any of the Group Companies) or any successor
thereof, a responsible Tax officer of Buyer shall certify to Seller the amount
of any Seller Tax Benefits payable by Buyer to Seller pursuant to this
_Section 6.2(i)_ with respect to such taxable year. If any Pre-Closing Tax
Attributes or Transaction Tax Deductions are subsequently disallowed by a
Taxing Authority, and if in connection with such disallowance the amount of
Seller Tax Benefits is reduced, Seller shall promptly repay to Buyer the
amount of such reduction in Seller Tax Benefits, plus interest at a rate per
annum of three percent (3%) calculated from the date of the payment by Buyer
of the Seller Tax Benefits to Seller to the date of repayment by Seller;
provided that Seller shall not be obligated to pay Buyer any amount in excess
of the Seller Tax Benefits previously paid by Buyer to Seller pursuant to this
_Section 6.2(i)_, plus interest at a rate per annum of three percent (3%)
calculated from the date of the payment by Buyer of the Seller Tax Benefits to
Seller to the date of repayment by Seller.

 



 

(j) Except as provided otherwise herein, on or with respect to the Closing
Date, none of the Group Companies shall take, and none of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates shall

 



      
 

 



 

permit or otherwise allow any of the Group Companies to take, any action not
in the ordinary course of the Group Companies businesses, including, but not
limited to, the making or revocation of any Tax election, the merger or
liquidation of any of the Group Companies or the distribution of any property
in respect of any of the Group Companies stock, without the prior written
consent of Seller, which consent may be withheld in Sellers sole discretion.

 



 

(k) Except as required by Law, Buyer shall not, and shall not cause or permit
any Group Company or any of Buyers Affiliates to, (i) amend, refile or
otherwise modify any Tax Return with respect to any Group Company for any Tax
period or portion thereof ending on or prior to the Closing Date, (ii) make or
change any Tax election with respect to any Tax period or portion thereof
ending on or prior to the Closing Date, (iii) enter into any closing
agreement, settle any Tax claim or assessment relating to any Group Company,
surrender, reduce or limit any right to claim a refund of Taxes, or consent to
any extension or waiver of the limitation period applicable to any Tax claim
or assessment relating to any Group Company, in each case for any Tax period
or portion thereof ending on or prior to the Closing Date, (iv) carryback any
net operating loss, capital loss, Tax credit, or other Tax attribute from
taxable periods beginning after the Closing Date to a Pre-Closing Tax Period,
or (v) take any other action that could increase Sellers liability for Taxes
(including any liability of Seller to indemnify Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to
this Agreement, in each instance without obtaining the prior written consent
of Seller, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , if such amendment, modification, change,
agreement, settlement, claim, consent, carryback, credit or other action for
which Sellers consent is required pursuant to this _Section 6.2(k)_ pertains
to or affects Income Taxes or an Income Tax Return of any Group Company with
respect to a Tax period or portion thereof ending on or prior to the Closing
Date, Seller may withhold its consent in its sole and absolute discretion.

 



 

(l) Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that each of the Group Companies
shall become a member of Buyers Consolidated Group and shall be included in
Buyers consolidated federal Income Tax Return as of the beginning of the day
immediately following the Closing Date. For purposes of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (B) (and for purposes of similar or
comparable provisions under state, local and foreign Law), the Parties agree
that (i) the taxable year of each member of the Group Companies shall end as
of the end of the Closing Date for federal Income Tax purposes (and for all
other Tax purposes to the extent permitted under applicable Law), (ii) except
as otherwise specially permitted or required pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, all items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit incurred by
the Group Companies on the Closing Date and after the occurrence of the
Closing shall be treated, to the extent permitted under Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1502-76(b)((ii)(B) (and under any comparable or similar provisions
of state, local or foreign Law), as occurring at the beginning of the day
immediately following the Closing Date, and (iii) except as otherwise
specially permitted or required pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, on or
with respect to the Closing Date, none of Group Companies shall incur, and
neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall permit or otherwise allow any
Group Company to incur, any "extraordinary item" as defined in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii)(C). Each of Buyer and Seller shall
file, and shall cause each of their Affiliates and the Group Companies to
file, all federal Income Tax Returns (and to the extent permitted, all state,
local and foreign Income Tax Returns) in a manner consistent with this
_Section 6.2(l)_.

 



      
 

 



 

(m) None of Buyer, the Group Companies, or Buyers Affiliates shall make any
election under Section 336(e) or Section 338 of the Code with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, without first obtaining the prior
written consent of Seller, which consent may be withheld in Sellers sole
discretion.

 



 

Section 6.3 _Access to Information_.

 



 

(a) From and after the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing Date or
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, upon
reasonable notice, and subject to restrictions contained in the
confidentiality agreements to which the Group Companies are subject, the
Company shall provide to Buyer and its authorized representatives during
normal business hours reasonable access to all books and records of the Group
Companies (in a manner so as to not interfere with the normal business
operations of any Group Company) and the Group Companies shall furnish
promptly to Buyer and its representatives such information concerning their
business, properties, Contracts, assets, liabilities and employees as Buyer
and its representatives may reasonably request; _provided_ , that in no event
shall the foregoing include any sampling or analysis of soil, air,
groundwater, building materials or other environmental media nor may Buyer
require that such sampling or analysis be conducted. All of such information
shall be treated as confidential information pursuant to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, the provisions of which are by this reference
hereby incorporated herein. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this Agreement, during the period from the date hereof until the Closing,
none of Seller and any of its Affiliates shall be required to disclose to
Buyer or any of its representatives any information (A) to the extent related
to the sale or divestiture process conducted by Seller or its Affiliates for
the Group Companies vis-a-vis any Person other than Buyer and its Affiliates,
or Sellers or its Affiliates (or their representatives) evaluation of the
business of the Group Companies in connection therewith, including
projections, financial and other information relating thereto, (B) if doing so
would violate any Contract or Law to which Seller or any of its Affiliates is
a party or is subject or which it reasonably determined upon the advice of
counsel could result in the loss of the ability to successfully assert
attorney-client and work product privileges or (C) if Seller or any of its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on the other
hand, are adverse parties in a litigation and such information is reasonably
pertinent thereto.

 



 

(b) All of the information provided pursuant to this _Section 6.3_ shall be
treated as confidential information pursuant to the terms and for all purposes
of the Confidentiality Agreement. Effective upon the Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall automatically terminate without further action
by the Parties.

 



 

Section 6.4 _Efforts to Consummate; Extension_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of Seller, Buyer
and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective as promptly as
practicable the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
satisfaction, but not waiver, of the closing conditions set forth in _ARTICLE
7_). Each of Seller, Buyer and the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain consents of all Governmental Entities or other third parties
necessary to consummate

 



       
 

 



 

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. All costs incurred in
connection with obtaining such consents shall be borne by the Party incurring
such costs, except that the HSR Act filing fee, shall be fully paid by Buyer
and, in no event, shall Seller, any of its Affiliates or any of the Group
Companies be required to make any payments (other than routine administrative
fees, contractual change of control payments and attorneys fees) or provide
other types of consideration in order to seek or facilitate the obtaining of
any such consents. Each Party shall make an appropriate filing, if necessary,
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement promptly (and in any event, within seven (7) Business Days) after
the date of this Agreement and shall supply as promptly as practicable to the
appropriate Governmental Entities any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested on an ongoing basis pursuant to the HSR Act.
Without limiting the foregoing, (i) subject to _Section 6.4(b)_ (including
Buyers right to extend the Outside Date pursuant to the terms thereof), the
Company, Seller, Buyer and their respective Affiliates shall not extend any
waiting period or comparable period under the HSR Act or enter into any
agreement with any Governmental Entity not to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, except with the prior written consent of the other
Parties, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, including, but not
limited to, the withdrawal and re-filing of the original filing pursuant to
the HSR Act, and (ii) Buyer and Seller each agree to take all commercially
reasonable actions that are necessary or advisable or as may be required by
any Governmental Entity to expeditiously consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (unless the taking of such actions,
individually or in the aggregate, would result, or would reasonably be
expected to result, in the loss, disposition or impairment of assets,
including as described in (A), (B) and (C) below, in excess of a _de minimis_
value), including (A) selling, licensing or otherwise disposing of, or holding
separate and agreeing to sell, license or otherwise dispose of, any entities,
assets or facilities of any Group Company after the Closing or any entity,
facility or asset of Buyer or its Affiliates, (B) terminating, amending or
assigning existing relationships and contractual rights and obligations and
(C) amending, assigning or terminating existing licenses or other agreements
and entering into such new licenses or other agreements.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if the
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement has not expired or been terminated prior to the
Outside Date, Buyer shall have the unilateral right to six (6) consecutive
options, exercised with at least three (3) Business Days notice to Seller
prior to the then-current Outside Date, to extend the then-current Outside
Date by thirty (30) days (each, an " _Extension Option_ "). In addition, if
Buyer is diligently and in good faith pursuing clearance pursuant to the HSR
Act and has some reasonable and demonstrable indication from the applicable
Governmental Entities that clearance under the HSR Act is forthcoming within
thirty (30) days, then Buyer shall have the option, exercised with at least
three (3) Business Days notice to Seller prior to the then-current Outside
Date, to extend the then-current Outside Date by a final thirty (30) days (the
" _Final Extension_ "). For the sake of clarity, if Buyer were to exercise all
of the Extension Options and the Final Extension, the original Outside Date
would be extended a total of two hundred ten (210) days past the initial
Outside Date. Any extension of the Outside Date after the Final Extension
shall require the mutual agreement of the Parties. If (i) the applicable
waiting period under the HSR Act relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement has not expired or been terminated within sixty (60) days of
the date of this Agreement, and (ii) Buyer has complied, in all material
respects, with its obligations set forth in _Section 6.4(a)_, then Buyer may
terminate this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement at any time thereafter (including prior to the Outside Date, during
any of the Extension Options or the Final Extension) with at least three (3)
Business Days written notice to Seller, provided that Buyers right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 6.4(b)_ shall be limited
to the failure to obtain clearance pursuant to the HSR Act. Upon such
termination of the Agreement by Buyer, and in accordance with _Section
2.3(a)(iv)_, Seller shall be entitled to receive from the Escrow Agent a
portion of the Deposit equal to the HSR Termination Fee, and the remaining
amount of the Deposit shall be returned to Buyer, with each distribution to be
made by the Escrow Agent within two (2) Business Days of the termination.

 



 

(c) In the event any Proceeding by any Governmental Entity or other Person is
commenced which questions the validity or legality of the transactions
contemplated hereby or seeks damages in connection therewith, the Parties
agree to cooperate and use reasonable efforts to defend against such
Proceeding and, if an injunction or other order is issued in any such
Proceeding, to use commercially reasonable efforts to have such injunction or
other order lifted, and to cooperate reasonably regarding any other impediment
to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(d) Seller and Buyer shall permit counsel for the other Party reasonable
opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the
other Party in connection with, any proposed written communication to any
Governmental Entity relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each of Seller and Buyer agrees not to participate in any
substantive meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone with any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement unless it consults with the other Party in advance and, to the
extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives the other Party the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting or discussion.

 



 

(e) Neither Seller nor any Group Company shall have any liability to Buyer
directly arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any consents or
waivers (including any waivers of any rights of first refusal, rights of first
offer or similar rights) that are contained or contemplated by the Contracts
listed on _Schedule 3.5_ hereto in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or because of the termination of any contract
as a result thereof, and no such failure or termination shall result in the
failure of any condition set forth in _ARTICLE 7_.

 



 

Section 6.5 _Public Announcements_. Buyer, on the one hand, and the Company
and Seller, on the other hand, shall consult with one another and seek one
anothers prior written consent before issuing any press release, or otherwise
making any public statements, with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement prior to such consultation and prior written consent;
_provided_ that each Party may make any such announcement which it in good
faith believes, based on advice of counsel, is necessary in connection with
any requirement of Law, it being understood and agreed that each Party shall
provide the other Parties with copies of any such announcement in advance of
such issuance.

 



 

Section 6.6 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 



      
 

 



 

(a) Buyer agrees that all rights to indemnification or exculpation now
existing in favor of the directors, officers, employees and agents of Seller
and each Group Company, as provided in Sellers or such Group Companys
Governing Documents or otherwise in effect as of the date hereof with respect
to any matters occurring prior to the Closing Date, shall survive the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall continue in full force
and effect and that the Group Companies on their own or on Sellers behalf,
will perform and discharge Sellers and the Group Companies obligations to
provide such indemnity and exculpation. To the maximum extent permitted by
applicable Law, such indemnification shall be mandatory rather than
permissive, and the Company shall advance expenses in connection with such
indemnification as provided in Sellers or such Group Companys Governing
Documents or other applicable agreements. The indemnification and liability
limitation or exculpation provisions of the Group Companies Governing
Documents shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified after the
Closing Date in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder
of individuals who, as of the Closing Date or at any time prior to the Closing
Date, were directors, officers, employees or agents of Seller or any Group
Company, unless such modification is required by applicable Law.

 



 

(b) Contemporaneously with the Closing, Seller, at Buyers sole expense, shall
cause the Company to, and the Company shall, purchase and maintain in effect,
beginning on the Closing and for a period of six (6) years thereafter, without
any lapses in coverage, a "tail" policy providing directors and officers
liability insurance coverage for the benefit of those Persons who are covered
by Sellers or any Group Companys directors and officers liability
insurance policies as of the date hereof or at the Closing, for a period of
six (6) years following the Closing Date with respect to matters occurring
prior to the Closing that is at least equal to the coverage provided under
Sellers or the Group Companies current directors and officers liability
insurance policies; _provided_ that the Company may substitute therefor
policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions which
are no less advantageous to the beneficiaries thereof so long as such
substitution does not result in gaps or lapses in coverage with respect to
matters occurring prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ further that, in
satisfying its obligations under this Section, the Company shall not be
obligated to pay premiums in excess of 300% of the amount per annum the
Company paid in its last full fiscal year, which amount the Company has
disclosed to Buyer prior to the date hereof, but nonetheless shall be
obligated to maintain the maximum amount of liability insurance coverage
available for such limit.

 



 

(c) The directors, officers, employees and agents of Seller and each Group
Company entitled to the indemnification, liability limitation, exculpation and
insurance set forth in this _Section 6.6_ are intended to be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 6.6_. This _Section 6.6_ shall survive the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall be
binding on all successors and assigns of Buyer and the Company.

 



 

Section 6.7 _Exclusive Dealing_. During the period from the date of this
Agreement until the earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, neither Seller nor any of the Group
Companies shall take, nor shall it permit any of its Affiliates, officers,
directors, employees, representatives, consultants, financial advisors,
attorneys, accountants or other agents to take, any action to solicit,
encourage, initiate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or provide
any information to or enter into any agreement with any Person (other than
Buyer and/or its respective Affiliates) concerning any purchase of

 



      
 

 



 

any of the Group Companies equity securities or any merger, sale of
substantial assets or similar transaction involving any Group Company, other
than assets sold in the ordinary course of business (each such acquisition
transaction, an " _Acquisition Transaction_ "); _provided_ , however, that
Buyer hereby acknowledges that prior to the date of this Agreement, the
Company has provided information relating to the Group Companies and has
afforded access to, and engaged in discussions with, other Persons in
connection with a proposed Acquisition Transaction and that such information,
access and discussions could reasonably enable another Person to form a basis
for an Acquisition Transaction without any breach by the Company of this
_Section 6.7_. Seller and the Company shall promptly notify Buyer if any such
discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, any
such inquiries or proposals are received by, or any such information is
requested from, Seller or any of the Group Companies, or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees and representatives.

 



 

Section 6.8 _Documents and Information; Financial Information_.

 



 

(a) After the Closing Date, Buyer and the Company shall, and shall cause the
Companys Subsidiaries to, until the seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing
Date, retain all books, records and other documents pertaining to the business
of the Group Companies in existence on the Closing Date and make the same
available for inspection and copying by Seller (at Sellers expense) during
normal business hours of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, upon reasonable request and upon reasonable notice. No such books,
records or documents shall be destroyed after the seventh (7th) anniversary of
the Closing Date by Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, without
first advising Seller in writing and giving Seller a reasonable opportunity to
obtain possession thereof.

 



 

(b) During the period from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms, Seller and the Company shall, and after the Closing Date Seller shall
continue to, cooperate reasonably with Buyer to modify the Financial
Statements and prepare other financial information in such form and for such
periods as may be reasonably requested by Buyer in order for Buyer to meet the
requirements of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
or other U.S. federal securities Laws applicable to Buyers financial
statements relating to the Company and Buyers purchase of the Shares,
provided that any such modifications to the Financial Statements shall not be
considered modifications for purposes of the representation and warranty set
forth in _Section 3.4_ and/or the related condition precedent in _Section
7.2(a)_. Any such modifications shall be made, and any such cooperation shall
be provided, at Buyers sole cost and expense, including the reimbursement of
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

 



 

Section 6.9 _Contact with Business Relations_. During the period from the date
of this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Buyer hereby agrees that it is
not authorized to and shall not (and shall not permit any of its employees,
agents, representatives or Affiliates to) contact any employee (excluding
executive officers), customer, supplier, Dealer, Material Supplier,
distributor or other material business relation of any Group Company regarding
any Group Company or its business without the prior written consent of Seller.

 



 

Section 6.10 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 



      
 

 



 

(a) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the first
(1st) anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide employees of each
Group Company who continue to be employed by a Group Company or by Buyer or
any of Buyers other Subsidiaries after the Closing (the " _Continuing
Employees_ ") with a salary or hourly wage rate that is the same as or better
than the salary or wage rate provided to such employees prior to the Closing
Date and with employee benefits (excluding equity arrangements) that are the
same as or better than, in the aggregate, those provided by the Group
Companies prior to the Closing Date. From and after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Continuing Employee to
receive credit for any service with such Group Company (or any ERISA Affiliate
thereof) earned prior to the Closing Date (i) for eligibility and vesting
purposes and (ii) if applicable, for purposes of vacation accrual and
severance benefit determinations under any benefit or compensation plan,
program, agreement or arrangement of Buyer and its subsidiaries in which the
Continuing Employees may participate or be eligible to participate after the
Closing Date (the " _Buyer Plans_ "). In addition, Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to (A) cause to be waived all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements and similar
limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements under any Buyer Plans to the extent waived or satisfied by an
employee under any Employee Benefit Plan as of the Closing Date and (B) cause
any deductible, co-insurance and covered out-of-pocket expenses paid on or
before the Closing Date by any Continuing Employee (or covered dependent
thereof) to be taken into account for purposes of satisfying the corresponding
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions after the Closing
Date under any applicable Buyer Plan in the year of initial participation.
Nothing contained herein, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any
employee of any Group Company any right to continued employment for any period
or continued receipt of any specific employee benefit, or shall constitute an
amendment to or any other modification of any Buyer Plan or Employee Benefit
Plan.

 



 

(b) The Company shall terminate the Employee Benefit Plans listed as items 1
through 8 on _Schedule 3.10(a)_ immediately prior to the Closing. In
connection with the termination of such plans and agreements, the Company will
pay the terminated plan and agreement benefits to the applicable employees at
the Closing with such amounts constituting Seller Expenses.

 



 

Section 6.11 _Notices; Schedule Supplements_.

 



 

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date, each
Party shall notify each other Party in writing of (i) any Company Material
Adverse Effect (in the case the notifying Party is Seller) or a material and
adverse effect on Buyers ability to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby (in the case the notifying Party is Buyer), (ii) any fact,
circumstance, event or action the existence, occurrence or taking of which has
resulted in, or would reasonably be expected to result in, any representation
or warranty of Seller hereunder (in the case the notifying Party is Seller) or
Buyer hereunder (in the case the notifying Party is Buyer), not being true and
correct, in each case, to the extent the fact, circumstance, event or action
underlying such breach has occurred on or prior to the date hereof, or (iii)
any fact, circumstance, event or action the existence, occurrence or taking of
which has resulted in, or would reasonably be expected to result in, the
failure of any of the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE 7_ to be satisfied.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) From and after the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date, the
Company may, within five (5) Business Days of obtaining actual knowledge of
the occurrence of the matter being disclosed, prepare and deliver to Buyer
supplements and/or amendments to the disclosure schedules to this Agreement
(the " _Schedules_ ") (which may contain additional Schedules that are not in
existence as of the date hereof relating to any of the provisions contained in
_ARTICLE 3_, in each case, such supplement, amendment or new Schedule being
referred to as an " _Update_ ") only with respect to matters first occurring
after the date hereof and which matters do not result from a breach of any
covenants required to be performed or complied with by the Company or Seller
under this Agreement, and each such Update shall be deemed to be an amendment
to this Agreement for all purposes hereof other than for purposes of the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.2_; _provided_ that, in the event that the
disclosure of the facts, circumstances and events included in such Update
would give Buyer the right to elect to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(b)_ if the 20-day cure period described therein had lapsed and
Buyer does not make such election within ten (10) Business Days of its receipt
of such Update, such Update shall be deemed to be an amendment to this
Agreement for all purposes hereof, including with respect to the conditions
set forth in _Section 7.2_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Companys
right to supplement or amend the Schedules shall be limited to the matters
pertaining to _ARTICLE 3_ of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.12 _Restrictions on Transfer_. Prior to the Closing or the earlier
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Seller shall not
sell, transfer, contribute, pledge, distribute or otherwise dispose of or
incur any Liens on the Shares owned by Seller, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

 



 

Section 6.13 _Confidentiality_. From and after the Closing, Seller shall, and
shall cause its controlled Affiliates to, for a period of two (2) years from
and after the Closing Date, hold, and shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause its or their respective representatives to hold in confidence
any and all confidential and proprietary information, whether written or oral,
of the Group Companies, except to the extent that such information (a) is or
becomes generally available to or known by the public or the industry in which
the Group Companies operate without a breach by Seller or any of its
controlled Affiliates of the restrictions contained in this _Section 6.13_,
(b) is acquired by Seller, any of its controlled Affiliates or their
respective representatives from and after the Closing from sources which are
not actually known to such Person to be prohibited from disclosing such
information by a legal or contractual obligation or (c) following the Closing
Date, is independently developed or derived by Seller, its controlled
Affiliates or their respective representatives without reference to or the use
of any such confidential information; _provided_ , that if Seller is, based
upon the advice of its legal counsel, required to disclose any such
confidential information (by law, regulations, interrogatories, requests for
information or documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or other
process or compulsion or the rules of an applicable stock exchange), then
Seller may disclose that portion of such confidential information which its
counsel advises that it is required to disclose; provided that Seller shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an appropriate protective order
or other reasonable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded
such information, in each case, at Buyers sole cost and expense and upon
Buyers request. The provisions of this _Section 6.13_ shall not be
interpreted to prohibit the sharing by Seller of information of the Group
Companies or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
in the event of a dispute under this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.14 _Letters of Credit_. On or prior to the Closing Date, subject to
the mutually agreed outreach plan for communicating with counterparties of the
Company, the Company, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate and use their
commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions reasonably required in
order to terminate the outstanding L/Cs. In the event that termination of all
such L/Cs is unable to occur at the Closing, Buyer will, or will cause one of
its Affiliates to, post cash collateral or a back-to-back standby letter of
credit with the issuer of such L/Cs in a manner that will allow the issuer to
release its collateral and provide the Pay-off Letters.

 



 

Section 6.15 _No Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter_. Buyer shall not take
or cause or permit any Group Company to take any action with respect to the
Group Companies subsequent to the Closing that would cause the transactions
contemplated hereby to constitute part of a transaction that is the same as,
or substantially similar to, the "Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter"
described in Internal Revenue Service Notices 2001-16 and 2008-111.

 



 

Section 6.16 _Seller Release_. Upon the occurrence of the Closing, Seller
hereby releases and forever discharges Buyer and each of its individual, joint
or mutual, past, present and future representatives, Affiliates, successors
and assigns (individually, a " _Releasee_ " and collectively, " _Releasees_ ")
from any and all claims, demands, proceedings, causes of action, orders,
obligations, contracts, agreements, debts and Liabilities whatsoever, whether
known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, both at law and in equity, which
Seller or any of its Affiliates now has, has ever had or may hereafter have
against the Releasees arising contemporaneously with or prior to the Closing
Date or on account of or arising out of any matter, cause or event, occurring
contemporaneously with or prior to the Closing Date; provided, that nothing
contained herein shall operate to release (i) any obligations of Buyer arising
under this Agreement or any agreement entered into in connection therewith,
(ii) in the case of any Releasee who is an employee of any Group Company, any
claims for salary or wages and benefits which are not past due as of the
Closing Date, or (iii) in the case of any Releasee who is an officer, director
or manager of any Group Company, any claims for indemnification or
reimbursement that such Releasee may have against such Group Company under its
organizational documents or this Agreement (not including indemnification or
reimbursement claims related to claims made under this Agreement).

 



 

Section 6.17 _Divested Facilities_. If any Group Company sells, transfers or
assigns a Facility prior to the Closing, the proceeds from such sale, transfer
or assignment shall be included (without duplication) in Cash and Cash
Equivalents and the Enterprise Value shall be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar
basis. If a Group Company finances any portion of such sale, transfer or
assignment for the third party purchaser, the financed portion (i.e., a note
or other Indebtedness) shall not be included in the Notes Receivable Amount.

 



 

Section 6.18 _Hauling Business_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
terminate the Group Companies operation of fuel distribution vehicles and any
related hauling services, so long as such termination does not violate any
applicable Contract of any Group Company. Any and all costs and expenses
associated with or related to such termination shall be the responsibility of
Seller.

 **ARTICLE 8 
TERMINATION; AMENDMENT; WAIVER**

 



 

Section 8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be abandoned at any time prior
to the Closing:

 



 

(a) by mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller;

 



 

(b) by Buyer, if any of the representations or warranties of Seller or the
Company set forth in _ARTICLE 3_ or _ARTICLE 4_ shall not be true and
correct or if the Company or Seller has failed to perform any covenant or
agreement on the part of Seller or the Company set forth in this Agreement
(including an obligation to consummate the Closing) _such that_ the condition
to Closing set forth in either _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_,
respectively, would not be satisfied and the breach or breaches causing such
representations or warranties not to be true and correct, or the failures to
perform any covenant or agreement, as applicable, are not cured within twenty
(20) days after written notice thereof is delivered to Seller; _provided_ that
Buyer is not then in breach of this Agreement so as to cause the condition to
Closing set forth in either _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_ from being
satisfied;

 



 

(c) by Seller, if any of the representations or warranties of Buyer set forth
in _ARTICLE 5_ shall not be true and correct or if Buyer has failed to
perform any covenant or agreement on the part of Buyer set forth in this
Agreement (including an obligation to consummate the Closing) _such that_ the
condition to Closing set forth in either _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section
7.3(b)_, respectively, would not be satisfied and the breach or breaches
causing such

 



       
 

 



 

representations or warranties not to be true and correct, or the failures to
perform any covenant or agreement, as applicable, are not cured within twenty
(20) days after written notice thereof is delivered to Buyer; _provided_ that
neither Seller nor any Group Company is then in breach of this Agreement so as
to cause the condition to Closing set forth in either _Section 7.2(a)_ or
_Section 7.2(b)_ from being satisfied;

 



 

(d) by Seller, if the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not
have been consummated on or prior to January 5, 2015, or as extended by Buyer
pursuant to _Section 6.4(b)_ (the " _Outside Date_ ") and Seller shall not
have breached in any material respect its obligations under this Agreement in
any manner that shall have proximately caused the failure to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement on or before the Outside Date;

 



 

(e) by any Party, if any Governmental Entity shall have issued an Order or
taken any other action permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise
prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such Order or
other action shall have become final and non-appealable; _provided_ that the
Party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(e)_
shall have used commercially reasonable efforts to remove such Order; or

 



 

(f) by Buyer in accordance with _Section 6.4(b)_.

 



 

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_, this entire Agreement shall forthwith
become void (and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of
Buyer, Seller, Buyer Gurantor or the Company or their respective officers,
directors or equity holders) with the exception of (a) the provisions of this
_Section 8.2_, _Section 6.3(b)_, _Section 6.5_, and _ARTICLE 10_, each of
which provisions shall survive such termination and remain valid and binding
obligations of the Parties, and (b) any liability of any Party for any willful
failure to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement prior to such
termination (including any failure by a Party to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement if it is obligated to do so hereunder). For
purposes of this _Section 8.2_, "willful" shall mean a breach that is a
consequence of an act undertaken by the breaching Party with the knowledge
that the taking of such act would, or would be reasonably expected to, cause a
breach of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.3 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, Seller (on
behalf of itself and the Company) may (a) extend the time for the performance
of any of the obligations or other acts of Buyer contained herein, (b) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of Buyer contained
herein or in any document, certificate or writing delivered by Buyer pursuant
hereto or (c) waive compliance by Buyer with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein. At any time prior to the Closing, Buyer may (i)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
the Company or Seller contained herein, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the Company and Seller contained herein or
in any document, certificate or writing delivered by the Company or Seller
pursuant hereto or (iii) waive compliance by the Company and Seller with any
of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of
any Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in
a written instrument signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party
to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE 9 
INDEMNIFICATION**

 



 

Section 9.1 _Survival_. Subject to the limitations and other provisions of
this Agreement, all of the representations and warranties of the Parties
contained herein shall survive the Closing and shall remain in full force and
effect until the date that is twelve (12) months from the Closing Date (the "
_Cutoff Date_ "). All covenants and agreements of the Parties contained herein
shall survive the Closing indefinitely or for the period explicitly specified
therein; _provided_ , that all covenants and agreements contained herein which
by their terms are to be performed in whole on or prior to the Closing Date
shall terminate upon and shall not survive the Closing, unless the breach or
non-fulfillment of any such covenant at or prior to the Closing was not
disclosed in the Company Certificate, in which case, for purposes of any claim
for breach or non-fulfillment of any such covenant, such covenant shall
survive until the Cutoff Date (the " _Surviving Pre-Closing Covenants_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any claims asserted in good faith with
reasonable specificity (to the extent known at such time) and in writing by
notice from the non-breaching Party to the breaching Party prior to the Cutoff
Date or end of any other applicable survival period shall not thereafter be
barred by the expiration of the relevant representation, warranty or covenant
and such claims shall survive until finally resolved.

 



 

Section 9.2 _Indemnification By Seller_. Subject to the other terms and
conditions of this _ARTICLE 9_, from and after the Closing, Seller shall
indemnify and defend each of Buyer and its Affiliates and their respective
representatives (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnitees_ ") against, and shall
hold each of them harmless from and against, and shall pay and reimburse each
of them for, any and all Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, the
Buyer Indemnitees as a result of:

 



 

(a) any breach of any of the representations or warranties of Seller or the
Company contained in this Agreement, as of the date such representation or
warranty was made or as if such representation or warranty was made on and as
of the Closing Date;

 



 

(b) any breach or non-fulfillment of (i) any covenant, agreement or obligation
to be performed by Seller following the Closing pursuant to this Agreement and
(ii) any Surviving Pre-Closing Covenant;

 



 

(c) any and all Seller Taxes;

 



 

(d) the Compensation Claim; and

 



 

(e) the Stratford Claim.

 



 

Section 9.3 _Indemnification By Buyer_. Subject to the other terms and
conditions of this _ARTICLE 9_, from and after the Closing, Buyer shall
indemnify and defend each of Seller and its Affiliates and their respective
representatives (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnitees_ ") against, and
shall hold each of them harmless from and against, and shall pay and reimburse
each of them for, any and all Losses actually incurred or sustained by, or
imposed upon, the Seller Indemnitees as a result of:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) any breach of any of the representations or warranties of Buyer contained
in this Agreement, as of the date such representation or warranty was made or
as if such representation or warranty was made on and as of the Closing Date;
or

 



 

(b) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation to
be performed by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.4 _Certain Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, the indemnification provided for in _Section 9.2_ and
_Section 9.3_ shall be subject to the following limitations:

 



 

(a) Seller shall not be liable to the Buyer Indemnitees for indemnification
under _Section 9.2(a)_ (other than with respect to a claim for
indemnification as a result of any inaccuracy in or breach of _Section 3.1_
(Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries), _Section 3.2_ (Capitalization
of the Group Companies), _Section 3.3_ (Authority), _Section 3.15_ (Tax
Matters), _Section 3.16_ (Brokers), _Section 3.17(a)_ (Owned Real
Properties), _Section 3.17(b)_ (Leased Real Property), _Section 4.1_
(Authority), _Section 4.3_ (Title to Shares), and _Section 4.5_ (Brokers)
(collectively, the " _Fundamental Representations_ ")), until the aggregate
amount of all Losses indemnifiable under _Section 9.2(a)_ (other than those
with respect to a Fundamental Representation) exceeds an amount equal to Two
Million Dollars ($2,000,000), in which event the Buyer Indemnitees shall only
be entitled to recover Losses in excess of such amount, subject to the other
limitations set forth herein.

 



 

(b) Seller shall not be liable to the Buyer Indemnitees for indemnification
under _Section 9.2(a)_ (other than with respect to a claim for
indemnification with respect to a Fundamental Representation) for any
particular Loss (including any series of related Losses) indemnifiable
pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ (other than those with respect to a Fundamental
Representation), unless such Loss (including any series of related Losses)
equals or exceeds $25,000 (the " _Per Claim Deductible_ "), and any Losses (or
series of related Losses) that are less than the Per Claim Deductible (other
than those with respect to a Fundamental Representation) shall not be included
in the aggregate Losses indemnifiable pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_, including
for purposes of _Section 9.4(a)_.

 



 

(c) The maximum liability of Seller with respect to Losses indemnifiable
pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ (other than with respect to a claim for
indemnification with respect to a breach of a Fundamental Representation by
Seller or the Company) and _Section 9.2(b)_ shall be the Indemnification
Escrow Amount and the Indemnification Escrow Amount shall be the sole and
exclusive source of recovery with respect to such indemnifiable Losses.

 



 

(d) The Seller Indemnitees and the Buyer Indemnitees shall be obligated to pay
for the same Loss only once under this _ARTICLE 9_ even if a claim for
indemnification in respect of such Loss has been made as a result of a breach
of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement.

 



 

(e)

 



 

(i) Subject to the provisions of this _Section 9.4(e)_, the amount of any and
all Losses shall be determined net of (i) any amounts or Losses actually
received by any of

 



      
 

 



 

the Buyer Indemnitees (net of any related costs and expenses incurred in
connection therewith, including the direct costs of insurance premiums and
deductibles relating to any such insurance proceeds) under or pursuant to (x)
any insurance coverage or storage tank fund, and all arrangements set forth on
_Schedule 3.11(d)_ (collectively, " _Alternative Arrangements_ ") and (y) any
other indemnity or reimbursement arrangement or Contract or from other
collateral sources and (ii) any Tax benefits realized (whether by refund,
credit against or reduction in Taxes otherwise payable) by the Buyer
Indemnitees or any of their respective Affiliates (during, or before, the
calendar year in which Seller makes a payment pursuant to this _ARTICLE 9)_
arising from the incurrence or payment of the underlying obligations relating
to such Losses. To the extent such Tax benefit is not realized during, or
before, the taxable year in which Seller makes a payment pursuant to this
_ARTICLE 9_, Buyer shall remit to Seller the amount of any Tax benefit
actually realized by the Buyer Indemnitees or any of their respective
Affiliates during or with respect to the five (5) taxable years following the
year in which Seller makes such payment. For purposes of this _Section
9.4(e)_, a Tax benefit is realized when and to the extent (A) the hypothetical
Tax liability of Buyer and its Affiliates in a Tax year, calculated by
excluding the relevant Tax deductions attributable to the Losses exceed (B)
the actual Tax liability of Buyer and its Affiliates for such Tax year
calculated by taking into account the relevant Tax deductions attributable to
the Losses (and treating such deductions as the last items in such
calculation). Buyer shall remit to Seller the amount of the realized Tax
benefit within five (5) days after the date of realization.

 



 

(ii) Prior to recovering any amounts for indemnification from Seller, the
Buyer Indemnitees shall use commercially reasonable efforts to collect all
amounts available and recoverable under any Alternative Arrangements and
Seller shall provide reasonable cooperation to the Buyer Indemnitees
undertaking such efforts, including by providing reasonable access to any
documents, reports, data or other information in the possession of Seller
required by the Buyer Indemnitees or any Alternative Arrangements; _provided_
, _however_ , that, (A) in no event, shall the expenditure of such efforts
require the Buyer Indemnitees to expend any such efforts prior to submitting a
claim for indemnification under this Agreement, (B) nothing provided herein
shall require any Buyer Indemnitee to avail itself of any available policies
of self-insurance other than any Alternative Arrangements, and (C) if Buyer
seeks indemnification from Seller, Buyer shall provide Seller with documents
and information directly related to such efforts and recovery, as reasonably
requested by Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall not be liable
for any Losses related to any breach of the representations and warranties set
forth in _Section 3.11_ unless and until the Buyer Indemnitees have exhausted
their remedies under all Alternative Arrangements reasonably available to
Buyer or any Buyer Indemnitees, and thereafter, Seller shall only be
responsible for the portion of any Losses that is not satisfied or covered by
any reasonably available Alternative Arrangements (net of any related costs
and expenses incurred in connection therewith, including the direct costs of
premiums relating to any insurance proceeds) after satisfaction or payment of
any deductible or retention thereunder (which shall be the responsibility of
the applicable Buyer Indemnitee and shall not be indemnifiable Losses
hereunder); _provided_ , _however_ , that, in no event, shall the exhaustion
of such remedies require the Buyer Indemnitees to exhaust any such remedies
prior to submitting a claim for indemnification under this Agreement. For
purposes hereof, Buyer shall have satisfied the "exhaustion of remedies" of
Alternative Arrangements as long as Buyer has commenced a Proceeding in
pursuit of the Alternative Arrangements and Buyer prosecutes such Proceeding
in an attempt to avail itself of the Alternative Arrangements; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that "exhaustion

 



      
 

 



 

of remedies" shall not require Buyer to pursue or appeal any decision issued
in connection with any Proceeding.

 



 

(f) In any case where a Buyer Indemnitee recovers, under any Alternative
Arrangements, any amount in respect of a matter for which such Buyer
Indemnitee was, prior to such recovery, indemnified pursuant to _Section
9.2_, such Buyer Indemnitee shall promptly pay over to Seller any amount so
recovered from Seller (after deducting therefrom the amount of the expenses
incurred by such Buyer Indemnitee in procuring such recovery), but not in
excess of the sum of (i) any amount previously so paid by Seller to or on
behalf of such Buyer Indemnitee in respect of such matter and (ii) any amount
actually expended by Seller in pursuing or defending any claim arising out of
such matter that is indemnifiable as a Loss hereunder.

 



 

(g) The Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
_Section 9.2_ for any Loss to the extent that (i) such Loss is reflected as a
liability on the Latest Balance Sheet or reflected in the footnotes to the
Financial Statements or (ii) such Loss was taken into account in the
determination of the Final Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.4(d)_, each
only to the extent that amounts associated with such Loss are included
therein.

 



 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Seller shall not be
obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees for any Loss with respect to any
environmental matter or condition, including for any inaccuracy or breach of
the representations and warranties in _Section 3.11_ (Environmental Matters),
that is discovered or detected by any sampling, investigation, analysis or
reporting unless: (i) such sampling, investigating, analysis or reporting is
affirmatively required by Environmental Laws or by a Governmental Entity; (ii)
such sampling, investigation, analysis or reporting is necessary to conduct in
defense of a Third Party Claim against Buyer Indemnitees alleging that
Hazardous Substances have migrated off of any Owned Real Property or any
Leased Real Property; or (iii) such sampling, investigation, analysis or
reporting is conducted in connection with the bona fide construction or
expansion of improvements by any Buyer Indemnitee at any Real Property
undertaken in the ordinary course of business to the extent such sampling,
investigation, analysis or reporting is consistent with industry practice. Any
indemnification of any of the Buyer Indemnitees with respect to any
remediation, removal or cleanup, including any investigation, monitoring, or
remedial obligations, shall be limited to such costs for such actions that are
required by Environmental Laws to attain compliance with minimum applicable
remedial standards for continued use of the relevant property or facility as a
gasoline fueling and service station and/or convenience store with gasoline
fueling operations, employing, if appropriate, available or acceptable,
permissible risk-based remedial standards and reasonable deed or use
restrictions and institutional controls.

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if any Buyer
Indemnitee makes a claim for Losses against Seller under this _ARTICLE 9_,
neither Seller nor any Indemnified Person that is an Affiliate of such Seller
will make any claim for indemnification under this _ARTICLE 9_ against Buyer,
its Affiliates or any of the Group Companies by reason of the fact that Seller
or its Affiliates was a controlling person, director, employee or
representative of any of the Group Companies with respect to the claim brought
by such Buyer Indemnitee against Seller or that is based on the facts or
circumstances that form the basis for the indemnification claim brought by
such Buyer Indemnitee against Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in
this _Section 9.4(i)_ shall in any way limit or otherwise affect any

 



      
 

 



 

rights granted to the directors, officers, employees and agents of Seller and
each Group Company pursuant to _Section 6.6(c)_.

 



 

(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller
covenants and agrees the following with respect to Losses indemnifiable
pursuant to _Section 9.2(d)_ and _Section 9.2(e)_ (together, the " _Retained
Claims_ "):

 



 

(i) Seller will maintain a minimum net asset value, determined in accordance
with GAAP, of Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000) until six (6) months after
the expiration of all applicable statutes of limitation, provided that such
requirement shall cease upon the settlement of both of the Retained Claims so
long as each such settlement is in writing and provides for the unconditional
release from all liabilities and obligations associated with the Retained
Claims;

 



 

(ii) Seller is responsible, without limitation as either to amounts or time,
for any and all Losses associated with the Retained Claims;

 



 

(iii) Seller, at its sole cost and expense, will direct and control with
counsel and other professionals of its choosing (and reasonably acceptable to
Buyer) any and all matters or proceedings associated with the Retained Claims
including, but not limited to, settlement discussions, litigation and dispute
resolution proceedings;

 



 

(iv) Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable
respects in connection with the defense of the Retained Claims, including
making available records relating to such Retained Claims and furnishing,
without expense (other than reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses) to
Seller, such management employees of Buyer or its Affiliates, information and
testimony, and attending such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials and appeals as may be reasonably necessary for the preparation of the
defense of such Retained Claims;

 



 

(v) Buyer, at its own cost and expense, may employ separate counsel of its own
choice to monitor the defense of the Retained Claims;

 



 

(vi) Seller agrees and covenants to provide periodic updates and otherwise
provide such other information that may be reasonably requested by Buyer or
its counsel with respect to the Retained Claims, to the extent that the
provision of such updates and information would not, based on Sellers
reasonable determination and upon the advice of counsel, result in the loss of
the ability to successfully assert attorney-client and work product
privileges; and

 



 

(vii) Buyers consent shall be required for any proposed settlement of either
of the Retained Claims, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned, provided that such consent shall only be required with respect
to the non-monetary aspects of any such proposed settlement.

 



 

Section 9.5 _Indemnification Procedures_. The party making a claim under this
_ARTICLE 9_ is referred to as the " _Indemnified Party,_ " and the party
against whom such claims are asserted under this _ARTICLE 9_ is referred to
as the " _Indemnifying Party._ "

 



      
 

 



 

(a) _Third Party Claims_. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any Proceeding made or brought by any Person who
is not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement
or a representative of the foregoing (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") against such
Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is obligated to
provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall give
the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof (the " _Claim
Notice_ "), but in any event not later than thirty (30) calendar days after
receipt of such notice of such Third Party Claim. The failure to give such
prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of
its indemnification obligations, except to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party is prejudiced thereby. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall
describe the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of
all material written evidence thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount,
if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may reasonably be
sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have the
right to participate in, or by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party,
to assume the conduct and control of the settlement or defense of any Third
Party Claim at the Indemnifying Partys expense and by the Indemnifying
Partys own counsel, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith
in such defense; _provided_ , that if the Indemnifying Party is Seller, such
Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to defend or direct the defense of
any such Third Party Claim that (x) is asserted directly by or on behalf of a
Person that is a material supplier, Dealer or customer of any Group Company,
or (y) seeks an injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnified
Party. In the event that the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any
Third Party Claim, subject to _Section 9.5(b)_, it shall have the right to
take such action as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or
make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third Party Claim in the name and on
behalf of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to
participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim with counsel selected by
it subject to the Indemnifying Partys right to control the settlement and
defense thereof. The fees and disbursements of such counsel shall be at the
expense of the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to
compromise or defend such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may,
subject to _Section 9.5(b)_, pay, compromise, defend such Third Party Claim
and seek indemnification for any and all Losses based upon, arising from or
relating to such Third Party Claim. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each
other in all reasonable respects in connection with the defense of any Third
Party Claim, including making available records relating to such Third Party
Claim and furnishing, without expense (other than reimbursement of actual out-
of-pocket expenses) to the defending party, such management employees of the
non-defending party, information and testimony, and attending such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be
reasonably necessary for the preparation of the defense of such Third Party
Claim.

 



 

(b) _Settlement of Third Party Claims_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into settlement of any
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed),
except to the extent such settlement does not provide for liability or the
creation of a financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnified
Party and provides, in customary form, for the unconditional release of each
Indemnified Party from all liabilities and obligations in connection with such
Third Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense pursuant
to _Section 9.5(a)_, it shall not agree to any settlement without the written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be

 



      
 

 



 

unreasonably withheld or delayed), and no such settlement shall be
determinative of the Indemnifying Partys obligations under this _ARTICLE 9_.

 



 

(c) _Direct Claims_. Any Proceeding by an Indemnified Party on account of a
Loss which does not result from a Third Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ")
shall be asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party
reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later than
sixty (60) days after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of such Direct
Claim. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not, however,
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except to
the extent that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby. Such notice by
the Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail,
shall include copies of all material written evidence thereof and shall
indicate the estimated amount of the Loss that has been or may be reasonably
sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall allow the
Indemnifying Party and its professional advisors to investigate the matter or
circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether and to what
extent any amount is payable in respect of the Direct Claim and the
Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying Partys investigation by
giving such information and assistance (including access to the Companys
premises and personnel and the right to examine and copy any accounts,
documents or records) as the Indemnifying Party or any of its professional
advisors may reasonably request.

 



 

Section 9.6 _Subrogation_. In the event of payment by or on behalf of any
Indemnifying Party to any Indemnified Party (including pursuant to this
_ARTICLE 9_) in connection with any Third Party Claim, such Indemnifying
Party shall be subrogated to and shall stand in the place of such Indemnified
Party as to any events or circumstances in respect of which such Indemnified
Party may have any right, defense or claim relating to such claim or demand
against any claimant or plaintiff asserting such claim or demand. Such
Indemnified Party shall cooperate with such Indemnifying Party in a reasonable
manner, and at the cost of such Indemnifying Party, in presenting any
subrogated right, defense or claim.

 



 

Section 9.7 _Payments_.

 



 

(a) Any amounts owing from Seller pursuant to this _ARTICLE 9_ shall be made
solely by disbursement of a portion of the Indemnification Escrow Amount
pursuant to the Closing Escrow Agreement. In no event shall the Buyer
Indemnitees be entitled to recover an aggregate amount pursuant to this
_ARTICLE 9_ in excess of the available portion of the Indemnification Escrow
Amount at any given time. Any amounts payable by Buyer pursuant to this
_ARTICLE 9_ shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the applicable Seller Indemnitee within five (5) Business Days of the final
determination thereof.

 



 

(b) Any portion of the Indemnification Escrow Amount remaining as of the
Cutoff Date (less the aggregate amount claimed by the Buyer Indemnitees
pursuant to claims made against such funds in accordance with this Agreement
and the Closing Escrow Agreement and not fully resolved prior to such date)
shall be released to Seller. At any time following the Cutoff Date, to the
extent the available portion of the Indemnification Escrow Amount exceeds the
aggregate amount claimed by the Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to claims made
before the Cutoff Date and not fully resolved before the Cutoff Date, such
excess shall be promptly released to Seller. If any portion of the
Indemnification Escrow Amount remains after the resolution of

 



      
 

 



 

all claims made by the Buyer Indemnitees before the Cutoff Date, such amounts
shall be released to Seller.

 



 

(c) Buyer and Seller shall promptly deliver joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent in accordance with the Closing Escrow Agreement instructing the
Escrow Agent to make any distributions from the Indemnification Escrow Amount
as contemplated by this _Section 9.7_.

 



 

Section 9.8 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. All indemnification
payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the Parties as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required
by Law.

 



 

Section 9.9 _Effect of Investigation_. The Buyer Indemnitees and the Seller
Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover Losses arising under _Section
9.2(a)_ or _Section 9.3(a)_ (as the case may be) to the extent Seller or
Buyer (as the case may be) had actual knowledge, at or prior to the date of
this Agreement, of a fact or series of related facts that Seller or Buyer (as
the case may be) reasonably believed would be a breach of a representation or
warranty set forth in this Agreement and that Losses would result from such
breach (in each case to the extent thereof); _provided_ , that (i) such Buyer
Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee shall have the burden of proof to establish
actual knowledge of Seller or Buyer (as the case may be) pursuant to this
_Section 9.9_, and (ii) the actual knowledge of Buyer for purposes of this
_Section 9.9_ shall mean the actual knowledge, without independent
investigation, of Mark Cosenza, Dylan Remley and Winston Eaton.

 



 

Section 9.10 _Exclusive Remedies_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that,
from and after the Closing, their sole and exclusive remedy with respect to
any and all claims (other than claims for intentional fraud committed with
actual knowledge on the part of a party in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, which such claims shall not be subject to any
monetary or survival limitations set forth in this Agreement, and other than
claims to enforce, or for breach of, Buyer Guarantors Obligations pursuant to
_Section 10.20_) for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to or in any
way arising from the subject matter of this Agreement, shall be to make a
claim for Losses pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this
_ARTICLE 9_ and the Parties hereby waive any other statutory and common law
remedies or claims. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that each Buyer Indemnitees right to indemnification
under this _ARTICLE 9_ for any environmental matter, including for any breach
or inaccuracy of the representations and warranties contained in _Section
3.11_ (Environmental Matters), shall constitute such Buyer Indemnitees sole
and exclusive remedy against Seller with respect to any environmental matter,
including any such matter arising under any Environmental Laws. The Buyer
Indemnitees hereby, except as specifically reserved under this _ARTICLE 9_,
(a) waive any remedies or claims that may be available under Environmental
Laws, and (b) release Seller from any claim, demand or liability with respect
to any environmental matters, including any such claims arising under
Environmental Laws.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE 10 
MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

Section 10.1 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement (a) constitutes
the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and (b) shall not be assigned by any Party (whether by operation of Law or
otherwise), other than for collateral purposes, without the prior written
consent of Buyer and Seller; _provided_ that Buyer may assign its rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement to any Affiliate of Buyer
without Sellers prior written consent so long as Buyer remains the primary
obligor under this Agreement. Any attempted assignment of this Agreement not
in accordance with the terms of this _Section 10.1_ shall be void.

 



 

Section 10.2 _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other
communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given (and shall be
deemed to have been duly given upon receipt) by delivery in person, by

Section 10.3 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all matters arising from or
relating to this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of
law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or
any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Law of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 10.4 _Certain Fees, Expenses, and Taxes_. Except as otherwise set
forth in this Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
the fees and disbursements of counsel, financial advisors and accountants,
shall be paid by the Party incurring such fees or expenses.

 



 

Section 10.5 _Construction; Interpretation_. The term "this Agreement" means
this Stock Purchase Agreement together with the Schedules and exhibits hereto,
as the same may from time to time be amended, modified, supplemented or
restated in accordance with the terms hereof. The headings contained in this
Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. No Party, nor its respective
counsel, shall be deemed the drafter of this Agreement for purposes of
construing the provisions hereof, and all provisions of this Agreement shall
be construed according to their fair meaning and not strictly for or against
any Party. Unless otherwise indicated to the contrary herein by the context or
use thereof: (i) the words, "herein," "hereto," "hereof" and words of similar
import refer to this Agreement as a whole, including the Schedules and
exhibits, and not to any particular section, subsection, paragraph,
subparagraph or clause contained in this Agreement; (ii) for purposes of
_Section 6.4_, the words "de minimis value" shall mean a value of five
percent (5%) of the Enterprise Value; (iii) masculine gender shall also
include the feminine and neutral genders, and vice versa; (iv) words importing
the singular shall also include the plural, and vice versa; (v) the words
"include," "includes" or "including" shall be deemed to be followed by the
words "without limitation"; and (vi) except as otherwise set forth in this
Agreement, any accounting terms shall be given the definition thereof under
GAAP.

 



 

Section 10.6 _Exhibits and Schedules_. All exhibits and Schedules, or
documents expressly incorporated into this Agreement, are hereby incorporated
into this Agreement and are hereby made a part hereof as if set out in full in
this Agreement. Any item disclosed in any Schedule referenced by a particular
section in this Agreement shall be deemed to have been disclosed with respect
to every other section in this Agreement if the relevance of such disclosure
to such other section is reasonably apparent. The specification of any dollar
amount in the representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or the
inclusion of any specific item in any Schedule is not intended to imply that
such amounts, or higher or lower amounts or the items so included or other
items, are or are not material, and no Party shall use the fact of the setting
of such amounts or the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or
controversy as to whether any obligation, items or matter not described herein
or included in a Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement. The Schedules and the information and disclosures contained therein
are intended only to qualify and limit the representations, warranties and
covenants of Seller contained in this Agreement and shall not be deemed to
expand in any way the scope or effect of any such representations, warranties
or covenants. A disclosure of any contract or agreement in the Schedules shall
be deemed to include any and all exhibits, addenda and schedules thereto. The
Schedules include brief descriptions or summaries of certain agreements and
instruments. Such descriptions or summaries do not purport to be
comprehensive, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the text of
the documents described.

 



 

Section 10.7 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each Party and its successors and permitted
assigns and, except as provided in _Section 6.6_, nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon

 



      
 

 



 

any other Person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever
under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.8 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, all other provisions of this Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any Party.

 



 

Section 10.9 _Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures_. This Agreement may be
executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an
original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by
facsimile or scanned PDF pages shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart to this Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.10 _Knowledge of the Company_. For all purposes of this Agreement,
the phrases "to the Knowledge of the Company" and "to the Companys Knowledge"
and "Known by the Company" and any derivations thereof shall mean as of the
applicable date, the actual knowledge of August Schiesser, Jeffrey A. Walker
and John T. Dziedzic (none of whom shall have any personal liability or
obligations regarding such knowledge), after making reasonable inquiry of
employees of the Group Companies generally responsible for the subject matter
to which knowledge is pertinent.

 



 

Section 10.11 _Limitation on Remedies_. Except in the case of intentional
fraud committed with actual knowledge, no breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant contained herein or in any certificate delivered pursuant
to this Agreement shall give rise to any right on the part of Buyer or Seller,
after the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, to rescind
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 10.12 _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or
implied in this Agreement, Buyer agrees and acknowledges that no recourse
under this Agreement or any documents or instruments delivered in connection
with this Agreement shall be had against any current or future director,
officer, or employee of Seller or of any Affiliate or assignee thereof, as
such, whether by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or
equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any statute, regulation or other
applicable Law, it being expressly agreed and acknowledged that no personal
liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred
by any current or future officer, agent or employee of Seller or any current
or future director, officer or employee of Seller or of any Affiliate or
assignee thereof, as such, for any obligation of Seller under this Agreement
or any documents or instruments delivered in connection with this Agreement
for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or
their creation.

 



 

Section 10.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND,
ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION (I) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR (II) IN ANY WAY
CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES IN
RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO, IN EACH
CASE,

 



      
 

 



 

WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT,
EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE. EACH PARTY HEREBY FURTHER AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY
SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL
WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT THE PARTIES MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY
COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

 



 

Section 10.14 _Jurisdiction and Venue_. Each of the Parties (i) submits to the
exclusive general jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery for the State of
Delaware (the " _Chancery Court_ ") and any state appellate court therefrom
located within the State of Delaware (or, only if the Chancery Court declines
to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court
within the State of Delaware) in any Proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, (ii) agrees that all claims in respect of such Proceeding may
be heard and determined in any such court and (iii) agrees not to bring any
Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other court.
Each of the Parties waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of any Proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety or other
security that might be required of any other Party with respect thereto. Each
Party agrees that service of summons and complaint or any other process that
might be served in any Proceeding may be made on such Party by sending or
delivering a copy of the process to the Party to be served at the address of
the Party and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in _Section
10.2_. Nothing in this _Section 10.14_, however, shall affect the right of
any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law. Each
Party agrees that a final, non-appealable judgment in any Proceeding so
brought shall be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in
any other manner provided by Law.

 



 

Section 10.15 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any
and all remedies provided herein will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such
party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy. The Parties agree and acknowledge that
irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be
an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not
perform their respective obligations under the provisions of this Agreement
(including failing to take such actions as are required of them hereunder to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with
their specific terms or otherwise breach such provisions. It is accordingly
agreed that, prior to the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1_, the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, in each case without posting a bond or undertaking, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief when expressly
available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the basis that the other
Parties have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is
not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.

 



 

Section 10.16 _Waiver of Conflicts_.

 



      
 

 



 

(a) Recognizing that McGuireWoods LLP has acted as legal counsel to Seller and
the Group Companies prior to the Closing, and that McGuireWoods LLP intends to
act as legal counsel to Seller and its Affiliates (which will no longer
include the Group Companies) after the Closing, each of Buyer and the Company
hereby waives, on its own behalf and agrees to cause its Affiliates to waive,
any conflicts that may arise in connection with McGuireWoods LLP representing
Seller and/or its Affiliates after the Closing as such representation may
relate to Buyer, any Group Company or the transactions contemplated herein. In
addition, all communications involving attorney-client confidences between
Seller, its Affiliates or any Group Company and McGuireWoods LLP in the course
of the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that
belong solely to Seller and its Affiliates (and not the Group Companies).
Accordingly, the Group Companies shall not have access to any such
communications, or to the files of McGuireWoods LLP relating to engagement,
whether or not the Closing shall have occurred, and Buyer will not, and will
cause each of its Affiliates no to, use any attorney-client communications
remaining in the records of any of the Group Companies after the Closing in a
manner that may be adverse to Seller or any of Sellers Affiliates.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon and after the
Closing, (i) Seller and its Affiliates (and not the Group Companies) shall be
the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to such
engagement, and none of the Group Companies shall be a holder thereof, (ii)
the files of McGuireWoods LLP and Matrix Private Equities, Inc. in respect of
such engagement constitute property only of Seller and its Affiliates (and not
the Group Companies) and (iii) McGuireWoods LLP shall have no duty whatsoever
to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications or files to any
of the Group Companies by reason of any attorney-client relationship between
McGuireWoods LLP and any of the Group Companies or otherwise. Furthermore,
Buyer agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of each of its Affiliates, that
in the event of a post-Closing dispute between Seller or Sellers Affiliate on
the one hand and any of the Group Companies on the other arising out of or
relating to any matter in which McGuireWoods LLP jointly represented both
parties, neither the attorney-client privilege, the expectation of client
confidence, nor any right to any other evidentiary privilege will protect from
disclosure to Seller or Sellers Affiliates any information or documents
developed or shared during the course of McGuireWoods LLPs joint
representation.

 



 

Section 10.17 _Time of Essence_. With regard to all dates and time periods set
forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

 



 

Section 10.18 _Further Assurances_. Following the Closing, as and when
requested by any Party and at such Partys expense, any other Party shall
execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents
and instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further or
other actions as such other Party may reasonably deem necessary to evidence
and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.19 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended or modified only by a
written agreement executed and delivered by duly authorized officers of Buyer,
Seller, and the Company. This Agreement may not be modified or amended except
as provided in the immediately preceding sentence and any purported amendment
by any Party or Parties effected in a manner which does not comply with this
_Section 10.19_ shall be void.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 10.20 _Buyer Guarantee_.

 



 

(a) Buyer Guarantor hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees to Seller and the Company the due, full and punctual payment and
performance of all covenants, obligations, liabilities and agreements of Buyer
hereunder (the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ "), subject to the terms and
conditions hereunder. If, for any reason whatsoever, Buyer fails or is unable
to duly, punctually and fully pay or perform the Guaranteed Obligations, Buyer
Guarantor will forthwith pay in lawful currency of the United States, or
perform or cause to be performed, the Guaranteed Obligations. The foregoing
obligation of Buyer Guarantor constitutes a continuing guarantee of payment
and performance (not of collection), and is and shall be absolute and
unconditional under any and all circumstances, including circumstances which
might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge of a guarantor or
surety and including any amendment, extension, modification or waiver of any
of the Guaranteed Obligations or any insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation or
dissolution of Buyer or any assignment thereby. Buyer Guarantor hereby
irrevocably waives (to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law) notice
of acceptance of this guaranty and notice of any liability to which it may
apply, and waives promptness, diligence, presentment, demand or payment,
protest, notice of dishonor or nonpayment, suit, filing objections with a
court, any right to require proceeding first against Buyer (including
initiating a Proceeding against Buyer), any right to require the prior
disposition of the assets of Buyer to meet any of its obligations hereunder or
the taking of any other action by Seller and the Group Companies and all
demands whatsoever. The guaranty set forth in this _Section 10.20(a)_ will
remain in full force and effect, and will be binding upon Buyer Guarantor,
until all of the Guaranteed Obligations have been satisfied.

 



 

(b) Buyer Guarantor hereby represents and warrants to Seller that:

 



 

(i) Buyer Guarantor is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization;

 



 

(ii) Buyer Guarantor has all requisite power and authority and has taken all
limited partnership action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform
its obligations under this Agreement;

 



 

(iii) No material notices to, filings with, or authorizations, consents or
approvals of any Governmental Entity are necessary for the execution, delivery
or performance of this Agreement. Neither the execution, delivery and
performance by Buyer Guarantor of this Agreement nor the consummation by Buyer
Guarantor of the transactions contemplated thereby will (A) conflict with or
result in any breach of any provision of Buyer Guarantors Governing
Documents, (B) result in a violation or breach of, or cause acceleration, or
constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or
give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration) under any
of the terms, conditions or provisions of any material Contract to which Buyer
Guarantor is a party, other than violations, breaches, accelerations or
defaults which would not, or would not be reasonably likely to, have a
material effect on Buyers ability to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Agreement or (C) violate any material Law or Order of
any Governmental Entity applicable to Buyer Guarantor or any of its properties
or assets;

 



      
 

 



 

(iv) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Buyer Guarantor
and is a valid and binding agreement of Buyer Guarantor, enforceable against
it in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting generally the enforcement
of creditors rights and subject to general principles of equity; and

 



 

(v) Buyer Guarantor has, and will cause Buyer to have at the Closing and all
other relevant subsequent times thereafter, sufficient funds to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and pay and perform all
obligations of Buyer hereunder, including to pay the fees and expenses of
Buyer related to the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 10.21 _Prevailing Party_. If any litigation, other court action, or
proceeding is commenced by any Party to enforce its rights under this
Agreement against any other Party, all fees, costs and expenses, including,
without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and court costs, incurred by
the prevailing Party in such litigation, action, arbitration, or proceeding
shall be reimbursed by the losing Party; provided, that if a Party to such
litigation or action prevails in part, and loses in part, the court or other
adjudicator presiding over such litigation or action shall award a
reimbursement of the fees, costs and expenses incurred by the substantially
prevailing Party.
