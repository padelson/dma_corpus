".

 



 

(b) _Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 



 

(i) Within 45 days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to the
Company the following (collectively, the " _Preliminary Adjustment Statement_
"):

 



 

(A) an unaudited combined balance sheet of the Fleet Business as of the
Closing Date (the " _Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet_ "), prepared by Buyer
in accordance with the Financial Statement Principles; and

 



 

(B) a reasonably detailed calculation by Buyer of the U.S. Net Assets and the
Canadian Net Assets, in each case as of the Closing Date, based on the
Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet (such amounts, the

 



      
 

 



 

" _Closing Adjustment Amounts_ "). The Closing Adjustment Amounts will be
prepared in conformity with the Financial Statement Principles and Exhibit B.

 



 

(ii) The Company shall have 45 days (the " _Review Period_ ") following
receipt of the Preliminary Adjustment Statement to review the Preliminary
Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of the Closing Adjustment Amounts
and to notify Buyer in writing if it disputes any of the items set forth on
the Preliminary Adjustment Statement (the " _Disagreement Notice_ "). In
connection with the Companys review of the Preliminary Adjustment Statement,
the Company and its Representatives shall have reasonable access, during
normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to all relevant work papers,
schedules, memoranda and other documents prepared by Buyer or its
Representatives in connection with its preparation of the Preliminary Closing
Balance Sheet and/or its calculation of the Closing Adjustment Amounts and to
finance personnel and accountants of Buyer and its Subsidiaries and any other
information which the Company reasonably requests, and Buyer shall, and shall
cause its Representatives to, cooperate reasonably with the Company and its
Representatives in connection therewith.

 



 

(iii) In the event that the Company shall deliver a Disagreement Notice to
Buyer, Buyer and the Company shall cooperate in good faith to resolve such
dispute as promptly as practicable and, upon such resolution, if any, any
adjustments to the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Adjustment
Amounts shall be made in writing in accordance with the agreement of Buyer and
the Company. If the Company does not deliver a Disagreement Notice to Buyer
before the expiration of the Review Period, effective as of 12:01 a.m., New
York City Time, on the day immediately following the last day of the Review
Period, the Closing Adjustment Amounts as shown in the Preliminary Adjustment
Statement shall become final, conclusive and binding on the parties hereto and
shall constitute the respective Final Adjustment Amounts for purposes of
_Section 1.4(b)(vii)_, _Section 1.4(b)(ix)_ and _Section 1.4(b)(x)_.

 



 

(iv) If Buyer and the Company are unable to resolve any such dispute within 30
days or such longer period as Buyer and the Company shall mutually agree in
writing (the " _Resolution Period_ ") after the Companys delivery of the
Disagreement Notice, such dispute shall be promptly submitted to a mutually
acceptable nationally recognized firm of independent certified public
accountants that has not provided material services to either the Company or
Buyer or their Affiliates in the preceding three years, or if no such firm is
available and willing to serve, then a mutually acceptable expert in public
accounting, in each case, upon which Buyer and the Company shall have mutually
agreed (an " _Independent Accounting Firm_ "). If the parties are unable to
agree on an Independent Accounting Firm within 15 days following the
expiration of the Resolution Period, either party may request CPR to appoint a
senior partner in a nationally recognized accounting firm to serve as the
Independent Accounting Firm.

 



 

(v) If any remaining items in dispute (" _Unresolved Items_ ") are submitted
to the Independent Accounting Firm for resolution, each of Buyer and the
Company shall submit to the Independent Accounting Firm (with a copy delivered
to the other Party on the same day), within 15 days after the date of the
engagement of the

 



      
 

 



 

Independent Accounting Firm, a memorandum (which may include supporting
exhibits) setting forth their respective positions on the Unresolved Items.
Each of Buyer and the Company may (but shall not be required to) submit to the
Independent Accounting Firm (with a copy delivered to the other Party on the
same day), within 30 days after the date of the engagement of the Independent
Accounting Firm, a memorandum responding to the initial memorandum submitted
to the Independent Accounting Firm by the other Party. Unless requested by the
Independent Accounting Firm in writing, no Party may present any additional
information or arguments to the Independent Accounting Firm, either orally or
in writing. The Independent Accounting Firm shall be given reasonable access
to all relevant records of the Fleet Business to calculate the Closing
Adjustment Amounts.

 



 

(vi) The Independent Accounting Firm shall act as an expert and not as an
arbitrator to calculate, based solely on the written submissions of Buyer, on
the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, and not by independent
investigation, the Closing Adjustment Amounts and shall be instructed that its
calculation (A) must be made in accordance with the Financial Statement
Principles, and (B) with respect to each item in dispute, must be within the
range of values established for such amount as determined by reference to the
value assigned to such amount by the Company in the Disagreement Notice and by
Buyer in the Preliminary Adjustment Statement. The Independent Accounting Firm
shall submit such calculation to the Company and Buyer as soon as practicable,
but in any event within 30 days after the Unresolved Items are submitted to
the Independent Accounting Firm. Except for any dispute to the extent relating
to any interpretation of Law or terms of this Agreement, the determination by
the Independent Accounting Firm of the Closing Adjustment Amounts, as set
forth in a written notice delivered to Buyer and the Company by the
Independent Accounting Firm in accordance with this Agreement shall be binding
and conclusive on Buyer and the Company.

 



 

(vii) The Closing Adjustment Amounts as determined after all disputes have
been resolved in accordance with this _Section 1.4_ are referred to herein
collectively as the " _Final Adjustment Amounts_ " and individually as the "
_Final U.S. Net Assets_ ", the " _Final Canadian Net Assets_ ", respectively,
and the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet, as revised reflect the Final
Adjustment Amounts, shall be referred to herein as the " _Final Closing
Balance Sheet_ ".

 



 

(viii) Buyer and the Company agree that the procedures set forth in this
_Section 1.4_ for resolving disputes with respect to the Preliminary Closing
Balance Sheet and the calculation of Closing Adjustment Amounts shall be the
sole and exclusive method for resolving any such disputes; _provided_ that
this provision shall not prohibit any Party from instituting any Action to
enforce any decision pursuant to the terms hereof by the Independent
Accounting Firm in any court of competent jurisdiction. Except for any dispute
to the extent relating to any interpretation of Law or terms of this
Agreement, the substance of the Independent Accounting Firms determination
shall not be subject to review or appeal, absent a showing of fraud. It is the
intent of the Parties to have any determination of Unresolved Items by the
Independent Accounting Firm proceed in an expeditious manner; _however_ , any
deadline or time period contained herein may be

 



      
 

 



 

extended or modified by agreement of the Parties and the Parties agree that
the failure of the Independent Accounting Firm to strictly conform to any
deadline or time period contained herein shall not be a basis for seeking to
overturn any determination rendered by the Independent Accounting Firm. Any
expenses relating to the engagement of the Independent Accounting Firm in
respect of its services pursuant to this _Section 1.4_ shall be shared
equally by Buyer and the Company.

 



 

(ix) The final U.S. purchase price (the " _Final U.S. Purchase Price_ ") shall
be equal to the sum of (A) the Initial U.S. Purchase Price and (B) an amount
equal to the Final U.S. Net Assets _minus_ the Estimated U.S. Net Assets
(which amount may be positive or negative). The amount derived by subtracting
the Initial U.S. Purchase Price from the Final U.S. Purchase Price is referred
to as the " _Final U.S. Closing Adjustment_ ".

 



 

(x) The final Canadian purchase price (the " _Final Canadian Purchase Price_
") shall be equal to the sum of (A) the Initial Canadian Purchase Price and
(B) an amount equal to the Final Canadian Net Assets _minus_ the Estimated
Canadian Net Assets (which amount may be positive or negative). The amount
derived by subtracting the Initial Canadian Purchase Price from the Final
Canadian Purchase Price is referred to as the " _Final Canadian Closing
Adjustment_ ".

 



 

(xi) Buyer (if sum of the Final U.S. Closing Adjustment and the Final Canadian
Closing Adjustment is a positive number) or the Company (if sum of the Final
U.S. Closing Adjustment and the Final Canadian Closing Adjustment is a
negative number), as the case may be, shall (or shall cause their applicable
Subsidiaries to), within five Business Days after the later of: (A) the
determination of the Final U.S. Net Assets pursuant to this _Section 1.4_;
and (B) the determination of the Final Canadian Net Assets pursuant to this
_Section 1.4_ make payment to the other (or their applicable Subsidiaries) by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or more accounts
designated by the other (or their applicable Subsidiaries) an amount equal to
the absolute value of the sum of the Final U.S. Closing Adjustment and the
Final Canadian Closing Adjustment as determined pursuant to this _Section
1.4_.

involve the Fleet Business or any of the Fleet Subsidiaries and that would not
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impede or delay the
consummation of the Transactions.

 



 

Section 4.2 _No Solicitation_.

 



 

(a) The Company agrees that it shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its
directors, officers and employees to, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its other Representatives to, immediately (i) cease all
existing discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with
respect to any Takeover Proposal, (ii) to the extent permissible and in
accordance with the applicable confidentiality agreement, request the prompt
return or destruction of all non-public information previously furnished to
any Person (other than Buyer and its Representatives) within the last twelve
months for the purpose of evaluating any Takeover Proposal or the making or
consummation thereof and (iii) prohibit any access by any Person (other than
Buyer and its Representatives) to any physical or electronic data room
relating to any Takeover Proposal or the making or consummation thereof. From
the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing Date or the date,
if any on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 6.1_, the
Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its directors,
officers and employees not to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its other Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any Takeover Proposal or the
making or consummation thereof or (ii) enter into, or otherwise participate in
any discussions (except to notify such Person of the existence of the
provisions of this _Section 4.2_) or negotiations with any Person (other than
Buyer and its Representatives) regarding, or furnish to any Person (other than
Buyer and its Representatives) any information or access in connection with,
any Takeover Proposal, (C) enter into any agreement, arrangement or
understanding (whether written or unwritten) with respect to any Takeover
Proposal or the making or consummation thereof. The Parties agree that any
breach of this _Section 4.2_ by any Affiliate or Representative acting on the
behalf of the Company shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 4.2_ by
the Company.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from: (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the
Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or
making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule
14d-9 under the Exchange Act; (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders
of the Company (x) that does not relate primarily to the Fleet Business or (y)
if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with applicable Law; (iii) informing any
Person of the existence of the provisions contained in this _Section 4.2_; or
(iv) making any "stop, look and listen" communication to the stockholders of
the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to the stockholders of the Company).

 



 

(c) As used in this Agreement, " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry,
proposal or offer from any Person (other than Buyer and its Representatives)
to purchase or otherwise acquire, in a single transaction or series of related
transactions, all or any material portion of the Fleet Business, including a
sale of the entire Company in a manner that precludes the consummation of the
Transactions, or any other transaction that would reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially impede, interfere with or delay the consummation of the
Transactions. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not be prohibited
from directly or indirectly, initiating, soliciting, negotiating, discussing,
knowingly encouraging or knowingly facilitating any proposal or offer by any
Person to purchase or otherwise acquire, in a single transaction or series of
related transactions, any portion of the Company or its business other than
the Fleet Business (including the mortgage business and any Subsidiaries of
the Company which own or operate such business) so long as such transaction or
transactions would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impede
or delay the consummation of the Transactions.

 



 

Section 4.3 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Parties
shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to: (i) cause the
Transactions to be consummated as soon as practicable; (ii) make promptly any
required submissions and filings under applicable Antitrust Laws with respect
to the Transactions; (iii) promptly furnish information required in connection
with such submissions and filings under such Antitrust Laws; (iv) keep the
other Parties reasonably informed with respect to the status of any such
submissions and filings under Antitrust Laws, including with respect to: (A)
the receipt of any non-action, action, clearance, consent, approval or waiver;
(B) the expiration of any waiting period; (C) the commencement or proposed or
threatened commencement of any Action under Antitrust Laws; and (D) the nature
and status of any objections raised or proposed or threatened to be raised
under Antitrust Laws with respect to the Transactions; and (v) obtain all
actions or non-actions, approvals, consents, waivers, registrations, permits,
authorizations and other confirmations from any Governmental Authority or
third party necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Transactions as
soon as practicable. For purposes hereof, " _Antitrust Laws_ " means the
Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act,
the Competition Act (Canada) (the " _Competition Act_ ") and all other Laws
issued by a Governmental Authority that are designed or intended to prohibit,
restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or
restraint of trade or lessening of competition through merger or acquisition.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of _Section 4.3(a)_: (i) each Party
hereto agrees to: (A) make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report
Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as soon as
practicable and in any event within 15 days after the date hereof (unless the
Parties otherwise agree to a different date); (B) supply as soon as
practicable to the appropriate Governmental Authorities any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR
Act; (C) make an appropriate filing pursuant to the Competition Act (including
a pre-merger notification filing pursuant to Part IX of the Competition Act)
with respect to the Transactions as soon as practicable and in any event
within 10 Business Days after the date hereof (unless the Parties otherwise
agree to a different date); (D) supply as promptly as practicable to the
appropriate Governmental Authorities any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the Competition Act;
(E) not extend or consent to any extension of the waiting period under any
Antitrust Laws or enter into any agreement with a Governmental Authority to
not consummate the Transactions, except with the written consent of the other
Party; and (F) use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all other actions consistent with this _Section 4.3_ necessary to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act
and the Competition Act (including any extensions thereof) as soon as
practicable; and (ii) each Party agrees to: (x) make the appropriate filings
under any other Antitrust Laws as soon as practicable and no later than what
would reasonably be expected to be required to consummate the Transactions no
later than three Business Days before the End Date; (y) supply as soon as
practical any additional information and documentary material to the
appropriate Governmental Authorities that may be requested by such
Governmental Authorities; and (z) use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all other actions consistent with this _Section 4.3_
necessary to obtain any necessary approvals, consents, waivers, permits,
authorizations or other actions or non-actions from each applicable
Governmental Authority as soon as practicable.

 



 

(c) Each of the Parties shall: (i) promptly notify the other Party of, and, if
in writing, furnish the other Party with copies of (or, in the case of oral
communications, advise the other Party of the contents of), any material
communication to such Party from a Governmental Authority and permit the other
Party to review and discuss in advance (and to consider in good faith any
comments made by the other Party in relation to) any proposed written
communication to a Governmental Authority; (ii) keep the other Party
reasonably informed of any developments, meetings or discussions with any
Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry
concerning the Transactions; and (iii) not independently participate in any
meeting or material discussions with a Governmental Authority in respect of
any filings, investigation or inquiry concerning the Transactions without
giving the other Party prior notice of such meeting or discussions and, unless
prohibited by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend or
participate. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, each of Buyer
and the Company may designate any non-public information provided to any
Governmental Authority as restricted to "Outside Antitrust Counsel" only and
any such information shall not be shared with employees, officers or directors
or their equivalents of the other Party without prior written approval of the
Party providing the non-public information.

 



 

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of _Section 4.3(a)_, Buyer agrees to
use its reasonable best efforts to take promptly any and all steps necessary
to avoid, eliminate or resolve each and every impediment and obtain all
clearances, consents, approvals and waivers

 



      
 

 



 

under Antitrust Laws that may be required by any Governmental Authority, so as
to enable the Parties to close the Transactions as soon as practicable,
including, in the event that an Action under Antitrust Laws is commenced,
threatened or is foreseeable to either Party challenging any of the
Transactions and such Action seeks, or would reasonably be expected to seek,
to prevent, materially impede or delay the consummation of the Transactions,
offering, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
orders, trust or otherwise: (i) the sale, license, holding separate or other
disposition of assets or businesses of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries and/or
of the Fleet Business; (ii) terminating, relinquishing, modifying or waiving
existing relationships, ventures, contractual rights, obligations or other
arrangements of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries and/or of the Fleet Business;
and (iii) creating any relationships, ventures, contractual rights,
obligations or other arrangements of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries and/or
of the Fleet Business (each a " _Remedial Action_ "); _provided,_ _however_ ,
that any Remedial Action that involves the participation of the Company may,
at the discretion of the Company, be conditioned upon consummation of the
Transactions; and, _provided_ , _further_ , that the initiation of a second
request under the HSR Act or any comparable request under the Competition Act
does not, in and of itself, trigger the need for Buyer to take or agree to
take any Remedial Action.

 



 

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of _Section 4.3(a)_, in the event
that any Action (other than an investigation) under Antitrust Laws is
commenced, threatened or is foreseeable challenging any of the Transactions
and such Action seeks, or would reasonably be expected to seek, to prevent or
materially impede or delay the consummation of the Transactions, Buyer shall
use reasonable best efforts to take any and all action, including a Remedial
Action, to avoid or resolve any such Action and each of the Company and Buyer
shall cooperate with each other and use its respective reasonable best efforts
to contest and resist any such Action and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order under Antitrust
Laws, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Transactions as promptly
as practicable and in any event no later than three Business Days prior to the
End Date.

 



 

(f) Buyer shall not, and shall not permit its Subsidiaries to, acquire or
agree to acquire any rights, assets, business, Person or division thereof
(through acquisition, license, joint venture, collaboration or otherwise), if
such acquisition would reasonably be expected to materially increase the risk
of not obtaining, or materially impede or delay the obtaining of, any
applicable clearance, consent, approval or waiver under Antitrust Laws with
respect to the Transactions.

 



 

(g) The Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take promptly any
and all steps necessary to obtain the Third Party Consents set forth on
_Section 4.3(g)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, so as to enable the
Parties to make and give effect to the amendments to the Financing Agreements
described in _Section 2.19(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule in
compliance with the Financing Agreements and to otherwise close the
Transactions as soon as practicable. Such reasonable best efforts of the
Company may include the payment of reasonable consideration or the grant of
reasonable concessions (it being understood that any concession that would
reasonably be expected to be adverse to Buyers operation of the Fleet
Business following the Closing will require Buyers prior written consent).
Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with the Company in connection with obtaining
the Third Party

 



      
 

 



 

Consents set forth on _Section 4.3(g)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
but such cooperation shall not require Buyer to pay any consideration or grant
any concession.

 



 

(h) Buyer agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take promptly any and
all steps necessary to obtain the Third Party Consents set forth on _Section
4.3(h)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, so as to enable the Parties to
make and give effect to the amendments to the Financing Agreements described
in _Section 2.19(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule in compliance with
the Financing Agreements and to otherwise close the Transactions as soon as
practicable. Such reasonable best efforts of Buyer may include the payment of
reasonable consideration or the grant of reasonable concessions (it being
understood that any concession that implicates the Fleet Business will only
become effective following the Closing). The Company shall reasonably
cooperate with Buyer in connection with obtaining the Third Party Consents set
forth on _Section 4.3(h)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. The Company
shall promptly reimburse Buyer for any consideration paid and pay to Buyer an
amount necessary to put Buyer in the position it would have been in if it had
not granted any concessions; _provided_ that the Company shall not have any
obligation to reimburse Buyer pursuant to this sentence for any consideration
paid or concession granted by Buyer without the prior written consent of the
Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned).

 



 

(i) In furtherance and not in limitation of _Section 4.3(g)_ and _Section
4.3(h)_, each of the Parties shall: (i) promptly notify the other Party of,
and, if in writing, furnish the other Party with copies of (or, in the case of
oral communications, advise the other Party of the contents of), any material
communication to such Party from any noteholder, counterparty, intermediary,
opining counsel or rating agency in connection with obtaining the Third Party
Consents required for the Financing Programs and permit the other Party to
review and discuss in advance (and to consider in good faith any comments made
by the other Party in relation to) any proposed written communication to any
noteholder, counterparty, intermediary, opining counsel or rating agency in
connection with obtaining the Third Party Consents required for the Financing
Programs; (ii) keep the other Party reasonably informed of any developments,
meetings or discussions with any noteholder, counterparty, intermediary,
opining counsel or rating agency in connection with the Third Party Consents
required for the Financing Programs; and (iii) not independently participate
in any meeting or material discussions with any noteholder, counterparty,
intermediary, opining counsel or rating agency in connection with the Third
Party Consents required for the Financing Programs without, to the extent
practicable, giving the other Party prior notice of such meeting or
discussions and, unless prohibited by such noteholder, counterparty,
intermediary, opining counsel or rating agency, the opportunity to attend or
participate.

 



 

Section 4.4 _Public Announcements_. The initial press releases of Buyer and
the Company with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be
reasonably agreed upon by Buyer and the Company. Following such initial press
release, Buyer and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing,
and give each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press
release or other public statements with respect to the Transactions and shall
not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to
such consultation, except as such Party may reasonably conclude may be
required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any securities exchange or securities quotation system
(and then only after as much advance notice and consultation as is

 



      
 

 



 

feasible); _provided_ , _however_ , that the restrictions set forth in this
_Section 4.4_ shall not apply to any press release or public statement (a)
made or proposed to be made by the Company in connection with a transaction
exclusively involving the Companys mortgage business or (b) in connection
with any dispute between the Parties regarding this Agreement or the
Transactions; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing shall not limit
the ability of any Party to make internal announcements to their respective
employees and other stockholders that are not inconsistent with the prior
public disclosures regarding the Transactions or to the extent permitted under
_Section 4.2(b)_.

 



 

Section 4.5 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing Date or the date on
which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, upon
reasonable prior written notice from Buyer, the Company shall afford to Buyer
and its Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to the
personnel, properties, books, Contracts and records of the Fleet Subsidiaries
and the Fleet Business, and the Company shall furnish promptly to Buyer such
information concerning the Fleet Subsidiaries and the Fleet Business as Buyer
may reasonably request (other than any publicly available document filed by
the Company pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities Laws);
_provided_ that Buyer and its Representatives shall conduct any such review or
activities in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business
or operations of the Company; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company
shall not be obligated to provide such access or information if the Company
determines, in its reasonable judgment, that doing so would violate applicable
Law, result in a material breach of any Contract in existence as of the date
hereof, jeopardize the protection of the attorney-client privilege or expose
the Company or any of its Affiliates to risk of liability for disclosure of
sensitive or personal information. Until the Closing Date, the information
provided (including without limitation pursuant to _Section 4.12_ (excluding
information provided by the Company for public disclosure by Buyer)) will be
subject to the terms of the confidentiality letter agreement, dated as of
September 23, 2013, between Buyer and the Company (as it may be amended from
time to time, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall not, and Buyer shall cause its
Representatives not to, use such information for any purpose unrelated to the
consummation of the Transactions.

 



 

(b) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that it: (i) had an opportunity to discuss
the Fleet Business with the management of the Company; (ii) has had access to
the books and records, facilities, contracts and other assets of the Fleet
Business which it and its Representatives have requested to review; (iii) has
been afforded the opportunity to ask questions of and receive answers from
officers of the Company with respect to the Fleet Business; and (iv) has
conducted its own independent investigation of the Fleet Business and the
Transactions.

 



 

Section 4.6 _Distribution_ (a) . Immediately prior to the Closing (and, for
the avoidance of doubt, after the amendments described in Section 2.19(f) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule with respect to the Canadian-based Financing
Program have become effective), the Company shall cause PHHVMS to distribute
all of the issued and outstanding Equity Interests of PHHCH to the Company
(the " _Distribution_ ").

 



       
 

 



 

Section 4.7 _Transaction Litigation_. The Company shall give Buyer the
opportunity to participate (at its own expense) in, but not control, the
defense or settlement of any securityholder litigation against the Company or
any of its directors or officers relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions. Each of Buyer and the Company shall notify the other promptly
(and in any event within 48 hours) of the commencement of any such
securityholder litigation of which it has received notice.

 



 

Section 4.8 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, or shall cause the applicable
Non-Fleet Subsidiary to, transfer the employment of any employee employed in
operations of the Fleet Business who is not already employed by a Fleet
Subsidiary to a Fleet Subsidiary.

 



 

(b) Effective as of the Closing, the Company and each Non-Fleet Subsidiary
shall assign to Buyer and its Affiliates all of their respective rights with
respect to any Active Employee that relate to restrictive covenants agreements
(including any covenants relating to non-competition, non-solicitation, no-
hire or confidentiality) and assignment of inventions and intellectual
property rights set forth on _Section 4.8(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, to the extent that such agreements may be assigned without the
consent of the applicable Fleet Employee. For purposes of this Agreement, the
term "Active Employee" shall mean each Fleet Employee who (1) is actively
employed by any Fleet Subsidiary immediately on and after the Closing or (2)
was not actively at work immediately prior to the Closing due to a leave of
absence (including due to vacation, holiday, sick leave, maternity or
paternity leave, military leave, jury duty, bereavement leave, injury, short-
term disability or long-term disability).

 



 

(c) For purposes of determining the number of vacation days to which each
Active Employee shall be entitled following the Closing, Buyer shall assume
and honor all vacation days accrued or earned but not yet taken by such Active
Employee as of the Closing Date. To the extent that an Active Employee is
entitled under applicable Law to be paid for any vacation days accrued or
earned but not yet taken by such Active Employee as of the Closing Date, Buyer
shall discharge the liability for such vacation days.

 



 

(d) For a period of 12 months following the Closing Date (such period, the "
_Continuation Period_ "), Buyer shall provide, or shall cause to be provided,
to each Active Employee (i) annual base salary and base wages and cash
incentive compensation opportunities and vacation/paid time off benefits that
are each no less favorable than those in effect as of immediately prior to the
Closing and (ii) employee benefits (other than equity and equity-based
compensation benefits and pension benefits) that are no less favorable in the
aggregate to the employee benefits provided by the Company or one of its
Affiliates to the Active Employees as of immediately prior to the Closing.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer
shall, or shall cause the Fleet Subsidiaries to, provide any Active Employee
whose employment terminates during the Continuation Period with severance
benefits (including, without limitation, notice pay, pay in lieu of notice and
termination pay) that are no less favorable than the severance benefits that
would be applicable to the Active Employee upon a similar termination
immediately prior to the Closing or, to the extent more favorable, as required
by applicable local Law.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Except as specifically provided in this _Section 4.8_ or in the
Transition Services Agreement, as of the Closing Date, (i) the Company shall
cause each Fleet Subsidiary to cease to be a participating employer in all
employee benefit plans and policies sponsored, maintained or contributed to by
the Company or any Non-Fleet Subsidiary (including the Benefit Plans), other
than any Assumed Plan (the " _Retained Plans_ "), and (ii) the Company and the
Non-Fleet Subsidiaries shall retain and be responsible for all liabilities
incurred prior to, on or after the Closing Date under the Retained Plans.

 



 

(f) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits but not for purposes of defined benefit
pension accrual) under the employee benefit plans of Buyer and its
Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Active Employee after the Closing Date
(including the Assumed Plans) (the " _New Plans_ "), each Active Employee
shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors as of the Closing Date, to the
same extent as such Active Employee was entitled, before the Closing Date, to
credit from the Company or one of its Subsidiaries for such service under any
similar Benefit Plan in which such Active Employee participated or was
eligible to participate immediately prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ that
the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result
in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) Buyer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that each Active Employee
shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any
and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is replacing
comparable coverage under an Assumed Plan in which such Active Employee
participated immediately before the Closing Date (such plans, collectively,
the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Active Employee,
Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be
waived for such Active Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the
extent such conditions were inapplicable or waived under the comparable Old
Plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such Active Employee
participated immediately prior to the Closing Date. Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by any
Active Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the
plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such Active Employees
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Active Employee and his
or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had
been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 



 

(g) The Company and the Non-Fleet Subsidiaries shall be responsible for all
claims for workers compensation benefits that are incurred on or prior to the
Closing Date by Active Employees who are primarily employed in the United
States, unless incurred under an Assumed Plan. Buyer and its Affiliates shall
be responsible for all claims for workers compensation benefits that are
incurred following the Closing Date by Active Employees primarily employed in
the United States. A claim for workers compensation benefits shall be deemed
to be incurred when the event giving rise to the claim (the " _Workers 
Compensation Event_") occurs. If the Workers Compensation Event occurs with
respect to an Active Employee primarily employed in the United States over a
period both preceding and following the Closing, the claim shall be the joint
responsibility and liability of the Company and Buyer and shall be

 



      
 

 



 

equitably apportioned between the Parties based upon the relative periods of
time that the Workers Compensation Event transpired preceding and following
the Closing.

 



 

(h) From and after the Closing, the Company and the Non-Fleet Subsidiaries
shall be solely responsible for all obligations relating to any equity or
equity-based award granted by the Company on its behalf or on the behalf of
any of its Affiliates (including with respect to the withholding, reporting
and remittance of Taxes), and neither Buyer nor any of the Fleet Subsidiaries
shall have any liability or responsibility with respect to such awards.

 



 

(i) Commencing on the date of this Agreement and continuing thereafter, the
Company shall cooperate in good faith with Buyer to effectuate the most
expeditious procedures, subject to the limitations of applicable Law, for
transferring from the Company and the Non-Fleet Subsidiaries to Buyer such
data, knowledge and information relating to Active Employees (including
certain payroll processing data and data necessary in order to effect the
crediting of employee co-payments and deductibles pursuant to New Plans) in
order to allow Buyer to comply with its obligations pursuant to this _Section
4.8_.

 



 

(j) Buyer agrees to provide any required notice under the Worker Adjustment
and Retraining Notification Act, as amended, and any similar state or foreign
statute, and to otherwise comply with any such statute with respect to any
"plant closing" or "mass layoff" (as defined in the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act), or group termination or similar event affecting
Fleet Employees (including as a result of the consummation of the
Transactions). The Company shall notify Buyer prior to Closing of any layoffs
of any Fleet Employees in the 90-day period prior to Closing. Buyer shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Affiliates with respect to any
liability under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act or
similar statute incurred by the Company or its Affiliates as a result of any
action taken by Buyer or its Affiliates with respect to Fleet Employees on or
after the Closing Date.

 



 

(k) As soon as possible, but in no event later than 90 days after the Closing
Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause a Fleet Subsidiary to, establish a defined
contribution retirement plan intended to comply with Sections 401(a) and
401(k) of the Code (the " _Buyer 401(k) Plan_"). Buyer shall cooperate with
the Company to facilitate a "direct rollover" (within the meaning of Section
401(a)(31) of the Code) as soon as practicable following the adoption of the
Buyer 401(k) Plan for each Active Employee who elects in accordance with
applicable Law to transfer his or her account balance under the PHH
Corporation Employee Savings Plan (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_") to the Buyer
401(k) Plan, and the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
facilitate the transfer of outstanding loans (and any promissory notes or
other documents evidencing such loans) with respect to such accounts. Buyer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Buyer 401(k) Plan
contains substantially similar terms in the aggregate to the Company 401(k)
Plan.

 



 

(l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this Agreement shall: (i) be treated as an amendment to
any Benefit Plan or Assumed Plan; (ii) obligate Buyer or the Fleet
Subsidiaries to (A) maintain any particular benefit plan or arrangement or (B)
retain the employment of any particular employee; or (iii) prevent Buyer or
its Affiliates (including the Fleet Subsidiaries) from amending, modifying or

 



      
 

 



 

terminating any benefit plan or arrangement. Without limiting _Section 8.7_,
this _Section 4.8_ shall be binding upon and shall inure solely to the
benefit of each of the Parties, and nothing in this _Section 4.8_, express or
implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person (including for the
avoidance of doubt any Fleet Employee (or any eligible dependent or
beneficiary thereof) any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 4.9 _No Control of Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained in this
Agreement is intended to give Buyer, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct the Companys or its Subsidiaries operations prior to the
Closing Date. Further, nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to give
Buyer or any other Person, prior to or after the Closing Date, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys or its Subsidiaries
mortgage business. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall exercise,
consistent and in compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective
operations, and shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to perform their
respective obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

Section 4.10 _Excluded Marks; Change of Name_.

 



 

(a) Buyer shall, and shall cause each Fleet Subsidiary to as soon as
practicable, but in no event later than six months following the Closing Date,
except solely to the extent otherwise set forth on _Section 4.10(b)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Transition Period_ "): (i) cease to, and
not at any time thereafter, make any use of, as a company name or Trademark
(in any form or manner), any Trademarks that include in whole or in part those
Trademarks set forth on _Section 4.10(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
(the " _Scheduled Excluded Marks_ ") and any Trademark confusingly similar to,
or likely to be confusingly similar to, or dilutive of, any of the foregoing,
in any jurisdiction in the world (and regardless of whether alone or in
combination with any other words, phrases or designs) (collectively, all such
Trademarks, including the Scheduled Excluded Marks, the " _Excluded Marks_ "),
including as part of any Internet domain name; and (ii) cease to, and not at
any time thereafter, hold itself or themselves out as having any affiliation
or association with the Company or any of its Affiliates. For the avoidance of
doubt, the foregoing is not intended to limit fair use or nominative fair use,
or use in a descriptive or informational manner, or other similar uses, in
each case, to the extent permitted under applicable Law. In furtherance
thereof, as soon as practicable but in no event later than the expiration of
the Transition Period, Buyer shall, and shall cause each Fleet Subsidiary to,
remove, strike over or otherwise obliterate all Excluded Marks from all Fleet
Assets. Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that any temporary use by Buyer
or any Fleet Subsidiary of any of the Excluded Marks as permitted in this
_Section 4.10_, during the Transition Period is limited and for purposes of
winding down its use of any Excluded Marks and shall be solely as set forth
in, and subject to the terms and conditions of, the license granted to the
Fleet Subsidiaries pursuant to _Section 4.10(b)_ during the Transition Period
and conditioned upon Buyers and each Fleet Subsidiarys compliance in all
material respects with the terms and conditions set forth in this _Section
4.10_. This _Section 4.10(a)_ shall not limit the Permitted Non-PHH Formative
Uses set forth in _Section 4.10(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. "
_Permitted Non-PHH Formative Uses_ " has the meaning set forth in _Section
4.10(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including _Section
4.10(a)_), the Company hereby grants to the Fleet Subsidiaries a limited, non-
exclusive, non-assignable, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable, fully paid-
up, royalty-free license during the Transition Period to use the Excluded
Marks used in the Fleet Business (and in the same form and manner as used in
the Fleet Business) prior to the Closing consistent with past practice solely
in the conduct of the Fleet Business in the ordinary course substantially as
conducted by the Company immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Transition
License_ "); _provided_ that all uses of the Excluded Marks licensed hereunder
shall be in the same form and manner as used in the Fleet Business consistent
with past practice prior to the Closing, and for the avoidance of doubt, the
Fleet Subsidiaries shall not make (i) any new uses of any Excluded Marks in
connection with any goods or services in the Fleet Business or (ii) any
changes to the Excluded Marks; and provided further that each Fleet Subsidiary
complies in all material respects with the quality control requirements and
guidelines in effect for the Excluded Marks as of the Closing Date and such
reasonable quality control requirements and guidelines as may be provided to
Buyer or any Fleet Subsidiary by the Company from time to time during the
Transition Period and the other terms and conditions set forth in this
_Section 4.10_. If and as may be reasonably requested by the Company, Buyer
shall provide specimens of the Fleet Subsidiaries uses of the Excluded Marks
under the Transition License in connection with the Companys exercise of its
quality control with respect to the Excluded Marks. All goodwill arising from
any Fleet Subsidiaries use of any Excluded Mark and the exercise of the
Transition License shall inure solely to the benefit of the Company. The
Transition License shall automatically and immediately terminate upon the
expiration of the Transition Period, and if Buyer or any Fleet Subsidiary (or
any of Buyers other Affiliates) breaches any of the terms or conditions set
forth in this _Section 4.10_ in any material respect, the Company shall have
the right to terminate the Transition License on 15 days prior written notice
to Buyer. Buyer shall ensure that no Fleet Subsidiary shall use any other
trademark, service mark, logo, designation, trade name, corporate name or
other Trademark in combination or in connection with any Excluded Mark during
the Transition Period.

 



 

(c) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall ensure that each Fleet
Subsidiary shall, make clear in all correspondence, communications or other
dissemination of information regarding the Fleet Business made by Buyer or any
Fleet Subsidiary that the Fleet Business and the Fleet Subsidiaries are no
longer affiliated with the Company or any of its Affiliates in a form mutually
agreed upon by Buyer and the Company (such agreement not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned). During and after the Transition Period,
Buyer shall not, and shall ensure that each Fleet Subsidiary shall not,
directly or indirectly, in any jurisdiction in the world (i) adopt, use
(except as permitted during the Transition Period hereunder), register or
apply for registration of any Excluded Mark or (ii) contest or challenge the
validity, enforceability or registrability of any Excluded Mark or the
Companys or any of its Affiliates (including any of their respective
successors or assigns) ownership or use of any Excluded Mark.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 4.10_ on or
promptly after the Closing Date (but in no event later than 10 days after the
Closing Date, provided, however, that where notice or consent is required,
Purchaser shall have 10 days from the expiration of such notice period and
receipt of such consent), Buyer shall make all filings as may be required to
change the names of the Fleet Subsidiaries to another name or names that bear
no similarity to any Excluded Mark, including, where applicable, name change
amendments

 



      
 

 



 

and appropriate name change notices for each state where the Fleet
Subsidiaries are qualified to do business and making filings with the United
States Patent and Trademark Office and such other applicable Government
Authorities to update title to reflect the name change for all applied for,
issued and/or registered Intellectual Property owned by any of the Fleet
Subsidiaries. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall be responsible for any
and all costs and expenses incurred in connection with such name change,
including in connection with any and all related filings.

 



 

(e) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Fleet
Subsidiaries to, indemnify the Seller Indemnitees against, and hold each of
them harmless, from any and all Damages incurred or suffered by any Seller
Indemnitee to the extent arising out of or relating to the exercise of the
rights and license granted under this _Section 4.10_ and/or any other use of
any Excluded Marks by Buyer or any of the Fleet Subsidiaries or any of its
other Affiliates; but excluding any claims by third parties (i) challenging
the enforceability or validity of any Excluded Mark or (ii) alleging that the
Excluded Marks infringe the Intellectual Property rights of any third party,
in each case, with respect to clauses (i) and (ii), to the extent such claims
are based on uses of the Excluded Marks that are in the same form and manner
as used in the Fleet Business consistent with past practice prior to the
Closing Date and all such uses are in accordance with the terms of the
Transition License set forth in _Section 4.10(b)._ Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein and without limiting the foregoing indemnity,
if any third party claim covered by the foregoing indemnity affects, or could
reasonably be expected to affect, or otherwise relates to any Excluded Mark
(including the ownership, validity or enforceability thereof) or any goodwill
associated therewith, then the Fleet Equity Sellers shall have the right, but
not the obligation, upon notice to Buyer, to control and assume the defense
and settlement of such claim itself (or through or with any other Seller
Indemnitee).

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything contained herein, the Parties hereby acknowledge
and agree that the Scheduled Excluded Marks owned by a Fleet Subsidiary shall
be assigned to the Company or its Affiliate prior to or promptly following the
Closing.

 



 

Section 4.11 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Liabilities for Taxes_.

 



 

(i) The Company agrees to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees against and agrees
to hold each of them harmless from any and all Damages incurred or suffered by
any Buyer Indemnitee to the extent arising out of or relating to:

 



 

(A) all Taxes (other than Transfer Taxes) imposed on the Fleet Subsidiaries or
any Fleet Equity Seller for (x) any taxable period ending on or prior to the
Closing Date (other than any Canadian taxable period beginning at or after the
Closing on the Closing Date) or (y) with respect to any taxable period
beginning on or before and ending after the Closing Date (other than any
Canadian taxable period beginning at or after the Closing on the Closing Date)
(a " _Straddle Period_ "), the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date, determined in the manner described in _Section 4.11(a)(iv)_;
and

 



      
 

 



 

(B) all Taxes (other than Transfer Taxes) of any Person for which the Fleet
Subsidiaries are (or become) liable (x) pursuant to U.S. Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1502-6 or any similar provision of Law as a result of the Fleet
Subsidiaries having been, at any time before the Closing, a member of an
affiliated, consolidated or combined group for Tax purposes or (y) as a result
of the Fleet Subsidiaries having become a transferee or successor to such
Person on or before the Closing Date, or otherwise liable for the Taxes of
such Person, which Taxes are for a taxable period (or portion thereof) ending
on or prior to the Closing Date (other than any Canadian taxable period
beginning at or after the Closing on the Closing Date), by Contract or
otherwise (other than a liability arising (i) by actions taken after the
Closing by Buyer or any of its Affiliates, (ii) under an agreement to
indemnify another Person for Taxes that is part of or associated with a Lease
Agreement or (iii) under a commercial contract the principal purpose of which
does not relate to Taxes);

 



 

(C) any breach of the Specified Tax Representation; and

 



 

(D) notwithstanding _Section 4.11(a)(ii)_, all Taxes (other than Transfer
Taxes) resulting from any breach of any covenant or agreement made or to be
performed by the Company pursuant to _Section 4.1(b)(v)_, _Section
4.11(g)(i)_, _Section 4.11(g)(ii)_ or _Section 4.11(i)_ of this Agreement.

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, any Taxes arising from a transaction, other than
any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, that is initiated by Buyer or
any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Fleet Subsidiaries)
outside the ordinary course of business on the Closing Date but after the
Closing shall be treated as arising after the Closing Date for purposes of
this _Section 4.11_.

 



 

(ii) Buyer agrees to indemnify the Seller Indemnitees against and agrees to
hold each of them harmless from any and all Damages incurred or suffered by
any Seller Indemnitee to the extent arising out of or relating to all Taxes
imposed on the Fleet Subsidiaries, the Fleet U.S. Buyer or the Fleet Canadian
Buyer for (A) any taxable period beginning after the Closing Date, (B) with
respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle Period beginning
after the Closing Date determined in the manner described in _Section
4.11(a)(iv)_ or (C) notwithstanding _Section 4.11(a)(i)_, all non-income
Taxes resulting from any breach of covenant or agreement made or to be
performed by Buyer pursuant to _Section 4.11(f)_.

 



 

(iii) Buyer and the Company will not take any action, or permit any action to
be taken, that may prevent the taxable year of any Fleet Subsidiary from
closing for U.S. federal income Tax purposes and (to the extent permitted
under applicable Law) state, local and foreign income Tax purposes on the
Closing Date. Buyer and the Company acknowledge that Canadian Transferred
Entity will make an election under subsection 256(9) of the ITA with respect
to the transfer of the Fleet Canadian Equity.

 



      
 

 



 

(iv) In the case of any Straddle Period:

 



 

(A) real, personal and intangible property Taxes (" _Property Taxes_ ")
allocated to the portion of such period ending on the Closing Date shall be
equal to the amount of such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle Period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar
days in the Straddle Period through the Closing Date and the denominator of
which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period; and

 



 

(B) Taxes (other than Property Taxes) allocated to the portion of such period
ending on the Closing Date shall be computed as if such taxable period ended
as of the close of business on the Closing Date and, in the case of any Taxes
attributable to the ownership of any equity interest in any partnership, other
"flowthrough" entity or "controlled foreign corporation" (within the meaning
of Section 957(a) of the Code or any comparable state, local or foreign Law),
as if the taxable period of such partnership, other "flowthrough" entity or
controlled foreign corporation ended as of the close of business on the
Closing Date (whether or not such Taxes arise in a Straddle Period of the
applicable owner).

 



 

(v) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer shall be
liable for, pay (or cause to be paid) and indemnify and hold harmless the
Seller Indemnitees from and against any Transfer Taxes. Buyer shall prepare
and timely file (or cause to be prepared and timely filed) when due all Tax
Returns required to be filed in respect of Transfer Taxes and shall remit (or
cause to be remitted) to the applicable Governmental Authorities the Transfer
Taxes shown to be due in respect of such Tax Returns, and shall provide the
Company with proof of such payment. The Company shall (and shall cause the
Fleet Equity Sellers to) reasonably cooperate with Buyer in the preparation
and filing of any such Tax Returns.

 



 

(vi) The obligations of the Company to indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer
Indemnitees, on the one hand, and the obligations of Buyer to indemnify and
hold harmless the Seller Indemnitees, on the other hand, pursuant to this
_Section 4.11_ shall terminate on the date that is 30 days after the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if, with respect to any non-United States tax, there is no applicable
statute of limitations, such obligations shall terminate on the seventh
anniversary of the Closing Date.

 



 

(vii) Whenever the Company shall be required to pay any Buyer Indemnitees or
Buyer shall be required to pay to any Seller Indemnitees an amount pursuant to
this _Section 4.11_, such payments shall be made within the later of 10 days
after such payments are requested or two days before the requesting party is
required to pay the related Tax liability.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) _Tax Returns_.

 



 

(i) The Company shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) and cause to be timely
filed when due (taking into account all extensions properly obtained) all Tax
Returns of or that include the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company other
than a Fleet Subsidiary (the " _PHH Group Tax Returns_ ") and shall remit or
cause to be remitted to the relevant Governmental Authorities any Taxes due in
respect of such Tax Returns.

 



 

(ii) Without prejudice to the rights of any Buyer Indemnitee under this
_Section 4.11_, (A) Buyer shall prepare and timely file (or cause to be
prepared and timely filed) when due (taking into account all extensions
properly obtained) all Tax Returns that are not PHH Group Tax Returns and that
are required to be filed after the Closing by or with respect to the Fleet
Subsidiaries or the Fleet Business (the " _Buyer Tax Returns_ "), and (B)
Buyer shall remit or cause to be remitted to the applicable Governmental
Authorities any Taxes shown to be due in respect of such Tax Returns.

 



 

(iii) With respect to any Buyer Tax Returns for a taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date, (x) such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with positions taken, elections made or methods used in prior
periods in filing such Tax Returns (except where otherwise required by Law)
and (y) Buyer shall provide the Company with a copy in draft form of each such
Tax Return at least 45 days prior to the date on which such Tax Return is due
(taking into account all extensions properly obtained) (or if such Tax Return
is due within 45 days after the Closing Date, then as soon as reasonably
practicable). The Company shall have the right within 15 days of the date of
receipt of such Tax Return, to review, comment on and make changes to each
such Tax Return in good faith. Buyer shall consider the Companys changes in
good faith and shall be obligated to reflect each of the positions or comments
requested by the Company unless Buyer has received (and shared with the
Company) a written opinion from nationally recognized tax counsel to the
effect that there is no reasonable basis for such position requested by the
Company. The Company shall pay Buyer no later than five days prior to the date
for filing such Tax Return (taking into account all extensions properly
obtained) an amount equal to any Taxes that are shown as due thereon. Buyer
shall thereafter execute and timely file, or cause to be executed and timely
filed, each such Tax Return and timely remit, or cause to be timely remitted,
such Taxes. Any reasonable third-party costs and expenses incurred in
preparing any such Tax Return by Buyer shall be reimbursed by the Company.

 



 

(iv) With respect to any Buyer Tax Returns for a Straddle Period, (x) such Tax
Returns shall be filed in a manner consistent with positions taken, elections
made or methods used in prior periods in filing such Tax Returns (except where
otherwise required by Law) and (y) such Tax Returns shall be submitted to the
Company in draft form not later than 45 days prior to the due date for filing
such Tax Returns (taking into account all extensions properly obtained) (or,
if such due date is within 45 days following the Closing Date, as promptly as
practicable following the Closing Date) for review and approval by the
Company. If the Company objects to any item(s) contained in any such draft Tax
Return presented by Buyer, then the Company shall notify Buyer of such
disputed item(s) and the basis for its objection within 15 days of the

 



      
 

 



 

day of receipt of such Tax Return, and Buyer and the Company shall act in good
faith to resolve any such dispute for the 10 day period thereafter. If within
10 days of the Companys delivery of a notice of objection, the parties have
not reached an agreement regarding such Tax Return, then the dispute shall be
presented to the Independent Accounting Firm, whose determination (except to
the extent relating to any interpretation of Law or terms of this Agreement)
shall be final and binding on both parties and may be entered and enforced in
any court having jurisdiction. The Company shall pay Buyer no later than five
days prior to the date for filing such Tax Return (taking into account all
extensions properly obtained) an amount equal to that portion of the Taxes
shown as due thereon and described in _Section 4.11(a)(i)(A)(y)_. Any
reasonable third-party costs and expenses incurred in preparing such Tax
Return shall be borne by the Company and Buyer in the same proportions as any
Taxes shown as due thereon are allocated to the Company and Buyer pursuant to
_Section 4.11(a)(i)(A)(y)_.

 



 

(v) Other than as required by applicable Law or as required by _Section
4.11(c)(iii)_, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall amend, refile or
otherwise modify (or grant an extension of any statute of limitations with
respect to) any Tax Return relating (x) in whole or in part to the Fleet
Subsidiaries or the Fleet Business with respect to any taxable period ending
on or before the Closing Date without the prior written consent of the
Company, which consent may be withheld in the Companys sole discretion, or
(y) to the Fleet Subsidiaries or the Fleet Business with respect to any
Straddle Period without the prior consent of the Company, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. For the avoidance of
doubt, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall take any action with
respect to any PHH Group Tax Return. Other than as required by applicable Law,
neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates shall amend, refile or otherwise
modify (or grant an extension of any statute of limitations with respect to)
any Tax Return relating in whole or in part to the Fleet Subsidiaries or the
Fleet Business (other than a PHH Group Tax Return of the Company) if such
amendment, refiling or modification reasonably could be expected to be adverse
to Buyer, except with the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 



 

(vi) Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Section 4.11(b)_, the
Company, in its sole discretion, may cause any Fleet Subsidiary to elect to
claim (or not claim) "bonus depreciation" under Section 168(k) of the Code for
any item of property for which such an election is available on any Buyer Tax
Return for, or that includes any portion of, the taxable year ended December
31, 2013.

 



 

(c) _Refunds and Credits_.

 



 

(i) Any Tax refund, credit or similar benefit (including interest received
thereon) received by or credited to Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including,
from and after the Closing Date, any Fleet Subsidiary) that relates to any
Taxes paid on or prior to the Closing Date or to any taxable period ending on
or before the Closing Date, and with respect to any Straddle Period, the
portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, shall be paid by
Buyer to the Company (net of Taxes resulting from such receipt or crediting)
within 30 days after the receipt of such Tax refund or the

 



      
 

 



 

claiming of such credit or similar benefit. If any portion of any Tax refund,
credit or similar benefit is subsequently disallowed, then amounts previously
paid by Buyer hereunder in respect thereof shall be promptly reimbursed to
Buyer.

 



 

(ii) For purposes of this _Section 4.11_, where it is necessary to apportion
a refund, credit or similar benefit between the Company and Buyer for a
Straddle Period, such refund, credit or similar benefit shall be apportioned
between the Company and Buyer as provided in _Section 4.11(a)(iv)_.

 



 

(iii) Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, cooperate in obtaining
as soon as permitted by applicable Law any refund, credit or similar benefit
that relates to any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date, and
with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date, that the Company reasonably believes should be
available, including through filing amended Tax Returns with the applicable
Governmental Authorities. The Company agrees to reimburse Buyer for any
reasonable third-party costs and expenses incurred by it in providing such
cooperation.

 



 

(iv) None of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Fleet Subsidiaries) shall, and Buyer shall cause its Affiliates not to, elect
to carry back or over any net operating loss or other Tax item to any PHH
Group Tax Return for any taxable period.

 



 

(d) _Contests_.

 



 

(i) Each of Buyer and the Company shall promptly notify the other in writing
upon receipt of written notice of any pending or threatened audit, notice of
deficiency, examination, assessment or any other administrative or judicial
proceeding (" _Audit_ ") which may affect any Tax liability for which the
other may be liable pursuant to this _Section 4.11_.

 



 

(ii) The Company shall have the sole and absolute right to (i) conduct any
Audit that relates to (A) any PHH Group Tax Return or (B) any Buyer Tax Return
for a complete taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date, (ii)
employ counsel of its choice in connection therewith and (iii) settle any such
Audit on such terms as it may determine; _provided_ that the Company shall not
settle any such Audit without the prior written consent of Buyer, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, if such
settlement would reasonably be expected to adversely affect Buyer. If the
Company elects not to conduct any such Audit, then (i) Buyer (A) shall
diligently prosecute such Audit in good faith, (B) shall, upon reasonable
request, keep the Company reasonably informed of the status of developments
with respect to such Audit and (C) shall not settle or concede any such Audit
without the prior written consent of the Company (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) and (ii) any reasonable third-
party costs and expenses incurred by Buyer shall be reimbursed by the Company.
For the avoidance of doubt, reasonable third-party costs and expenses shall
include the fees of outside counsel and/or accountants engaged by Buyer in
connection with an Audit described under this

 



      
 

 



 

Section 4.11(d)(ii). The Company and Buyer shall jointly control any Audit in
respect of the Fleet Subsidiaries or the Fleet Business (other than a PHH
Group Tax Return) with respect to a Straddle Period.

 



 

(iii) In the case of an Audit of an Indemnified Party concerning an amount of
potential Taxes which would be subject to indemnification under this _Section
4.11_, where, notwithstanding that the Audit has not yet been resolved, (A)
such Taxes are required to be paid by an Indemnified Party under applicable
Law, or (B) in respect of such Taxes any Governmental Authority garnishes any
amount or initiates a collection or enforcement action under applicable Law
(each such amount, determined without reduction on account of any Tax Refund
that is not required to be paid to the Company pursuant to _Section
4.11(c)(i),_ a " _Preliminary Compulsory Payment Amount_ "), the Indemnifying
Party shall, within 10 days of receipt of written notice of such requirement
to pay, garnishment or potential for collection or enforcement, pay the
Indemnified Party an amount equal to the Preliminary Compulsory Payment
Amount.

 



 

(iv) Where clause (iii) has applied in respect of an Audit, upon the
occurrence of a final determination in respect of the Audit made by a
Governmental Authority (including pursuant to a settlement) (a " _Final
Determination_ "), (A) if the aggregate amount of all Preliminary Compulsory
Payment Amounts in respect of particular indemnified Taxes is less than the
amount so determined under the Final Determination to be the amount of the
indemnified Taxes (the " _Final Compulsory Payment Amount_ "), the
Indemnifying Party shall, within 10 days of the Final Determination, pay to
the Indemnified Party an amount equal to the difference between the aggregate
amount for all such Preliminary Compulsory Payment Amount and the Final
Compulsory Payment Amount, and (B) if the aggregate amount of all such
Preliminary Compulsory Payment Amounts exceeds the Final Compulsory Payment
Amount, the Indemnified Party shall within 10 days of the receipt of the
related refund or credit, pay to the Indemnifying Party an amount equal to the
difference between the aggregate amount of all such Preliminary Compulsory
Payment Amount and the Final Compulsory Payment Amounts.

 



 

(e) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax sharing agreements or similar agreements
with respect to or involving any Fleet Subsidiary, on the one hand, and the
Company or any Non-Fleet Subsidiary, on the other hand, shall be terminated as
of the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, none of the Fleet
Subsidiaries shall be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

 



 

(f) _Tax Matters Cooperation_. Each of Buyer and the Company shall (and shall
cause its respective Affiliates to) cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns of the Fleet Subsidiaries or with respect to the Fleet Business and
any Audit. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other
partys request) the provision (with the right to make copies) of records and
information reasonably relevant to any such Audit and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that
neither Buyer nor the Company shall be required to grant access to its
corporate offices. The Company and Buyer shall (and shall cause each of their

 



      
 

 



 

respective Affiliates to) (i) retain all books and records with respect to Tax
matters pertinent to each of the Fleet Subsidiaries relating to any taxable
period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer or the
Company, any extensions thereof) and abide by all record retention agreements
entered into with any Governmental Authority and (ii) give the other party
reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any
such books and records and, if the other party so requests, shall allow the
requesting party, at its sole expense, to take possession of such books and
records.

 



 

(g) _Section 338 Elections_.

 



 

(i) Buyer and the Company shall jointly make an election under Section
338(h)(10) of the Code (and any comparable election under state or local tax
Law) with respect to each Fleet Subsidiary that is classified as a domestic
corporation for United States federal income Tax purposes (the " _Section
338(h)(10) Elections_").

 



 

(ii) A copy of the executed IRS Form 8023 indicating the consent of Buyer and
the Company to each Section 338(h)(10) Election is attached hereto as Exhibit
E. The Company authorizes Buyer to, and promptly after the Closing Date Buyer
shall, (1) complete such IRS Form 8023 by entering relevant information
regarding the Fleet U.S. Buyer in Section A-1 of such form and entering the
Closing Date on line 5a of such form and adjacent to the signature of the
authorized person for the Company and (2) file such form with the IRS on
behalf of Buyer and the Company. Following such completion and filing, Buyer
shall provide the Company with a copy of such completed IRS Form 8023. Buyer
and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
cooperate in good faith in the preparation, execution and timely filing of IRS
Form 8883 and all other Section 338 Forms, including by providing Buyer with
such information as Buyer reasonably requests in order to prepare such Section
338 Forms.

 



 

(iii) As used in this Agreement, "Section 338 Forms" means all tax returns
that are required to be submitted to any Federal, state, county or other local
Governmental Authority in connection with the Section 338(h)(10) Elections.
Section 338 Forms include any "statement of section 338 election" and IRS Form
8023 (together with any schedules or attachments thereto) that are required
under U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.338-1 or U.S. Treasury Regulation
Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 or any successor provisions.

 



 

(iv) Buyer and its Affiliates shall be entitled to make an election under
Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to any Canadian Fleet Subsidiary
acquired pursuant to this Agreement that is treated as a corporation for
United States federal income Tax purposes.

 



 

(h) _Purchase Price Allocation_.

 



 

(i) Buyer and the Company shall allocate the Final U.S. Purchase Price (and
other amounts properly included in the purchase price for United States
federal income Tax purposes) among the assets of the Fleet Subsidiaries for
all tax purposes

 



      
 

 



 

(including for purposes of the Section 338(h)(10) Elections). No later than 30
days after the Final U.S. Purchase Price has been determined pursuant to
_Section 1.4(b)_, Buyer shall provide to the Company a statement setting
forth such allocation (the " _Tax Allocation Statement_ ") and shall deliver a
copy of the Tax Allocation Statement to the Company. The Tax Allocation
Statement shall be reasonable and shall be prepared in good faith in
accordance with the Code, applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations and any
corresponding state, local or foreign Tax Law or Tax regulations.

 



 

(ii) Within 30 days following the receipt of the Tax Allocation Statement, the
Company shall have the right to object to such statement by written notice to
Buyer. If the Company does not so object within such time period, such
statement shall be deemed to have been accepted and agreed upon, and final and
conclusive, for all purposes of this Agreement. If the Company objects to any
item(s) set forth on the Tax Allocation Statement, the Company shall notify
Buyer in writing of such disputed item(s) and the basis for its objection, and
Buyer and the Company shall act in good faith to resolve any such dispute
within the 30 day period thereafter. If, within 30 days of the Companys
delivery of a notice of objection to the Tax Allocation Statement, the parties
have not reached an agreement regarding such allocations, the dispute shall be
presented to the Independent Accounting Firm, whose determination shall be
final and binding on both parties and may be entered and enforced in any court
having jurisdiction. The parties shall endeavor to cause the Independent
Accounting Firm to make a determination within 30 days but in no event later
than five days prior to the date any Tax Return for which such allocation
would be relevant is required to be filed under applicable Law. The fees and
expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be paid 50% by the Company
and 50% by Buyer.

 



 

(iii) None of Buyer or any of its Affiliates or the Company or any of its
Affiliates shall take, or permit any Affiliate to take, any position for any
Tax purpose (whether in connection with Audits, Tax Returns or otherwise) that
is inconsistent with the final Tax Allocation Statement, except as required
pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the
Code (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Tax law).

 



 

(iv) In the event of any adjustments to the Final U.S. Purchase Price (made
pursuant to _Section 7.7_ or otherwise), Buyer and the Company shall act in
good faith to make appropriate adjustments to the final Tax Allocation
Statement.

 



 

(i) _Treatment for United States Income Tax Purposes_. Each of Buyer and the
Company shall treat (A) the purchase and sale of each Fleet Subsidiary that is
treated as a corporation for United States federal income Tax purposes (other
than the Canadian Fleet Subsidiaries) as a purchase and sale for which an
election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code has been made and (B) the
purchase and sale of PHHVMS (and each of its Subsidiaries that is treated as
an entity disregarded as separate from the owner of PHHVMS for United States
federal income Tax purposes) as a purchase and sale of its assets, in each
case for United States federal income Tax purposes and, to the greatest extent
permitted by Law, for state and local income Tax purposes, and shall take no
position inconsistent with such treatment on any Tax Return or in any
proceeding before the Internal Revenue Service or any state and local

 



      
 

 



 

Governmental Authority, except as required pursuant to a "determination"
within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any similar provision of
state, local or foreign Tax law). For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
_Section 4.11(i)_ shall limit the rights of Buyer and its Affiliates under
_Section 4.11(g)(iv)_.

 



 

(j) _Tax Package_. To the extent not previously provided, Buyer shall prepare
and provide or cause to be prepared and provided to the Company a Tax Package
relating to each PHH Group Tax Return that is unfiled as of the Closing Date
and that includes any Fleet Subsidiary or the Fleet Business. The Tax Package
shall be provided to the Company as promptly as practicable but in no event
later than 120 days after the Closing Date. The Company shall reimburse Buyer
for any reasonable third-party costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this _Section 4.11(j)_.

 



 

(k) _Section 754 Elections_. With respect to any Fleet Subsidiary that is
classified as a partnership for United States federal income Tax purposes, to
the extent an election under Section 754 of the Code is not in effect on the
Closing Date, Buyer shall be entitled to cause such an election to be made on
the Tax Return of such partnership for the taxable period which includes the
Closing Date.

 



 

(l) _Exclusivity_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, except as
otherwise provided in this _Section 4.11_, all issues relating to Tax matters
shall be governed solely by the provisions of this _Section 4.11_, except
that the provisions of _Section 7.1_ (solely as to the survival of the
representations and warranties in _Section 2.9_), _Section 7.4(d)_, _Section
7.4(e)_, _Section 7.4(f)_, _Section 7.4(g)_, _Section 7.4(h)_, _Section
7.4(i)_, _Section 7.6_ and _Section 7.7_ shall apply as if such sections
were set forth in this _Section 4.11_.

 



 

Section 4.12 _Financing; Cooperation_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to
arrange and consummate the Financing as soon as practicable subject to the
terms and conditions described this Agreement and in the Debt Financing
Agreements, including, unless otherwise agreed by the Company, using
reasonable best efforts to: (i) maintain in full force and effect the
Financing and the Debt Financing Agreements for the commitment period set
forth therein; (ii) negotiate and enter on a reasonably timely basis into
definitive financing agreements with respect to the debt financing as
contemplated by the Debt Financing Agreements (as such terms may be modified
in accordance with _Section 4.12(c)_ (the " _Financing Documents_ ") so that
the Financing will be able to be consummated on the Closing Date; (iii) comply
with its obligations under the applicable Debt Financing Agreements and
Financing Documents, and satisfy on a reasonably timely basis the conditions
applicable to Buyer contained in the applicable Debt Financing Agreements and
Financing Documents so that the Financing will be able to be consummated on
the Closing Date; and (iv) cause the lenders to fund the Financing pursuant to
the terms of the Debt Financing Agreements on the Closing Date. Buyer shall
not (A) terminate any Debt Financing Agreement or (B) reduce the aggregate
amount of the Financing available under the Debt Financing, except, in the
case of each of clauses (A) and (B), (1) as expressly set forth herein or
therein or (2) with the prior written consent of the Company (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld,

 



      
 

 



 

delayed or conditioned). Buyer will furnish true, correct and complete copies
of all such material definitive agreements relating the Financing to the
Company promptly upon their execution if prior to the Closing Date (subject,
in the case of commercially sensitive information, to redactions).

 



 

(b) Buyer shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a reasonably current
basis with respect to all material activity concerning the status of the
Financing and its other financing activities and shall give the Company prompt
notice of any material adverse change with respect to such Financing. Without
limiting the foregoing, Buyer agrees to notify the Company promptly, and in
any event within two Business Days, if at any time: (i) any of the Debt
Financing Agreements shall be terminated for any reason (other than as a
result of the termination of this Agreement); (ii) any financing source that
is a party to any Debt Financing Agreement provides written notice to Buyer
that such source no longer intends to provide financing to Buyer; (iii) Buyer
has Knowledge of any actual or threatened (in writing) breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to the Debt Financing Agreements or
Financing Documents or any material dispute or disagreement between or among
the parties to Debt Financing Agreements or Financing Documents with respect
to the obligation to fund the Financing or the amount of the Financing to be
funded at Closing; or (iv) Buyer no longer believes in good faith that it will
be able to obtain funds sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement on the terms or within the timing described in the Debt
Financing Agreements. Buyer shall not amend, supplement, waive or otherwise
modify or replace, or agree to amend, supplement, waive or otherwise modify or
replace, the Debt Financing Agreements, other than as permitted pursuant to
_Section 4.12(c)_ with respect to the Debt Financing Agreements. Upon any
amendment, supplement, waiver or modification or replacement of the Debt
Financing Agreements in accordance with _Section 4.12(c)_ and this _Section
4.12(b)_, the term "Debt Financing Agreements" shall mean the applicable
documents and commitments as so amended, supplemented or modified or replaced.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, after the date
of this Agreement but prior to the Closing, any Debt Financing Agreement may
be amended, supplemented, modified, replaced or any provision thereof waived
or superseded by written amendments or agreements (x) (A) to add lenders,
agents, lead arrangers, purchasers or any similar entities who have not
executed the Debt Financing Agreements as of the date hereof or (B) in any
other manner as does not and would not reasonably be expected to materially
impede the ability of Buyer or its Affiliates to timely consummate the
Transactions in accordance with the terms hereof, taking into account the
expected timing of the Closing or (y) replacing the existing Debt Financing
Agreements (in each case, whether by amendment, supplement, modification or
superseding agreement, the " _Alternative Debt Financing Commitment_ "), if
and only if any such amendment, supplement, modification, waiver or
replacement described in clause (x) or (y) above: (i) does not reduce the
aggregate amount of the financing to an amount that would cause Buyer not to
have sufficient funds to pay the Initial U.S. Purchase Price and the Initial
Canadian Purchase Price in accordance with the terms hereof and to pay all
fees and expenses relating to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby on the Closing Date (and Buyer shall provide commitments
to the Company and any financing source that is party to a Debt Financing
Agreement that it intends to use the Alternative Debt Financing Commitment or
other funds available to Buyer for such purpose); (ii) does not and would not
reasonably be expected to impose any new or additional conditions or otherwise
expand, amend,

 



      
 

 



 

or modify any of the conditions to the Financing or any provisions in the Debt
Financing Agreements or Financing Documents in a manner that (1) are
materially more onerous, taken as a whole, than those conditions and terms
contained in the Debt Financing Agreements as of the date hereof, (2) would
reasonably be expected to materially impact the ability of Buyer to enforce
its rights against the other parties to the Debt Financing Agreements or
Financing Documents, or (3) would reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially impede or delay the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of
the conditions to the Financing) on the Closing Date. In such event, (x) the
term "Debt Financing Agreement" as used herein shall be deemed to include any
Alternative Debt Financing Commitment entered into in accordance with this
_Section 4.12(c)_ to the extent then in effect, and (y) the term "Financing"
as used herein shall mean the debt financing contemplated by the Debt
Financing Agreements as amended, modified or superseded in accordance with
this _Section 4.12(c)_. Buyer shall promptly deliver to the Company a true,
correct and complete copy of any such executed amendment, supplement,
modification, waiver or replacement (subject, in the case of any commercially
sensitive information, to redactions).

 



 

(d) If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions or within the timing contemplated in the Debt Financing Agreements
or the Debt Financing Agreements shall be terminated or modified for any
reason not in accordance with this Agreement (but without waiving any
responsibility or liability for breach by Buyer of its obligations under this
Agreement), then Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to
obtain Alternative Debt Financing Commitments such that Buyer can fulfill its
obligations hereunder. The obligations under _Sections 4.12(a)_ and _(b)_
shall apply equally to any such Alternative Debt Financing Commitments
(including any new financing commitment). Buyer shall keep the Company
reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the
status of its efforts to arrange such Alternate Debt Financing Commitments and
shall, upon request, provide true and complete copies of all documents related
to the Alternate Debt Financing Commitments to the Company (subject, in the
case of any commercially sensitive information, to redactions).

 



 

(e) The Company shall provide reasonable cooperation to Buyer in connection
with the preparation and filing of a business acquisition report (" _BAR_ ")
required to be filed by Buyer or one of its Affiliates pursuant to Part 8 (the
" _BAR Requirements_ ") of Canadian National Instrument 51-102 Continuous
Disclosure Obligations (" _NI 51-102"_ ) in connection with the purchase of
the Fleet Equity, and in connection with the preparation and filing by Buyer
or one of its Affiliates of a short-form prospectus or prospectus supplement
(the " _Prospectus_ ") with respect to one or more financing transactions
(each, a " _Financing Transaction_ ") undertaken by Buyer pursuant to, and
required to comply with, applicable Canadian securities Laws (the "
_Prospectus Requirements_ "), including using commercially reasonable efforts
to:

 



 

(i) provide Buyer with financial statements for the Fleet Business necessary
to satisfy the BAR Requirements or the Prospectus Requirements, as applicable,
other than the pro forma financial statements prescribed by Section 8.4(5) of
NI 51-102, including reconciliation of financial information in such financial
statements from GAAP to IFRS, to the extent required, (A) in the case of the
BAR Requirements, no

 



      
 

 



 

later than 15 days after the Closing Date, and (B) in the case of the
Prospectus Requirements, no later than three days after delivery of a written
request by Buyer;

 



 

(ii) make available to Buyer, on reasonable notice, the material financial
books and records related to the Fleet Business;

 



 

(iii) cause the Companys auditor to provide to Buyer an unqualified audit
opinion with respect to the financial statements referred to in _Section
4.12(e)(i)_ and customary comfort letters to the underwriters with respect to
financial information relating to the Fleet Business included in the
Prospectus under the applicable Prospectus Requirements; and

 



 

(iv) provide the Companys auditor with customary and required management
representation letters and other customary information and documents as may be
reasonably requested by such auditor in order to provide a customary auditors
report and customary comfort letters to the underwriters;

 



 

in each case, to the extent necessary in order to allow Buyer to comply with
the BAR Requirements or the Prospectus Requirements; provided that the
Companys obligations under this Section 4.12 shall (A) only apply with
respect to the Financing Transactions related to the Transactions, including
any refinancing of such financing, and (B) terminate on December 31, 2014.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company or its personnel shall not be
required to (i) sign any comfort letter or other consent letter relating to
the financial or other information included or incorporated by reference in
the BAR or the Prospectus, (ii) participate in any underwriter due diligence
session, and (iii) participate in the drafting of the Prospectus and related
working sessions of the working group formed by Buyer in connection with the
Financing Transaction.

 



 

(g) Buyer hereby agrees and acknowledges that the provision by the Company to
Buyer of financial statements and other information pursuant to this _Section
4.12_ is made for the sole purpose of allowing Buyer to comply with the BAR
Requirements or the Prospectus Requirements, and the provision of such
financial or other information shall not be deemed to result in any
representation or warranty from Company to Buyer unless specifically set out
in this Agreement.

 



 

(h) Buyer shall reimburse the Company for all third party expenses incurred by
the Company in connection with the compliance by the Company with its
obligations under this _Section 4.12_.

 



 

(i) Buyer shall indemnify the Seller Indemnitees against, and agree to hold
each of them harmless from any and all Damages incurred or suffered by any
Seller Indemnitee to the extent arising out of or relating to the Companys
and the Seller Indemnitees compliance with the terms of this _Section 4.12_,
including (i) the compliance of Buyer with the BAR Requirements or the
Prospectus Requirements, (ii) any claim or Action by or on behalf of
shareholders or other securityholders of Buyer with respect to the financial
or other information

 



      
 

 



 

included, or omitted to be included, in the BAR or the Prospectus, including
financial or other information relating to the Fleet Business, and (iii) the
Financing Transaction.

 



 

(j) Nothing in this _Section 4.12_ shall require such cooperation to the
extent it would (i) cause any condition to Closing set forth in _Article V_
to fail to be satisfied or otherwise cause any breach of this Agreement
(unless waived by Buyer) or otherwise materially impair or delay the parties
obligations under this Agreement, including the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to take any action that will conflict with or violate the
Companys or any of its Subsidiaries organizational documents or any
applicable Laws or result in the contravention of, or that would reasonably be
expected to result in a violation or breach of, or default under, any material
Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party (in each
case prior to the Closing) or (iii) result in any equity holder, officer or
director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries incurring any personal
liability with respect to any matters relating to or arising out of the
Financing Transaction.

 



 

(k) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
agrees on behalf of itself and its members, Representatives and Affiliates
(collectively, the " _Seller Related Parties_ "), that the Seller Related
Parties shall not assert (or support the assertion of) any claims, actions or
proceedings against the lenders to any Debt Financing Agreement or Financing,
whether at law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
arising out of or in any way relating to this Agreement, any Debt Financing
Agreement or Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and
that the lenders shall have no liability to the Seller Related Parties in
connection herewith or therewith.

 



 

Section 4.13 _Agreement Not to Compete, Solicit or Hire_.

 



 

(a) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and expiring on the date
that is two years after the Closing Date (the " _Restricted Period_ "), the
Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, directly or
indirectly, compete with or engage in the Fleet Business, as currently
conducted, within or for the market of North America (the " _Restricted
Business_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that for the avoidance of doubt, the
foregoing shall not restrict the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from in
any way conducting any business or operation of any such Person other than the
Fleet Business as of the date hereof, including the Companys mortgage
business; and _provided further_ that, for such purposes, (x) no owner of less
than 15% of the outstanding equity or voting interests of any Person and (y)
no director (or other equivalent position on an equivalent governing body) of
any Person, and (z) without limiting clause (x) hereof, no pension plan,
savings plan or other similar employee benefit plan owning any equity or other
interests in a Person for passive investment purposes only, in any such case
shall be deemed to be engaged in the Restricted Business solely as a result of
ownership of such equity or voting interests or such directorship. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 4.13_ shall (x) restrict the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries from taking any action required to be taken
by it pursuant to either of the Transition Services Agreements or (y) limit
any Person who purchases or otherwise acquires, in a single transaction or
series of related transactions, any portion of the Company or its business
other than the Fleet Business (including the mortgage business and any
Subsidiaries of the Company which own or operate such

 



       
 

 



 

business) from engaging in the Restricted Business as long as such Person was
engaged in the Restricted Business at the time of such purchase or
acquisition.

 



 

(b) During the Restricted Period, the Company shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, solicit, influence, entice or
encourage any person who at such time is a director, officer, employee or
service provider of any Fleet Subsidiary or Buyer or Buyers Affiliates to
cease or curtail his or her relationship therewith; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the restrictions of this _Section 4.13(b)_ shall not apply to (x) the
placement of general advertisements (including without limitation in
periodicals, such as newspapers and trade publications) or the use of general
search firm services that are not targeted toward directors, officers or
employees of any Fleet Subsidiary or Buyer or Buyers Affiliates or (y)
directors, officers or employees of any Fleet Subsidiary or Buyer or Buyers
Affiliates whose relationship had been terminated (other than in circumstances
involving a breach of this _Section 4.13(b)_) for at least three months prior
to such solicitation.

 



 

(c) During the Restricted Period, the Company shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, hire or attempt to hire, whether
as a director, officer, employee, service provider or otherwise, any person
who at such time is (or within the three-month period immediately preceding
such time was) a director, officer, employee or service provider of any Fleet
Subsidiary or Buyer or Buyers Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
placement of general advertisements (including without limitation in
periodicals, such as newspapers and trade publications) or the use of general
search firm services that are not targeted toward directors, officers or
employees of any Fleet Subsidiary or Buyer or Buyers Affiliates will not
constitute an attempt to hire for the purposes of this _Section 4.13(c)_, and
hiring any employees (but not directors and officers) who respond to any such
activity will not be prohibited by this _Section 4.13(c)_. For Canadian
federal income tax purposes, the parties confirm that no portion of the Final
Purchase Price is received by the Fleet Equity Sellers for a "restrictive
covenant", as that term is defined for the purposes of Section 56.4 of the
ITA, granted by them. The Parties agree that any "restrictive covenant"
granted hereunder is to maintain or preserve the fair market value of the
Fleet Equity.

 



 

(d) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and expiring on the date
that is one year after the Closing Date, Buyer shall not directly or
indirectly, solicit, influence, entice or encourage any person who at such
time is a director, officer, employee or service provider of the Company or
the Non-Fleet Subsidiaries to cease or curtail his or her relationship
therewith; _provided_ , _however_ , that the restrictions of this _Section
4.13(d)_ shall not apply to (x) the placement of general advertisements
(including without limitation in periodicals, such as newspapers and trade
publications) or the use of general search firm services that are not targeted
toward directors, officers or employees of the Company or any Non-Fleet
Subsidiary or (y) directors, officers or employees of the Company or any Non-
Fleet Subsidiary whose relationship had been terminated (other than in
circumstances involving a breach of this _Section 4.13(d)_) for at least
three months prior to such solicitation.

 



 

(e) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and expiring on the date
that is one year after the Closing Date, Buyer shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, hire or attempt to hire, whether
as a director, officer, employee, service provider or otherwise, any person
who at such time is (or within the three-month period

 



      
 

 



 

immediately preceding such time was) a director, officer, employee or service
provider of the Company or any Non-Fleet Subsidiary; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the placement of general advertisements (including without limitation in
periodicals, such as newspapers and trade publications) or the use of general
search firm services that are not targeted towards directors, officers or
employees of the Company or any Non-Fleet Subsidiary will not constitute an
attempt to hire for the purposes of this _Section 4.13(e)_, and hiring any
employees (but not directors and officers) who respond to any such activity
will not be prohibited by this _Section 4.13(e)_.

 



 

Section 4.14 _Further Assurances_. After the Closing, if the Parties determine
that any Fleet Asset is held by the Company or a Non-Fleet Subsidiary, such
Fleet Asset shall be transferred to a Fleet Subsidiary designated by Buyer
without the payment of any additional consideration. After the Closing, if the
Parties determine that any Excluded Asset (including any Excluded Mark) is
held by a Fleet Subsidiary, such asset shall be transferred to the Company or
a Non-Fleet Subsidiary designated by the Company without the payment of any
additional consideration. Notwithstanding the two immediately preceding
sentences, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Fleet Subsidiaries) shall be obligated under this _Section 4.14_
to pay any consideration or grant any concession. All costs and expenses
arising out of compliance with this _Section 4.14_ shall be borne by the
Company.

 



 

Section 4.15 _Cooperation; Intercompany Accounts_.

 



 

(a) Prior to Closing, the Company shall cause (i) any Fleet Asset held by the
Company or a Non-Fleet Subsidiary to be transferred to a Fleet Subsidiary and
(ii) any Excluded Asset held by a Fleet Subsidiary to be transferred to the
Company or a Non-Fleet Subsidiary.

 



 

(b) Prior to Closing, except in the case of the Contracts set forth on
_Section 4.15(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company shall cause
(i) any Contract between the Company or any Non-Fleet Subsidiary, on the one
hand, and any Fleet Subsidiary or the Fleet Business, on the other hand, to be
terminated and (ii) any amounts owed to or by the Company or any Non-Fleet
Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any Fleet Subsidiary or the Fleet Business,
on the other hand, to be settled or otherwise extinguished. Amounts owed
solely between Fleet Subsidiaries shall not be affected by this provision.

 



 

Section 4.16 _Confidentiality_. Except as required by applicable Law or as
may be reasonably necessary in connection with the prosecution or defense of
any Action, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its
Representatives to, keep confidential all information relating to the Fleet
Business, the Fleet Assets or the Fleet Subsidiaries, other than information
that is generally available to the public as of the date of this Agreement or
thereafter becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of
a breach of this _Section 4.16_. The covenant set forth in this _Section
4.16_ shall terminate on the date that is 18 months after the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 4.17 _Undertaking Regarding New Chesapeake Transactions_. Buyer shall
ensure that (a) the supplemental indenture to the Chesapeake Indenture under
which each new series of investor notes will be issued by Chesapeake Funding
LLC will include a provision to the effect that Buyer has assumed all of the
Companys obligations under the related Financing Program and therefore the
Company will have no obligations in respect of such investor notes

 



      
 

 



 

under such Financing Program; and (b) the terms and conditions of such a new
series of investor notes will not be dependent on the performance by the
Company of obligations entered into under the Financing Program prior to the
Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not prevent
Chesapeake Funding LLC from (i) providing for terms and conditions of a new
series of notes and the making of related disclosures, in each case that are
consistent with the rights, remedies and obligations arising under any then
outstanding series of investor notes, but only for so long as such existing
series remains outstanding, and (ii) complying with the requirements of any
rating agency or other third party participant whose consent or approval is a
condition to such issuance and sale under the Financing Program.

30, 2014 (the " _End Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 6.1(b)(i)_ shall not be
available to a Party if the failure of the Transactions to have been
consummated on or before the End Date was primarily due to the failure of such

respect to the Company, those covenants set forth in _Section 4.12_
(Financing Cooperation));

 



 

(ii) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in _Section 5.1(b)_ shall

_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section

have failed to comply with its obligations under _Section 4.3_; or

 



 

(c) by Buyer, if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements (other than those
covenants and agreements set forth in _Section 4.12_ (Financing Cooperation))
set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give
rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 5.2(a)_ or _Section
5.2(b)_, respectively, and (B) cannot be cured by the Company by the End Date

 



      
 

 



 

or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within 30 calendar

material breach of any representation, warranties, covenants or other
agreements hereunder; or

 



 

(d) by the Company, if Buyer shall have breached or failed to perform any of
their representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in _Section 5.3(a)_ or _Section 5.3(b)_,
respectively, and (B) cannot be cured by Buyer by the End Date or, if capable
of being cured, shall not have been cured within 30 calendar days following

Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section 6.2_ shall not release
any Party from any liability for any willful and material breach by such Party

ARTICLE VII

 



 

 _INDEMNIFICATION_

 



 

Section 7.1 _Survival_. The representations and warranties of the Parties
contained in this Agreement and all covenants and agreements of the Parties
that are to be performed prior to the Closing shall survive the Closing until
March 31, 2016; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) the Fundamental
Representations shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statute
of limitations, (b) the Specified Tax Representation shall survive Closing
until 30 days following the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations, and (c) the representations and warranties made by the Company in
_Section 2.9_ (other than the Specified Tax Representation) shall not survive

that by their nature are required to be performed after the Closing shall
survive the Closing until fully performed or fulfilled, unless and only to the
extent that non-compliance with such covenants or agreements is waived in
writing by the Party entitled to such performance. Notwithstanding the
preceding two sentences, any breach of any covenant, agreement, representation
or warranty in respect of which indemnification may be sought under this
Agreement shall survive the time at

 



      
 

 



 

which it would otherwise terminate pursuant to the preceding two sentences, if
notice of such breach giving rise to such right of indemnification shall have
been given to the Party against whom such indemnification may be sought prior
to such time. The Parties acknowledge and agree that with respect to any claim
that any Party may have against any other Party that is permitted pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement, the survival periods set forth and agreed to in
this _Section 7.1_ shall govern when any such claim may be brought and shall
replace and supersede any statute of limitations that may otherwise be
applicable.

 



 

Section 7.2 _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 4.11_ relating to Taxes and the provisions of this
_Article VII_, including the limitations set forth in _Section 7.4_,
effective at and after the Closing, the Company agrees to indemnify Buyer and
its Affiliates (including the Fleet Subsidiaries), directors, officers,
employees, successors, permitted assigns, agents and representatives
(collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnitees_ ") against and agrees to hold each of
them harmless from any and all Damages incurred or suffered by any Buyer
Indemnitee to the extent arising out of or relating to:

 



 

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty of the Company in _Article
II_ of this Agreement (other than the Fundamental Representations and the
representations and warranties in _Section 2.9_);

 



 

(ii) any breach of any Fundamental Representation;

 



 

(iii) any breach of any covenant or agreement made or to be performed by the
Company pursuant to this Agreement; or

 



 

(iv) any Excluded Liability.

 



 

(b) Subject to _Section 4.11_ relating to Taxes and the provisions of this
_Article VII_, including the limitations set forth in _Section 7.4_,
effective at and after the Closing, Buyer agrees to indemnify the Fleet Equity
Sellers and their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees,
successors, permitted assigns, agents and representatives (collectively, the "
_Seller Indemnitees_ ") against and agrees to hold each of them harmless from
any and all Damages incurred or suffered by any Seller Indemnitee to the
extent arising out of or relating to:

 



 

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer in _Article III_ of
this Agreement;

 



 

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement; or

 



 

(iii) any Assumed Liability.

 



 

(c) For purposes of _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ and _Section 7.2(a)(ii)_, each of
(i) the determination of whether any breach of any representation or warranty
(other than the representations and warranties in _Section 2.5(b)_ and
_Section 2.6(b)_) has occurred and (ii) the determination of the amount of
Damages arising out of or relating to any breach of any

 



      
 

 



 

representation of warranty (other than the representations and warranties in
_Section 2.5(b)_ and _Section 2.6(b)_) shall be made without regard to any
qualification or exception contained in such representation or warranty
relating to materiality or Fleet Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 7.3 _Procedures_. Except with respect to Tax claims, which are solely
addressed in _Section 4.11_, claims for indemnification under this Agreement
shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

 



 

(a) Any Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee seeking indemnification under
this Agreement (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") with respect to any claim asserted
against the Indemnified Party by a third party (" _Third Party Claim_ ") in
respect of any matter that is subject to indemnification under _Section 7.2_
shall (i) promptly notify the other Party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of
the Third Party Claim (and in any event within 60 Business Days of the date on
which the Indemnified Party knows or reasonably should have known of the Third
Party Claim unless the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such delay), and
(ii) as promptly as practicable transmit to the Indemnifying Party a written
notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") describing in reasonable detail the nature of
the Third Party Claim, a copy of all papers served with respect to such claim
(if any), the basis of the Indemnified Partys request for indemnification
under this Agreement and a reasonable estimate of any Damages suffered with
respect thereto.

 



 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend the Indemnified
Party against such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party will promptly
notify the Indemnified Party (and in any event within 60 Business Days after
having received any Claim Notice) with respect to whether or not it is
exercising its right to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party
Claim. If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party that the
Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim (such
election to be without prejudice to the right of the Indemnifying Party to
dispute whether such claim is an indemnifiable Damage under this _Article
VII_), then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend such Third
Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party, in all
appropriate proceedings, to a final conclusion or settlement at the discretion
of the Indemnifying Party in accordance with this _Section 7.3(b)_. The
Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such defense and proceedings,
including any compromise or settlement thereof; _provided_ _,_ _however_ _,_
that the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any settlement agreement
without the written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, such consent shall not be required if (A) the settlement agreement
contains a complete and unconditional general release by the third party
asserting the Third Party Claim to all Indemnified Parties affected by the
Third Party Claim, (B) the settlement agreement does not contain any sanction
or restriction upon the conduct or operation of any business conducted by the
Indemnified Party or its Affiliates or other equitable relief or relief for
other than money damages against the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates, and
(C) the settlement agreement obligates the Indemnifying Party to pay the full
amount of Damages incurred thereunder. The Indemnified Party may participate
in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim
controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section 7.3(b)_, and
the Indemnified Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to
such participation.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party that the
Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section
7.3(b)_ within 20 Business Days after receipt of any Claim Notice, then the
Indemnified Party shall defend itself against the applicable Third Party
Claim, and be reimbursed for its reasonable cost and expense (but only if the
Indemnified Party is actually entitled to indemnification hereunder) in regard
to the Third Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnified Party, in
all appropriate proceedings and in good faith, which proceedings shall be
prosecuted diligently by the Indemnified Party. In such circumstances, the
Indemnified Party shall defend any such Third Party Claim in good faith and
have full control of such defense and proceedings; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Indemnified Party may not enter into any compromise or settlement of
such Third Party Claim if indemnification is to be sought hereunder, without
the Indemnifying Partys consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Indemnifying Party may participate in,
but not control, any defense or settlement controlled by the Indemnified Party
pursuant to this _Section 7.3(c)_, and the Indemnifying Party shall bear its
own costs and expenses with respect to such participation; _provided_ ,
_however_ , if at any time the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing that
such Third Party Claim is an indemnifiable Damage under this _Article VII_,
the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume the defense of such Third
Party Claim in accordance with _Section 7.3(b)_.

 



 

(d) If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees, at
the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party (but only if the
Indemnified Party is actually entitled to indemnification hereunder), to
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting any Third
Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party elects to contest, including providing
reasonable access to documents, records and information. In addition, the
Indemnified Party will make its personnel reasonably available at no cost to
the Indemnifying Party for conferences, discovery, proceedings, hearings,
trials or appeals as may be reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party.
The Indemnified Party also agrees to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and
its counsel in the making of any related counterclaim against the Person
asserting the Third Party Claim or any cross complaint against any Person and
executing powers of attorney to the extent necessary.

 



 

(e) A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a Third Party
Claim shall be asserted by notice to the Party from whom indemnification is
sought as promptly as practicable (the failure to give prompt notice shall
not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification
obligations if such notice is provided within 20 Business Days of the date on
which the Indemnified Party knows or reasonably should have known of the claim
for indemnification, unless and to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
prejudiced by such delay), which notice shall describe in reasonable detail
the nature of the claim and the basis of the Indemnified Partys request for
indemnification under this Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.4 _Limitations on Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Article VII_:

 



 

(a) the Company shall not be liable under _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ for any breach
of any representation or warranty of the Company attributable to a single
course of conduct or related set of facts, events or circumstances unless the
amount of Damages incurred or suffered by the Buyer Indemnitees for such
breach exceeds $100,000 (" _De Minimis Amount_ ");

 



       
 

 



 

(b) the Company shall not be liable under _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ for any breach
of any representation or warranty of the Company, unless the aggregate amount
of Damages incurred or suffered by the Buyer Indemnitees for such breach and
all other such breaches subject to indemnification under _Section 7.2(a)(i)_
exceeds $14,025,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), and then only to the extent such
aggregate Damages exceed such amount; _provided_ , _however_ , that, for the
avoidance of doubt, Damages attributable to a single course of conduct or
related set of facts, events or circumstances that do not exceed the De
Minimis Amount pursuant to _Section 7.4(a)_ shall not be counted towards the
calculation of the Deductible;

 



 

(c) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
shall the Companys aggregate liability arising out of or relating to (i)
_Section 7.2(a)(i)_ exceed $140,250,000 (the " _Cap_ ") or (ii) _Section
7.2(a)(i)_ and _Section 7.2(a)(ii)_ exceed the Final Purchase Price;

 



 

(d) In no event shall the Company be liable under _Section 7.2(a)_ or
_Section 4.11_ for any Damages arising from an action taken or not taken by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at Buyers express written request;

 



 

(e) no Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification under _Section
4.11_ or this _Article VII_ against any Damages arising out of relating to
any liability to the extent that such liability (or reserve therefor) has been
included in the calculation of the Final U.S. Net Assets or the Final Canadian
Net Assets;

 



 

(f) each Indemnified Party shall have a duty to use commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate any Damages for which such Indemnified Party claims
indemnification under this Agreement, including, with respect to the Financing
Programs and Financing Agreements, pursuing such amendments, consent
solicitations or asset repurchases as may be necessary or reasonably
appropriate to mitigate Damages ( _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt,
the costs of such amendments, consent solicitations or repurchases shall be
Damages);

 



 

(g) the amount of any Damages for which an Indemnified Party claims
indemnification under this Agreement shall be (x) reduced by the amount of (i)
any insurance proceeds actually received from third party insurers with
respect to such Damages; (ii) any Tax benefit Actually Realized with respect
to the Canadian Fleet Subsidiaries, which Tax benefit is attributable to such
Damages or to the facts giving rise to such Damages (after deducting from such
proceeds the amount of the expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in
procuring such recovery); and (iii) any indemnification, contribution, offset
or reimbursement payments actually received from third parties with respect to
such Damages (after deducting from such payments the amount of the expenses
incurred by such Indemnified Party in procuring such recovery) and (y)
increased by any Tax detriment Actually Realized by the Indemnified Party with
respect to the Canadian Fleet Subsidiaries that is attributable to the receipt
of indemnification payments under this Agreement in respect of such Damages;
_provided_ that such Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain recoveries from insurers, including title insurers, and
other third parties in respect of this _Section 7.4(g)_; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that an Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause any Tax benefit to be Actually Realized with respect to such
Damages. If an Indemnified Party (A) actually receives insurance proceeds from
third party insurers with respect to such Damages, (B) has a Tax benefit
Actually Realized

 



      
 

 



 

or (C) actually receives indemnification, contribution, offset or
reimbursement payments from third parties with respect to such Damages, in
each case, at any time subsequent to any indemnification payment pursuant to
this Agreement with respect to such Damages, then such Indemnified Party shall
promptly reimburse the applicable Indemnifying Party for such indemnification
payment up to such amount actually received by such Indemnified Party (after
deducting from such proceeds the amount of the expenses incurred by such
Indemnified Party in procuring such recovery);

 



 

(h) in the event an Indemnified Party shall recover Damages in respect of a
claim of indemnification under this _Article VII_ or _Section 4.11_, no
other Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover the same Damages in
respect of a claim for indemnification;

 



 

(i) no Party shall have any liability under _Article VII_ for, and Damages
shall not include, any punitive, incidental, consequential, special or
indirect Damages (including lost profits, loss in value or any damages that
are based on a multiple of earnings), in each case, except to the extent any
such Damages are paid or payable (and subsequently paid) with respect to a
Third Party Claim as to which a Party is entitled to indemnification under
this Agreement;

 



 

(j) THE RIGHTS OF INDEMNIFICATION SET FORTH IN THIS _ARTICLE VII_ SHALL BE
ENFORCEABLE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY PERSON (INCLUDING ANY INDEMNIFYING
PARTY) ALLEGES OR PROVES THE SOLE, CONCURRENT, CONTRIBUTORY OR COMPARATIVE
NEGLIGENCE OF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY OR THE SOLE OR CONCURRENT STRICT LIABILITY
IMPOSED ON THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY; and

 



 

(k) no Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification under this
Article VII against any Damage arising out of or relating to (i) a failure by
any Customer or other third party obligor under or in respect of a Lease
Agreement, or any third party obligor under or in respect of any other
Financing Agreement, in each case, to perform, after the Closing, its
obligations (including any payment obligation or any obligation to provide
credit support) under or in respect of such Contract or (ii) any direct or
indirect costs incurred by a Buyer Indemnitee to purchase any Fleet Asset or
to make a payment in respect of any Fleet Asset, in each case as a result of
such Fleet Asset becoming ineligible under a Financing Program after the
Closing.

 



 

Section 7.5 _Assignment of Claims_ (a) . If the Indemnified Party receives any
payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Damages pursuant to
_Section 7.2_ or _Section 4.11_ and the Indemnified Party could have
recovered all or a part of such Damages from a third party (a " _Potential
Contributor_ ") based on the underlying claim asserted against the
Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall, to the extent permitted by
Law and any pertinent Contract, assign such of its rights to proceed against
the Potential Contributor as are necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to
recover from the Potential Contributor the amount of such payment.

 



 

Section 7.6 _Exclusivity_.

 



 

(a) After the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy for any and all claims,
Damages or other matters arising under, out of or related to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, other than in the case of fraud, shall
be the rights of indemnification set

 



      
 

 



 

forth in _Section 4.11_ and this _Article VII_ only, and no Person will have
any other entitlement, remedy or recourse, whether in contract, tort, strict
liability, equitable remedy or otherwise, it being agreed that all of such
other remedies, entitlements and recourse are expressly waived and released by
the Parties to the fullest extent permitted by Law. Notwithstanding the
immediately preceding sentence, this _Section 7.6(a)_ will not operate to
interfere with or impede the operation of the covenants contained in this
Agreement that by their nature are required to be performed after the Closing,
with respect to a Partys right to seek equitable remedies (including specific
performance or injunctive relief). The provisions of this _Section 7.6(a)_,
together with the covenants contained in this Agreement that by their nature
are required to be performed after the Closing, were specifically bargained-
for between the Company, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, and
were taken into account by the Parties in arriving at the Initial U.S.
Purchase Price and the Initial Canadian Purchase Price. Each Party,
respectively, specifically relied upon the provisions of this _Section
7.6(a)_ in agreeing to the Initial U.S. Purchase Price and the Initial
Canadian Purchase Price (determined in accordance with _Section 1.4(a)_) and
in agreeing to provide the specific representations and warranties set forth
in _Article II_ (in the case of the Company) and _Article III_ (in the case
of Buyer).

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if there is fraud, then
the survival periods set forth in _Section 7.1_ shall not apply with respect
to any remedy sought as a result of such fraud.

 



 

Section 7.7 _Characterization of Indemnity Payments_. The Parties agree that
any indemnification payments made pursuant to _Section 4.11_ or this _Article
VII_ shall be treated for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Final
Purchase Price unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

 



 

Section 7.8 _Application to Taxes_. Except as provided in _Section 4.11(l)_
and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Parties agree that
this _Article VII_ shall not apply to _Section 4.11_.

 



 

ARTICLE VIII

 



 

 _MISCELLANEOUS_

 



 

Section 8.1 _Survival of Confidentiality Agreement_. The Confidentiality
Agreement shall (a) survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms and (b) terminate as of the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 8.2 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as provided in _Section 4.11_,
_Section 4.12_, _Section 6.2_ and _Article VII_, whether or not the
Transactions are consummated, all fees and expenses incurred in connection
with the Transactions and this Agreement shall be paid by the Party incurring
or required to incur such fees or expenses.

 



 

Section 8.3 _Amendment or Supplement_. This Agreement may be amended or
supplemented in any and all respects by written agreement of the Parties.

 



 

Section 8.4 _Waiver_. Any Party may, subject to applicable Law, (a) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other Party, (b)
extend the time for the

 



      
 

 



 

performance of any of the obligations or acts of the other Party or (c) waive
compliance by the other Party with any of the covenants or agreements
contained herein or, except as otherwise provided herein, waive any of such
Partys conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by a
Party in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor
shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further
