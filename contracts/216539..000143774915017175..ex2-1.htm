Date (the " _Marigold Designees_ "). In addition, at least one (1) Marigold

the avoidance of doubt, Montage and New Holdco and their respective Boards of

delivered in exchange therefor; and

 



 

(c) each share of Common Stock, no par value per share, of Merger Sub 2

Section 2.3 Montage Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards.

 



 

(a) Prior to the First Merger Effective Time, the Holdco Board, Montage

shall take all actions necessary so that, as of the First Merger Effective

(i) each Montage Stock Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the
First Merger Effective Time shall be assumed by New Holdco and become an
option (a " _Montage Exchange Option_ ") to purchase, on the same terms and
conditions (including applicable vesting requirements) as applied to each such
Montage Stock Option immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time, the
number of shares of New Holdco Voting Common Stock that is equal to the number
of shares of Montage Voting Common Stock subject to such Montage Stock Option
immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time, at an exercise price per
share of New Holdco Voting Common Stock equal to the exercise price for each
such share of Montage Voting Common Stock subject to such Montage Stock Option
immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time (including applicable
vesting, exercise and expiration provisions); and

 



 

 



   



 

(ii) each share of Montage Restricted Stock and each right of any kind,
contingent or accrued, to receive shares of Montage Voting Common Stock or
benefits measured in whole or in part by the value of a number of shares of
Montage Voting Common Stock granted by Montage outstanding immediately prior
to the First Merger Effective Time (including Montage DSUs, restricted stock
units, phantom units, deferred stock units, stock equivalents and dividend
equivalents), other than Montage Stock Options (each, other than Montage Stock
Options, a " _Montage Stock-Based Award_ "), shall be assumed by New Holdco
and become an award, on the same terms and conditions (including applicable
vesting requirements and deferral provisions) as applied to each such Montage
Stock-Based Award immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time, with
respect to the number of shares of New Holdco Voting Common Stock that is
equal to the number of shares of Montage Voting Common Stock subject to the
Montage Stock-Based Award immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time
(a " _Montage Exchange Stock-Based Award_ "). For the avoidance of doubt,
shares of Montage Voting Common Stock issued in connection with the settlement

Effective Time (including vested Montage Restricted Stock) shall be treated in
the manner set forth in Section 2.1(a).

 



 

(b) New Holdco shall file, no later than fifteen (15) days after the First
Merger Effective Time, an effective registration statement on Form S-8 (or any
successor or other appropriate form) under the Securities Act to register

Exchange Stock-Based Awards and Marigold Rollover Share-Based Awards.

 



 

Section 2.4 Marigold Share Options and Other Share-Based Awards. Prior to
the Second Merger Effective Time, the Holdco Board, Marigold and the Marigold
Board and the Compensation Committee of the Marigold Board shall take all
actions necessary so that:

 



 

(a) each Marigold Share Option that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Second Merger Effective Time shall, as of the Second
Merger Effective Time, be assumed by New Holdco and become, as of the Second
Merger Effective Time, an option (a " _Marigold Exchange Option_ ") to
purchase, on the same terms and conditions (including applicable exercise and
expiration provisions but taking into account any acceleration of vesting as
of the Second Merger Effective Time provided for under the terms of the
Marigold Incentive Plans and award agreements thereunder applicable to such
Marigold Share Option) as applied to each such Marigold Share Option
immediately prior to the Second Merger Effective Time, shares of New Holdco
Voting Common Stock, except that (i) the number of shares of New Holdco Voting
Common Stock subject to the Marigold Exchange Option shall equal the product
of the number of shares of Marigold Common Stock that were subject to such
Marigold Share Option immediately prior to the Second Merger Effective Time
multiplied by the Marigold Equity Award Exchange Ratio, with the result
rounded down to the nearest whole number and (ii) the per share exercise price
of each such Marigold Exchange Option will be equal to the quotient determined
by dividing the exercise price per share at which such Marigold Share Option
was exercisable immediately prior to the Second Merger Effective Time by the
Marigold Equity Award Exchange Ratio, with the result rounded up to the
nearest whole cent; and

 



 

 



   



 

(b) each share of Marigold Restricted Shares and each right of any kind,
contingent or accrued, to receive shares of Marigold Common Stock or benefits
measured in whole or in part by the value of a number of shares of Marigold
Common Stock granted by Marigold outstanding immediately prior to the Second
Merger Effective Time (including restricted stock units, stock equivalent
units, phantom units, deferred stock units, stock equivalents and dividend
equivalents), other than Marigold Share Options (each, other than Marigold
Share Options, a " _Marigold Share-Based Award_ "), shall, as of the Second
Merger Effective Time, to the extent such Marigold Share-Based Award vests and
its vesting restrictions lapse as of the Second Merger Effective Time in
accordance with its terms, vest and all time vesting restrictions shall lapse,
and, in exchange for the cancellation of such Marigold Share-Based Award,
entitle the holder to the Marigold Merger Consideration, plus any accrued, but
unpaid dividends and dividend equivalents with respect to each share of
Marigold Common Stock subject to the Marigold Share-Based Award (the "
_Marigold Share-Based Award Payment_ "). Any Marigold Share-Based Award that
does not, by its terms, vest and have all time-vesting restriction lapse as of
the Second Merger Effective Time shall be referred to as the " _Marigold
Rollover Share-Based Awards_ _"_. The portion of any Marigold Share-Based
Award Payment consisting of Cash Consideration and unpaid dividends and
dividend equivalents shall be made by the Marigold Surviving Corporation, net
of any applicable withholding Taxes with respect to the full amount of the
Marigold Share-Based Award Payment (including both the amount of any Cash
Consideration and the value of any Stock Consideration), through, to the
extent applicable, the Marigold Surviving Corporation's payroll on the next
administratively practicable regular payroll date (and in any event within 20
Business Days) following the Second Merger Effective Time. Shares of New
Holdco Voting Common Stock representing the portion of the Marigold Share-
Based Award Payment consisting of Stock Consideration shall be issued and
distributed by New Holdco to the former holders of Marigold Share-Based Awards
promptly following the Second Merger Effective Time (and in any event within
20 Business Days). For the avoidance of doubt, shares of Marigold Common Stock
issued in connection with the settlement of Marigold Share-Based Awards which
vest on or prior to the Second Merger Effective Time (including vested
Marigold Restricted Shares) shall be treated in the manner set forth in
Section 2.2(a). Each Marigold Rollover Share-Based Award shall be assumed by
New Holdco and shall be subject to the same terms and conditions, including
applicable vesting conditions, as applied to each Marigold Rollover Share-
Based Award immediately prior to the Second Merger Effective Time, except that
the number of shares of New Holdco Voting Common Stock relating to each
Marigold Rollover Share-Based Award shall be equal to the product of the
number of shares of Marigold Common Stock that were subject to such Marigold
Rollover Share-Based Award immediately prior to the Second Merger Effective
Time multiplied by the Marigold Equity Award Exchange Ratio, with the result
rounded down to the nearest whole number.

 



 

(c) The Marigold Board or the Compensation Committee of the Marigold Board
(or another committee duly authorized by the Marigold Board for such purpose),
as applicable, shall take all actions necessary or required under the Marigold
Employee Stock Purchase Plan of 2002 (the " _Marigold ESPP_ ") and subject to
applicable Law to (i) cause the Marigold ESPP not to commence an offering
period to purchase Marigold Common Stock that would otherwise begin on or
after the date of this Agreement or to accept payroll deductions with respect
to any such offering period that would otherwise begin on or after the date of
this Agreement to be used to purchase Marigold Common Stock under the Marigold
ESPP, (ii) if the Second Merger Effective Time shall occur prior to the end of
the offering period in existence under the Marigold ESPP on the date of this
Agreement, cause the rights of participants in the Marigold ESPP with respect
to any such offering period then underway under the Marigold ESPP to be
determined by treating the last Business Day prior to the Second Merger
Effective Time as the last day of such offering period and by making such
other pro-rata adjustments as may be necessary to reflect the shortened
offering period but otherwise treating such shortened offering period as a
fully effective and completed offering period for all purposes of the Marigold
ESPP, and (ii) cause the Marigold ESPP to terminate immediately prior to and
effective as of the Second Merger Effective Time. All amounts withheld by
Marigold on behalf of the participants in the Marigold ESPP that have not been

Effective Time will be returned to the participants without interest pursuant
to the terms of the Marigold ESPP.

 



 

 



   



 

(d) Promptly following the Second Merger Effective Time, New Holdco shall
pay or shall cause the Marigold Surviving Corporation to pay the aggregate
cash portion of the Marigold Share-Based Award Payments as set forth in
Section 2.4(b).

 



 

(e) " _Marigold Equity Award Exchange Ratio_ " means (i) the Marigold

daily volume weighted average price of a share of Montage Voting Common Stock
on the NYSE over the twenty (20) consecutive trading days immediately prior to
the date that is three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 2.5 Exchange of Montage Shares. Pursuant to Section 13.1-719.1 of
the VSCA, each certificate that, immediately prior to the First Merger
Effective Time, represented shares of Montage Voting Common Stock or shares of
Montage Non-Voting Common Stock, and all shares of Montage Voting Common Stock
and Montage Non-Voting Common Stock held in book-entry form immediately prior
to the First Merger Effective Time, shall, from and after the First Merger
Effective Time, represent an equal number of shares of New Holdco Voting
Common Stock and New Holdco Non-Voting Common Stock, respectively.

 



 

Section 2.6 Exchange of Marigold Common Shares.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Montage shall appoint an agent reasonably
acceptable to Marigold (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") to act as paying and
exchange agent, including for purposes of exchanging certificates representing
Marigold Common Shares (the " _Marigold Certificates_ ") (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) or Marigold Common Shares held in book-entry form (the "
_Marigold Book-Entry Securities_ ") for the Marigold Merger Consideration.
Prior to the Second Merger Effective Time, Montage or New Holdco shall deposit
or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the
holders of Marigold Certificates and Marigold Book-Entry Securities, (i)
shares of New Holdco Voting Common Stock sufficient in order for the Exchange
Agent to distribute the Stock Consideration, and (ii) an amount of cash
sufficient in order for the Exchange Agent to distribute the aggregate Cash
Consideration. In addition, New Holdco shall deposit with the Exchange Agent,
as necessary from time to time after the Second Merger Effective Time, any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.6(g) and cash
in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.6(e). The
shares of New Holdco Voting Common Stock and cash deposited with the Exchange
Agent for the benefit of the holders of Marigold Common Shares are
collectively referred to herein as the " _Marigold Exchange Fund_ ". In
connection with the foregoing, Montage and New Holdco shall enter into an
Exchange Agent Agreement with the Exchange Agent, in a form reasonably
acceptable to Marigold, setting forth the procedures to be used in
accomplishing the deliveries and other actions contemplated by this Section
2.6.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) Promptly after the Closing Date, New Holdco shall cause the Exchange
Agent to mail to each holder of record of Marigold Common Shares, to the
extent the holder thereof has not submitted Marigold Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Marigold Book-Entry Securities prior to
the Closing Date, a letter of transmittal in a form prepared by Montage and
reasonably acceptable to Marigold (a " _Marigold Letter of Transmittal_ ")
(which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Marigold Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or transfer of the Marigold Book-Entry
Securities to the Exchange Agent and which shall otherwise be in customary
form and shall include customary provisions with respect to delivery of an
"agent's message" regarding the book-entry transfer of Marigold Book-Entry
Securities) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Marigold
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Marigold Book-Entry
Securities in exchange for the Marigold Merger Consideration.

 



 

(c) Each holder of Marigold Common Shares that have been converted into
the right to receive the Marigold Merger Consideration shall be entitled to
receive, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Marigold Certificate
(or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof), together with a properly completed
Marigold Letter of Transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agent's message" by the
Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange
Agent may reasonably request) in the case of book-entry transfer of Marigold
Book-Entry Securities, the Marigold Merger Consideration in respect of the
Marigold Common Shares represented by a Marigold Certificate (or affidavit of
loss in lieu thereof) or Marigold Book-Entry Security. The shares of New
Holdco Voting Common Stock constituting part of the Marigold Merger
Consideration shall be in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical
certificate is requested by a holder of Marigold Common Shares or is otherwise
required under applicable Law. The Exchange Agent shall accept such Marigold
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Marigold Book-Entry
Securities upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the
Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance
with normal exchange practices. If any Marigold Merger Consideration is to be
paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the applicable Marigold
Common Shares surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a
condition to such exchange that (i) either such Marigold Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or such Marigold Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) shall otherwise be in proper form for the transfer or such Marigold
Book-Entry Security shall be properly transferred, and (ii) the Person
requesting such exchange shall pay to New Holdco any transfer Taxes or other
Taxes required by reason of the payment of such consideration to a Person
other than that of the registered holder of the Marigold Certificate (or
Marigold Common Shares specified in an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof)
and/or Marigold Book-Entry Security so surrendered, or such Person shall
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax
has been paid or is not applicable.

 



 

 



   



 

(d) From and after the Second Merger Effective Time, until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.6, each Marigold Certificate and/or Marigold
Book-Entry Security shall be deemed to represent only the right to receive
upon such surrender, in each case together with a duly executed and properly
completed Marigold Letter of Transmittal, cash and certificates or evidence of
shares in book-entry form representing the Marigold Merger Consideration that
the holder of such Marigold Certificate and/or Marigold Book-Entry Security is
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.2(a), and any additional cash
payment that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.6(e) and
Section 2.6(g). No interest will be paid or will accrue on any such
consideration. The issuance or payment of the Marigold Merger Consideration
and the payment of any cash payment required to be made pursuant to Section
2.6(e) in respect of Marigold Common Shares in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement shall be deemed issued and paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such Marigold Common Shares (other than the right to
receive dividends or other distributions, if any, in accordance with Section
2.6(g)).

 



 

(e) No certificates or book-entry securities representing less than one
share of New Holdco Voting Common Stock shall be issued in the Second Merger
as a result of the conversion provided for in Section 2.2(a), but in lieu
thereof each Marigold Shareholder otherwise entitled to a fractional share of
New Holdco Voting Common Stock (after aggregating the total number of shares
of New Holdco Voting Common Stock that such Marigold Shareholder has the right
to receive pursuant to Section 2.2(a)) shall be entitled to receive from New
Holdco, in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.6(e), a cash
payment in lieu of such fractional shares equal to (i) the fraction of a share
of New Holdco Voting Common Stock, as applicable, to which such Marigold
Shareholder would otherwise be entitled, multiplied by (ii) the average daily
volume weighted average price of a share of Montage Voting Common Stock on the
NYSE over the five consecutive trading days immediately prior to the Closing
Date. The parties acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in lieu
of issuing fractional shares was not separately bargained-for consideration
but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the
expense and inconvenience to New Holdco that would otherwise be caused by the
issuance of fractional shares.

 



 

(f) After the Second Merger Effective Time, there shall be no further
transfer on the records of Marigold of Marigold Common Shares which have been
converted, pursuant to this Agreement, into the right to receive the
consideration set forth herein, and if any Marigold Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and/or Marigold Book-Entry Securities,
together with a duly executed and properly completed Marigold Letter of
Transmittal, are presented to the Exchange Agent, New Holdco or the Marigold
Surviving Corporation for transfer they shall be cancelled and exchanged,
without interest, for the Marigold Merger Consideration as provided in Section
2.2(a) (together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 2.6(e)).

 



 

(g) No dividends or other distributions with respect to the shares of New
Holdco Common Stock with a record date after the Second Merger Effective Time
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Marigold Common Shares with
respect to the shares of New Holdco Common Stock issuable hereunder, and all
such dividends and other distributions shall be paid by New Holdco to the
Exchange Agent and shall be included in the Marigold Exchange Fund, in each
case until the surrender of such Marigold Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof) or Marigold Book-Entry Security in accordance with this
Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws, following surrender of any such
Marigold Certificate or Marigold Book-Entry Security (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof) there shall be paid to the holder thereof, without interest, (i)
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Second Merger Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such shares of
New Holdco Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this
Agreement and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Second Merger Effective Time
but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such
surrender payable with respect to such shares of New Holdco Common Stock.

 



 

 



   



 

(h) None of Montage, New Holdco, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2, or Marigold
shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of New Holdco Common
Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) for any amount
required to be delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

 



 

(i) If any Marigold Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon such Person's (i) making of an affidavit of that fact claiming such
certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, (ii) delivery for the benefit of
New Holdco of a bond of indemnity in an amount and upon terms reasonably
satisfactory to the Exchange Agent, and (iii) execution and delivery of a
Marigold Letter of Transmittal, New Holdco will pay, in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the amount and type of consideration to
be paid in respect of each Marigold Common Share represented by such
certificate in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(j) Any portion of the Marigold Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by
the holders of Marigold Common Shares twelve (12) months after the Closing
Date shall be returned to New Holdco, upon demand, and any such holder who has
not exchanged Marigold Common Shares for the Marigold Merger Consideration in
accordance with this Section 2.6 prior to that time shall thereafter look only
to New Holdco for payment of the Marigold Merger Consideration, and any
dividends and distributions with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.6(g)
and any cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.6(e), in
respect of such shares without any interest thereon.

 



 

Section 2.7 Withholding Rights. Each of New Holdco, Montage, the Montage
Surviving Corporation, Marigold, the Marigold Surviving Corporation and any of
their respective Subsidiaries (and any agent acting on behalf of any of them,
including the Exchange Agent) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement such amounts as are
required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of federal, state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law. Any such
withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by New Holdco, Montage, the Montage
Surviving Corporation, Marigold, the Marigold Surviving Corporation or any
Subsidiary of any of them (or any agent acting on behalf of any of them,
including the Exchange Agent), as the case may be, to the appropriate
Governmental Entity and (ii) provided that such amounts are remitted to the
appropriate Governmental Entity, shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

 



 

Section 2.8 Adjustments. In the event that, at any time during the period
from the date hereof to the Second Merger Effective Time, Marigold or Montage,
as applicable, changes (or establishes a record date for changing) the number
of Marigold Common Shares issued and outstanding, or the number of shares of
Montage Common Stock issued and outstanding, as a result of a stock-split,
stock dividend, recapitalization, subdivision, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or any similar transaction, in each case other than
pursuant to transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then the Marigold
Merger Consideration shall be appropriately and proportionally adjusted to
reflect fully the effect of such change.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 2.9 Dissenting Shares. The holders of each share of Marigold Class
B Common Stock are entitled to rights to appraisal in the event of a merger of
Marigold pursuant to Section 490.1302 of the IBCA. Accordingly, and
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect to
each share of Marigold Class B Common Stock to which the holder thereof shall
have properly demanded appraisal in compliance with the provisions of Section
490.1321 of the IBCA (each, a " _Marigold Dissenting Share_ "), if any, such
holder shall be entitled to payment, solely from the Marigold Surviving
Corporation, of the fair value of the Marigold Dissenting Shares to the extent
permitted by and in accordance with the provisions of Section 490.1324 of the
IBCA; provided, however, that (a) if any holder of Marigold Dissenting Shares,
under the circumstances permitted by and in accordance with the IBCA,
affirmatively withdraws its demand for appraisal of such Marigold Dissenting
Shares, or (b) if any holder of Marigold Dissenting Shares takes or fails to
take any action the consequence of which is that such holder is not entitled
to payment for its shares under the IBCA, such holder or holders (as the case
may be) shall forfeit the right to appraisal of such shares of Marigold Class
B Common Stock and such shares of Marigold Class B Common Stock shall
thereupon cease to constitute Marigold Dissenting Shares and such shares of
Marigold Class B Common Stock shall be converted into and represent only the
right to receive the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration in
accordance with Section 2.2. Marigold shall give Montage prompt notice of any
demands received by Marigold for appraisal of shares of Marigold Class B
Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to Section 490.1302 of the IBCA and shall give Montage the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect
thereto. Marigold shall not, without the prior written consent of Montage,
make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such
demands.

conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets
owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, in each

to carry on its business as now conducted, in each case, except where the
failure to be so duly organized, validly existing, duly licensed or qualified

Section 3.4 SEC Filings; Financial Statements.

 



 

(a) Since July 1, 2013, Marigold has filed or furnished on a timely basis
all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents (including
exhibits and all other information incorporated therein) required to be filed
or furnished by Marigold with the SEC (the " _Marigold SEC Documents_ "). As
of their respective dates, the Marigold SEC Documents complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the
SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Marigold SEC Documents and,
except to the extent that information contained in such Marigold SEC Document
has been revised, amended, modified or superseded (prior to the date of this
Agreement) by a later filed Marigold SEC Document, none of Marigold SEC
Documents when filed or furnished contained any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 



 

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including any related notes and
schedules) contained or incorporated by reference in Marigold SEC Documents:
(i) complied as to form in all material respects with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC applicable thereto; (ii) were prepared in accordance
with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods covered (except
as may be indicated in the notes to such financial statements or as permitted
by Regulation S-X, or, in the case of unaudited financial statements, as
permitted by Form 10-Q or any successor form under the Exchange Act); and
(iii) fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of Marigold and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the respective
dates thereof and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of
Marigold and its consolidated Subsidiaries for the periods covered thereby
(subject, in the case of the unaudited financial statements, to normal and
recurring year-end adjustments that are not, individually or in the aggregate,
material). Such consolidated financial statements have been prepared from, and
are in accordance with, the books and records of Marigold and its
Subsidiaries. No financial statements of any Person are required by GAAP to be
included in the consolidated financial statements of Marigold.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) Marigold maintains, and at all times since July 1, 2014 has
maintained, a system of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) which is designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures that: (i)
pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Marigold and
its consolidated Subsidiaries; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of Marigold; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Marigold's
management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of Marigold's
system of internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year

Section 4.4 SEC Filings; Financial Statements.

 



 

(a) Since January 1, 2013, Montage has filed or furnished on a timely
basis all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents (including
exhibits and all other information incorporated therein) required to be filed
or furnished by Montage with the SEC (the " _Montage SEC Documents_ "). As of
their respective dates, the Montage SEC Documents complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the
SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Montage SEC Documents and,
except to the extent that information contained in such Montage SEC Document
has been revised, amended, modified or superseded (prior to the date of this
Agreement) by a later filed Montage SEC Document, none of Montage SEC
Documents when filed or furnished contained any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 



 

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including any related notes and
schedules) of Montage contained or incorporated by reference in Montage SEC
Documents: (i) complied as to form in all material respects with the published
rules and regulations of the SEC applicable thereto; (ii) were prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
covered (except as may be indicated in the notes to such financial statements
or as permitted by Regulation S-X, or, in the case of unaudited financial
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q or any successor form under the Exchange
Act); and (iii) fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Montage and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the
respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of operations and cash
flows of Montage and its consolidated Subsidiaries for the periods covered
thereby (subject, in the case of the unaudited financial statements, to normal
and recurring year-end adjustments that are not, individually or in the
aggregate, material). Such consolidated financial statements have been
prepared from, and are in accordance with, the books and records of Montage
and its Subsidiaries. No financial statements of any Person are required by
GAAP to be included in the consolidated financial statements of Montage.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) Montage maintains, and at all times since January 1, 2014 has
maintained, a system of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) which is designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures that: (i)
pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Montage and
its consolidated Subsidiaries; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of Montage; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Montage's
management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of Montage's
system of internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2014, and, except as set forth in Montage SEC Documents
filed prior to the date of this Agreement, such assessment concluded that such
controls were effective and Montage's independent registered accountant has
issued (and not subsequently withdrawn or qualified) an attestation report
concluding that Montage maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2014. To the knowledge of Montage, except as set
forth in the Montage SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement,
since January 1, 2014, Montage's independent registered accountant has not
identified or been made aware of: (1) any significant deficiency or material
weakness in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting utilized by Montage; (2) any illegal act or fraud, whether or not
material, that involves the management or other employees of Montage; or (3)
any claim or allegation regarding any of the foregoing.

 



 

(d) Montage maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule
13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that are reasonably designed to ensure
that all information required to be disclosed in Montage's reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC
and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to Montage's
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to enable each of the principal executive officer of Montage
and the principal financial officer of Montage to make the certifications
required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports. Montage is in
compliance in all material respects with all current listing and corporate
governance requirements of NYSE.

 



 

(e) None of the Montage or its consolidated Subsidiaries is a party to or
has any obligation or other commitment to become a party to any securitization
transaction, off-balance sheet partnership or any similar Contract (including
any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity, on the
other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a)
of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act)) where the result, purpose or
intended effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Montage in any of Montage's
published financial statements or other Montage SEC Documents.

 



 

(f) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or
unresolved comments in comment letters received from the SEC with respect to
Montage SEC Documents. To the knowledge of Montage, none of the Montage SEC
Documents is the subject of ongoing SEC review and there are no inquiries or
investigations by the SEC or any internal investigations pending or
threatened, in each case regarding any accounting practices of Montage.

connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "
_Montage Disclosure Documents_ "), and any amendments or supplements thereto,
when filed, distributed or disseminated, as applicable, will comply as to form
in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act.
Montage Disclosure Documents, at the time of the filing of such Montage
Disclosure Documents or any supplement or amendment thereto and at the time of
any distribution or dissemination thereof and at the time of the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, will not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 



 

(i) The Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall not, on the date the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus is first mailed to shareholders of Montage at the
time of Montage Shareholder Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (a) through (g) in Section 4.4,

incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by or on
behalf of Marigold for inclusion or incorporation by reference in Montage

Mergers.

the opinion of RBC Capital Markets, LLC (the " _Montage 's Financial
Advisor_"), financial advisor to Montage, dated September 4, 2015, to the
effect that subject to the assumptions and limitations set forth in such
opinion, the Marigold Merger Consideration provided for in the Second Merger
pursuant to this Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to
Montage. Montage will, following the execution of this Agreement, make
available to Marigold, solely for informational purposes, a signed copy of
such opinion.

 



 

Section 4.24 Montage Ownership of Marigold Common Shares. As of the date
hereof, neither Montage nor any Montage Subsidiary (nor any "affiliate" or
"associate" (as such terms are defined in Section 490.1110 of the IBCA) of

Chapter 490, Section 1110 of the IBCA) any Marigold Common Shares or other
equity interests of Marigold or any rights to purchase or otherwise receive
any shares of capital stock or any other equity securities of Marigold, or any

is determined in reference to, any such securities. During the three (3) year

Section 4.25 Montage Sharing Companies. Marigold acknowledges that Montage
neither controls, nor necessarily has knowledge concerning the operations of,
the Montage Sharing Companies. Accordingly, the information provided in the
Montage Disclosure Letter respecting the Montage Sharing Companies may be
incomplete or inaccurate, but solely as a matter of contract risk allocation,
and taking into account the materiality qualifiers set forth therein, Montage

the Montage Sharing Companies on the condition that Marigold acknowledge the

Section 4.26 Financial Ability.

 



 

(a) Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions precedent to Montage's
obligations hereunder and the completion of the Marketing Period, Montage has
no reason to believe that it will not be able to satisfy any term or condition
of the Transaction Financing (defined below) that is required to be satisfied
by Montage as a condition to such Transaction Financing, or that the
Transaction Financing will not be made available to Montage on the Closing
Date. Assuming the Transaction Financing is funded in accordance with the
Commitment Letter, the aggregate net proceeds contemplated by the Commitment
Letter, together with the cash of Montage and its Subsidiaries, will be an
amount sufficient for the satisfaction of Montage's cash payment obligations
under this Agreement on the Closing Date (including payment of the Cash
Consideration, all indebtedness of Marigold and Montage expected to be
required or contemplated to be repaid as a condition of the Transaction
Financing (the " _Retired Debt_ ") and any fees and expenses of, or payable
by, Montage or New Holdco in connection with the Merger or the Transaction
Financing).

 



 

(b) Montage has delivered to Marigold a true, complete and correct copy of
an executed commitment letter and fee letters (collectively, the " _Commitment
Letter_ ") from the financial institutions identified therein (together with
their respective Affiliates and their respective officers, employees,
directors, equityholders, partners, controlling parties, advisors, agents and
representatives and their successors and assigns, the " _Financing Sources_
"), pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
therein, the Financing Sources have committed to lend the amounts set forth
therein on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein (the "
_Transaction Financing_ ").

 



 

(c) Other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter, there are
no other agreements, side letters, arrangements or understandings (except for
customary fee credit letters and engagement letters, in each case associated
with the Transaction Financing, each of which does not (i) impair the
enforceability of the Commitment Letter, (ii) reduce the aggregate amount of
the Transaction Financing or (iii) impose new or additional (or adversely
expands, modifies or amends any of the existing) conditions precedent to the
Transaction Financing relating to the financing of the cash amounts needed to
be paid in connection with the Mergers (including all fees and expenses
required to be paid in connection with the Transaction Financing). There are
no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the
full amount of the Transaction Financing, except as set forth in the
Commitment Letter in the form so delivered to Marigold as of the date hereof.

 



 

(d) As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letter in the form so delivered
to Marigold is in full force and effect and represents the legally valid and
binding obligation of Montage and the Montage Subsidiaries, as applicable,
and, to the Knowledge of Montage, each of the other parties thereto,
enforceable in accordance with its terms (except as such enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization,
moratorium and other similar laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting creditors' rights, and by general equitable principles). As of the
date hereof, the Commitment Letter has not been withdrawn, rescinded or
terminated or otherwise amended, restated, modified or waived in any respect.
Montage and the Montage Subsidiaries are not in breach of any of the terms or
conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter. All fees required to be paid
under the Commitment Letter have been paid in full or, if not yet due, will be
duly paid in full when due.

 



 

(e) Montage acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of financing is not
a condition to Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, if any financing
contemplated to be obtained by Montage in connection with the Mergers has not
been obtained prior to Closing, Montage, New Holdco, Merger Sub 1 and Merger
Sub 2 shall continue to be obligated, subject to the fulfillment or waiver of
the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2, to consummate the
Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the
Closing in accordance with this Agreement.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 4.27 Solvency. Assuming (a) satisfaction of the conditions to
Montage's obligation to consummate the Mergers, and after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Transaction Financing, (b) any
repayment or refinancing of debt in connection with the Mergers, (c) the
accuracy of the representations and warranties of Marigold set forth in
Article III hereof and Marigold's compliance with this Agreement, (d) payments
of all amounts required to be paid by Montage, New Holdco, Merger Sub 1 and
Merger Sub 2 and the Montage Surviving Corporation in connection with the
consummation of the Mergers, the Transaction Financing and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, (e) payment of all related fees
and expenses, and (f) that any estimates, projections or forecasts prepared by
or on behalf of Marigold that have been provided to Montage have been prepared
in good faith based upon assumptions that were reasonable when made, each of
New Holdco, Montage, Marigold and their Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) will
be Solvent immediately after the Second Merger Effective Time. For the
purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Solvent_ " when used with respect to
any Person and its Subsidiaries, means that, as of any date of determination
(x) the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person and
its Subsidiaries (each taken as a whole) will, as of such date, exceed the
value of all probable liabilities of such Person and its Subsidiaries (taken
as a whole), including contingent and other probable liabilities, as of such
date, as such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with
applicable Law governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, (y) the
amount of the "present fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person and
its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) will, as of such date, exceed the amount
that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of such Person and its
Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) on their existing debts (including contingent
and other probable liabilities) as such debts become absolute and mature, , as
such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable Law
governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (z) such Person and
its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) will not have, as of such date, an
"unreasonably small amount of capital" for the operation of the businesses in
which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following such date, as such

subject to official notice of issuance. Each of New Holdco and Montage shall
also use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities
Law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions

third party with respect to furnishing such information) or subject to any
attorney client privilege (provided that the withholding party shall use
reasonable best efforts to permit the furnishing of such information in a
manner that does not result in loss or waiver of privilege).

 



 

 



   



 

(e) If at any time prior to the time that the Required Montage Vote is
obtained (the " _Montage Approval Time_ ") and the time that the Required
Marigold Vote is obtained (the " _Marigold Approval Time_ "), any information
relating to Marigold or Montage, or any of their respective Affiliates,
officers or directors, should be discovered by Marigold or Montage that should

include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate

necessary to conduct the business of the Montage Shareholder Meeting.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) As promptly as practicable following the effectiveness of the Form
S-4, Marigold shall, in consultation with Montage, in accordance with
applicable Law and the Marigold's bylaws, (i) establish a record date for,

expected to be a violation of applicable Law or for the distribution of any
required supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, or
(ii) if as of the time for which the Marigold Shareholder Meeting is
originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus) there
are insufficient Marigold Common Shares represented (either in person or by
proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the

Marigold shall be permitted to assert that the making of the Regulatory
Divestitures as contemplated by Schedule 6.3 do not constitute reasonable best
efforts.

 



 

(b) Montage and Marigold shall jointly, coordinate (i) the scheduling of,
and strategic planning for, any meeting with any Governmental Entity in
connection with the HSR Act, Communications Act and the FCC Rules, (ii) the

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing set forth in
this Section 6.3 or Schedule 6.3 shall (i) require, or be construed to
require, New Holdco, Montage, Marigold or any of their respective Subsidiaries
to take, or agree to take, any Regulatory Action or make any Regulatory
Divestiture unless the Regulatory Action or the Regulatory Divestiture shall
be conditioned upon the consummation of the Second Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby, or (ii) require, or be construed to require, New Holdco,
Montage, Marigold or any of their respective Subsidiaries to take, or agree to
take, any Regulatory Action unless all Regulatory Actions would not result in
a Regulatory Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 6.3(e)). Senior
executives of Montage shall consult in good faith with senior executives of
Marigold (with reasonable prior notice and giving due consideration to each
other's recommendations) with respect to any Regulatory Action that is not a
Regulatory Divestiture specifically listed in Schedule 6.3, and neither
Montage nor Marigold shall be permitted to take any action as part of
Regulatory Actions that would reasonably be expected to materially delay or
impede receipt of the FCC Consent or the consummation of the Regulatory
Actions or Mergers.

 



 

(e) For purposes of Section 6.3(d), (i) " _Regulatory Action_ " means any
obligation, condition or other requirement imposed by a Governmental Entity in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and
(ii) " _Regulatory Material Adverse Effect_ " means any Regulatory Action
imposed on New Holdco, Montage, Marigold or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, other than one or more Regulatory Divestitures of the

condition or results of operations of a company the size of (and with results
of operations equal to those of) Marigold and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, before the Second Merger Effective Time; provided that, for purposes of
determining whether any Regulatory Actions would have or would reasonably be
expected to have a Regulatory Material Adverse Effect, impacts of such
Regulatory Actions on New Holdco, Montage, Marigold or any of their respective
Subsidiaries shall be aggregated.

 



 

(f) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.3(a), but subject to
Section 6.3(d):

 



 

(i) Within twelve (12) Business Days of the date of this Agreement,
Montage and Marigold shall, and as necessary or advisable shall cause their

Licenses issued under Part 73 of Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, Montage and
Marigold shall, and as necessary or advisable shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, file the remainder of the FCC Applications. Montage and

promptly as practicable. Montage and Marigold shall each pay 50% of the FCC

(iii) Montage and Marigold acknowledge that, to the extent reasonably
necessary to expedite the grant by the FCC of any Renewal Application with
respect to any Station and thereby to facilitate the grant of the FCC Consent
with respect to such Station, each of Montage, Marigold and their applicable
Subsidiaries shall be permitted to enter into tolling agreements with the FCC
to extend the statute of limitations for the FCC to determine or impose a
forfeiture penalty against such Station in connection with (i) any pending
complaints that such Station aired programming that contained obscene,
indecent or profane material or (ii) any other enforcement matters against
such Station with respect to which the FCC may permit Montage or Marigold (or
any of their respective Subsidiaries) to enter into a tolling agreement.

 



 

(iv) If the Closing shall not have occurred for any reason within the
original effective periods of the FCC Consent, and neither party shall have
terminated this Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof, Montage and Marigold
shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain one or more extensions of
the effective period of the FCC Consent to permit consummation of the
transactions hereunder. Upon receipt of the FCC Consent, Marigold and Montage
shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to maintain in effect the
FCC Consent to permit consummation of the transactions hereunder. No extension
of the FCC Consent shall limit the right of Montage and Marigold to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof.

 



 

Section 6.4 Access to Information.

 



 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, each of Marigold and Montage shall, and shall cause

and other Representatives of the other, reasonable access, during normal
business hours during the period from the date of this Agreement to the
earlier of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms and
the Second Merger Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts and
records, and, during such period, each of such parties shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, make available to the other all other information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other may reasonably
request. Neither Marigold nor Montage nor any of their Subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of such party or its
Subsidiaries or contravene any Law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree
or fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement. Each of Marigold and Montage shall use reasonable best efforts to
make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in
which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

Broadcast Incentive Auction Rules, as they may be interpreted from time to
time by the FCC.

 



 

(e) Marigold and Montage acknowledge that (1) the FCC has announced its
intention to conduct the FCC Broadcast Incentive Auction no earlier than March
29, 2016; (2) the FCC Broadcast Incentive Auction will require television
station participants to file applications reflecting their intention to

bidding strategies, will be prohibited by 47 C.F.R. § 1.2205(b) (the "
_Prohibited Communications_ "); and (4) such Prohibited Communications will
remain prohibited until the FCC publicly announces the results of the FCC
Broadcast Incentive Auction (the period between the date Auction Applications
are required to be filed and the FCC's public announcement of the Auction
results hereinafter referred to as the " _Anti-Collusion Rule Period_ ").
During the Anti-Collusion Rule Period, neither Marigold nor Montage shall make
any statement, either oral or written, or take any action that is prohibited
under 47 C.F.R. § 1.2205(b). Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, neither Montage nor Marigold shall be required to provide or
communicate to the other or permit the other to access to any information that

account for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accruals (solely, in
the case of benefit accruals, with respect to Merger Benefit Plans that are
not defined benefit plans or provide post-retirement health or welfare
benefits, except as required by applicable Law or under any Merger Benefit
Plan that replaces a comparable Montage Benefit Plan or Marigold Benefit Plan,
as applicable), the service of such Continuing Employees with Marigold and the
Marigold Subsidiaries (and any predecessor entities) and Montage and the

same extent as such service was credited for such purpose, with respect to a
Montage Continuing Employee, by Montage and the Montage Subsidiaries and, with
respect to Marigold Continuing Employees, by Marigold and the Marigold
Subsidiaries; provided, however, that such service shall not be recognized to
the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits
with respect to the same period of service or with respect to New Benefit
Plans for which prior service is not taken into account or with respect to
plans for which participation and/or service is frozen.

 



 

(c) At and following the Second Merger Effective Time, New Holdco shall,
and shall cause the applicable Subsidiary to, as applicable, honor the accrued
and vested obligations of Montage and Marigold and their respective
Subsidiaries as of the Second Merger Effective Time under the provisions of
the Montage Benefit Plans, Montage Employment Agreements, Marigold Benefit
Plans, Marigold Employment Agreements, and New Benefit Plans, as applicable;
provided that this provision shall not prevent New Holdco or any of its
Subsidiaries from terminating any such plans or agreements to the extent
permitted by the respective terms of such plans or agreements, provided that
New Holdco honors all accrued and vested obligations under such plans and
agreements upon such termination.

 



 

 



   



 

(d) If Marigold Continuing Employees become eligible to participate in a
Montage Benefit Plan or a New Benefit Plan, or Montage Continuing Employees
become eligible to participate in a Marigold Benefit Plan or a New Benefit
Plan, in each case that provides medical, dental or other health care
insurance, New Holdco shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each
such plan to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations to the extent
such conditions are covered under the applicable medical, health, or dental

deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such employees
and their beneficiaries during the portion of the calendar year prior to such

insurability requirement which would otherwise be applicable to such employee
on or after the First Merger Effective Time for the year in which the First
Merger Effective Time or participation in such medical, dental or other health
care insurance plan of Montage or Marigold, as applicable, occurs, in each
case to the extent such employee had satisfied any similar limitation or
requirement under an analogous medical, dental or other health care insurance
plan of Marigold or Montage, as applicable, prior to the First Merger
Effective Time for the year in which the First Merger Effective Time or
participation in such medical, dental or health care insurance plan occurs.

 



 

(e) Without limiting the generality of Section 9.9, this Section 6.5 and
Section 2.3 and Section 2.4 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the
benefit of each party to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 6.5 or in
Section 2.3 or Section 2.4, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any
other Person, including any current or former director, officer or employee of
Marigold, Montage or any of their respective Subsidiaries, any rights or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 6.5 or by
reason of Section 2.3 or Section 2.4. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent
New Holdco, Montage, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2, the Montage Surviving
Corporation or the Marigold Surviving Corporation from amending, suspending or
terminating any Marigold Benefit Plans, Marigold Employment Agreements,
Montage Benefit Plans or Montage Employment Agreements to the extent permitted

Section 6.6 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance.

 



 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director or officer
may have under any indemnification agreement or under the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of Marigold, from and after the Second Merger
Effective Time, New Holdco shall cause the Marigold Surviving Corporation or
any applicable Subsidiary (excluding the Marigold Sharing Company and the
Montage Sharing Companies) (collectively, the " _D andO Indemnifying Parties_")
thereto to: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each person who is at the date
hereof, was previously, or during the period from the date hereof through the
date of the Second Merger Effective Time serving as a director or officer of
Marigold or such Subsidiary (collectively, the " _D andO Indemnified Parties_")
to the fullest extent the Marigold Surviving Corporation or any such
Subsidiary is so authorized or permitted by applicable Law, as now or
hereafter in effect, in connection with any DandO Claim and any losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, costs, Claim Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and
amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other
charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof)
relating to or resulting from such DandO Claim; and (ii) promptly pay on behalf
of or, within ten (10) Business Days after any request for advancement,
advance to each of the DandO Indemnified Parties, in each case to the fullest
extent the Marigold Surviving Corporation or the applicable Subsidiary is so
authorized or permitted by applicable Law, as now or hereafter in effect, any
Claim Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect to or
otherwise participating with respect to any DandO Claim in advance of the final
disposition of such DandO Claim, including payment on behalf of or advancement
to the DandO Indemnified Party of any Claim Expenses incurred by such DandO
Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to such
indemnification and/or advancement, in each case without the requirement of
any bond or other security, but subject to the Marigold Surviving
Corporation's receipt of a written undertaking by or on behalf of such DandO
Indemnified Party to repay such Claim Expenses if it is ultimately determined
under applicable Law that such DandO Indemnified Party is not entitled to be
indemnified. Without limiting any additional rights that any director or
officer may have under any indemnification agreement set forth in Section 6.6
of the Marigold Disclosure Letter or under the articles of incorporation and
bylaws of Marigold, the DandO Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only one
law firm to represent them with respect to each such DandO Claim unless there
is, under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict between the
positions of any two or more DandO Indemnified Parties. To the extent authorized
or permitted by applicable Law, the indemnification and advancement
obligations of the Marigold Surviving Corporation pursuant to this Section
6.6(a) shall extend to acts or omissions occurring at or before the Second
Merger Effective Time and any DandO Claim relating thereto (including with
respect to any acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of
this Agreement, the Mergers and the consummation of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the consideration and approval
thereof and the process undertaken in connection therewith and any DandO Claim
relating thereto), and all rights to indemnification and advancement conferred
hereunder shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or
officer of Marigold or any of the Marigold Subsidiaries after the date hereof
and shall inure to the benefit of such Person's heirs, successors, executors,
and personal and legal Representatives. As used in this Section 6.6(a): (x)
the term " _D andO Claim_" means any threatened, asserted, pending or completed
action, suit or proceeding or inquiry or investigation, whether instituted by
any party hereto, any Governmental Entity or any other Person, that any DandO
Indemnified Party in good faith believes might lead to the institution of any
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative,
investigative or other, including any arbitration or other alternative dispute
resolution mechanism, arising out of or pertaining to matters that relate to
(A) such DandO Indemnified Party's duties or service as a director or officer of
Marigold or the applicable Subsidiary thereto or (B) to the extent such person
is or was serving at the request or for the benefit of Marigold or any of the
Marigold Subsidiaries, any other entity or any benefit plan maintained by any
of the foregoing at or prior to the Second Merger Effective Time; and (y) the
term " _Claim Expenses_ " means reasonable attorneys' fees and all other
reasonable out-of-pocket costs, expenses and obligations (including experts'
fees, travel expenses, court costs, retainers, transcript fees, duplicating,
printing and binding costs, as well as telecommunications, postage and courier
charges) paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a
witness in or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to
investigate, defend, be a witness in or participate in, any DandO Claim for
which indemnification is authorized pursuant to this Section 6.6(a), including
any action relating to a claim for indemnification or advancement brought by a
DandO Indemnified Party. No DandO Indemnifying Party shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any actual or threatened DandO Claim in
respect of which indemnification has been sought by such DandO Indemnified Party
hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or judgment includes an
unconditional release of such DandO Indemnified Party from all liability arising
out of such DandO Claim, or such DandO Indemnified Party otherwise consents
thereto.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, New Holdco and Marigold agree that all
rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Second Merger Effective Time now
existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers of Marigold
or any of the Marigold Subsidiaries as provided in Marigold's bylaws as in
effect on the Closing Date and indemnification agreements of Marigold and the
Marigold Subsidiaries shall survive the Mergers and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms. For a period of six (6) years
from the Second Merger Effective Time, the articles of incorporation and
bylaws of Marigold shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification and limitations on liability of directors and officers than
are set forth in Marigold's articles of incorporation and bylaws as in effect
on the Closing Date, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Second Merger
Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder
of individuals who, at or prior to the Second Merger Effective Time, were
directors or officers of Marigold or any of the Marigold Subsidiaries, unless
such modification shall be required by applicable Law and then only to the
minimum extent required by applicable Law. At Marigold's option and expense,
prior to the Second Merger Effective Time, Marigold may purchase (and pay in
full the aggregate premium for) a six-year prepaid " _tail_ " insurance policy
(which policy by its express terms shall survive the Second Merger) of at
least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that
are no less favorable to the directors, officers, agents or fiduciaries of
Marigold or any of the Marigold Subsidiaries as Marigold's and the Marigold
Subsidiaries' existing directors' and officers' insurance policy or policies,
covering without limitation the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
with a claims period of six (6) years from the Second Merger Effective Time
for DandO Claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or prior to the
Second Merger Effective Time; provided, however, that the premium for such
tail policy shall not exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the aggregate
annual amounts currently paid by Marigold and the Marigold Subsidiaries for
such insurance (such amount being the " _Marigold Maximum Premium_ "). If
Marigold shall obtain such tail policy prior to the Second Merger Effective
Time, New Holdco or the Marigold Surviving Corporation shall cause such policy
to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and shall cause
Marigold to honor all its obligations thereunder. If Marigold fails to obtain
such tail policy prior to the Second Merger Effective Time, New Holdco or the
Marigold Surviving Corporation shall obtain such a tail policy, provided,
however, that the premium for such tail policy shall not exceed the Marigold
Maximum Premium; provided, further, that if such tail policy cannot be
obtained or can be obtained only by paying aggregate annual premiums in excess
of the Marigold Maximum Premium, New Holdco or the Marigold Surviving
Corporation shall only be required to obtain as much coverage as can be
obtained by paying an annual premium equal to the Marigold Maximum Premium.

 



 

(c) If any of New Holdco or the Marigold Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving company,
partnership or other entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
liquidates, dissolves or winds-up, or transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of New Holdco or the Marigold Surviving Corporation, as applicable,
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.6.

 



 

 



   



 

(d) New Holdco and the Marigold Surviving Corporation shall be jointly and
severally obligated to pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by any DandO Indemnified Party in
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 6.6;
provided, however, that such DandO Indemnified Party provides an undertaking to
repay such expenses if it is determined by a final and non-appealable judgment
of a court of competent jurisdiction that such Person is not legally entitled
to indemnification under Law.

 



 

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.6 are intended to be for the express
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each DandO Indemnified Party (who are
intended to be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.6), his or her
heirs and his or her personal Representatives, shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of New Holdco and the Marigold Surviving Corporation
and shall not be amended after the Second Merger Effective Time in a manner
that is adverse to any DandO Indemnified Party (including their successors,
assigns and heirs) without the prior written consent of such DandO Indemnified
Party (including the successors, assigns and heirs) affected thereby. The
exculpation and indemnification provided for by this Section 6.6 shall not be
deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to which a DandO Indemnified Party is
entitled, whether pursuant to applicable Law, contract or otherwise.

 



 

Section 6.7 Advice of Changes. Each of Montage, on the one hand, and
Marigold, on the other hand, shall promptly advise the other of any change or
event (i) having or reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Marigold, in the case of Marigold, or a Material Adverse Effect on Montage, in
the case of Montage, or (ii) that it believes would or would be reasonably
likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations,
warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement; provided, however, that
no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement; provided,
further, that a failure to comply with this Section 6.7 shall not constitute
the failure of any condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied unless
the underlying Material Adverse Effect or material breach would independently
result in the failure of a condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied.

 



 

Section 6.8 Tax Matters.

 



 

(a) Marigold shall use its reasonable best efforts to deliver to McDermott
Will and Emery LLP, counsel to Marigold (" _McDermott_ "), and Fried, Frank,
Harris, Shriver and Jacobson LLP, counsel to Montage (" _Fried Frank_ "), a "
_Tax Representation Letter_ ", dated as of the Closing Date (and, if
requested, dated as of the date the Form S-4 shall have been declared
effective by the SEC), signed by an officer of Marigold, and containing
representations of Marigold, and Montage shall use its reasonable best efforts
to deliver to McDermott and Fried Frank a " _Tax Representation Letter_ ,"
dated as of the Closing Date (and, if requested, dated as of the date the Form
S-4 shall have been declared effective by the SEC), signed by an officer of
Montage, and containing representations of Montage, in each case, as shall be
reasonably necessary or appropriate to enable Fried Frank to render the
opinion described in Section 7.2(e) and McDermott to render the opinion
described in Section 7.3(e).

 



 

 



   



 

(b) Marigold shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from
McDermott the opinion described in Section 7.3(e) (and any similar opinion to
be attached as an exhibit to the Form S-4). Montage shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain from Fried Frank the opinion described in Section
7.2(e) (and any similar opinion to be attached as an exhibit to the Form S-4).

 



 

(c) From and after the date hereof and until the Second Merger Effective
Time, none of Montage, Marigold or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall
knowingly (i) take any action, or fail to take any reasonable action, as a
result of which the First Merger and the Second Merger, taken together, are
reasonably likely to fail to qualify as a transaction described in Section 351
of the Code or (ii) enter into any contract, agreement, commitment or
arrangement to take or fail to take any such action described in clause (i).

 



 

Section 6.9 Approval Actions. Immediately after the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, Montage shall execute and deliver to Merger Sub 2 (with a
copy to Marigold) an irrevocable written consent approving and adopting this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Second
Merger (the " _Merger Sub 2 Shareholder Approval_ ").

 



 

Section 6.10 No Solicitation by Marigold.

 



 

(a) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Second Merger Effective
Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, (i)
Marigold shall not, and shall cause the Marigold Subsidiaries not to, and (ii)
Marigold shall and shall cause the Marigold Subsidiaries to use its and their
respective reasonable best efforts (including by notifying them of the
existence and terms of this Section 6.10(a)) to cause the Representatives of
Marigold and of the Marigold Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly:

 



 

(i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate the
making, submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal with respect to
Marigold or Acquisition Inquiry with respect to Marigold;

 



 

(ii) furnish any non-public information regarding Marigold or any of the
Marigold Subsidiaries to any Person who has made or in response to an
Acquisition Proposal with respect to Marigold or an Acquisition Inquiry with
respect to Marigold;

 



 

(iii) engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person who has made
any Acquisition Proposal with respect to Marigold or Acquisition Inquiry with
respect to Marigold (other than discussions in the ordinary course of business
that are unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry, which
shall be permitted);

 



 

(iv) approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal with respect
to Marigold or Acquisition Inquiry with respect to Marigold or, subject to
Section 6.10(c), withdraw or propose to withdraw its approval and
recommendation in favor of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the First Merger and Second Merger; or

 



 

 



   



 

(v) enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger,
acquisition, purchase or joint venture agreement or other similar agreement
(other than a Marigold Confidentiality Agreement, subject to Section 6.10(b))
for any Acquisition Transaction with respect to Marigold.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding Section 6.10(a), if after the date hereof but prior to
the Marigold Approval Time, the Marigold Board receives a bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal made after the date hereof but prior to the Marigold
Approval Time and which has not resulted from a violation of this Section
6.10, Marigold and its Representatives may contact such Person to clarify the
terms and conditions thereof and if the Marigold Board determines in its good
faith judgment, after consulting with outside counsel and a nationally
recognized third party financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Marigold Superior
Offer, and, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take
the actions described in clauses (A) and (B) below would be reasonably likely
to be inconsistent with the Marigold Board's fiduciary duties to Marigold
Shareholders under applicable Law, then Marigold may, at any time prior to the
Marigold Approval Time (A) furnish information with respect to Marigold and
the Marigold Subsidiaries to the Person or Persons (and its or their
Representatives and potential financing sources) making such Acquisition
Proposal, but only after such Person or Persons enter into a Marigold
Confidentiality Agreement and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations
with such Person or Persons (and its or their Representatives and potential
financing sources) regarding any such Acquisition Proposal made by such Person
or Persons; provided, that Marigold shall give written notice to Montage after
any such determination by the Marigold Board and before taking any of the
actions described in the foregoing clauses (A) and (B). Marigold shall
promptly (and in any event, within 24 hours) provide Montage with all non-
public information regarding Marigold and the Marigold Subsidiaries that is
provided by Marigold to a Person or Persons (or its or their Representatives
or potential financing sources) making such Acquisition Proposal that shall
not have been previously provided to Montage or its Representatives.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.10, in no
event may Marigold or any of the Marigold Subsidiaries or any of its
Representatives directly or indirectly reimburse or pay, or agree to reimburse
or pay, the fees, costs or expenses of, or provide or agree to provide
compensation to, any Person or Persons (or any of its or their Representatives
or potential financing sources) who makes an Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Inquiry with respect to Marigold.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.10(c), the Marigold
Board shall not (i) (A) fail to make or withdraw or qualify, amend or modify
in any manner adverse to Montage, or propose publicly to withdraw, or to
qualify, amend or modify, in any manner adverse to Montage, the Marigold Board
Recommendation or (B) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any action described in this clause (i)
being referred to as a " _Marigold Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") (it being
understood that the following shall not constitute a Marigold Adverse
Recommendation Change prohibited hereunder: (1) any "stop, look and listen"
disclosure in compliance with Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, and (2) any
communication by Marigold that expressly continues to recommend the
transactions contemplated hereby), (ii) take any action to make the provisions
of any "fair price", "moratorium", "control share acquisition", "business
combination" or other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation inapplicable
to any transaction contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) approve
or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, or cause or
authorize Marigold or any of the Marigold Subsidiaries to enter into, any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger, acquisition, purchase or
joint venture agreement or Contract or other instrument in respect of or
relating to an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Marigold (other than a
Marigold Confidentiality Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any
time before the Marigold Approval Time, the Marigold Board may effect a
Marigold Adverse Recommendation Change (other than in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal with respect to Marigold) in response to a Marigold
Intervening Event, if and only if: (A) if the Marigold Board determines in its
good faith judgment, after consulting with outside counsel, that the failure
to effect a Marigold Adverse Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely
to be inconsistent with the Marigold Board's fiduciary duties to the Marigold
Shareholders under applicable Law; (B) Marigold has provided Montage four (4)
Business Days' prior written notice specifying the Marigold Intervening Event
in reasonable detail and advising Montage that it intends to take such action
and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons for such action, it being
understood that the delivery of such notice shall not itself constitute a
Marigold Adverse Recommendation Change; and (C) (1) during such four (4)
Business Days notice period, to the extent requested in writing by Montage,
Marigold and its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Montage
and Montage's Representatives with respect to any revisions to the terms of
this Agreement so that such Marigold Intervening Event would no longer
necessitate a Marigold Adverse Recommendation Change, and (2) if after taking
into consideration any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in
writing by Montage by 5 p.m. Eastern Time on the last day of such notice
period, the Marigold Board continues to believe in its good faith judgment,
after consulting with outside counsel, that the failure to make a Marigold
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Marigold Intervening Event
would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Marigold Board's
fiduciary duties to the Marigold Shareholders under applicable Law. For the
avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 6.10(c) shall also apply to
any material change to the facts and circumstances relating to such Marigold
Intervening Event and require a new notice, except that the references to four
(4) business days shall be deemed to be three (3) business days.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.10(c) or elsewhere
in this Agreement, if the Marigold Board receives after the date hereof but
before the Marigold Approval Time a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal with respect to Marigold (which did not result from a violation of
this Section 6.10) that the Marigold Board determines in its good faith
judgment, after consulting with outside counsel and a nationally recognized
third party financial advisor, constitutes a Marigold Superior Offer, (i)
Marigold may (but in no event from and after the Marigold Approval Time)
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h) to enter into a definitive
agreement to accept such Marigold Superior Offer (and take an action described
in clause (ii) of the first sentence of this Section 6.10(c) contemporaneously
therewith), if Marigold pays the Marigold Termination Fee required to be paid
by it pursuant to Section 8.3 in connection with such termination, or (ii) the
Marigold Board may make a Marigold Adverse Recommendation Change in connection
with such Marigold Superior Offer, but in each case described in this sentence
only (1) after the fourth (4th) Business Day (such four (4) Business Day
period, the " _Marigold Notice Period_ ") following Marigold's delivery to
Montage of written notice (a " _Notice of Marigold Superior Offer_ "),
advising Montage that the Marigold Board is prepared to accept such Marigold
Superior Offer and enter into a definitive agreement with respect hereto
(which notice shall include the form of definitive agreement Marigold and the
Person that made such offer are prepared to enter into in connection with the
termination of this Agreement, any other information and material required to
be delivered under Section 6.10(b) or this Section 6.10(c), as applicable,
that has not yet been provided to Montage, and the identity of the Person or
Persons making such Acquisition Proposal) and terminate this Agreement or make
a Marigold Adverse Recommendation Change in connection with such Marigold
Superior Offer (it being understood that any such Notice of Marigold Superior
Offer regarding a Marigold Adverse Recommendation Change shall not itself
constitute a Marigold Adverse Recommendation Change for purposes of this
Agreement) and during such Marigold Notice Period, to the extent requested in
writing by Montage, Marigold and its Representatives shall negotiate in good
faith with Montage and Montage's Representatives with respect to any revisions
to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Montage so that such Acquisition
Proposal ceases to constitute a Marigold Superior Offer, and (2) if after
taking into consideration any revisions to the terms of this Agreement
proposed in writing by Montage by 5 p.m. Eastern Time on the last day of such
Marigold Notice Period, the Marigold Board continues to believe in its good
faith judgment, after consulting with outside counsel and a nationally
recognized third party financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal
continues to constitute a Marigold Superior Offer, and that, after
consultation with outside counsel, the failure to (i) terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(h) or (ii) make a Marigold Adverse Recommendation
Change in connection with such Marigold Superior Offer would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with the Marigold Board's fiduciary duties to the
Marigold Shareholders under applicable Law. Any (i) amendment to the financial
or other material terms of such Marigold Superior Offer or (ii) amendment to
an Acquisition Proposal that the Marigold Board had determined no longer
constitutes a Marigold Superior Offer, shall constitute a new Acquisition
Proposal and shall require Marigold to deliver to Montage a new Notice of
Marigold Superior Offer and a new Marigold Notice Period (which shall be three
(3), instead of four (4), Business Days in length) shall commence thereafter.
Except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 6.10(c),
Marigold shall have no right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(h).

 



 

 



   



 

(d) Nothing in this Section 6.10 shall prohibit the Marigold Board from
(i) taking and disclosing to Marigold's shareholders a position contemplated
by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated
under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its shareholders
required pursuant to applicable Law if the Marigold Board determines, in its
good faith judgment, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure
to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties or applicable Law; provided that (x) a disclosure pursuant to
clause (i) of this Section 6.10(d) shall be a Marigold Adverse Recommendation
Change unless the Marigold Board reaffirms the Marigold Board Recommendation
in such disclosure, and (y) clause (ii) of this Section 6.10(d) shall not
permit the Marigold Board to make a Marigold Adverse Recommendation Change or
to take any other actions contemplated by this Section 6.10, except, in each
case, to the extent expressly permitted by, and subject to the terms and
conditions of, this Section 6.10.

 



 

(e) Marigold shall promptly, within 36 hours, advise Montage orally and in
writing of any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry (including the
identity of the Person making or submitting such Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Inquiry and the terms thereof and all material modifications
thereto) that is made or submitted by any Person during the period beginning
on the date hereof until the Second Merger Effective Time or, if earlier, the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. If Marigold
receives an Acquisition Proposal or an Acquisition Inquiry, it shall (i)
promptly notify Montage (within no more than 36 hours after any director,
officer or financial advisor of Marigold is notified or becomes aware of the
receipt of such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry) of the
communication or receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry,
indicating, in connection with such notice, the identity of the person making
such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry and the material terms and
conditions thereof, and (ii) keep Montage reasonably informed on a current
basis of any material developments in the status and terms of any such
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry (including whether such
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry has been withdrawn or rejected and
any material change to the terms thereof).

 



 

 



   



 

(f) Marigold shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
discussions existing as of the date of this Agreement with any Person that
relate to any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry in respect of
Marigold proposed on or prior to the date hereof. Marigold acknowledges and
agrees that any actions taken by or at the direction of a Representative of
Marigold or any of the Marigold Subsidiaries that, if taken by Marigold, would
constitute a breach or violation of this Section 6.10 will be deemed to
constitute a breach and violation of this Section 6.10 by Marigold.

 



 

Section 6.11 No Solicitation by Montage.

 



 

(a) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Second Merger Effective
Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, (i)
Montage shall not, and shall cause the Montage Subsidiaries not to, and (ii)
Montage shall and shall cause the Montage Subsidiaries to use its and their
respective reasonable best efforts (including by notifying them of the
existence and terms of this Section 6.11(a)) to cause the Representatives of
Montage and of the Montage Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly:

 



 

(i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate the
making, submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal with respect to
Montage or Acquisition Inquiry with respect to Montage;

 



 

(ii) furnish any non-public information regarding Montage or any of the
Montage Subsidiaries to any Person who has made or in response to an
Acquisition Proposal with respect to Montage or an Acquisition Inquiry with
respect to Montage;

 



 

(iii) engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person who has made
any Acquisition Proposal with respect to Montage or an Acquisition Inquiry
with respect to Montage (other than discussions in the ordinary course of
business that are unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry,
which shall be permitted);

 



 

(iv) approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal with respect
to Montage or Acquisition Inquiry with respect to Montage or, subject to
Section 6.11(c), withdraw or propose to withdraw its approval and
recommendation in favor of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the First Merger and Second Merger; or

 



 

(v) enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger,
acquisition, purchase or joint venture agreement or other similar agreement
(other than a confidentiality agreement on the terms described below, subject
to Section 6.11(b)) for any Acquisition Transaction with respect to Montage.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) Notwithstanding Section 6.11(a), if after the date hereof but prior to
the Montage Approval Time, the Montage Board receives a bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal made after the date hereof but prior to the Montage
Approval Time and which has not resulted from a violation of this Section
6.11, Montage and its Representatives may contact such Person to clarify the
terms and conditions thereof and if the Montage Board determines in its good
faith business judgment, after consulting with outside counsel and a
nationally recognized third party financial advisor, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Montage
Superior Offer, and, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure
to take the actions described in clauses (A) and (B) below would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with the Montage Board's fiduciary duties to Montage
Shareholders under applicable Law, then Montage may, at any time prior to the
Montage Approval Time (A) furnish information with respect to Montage and the
Montage Subsidiaries to the Person or Persons (and its or their
Representatives and potential financing sources) making such Acquisition
Proposal, but only after such Person or Persons enter into a customary
confidentiality agreement with Montage (which confidentiality agreement must
be no less restrictive with respect to the confidential treatment of
information by such Person than the Confidentiality Agreement) (a " _Montage
Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and (B) participate in discussions or
negotiations with such Person or Persons (and its or their Representatives and
potential financing sources) regarding any such Acquisition Proposal made by
such Person or Persons; provided, that Montage shall give written notice to
Marigold after any such determination by the Montage Board and before taking
any of the actions described in the foregoing clauses (A) and (B). Montage
shall promptly (and in any event, within 24 hours) provide Marigold with all
non-public information regarding Montage and the Montage Subsidiaries that is
provided by Montage to a Person or Persons (or its or their Representatives or
potential financing sources) making such Acquisition Proposal that shall not
have been previously provided to Marigold or its Representatives.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.11, in no
event may Montage or any of the Montage Subsidiaries or any of its
Representatives directly or indirectly reimburse or pay, or agree to reimburse
or pay, the fees, costs or expenses of, or provide or agree to provide
compensation to, any Person or Persons (or any of its or their Representatives
or potential financing sources) who makes an Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Inquiry with respect to Montage.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.11(c), the Montage
Board shall not (i) (A) fail to make or withdraw or qualify, amend or modify
in any manner adverse to Marigold, or propose publicly to withdraw, or to
qualify, amend or modify, in any manner adverse to Marigold, the Montage Board
Recommendation or (B) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any action described in this clause (i)
being referred to as a " _Montage Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") (it being
understood that the following shall not constitute a Montage Adverse
Recommendation Change prohibited hereunder: (1) any "stop, look and listen"
disclosure in compliance with Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, and (2) any
communication by Montage that expressly continues to recommend the
transactions contemplated hereby), (ii) take any action to make the provisions
of any "fair price", "moratorium", "control share acquisition", "business
combination" or other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation inapplicable
to any transaction contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) approve
or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, or cause or
authorize Montage or any of the Montage Subsidiaries to enter into, any letter
of intent, agreement in principle, merger, acquisition, purchase or joint
venture agreement or Contract or other instrument in respect of or relating to
an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Montage (other than a Montage
Confidentiality Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time before
the Montage Approval Time, the Montage Board may effect a Montage Adverse
Recommendation Change (other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal
with respect to Montage) in response to a Montage Intervening Event, if and
only if: (A) if the Montage Board determines in its good faith business
judgment, after consulting with outside counsel, that the failure to effect a
Montage Adverse Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the Montage Board's fiduciary duties to the Montage
Shareholders under applicable Law; (B) Montage has provided Marigold four (4)
Business Days' prior written notice specifying the Montage Intervening Event
in reasonable detail and advising Marigold that it intends to take such action
and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons for such action, it being
understood that the delivery of such notice shall not itself constitute a
Montage Adverse Recommendation Change; and (C) (1) during such four (4)
Business Days notice period, to the extent requested in writing by Marigold,
Montage and its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Marigold
and Marigold's Representatives with respect to any revisions to the terms of
this Agreement so that such Montage Intervening Event would no longer
necessitate a Montage Adverse Recommendation Change, and (2) if after taking
into consideration any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in
writing by Marigold by 5 p.m. Eastern Time on the last day of such notice
period, the Montage Board continues to believe in its good faith business
judgment, after consulting with outside counsel, that the failure to make a
Montage Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Montage Intervening
Event would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Montage Board's
fiduciary duties to the Montage Shareholders under applicable Law. For the
avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 6.11(c) shall also apply to
any material change to the facts and circumstances relating to such Montage
Intervening Event and require a new notice, except that the references to four
(4) business days shall be deemed to be three (3) business days.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.11(c), if the
Montage Board receives after the date hereof but before the Montage Approval
Time a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal with respect to
Montage (which did not result from a violation of this Section 6.11) that the
Montage Board determines in its good faith business judgment, after consulting
with outside counsel and a nationally recognized third party financial
advisor, constitutes a Montage Superior Offer, the Montage Board may make a
Montage Adverse Recommendation Change in connection with such Montage Superior
Offer, but in each case described in this sentence only (1) after the fourth
(4th) Business Day (such four (4) Business Day period, the " _Notice Period_
") following Montage's delivery to Marigold of written notice (a " _Notice of
Montage Superior Offer_ ") advising Marigold that the Montage Board is
prepared to make a Montage Adverse Recommendation Change in connection with
such Montage Superior Offer (it being understood that any such Notice of
Montage Superior Offer regarding a Montage Adverse Recommendation Change shall
not itself constitute a Montage Adverse Recommendation Change for purposes of
this Agreement) and during such Notice Period, to the extent requested in
writing by Marigold, Montage and its Representatives shall negotiate in good
faith with Marigold and Marigold's Representatives with respect to any
revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Marigold so that such
Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Montage Superior Offer, and (2) if
after taking into consideration any revisions to the terms of this Agreement
proposed in writing by Marigold by 5 p.m. Eastern Time on the last day of such
Notice Period, the Montage Board continues to believe in its good faith
judgment, after consulting with outside counsel and a nationally recognized
third party financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal continues to
constitute a Montage Superior Offer, and that, after consultation with outside
counsel, the failure to make a Montage Adverse Recommendation Change in
connection with such Montage Superior Offer would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the Montage Board's fiduciary duties to the Montage
Shareholders under applicable Law. Any (i) amendment to the financial or other
material terms of such Montage Superior Offer or (ii) amendment to an
Acquisition Proposal that the Montage Board had determined no longer
constitutes a Montage Superior Offer, shall constitute a new Acquisition
Proposal and shall require Montage to deliver to Marigold a new Notice of
Montage Superior Offer and a new Montage Notice Period (which shall be three
(3), instead of four (4), Business Days in length) shall commence thereafter.

 



 

 



   



 

(d) Nothing in this Section 6.11 shall prohibit the Montage Board from (i)
taking and disclosing to Montage's shareholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under
the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its shareholders required
pursuant to applicable Law if the Montage Board determines, in its good faith
business judgment, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure
to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties or applicable Law; provided that (x) a disclosure pursuant to
clause (i) of of this Section 6.11(d) shall be a Montage Adverse
Recommendation Change unless the Montage Board reaffirms the Montage Board
Recommendation in such disclosure, and (y) clause (ii) of this Section 6.11(d)
shall not permit the Montage Board to make a Montage Adverse Recommendation
Change or to take any other actions contemplated by this Section 6.11, except,
in each case, to the extent expressly permitted by, and subject to the terms
and conditions of, this Section 6.11.

 



 

(e) Montage shall promptly, within 36 hours, advise Marigold orally and in
writing of any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry (including the
identity of the Person making or submitting such Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Inquiry and the terms thereof and all material modifications
thereto) that is made or submitted by any Person during the period beginning
on the date hereof until the Second Merger Effective Time or, if earlier, the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. If Montage
receives an Acquisition Proposal or an Acquisition Inquiry, it shall (i)
promptly notify Marigold (within no more than 36 hours after any director,
officer or financial advisor of Montage is notified or becomes aware of the
receipt of such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry) of the
communication or receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry,
indicating, in connection with such notice, the identity of the person making
such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry and the material terms and
conditions thereof, and (ii) keep Marigold reasonably informed on a current
basis of any material developments in the status and terms of any such
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry (including whether such
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry has been withdrawn or rejected and
any material change to the terms thereof).

 



 

(f) Montage shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
discussions existing as of the date of this Agreement with any Person that
relate to any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry in respect of
Montage proposed on or prior to the date hereof. Montage acknowledges and
agrees that any actions taken by or at the direction of a Representative of
Montage or any of the Montage Subsidiaries that, if taken by Montage, would
constitute a breach or violation of this Section 6.11 will be deemed to
constitute a breach and violation of this Section 6.11 by Montage.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 6.12 Financing.

 



 

(a) 

 



 

(i) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of
Montage, New Holdco and Merger Sub 2 shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the Transaction Financing on the terms and conditions (including the
flex provisions and taking into account the Marketing Period) described in the
Commitment Letter at Closing (taking into account the Marketing Period), and
shall not, without the prior written consent of Marigold (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), permit any amendment or
modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision under, the
Commitment Letter, in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (x) delay
or prevent or make less likely the funding of the Transaction Financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letter (or satisfaction of the conditions
precedent to the Transaction Financing) on the Closing Date in any material
respect or (y) extend or permit the extension of the marketing period under
the Commitment Letter (provided that, without the consent of Marigold,
Montage, New Holdco and Merger Sub 2 may amend the Commitment Letter (x) to
favorably modify pricing terms or add additional lenders, arrangers,
bookrunners and agents or (y) to implement or exercise any of the "market
flex" provisions (including pricing terms) contained in the fee letter
executed in connection with the Commitment Letter). Montage shall promptly
deliver to Marigold copies of any such amendment, modification or replacement.
For purposes of this Section 6.12, references to "Transaction Financing" shall
include the Transaction Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter as
permitted to be amended, modified or replaced by this Section 6.12(a) and
references to "Commitment Letter" shall include such documents as permitted to
be amended, modified or replaced by this Section 6.12(a).

 



 

 



   



 

(ii) Each of Montage, New Holdco and Merger Sub 2 shall use its reasonable
best efforts (A) to maintain in effect the Commitment Letter, (B) to enter
into definitive agreements with respect to the Commitment Letter consistent in
all material respects with the terms and conditions (including the flex
provisions and taking into account the Marketing Period) contained in the
Commitment Letter (or on terms no less favorable (taken as a whole) to
Montage, New Holdco or Merger Sub 2 than the terms and conditions (including
flex provisions) in the Commitment Letter), and (C) to satisfy (or obtain the
waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions precedent to funding in the
Commitment Letter and such definitive agreements thereto (taking into account
the Marketing Period and other than any condition where the failure to be so
satisfied is a direct result of Marigold's failure to furnish information
described in Section 6.12(b)) that are within Montage's control and to
consummate the Transaction Financing at the Closing.. Montage shall keep
Marigold reasonably informed on a current basis and in reasonable detail of
the status of its efforts to arrange the Transaction Financing and provide to
Marigold copies of the material definitive agreements for the Transaction
Financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Montage shall
give Marigold prompt notice (x) of any material breach or default by any party
to any of the Commitment Letter or definitive agreements related to the
Transaction Financing of which Montage becomes aware, (y) of the receipt of
(A) any written notice or (B) other written communication, in each case from
any Financing Source with respect to any actual or potential material breach,
default, termination or repudiation by any party to any of the Commitment
Letter or definitive agreements related to the Transaction Financing of any
provisions of the Commitment Letter or definitive agreements related to the
Transaction Financing, and (z) if at any time for any reason Montage believes
in good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the
Transaction Financing on the terms and conditions, in the manner or from the
sources contemplated by any of the Commitment Letter or definitive agreements
related to the Transaction Financing. As soon as reasonably practicable after
any notice by Montage to Marigold of the type described in the immediately
preceding sentence, but in any event within two Business Days of the date
Marigold delivers to Montage a written request, Montage shall use reasonable
best efforts to provide any information reasonably requested by Marigold
relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (x), (y) or (z) of the
immediately preceding sentence; provided, that they need not provide any
information believed to be privileged or that is requested for purposes of
litigation. If all or any portion of the Transaction Financing becomes
unavailable for any reason, and such portion is reasonably required to pay the
aggregate Cash Consideration, repay the Retired Debt and pay all fees,
expenses and other amounts contemplated to be paid by Montage, New Holdco,
Merger Sub 2 or the Montage Surviving Corporation pursuant to this Agreement,
Montage, New Holdco and Merger Sub 2 shall use their reasonable best efforts
to arrange and obtain in replacement thereof alternative debt Transaction
Financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient, when taken
together with available cash of Montage and any then-available Transaction
Financing pursuant to the Commitment Letter, to consummate the Mergers with
terms and conditions not materially less favorable (taken as a whole) to
Montage, New Holdco and Merger Sub 2 than the terms and conditions (taken as a
whole) set forth in the Commitment Letter (" _Available Transaction Financing_
"), as promptly as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of such
event. Montage shall deliver to Marigold true and complete copies of all
commitment letters and fee letters pursuant to which any such alternative
source shall have committed to provide any portion of the Transaction
Financing. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.12 or elsewhere in this
Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the "reasonable best efforts" of
Montage, New Holdco or Merger Sub 2 be deemed or construed to require any such
Person to, and no such Person shall be required to, pay any debt financing
fees in the aggregate in excess of those contemplated by the Commitment
Letter, or agree to conditionality or economic terms of the debt financing
that are (other than as specified in the preceding sentence) materially less
favorable than those contemplated by the Commitment Letter or any related fee
letter (including any "flex" provision therein).

obtaining the prior consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) of (a) Montage, in the case of a proposed announcement
or statement by Marigold or (b) Marigold, in the case of a proposed
announcement or statement by Montage; provided, however, that (i) any party

the extent required by applicable Law or by the rules and regulations of the

disclose any information that has not been made available in previous press

obtain the consent of Montage in connection with any press release or other

Section 9.9 Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries. Neither this Agreement
nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be
assigned by any of the parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise, but
except by intestate succession) without the prior written consent of the other
parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by each of the parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns. Except as otherwise
specifically provided in Section 6.6, this Agreement (including the documents
and instruments referred to in this Agreement) is not intended to and does not

Section 9.10 Specific Performance. The parties acknowledge and agree that
each of the parties would be irreparably damaged if any of the provisions of
this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
are otherwise breached and that any non-performance, breach or threatened
breach of this Agreement by any party could not be adequately compensated by
monetary damages alone and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy
at law. Accordingly, each party shall be entitled (in addition to any other
remedy that may be available to it whether in law or equity, including
monetary damages) to (a) enforcement of any provision of this Agreement by a
decree or order of specific performance and (b) a temporary, preliminary
and/or permanent injunction to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of any
provisions of this Agreement without posting any bond or undertaking. The
parties hereto further agree that they shall not object to the granting of
injunctive or other equitable relief on the basis that there exists an
adequate remedy at law. Each of the parties hereby expressly further waives
(a) any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law
would be adequate or that an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity and (b) any requirement
under any Law to post security as a prerequisite to obtaining equity relief.
Each party agrees that its initial choice of remedy will be to seek specific
performance of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

 



 

Section 9.11 Non-Survival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements.
None of the representations, warranties, covenants, and other agreements in
this Agreement, including any rights arising out of any breach of such
representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements, shall survive the
Second Merger Effective Time, except for those covenants and agreements
contained herein that by their terms apply or are to be performed in whole or
in part after the Second Merger Effective Time including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the covenants contained in Section 6.6.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 9.12 Non-Recourse. Except to the extent otherwise set forth in the
other Transaction Documents, all claims, obligations, Liabilities, or causes
of action (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by
statute) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason
of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, execution, or performance of this Agreement (including any
representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement
to, this Agreement), may be made by the parties hereto only against (and such
representations and warranties are those solely of) the Persons that are
expressly identified as parties in the preamble to this Agreement (the "
_Contracting Parties_ "). No Person who is not a Contracting Party, including
any current, former or future director, officer, employee, incorporator,
member, partner, manager, stockholder, Affiliate, or assignee of, and any
financial adviser, Financing Source or lender to any Contracting Party, or any
current, former or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member,
partner, manager, stockholder, Affiliate, or assignee of any of the foregoing
(collectively, the " _Nonparty Affiliates_ "), shall have any Liability
(whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute)
for any claims, causes of action, obligations, or Liabilities arising under,
out of, in connection with, or related in any manner to this Agreement or
based on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or its negotiation,
execution, performance, or breach (other than as set forth in the other
Transaction Documents), and, to the maximum extent permitted by Law (other
than as set forth in the other Transaction Documents), each Contracting Party
hereby waives and releases all such Liabilities, claims, causes of action, and
obligations against any such Nonparty Affiliates of another Contracting Party.
Without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, (a)
each Contracting Party hereby waives and releases any and all rights, claims,
demands, or causes of action that may otherwise be available at law or in
equity, or granted by statute, to avoid or disregard the entity form of a
Contracting Party or otherwise impose Liability of a Contracting Party on any
other Contracting Party's Nonparty Affiliate in respect of this Agreement,
whether granted by statute or based on theories of equity, agency, control,
instrumentality, alter ego, domination, sham, single business enterprise,
piercing the veil, unfairness, undercapitalization, or otherwise; and (b) each
Contracting Party disclaims any reliance upon any other Contracting Party's
Nonparty Affiliates with respect to the performance of this Agreement or any
representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement to
this Agreement. Subject to the rights of the parties to the Commitment Letter
under the terms thereof, none of the Contracting Parties, nor or any of their
respective Affiliates, solely in their respective capacities as parties to
this Agreement, shall have any rights or claims against any Financing Source,
solely in their respective capacities as lenders or arrangers in connection
with the Transaction Financing, and the Financing Sources, solely in their
respective capacities as lenders or arrangers, shall not have any rights or
claims against any Contracting Party or any related person thereof, in
connection with this Agreement or the Transaction Financing, whether at law or
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. For the avoidance of doubt, subject
to the rights of Montage under the Commitment Letter under the terms thereof,
none of the Financing Sources, nor or any of the respective Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives, and no past,
present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
stockholder, agent, attorney or representative of any such Financing Source
shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of any party
hereto under this Agreement or for any claim (whether in contract, tort or
otherwise) based on, in respect of, or by reason of (or in any way relating
to), the transactions contemplated hereby, including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to the Commitment Letter, the transactions
contemplated thereby or the performance thereof and the parties hereto agree
not to assert any such claim or bring any action, suit or proceeding in
connection with any such claim against any Financing Source or any of their
respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives or any of their respective past, present or future directors,
officers, employees, incorporators, members, partners, stockholders,
Affiliates, agents, attorneys or representatives.

Surviving Corporation Voting Common Stock.

 



 

6. _Share_ _Options and Other_ _Share_ _-Based Awards_. 

 



 

(a) Each Marigold Share Option that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall, as of the Merger
Effective Time, be assumed by New Holdco and become, as of the Merger
Effective Time, an option (a " _Marigold Exchange Option_ ") to purchase, on
the same terms and conditions (including applicable exercise and expiration
provisions but taking into account any acceleration of vesting as of the
Merger Effective Time provided for under the terms of the Marigold Incentive
Plans and award agreements thereunder applicable to such Marigold Share
Option) as applied to each such Marigold Share Option immediately prior to the
Merger Effective Time, shares of New Holdco Voting Common Stock, except that
(i) the number of shares of New Holdco Voting Common Stock subject to the
Marigold Exchange Option shall equal the product of the number of shares of
Marigold Common Stock that were subject to such Marigold Share Option
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time multiplied by the Marigold
Equity Award Exchange Ratio, with the result rounded down to the nearest whole
number and (ii) the per share exercise price of each such Marigold Exchange
Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price
per share at which such Marigold Share Option was exercisable immediately
prior to the Merger Effective Time by the Marigold Equity Award Exchange
Ratio, with the result rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) Each share of Marigold Restricted Shares and each right of any kind,

measured in whole or in part by the value of a number of shares of Marigold
Common Stock granted by Marigold outstanding immediately prior to the Merger
Effective Time (including restricted stock units, stock equivalent units,
phantom units, deferred stock units, stock equivalents and dividend
equivalents), other than Marigold Share Options (each, other than Marigold
Share Options, a " _Marigold Share-Based Award_ "), shall, as of the Merger
Effective Time, to the extent such Marigold Share-Based Award vests and its
vesting restriction lapse as of the Merger Effective Time in accordance with
its terms, vest and all time vesting restrictions shall lapse, and, in
exchange for the cancellation of such Marigold Share-Based Award, entitle the
holder to the Marigold Merger Consideration, plus any accrued, but unpaid
dividends and dividend equivalents with respect to each share of Marigold
Common Stock subject to the Marigold Share-Based Award (the " _Marigold Share-
Based Award Payment_ "). Any Marigold Share-Based Award that does not, by its
terms, vest and have all time-vesting restrictions lapse as of the Merger
Effective Time shall be referred to as the " _Marigold Rollover Share-Based
Awards_ ". The portion of any Marigold Share-Based Award Payment consisting of
Cash Consideration and unpaid dividends and dividend equivalents shall be made

Stock Consideration), through, to the extent applicable, the Marigold
Surviving Corporation's payroll on the next administratively practicable
regular payroll date (and in any event within 20 Business Days) following the
Merger Effective Time. Shares of New Holdco Voting Common Stock representing
the portion of the Marigold Share-Based Award Payment consisting of Stock
Consideration shall be issued and distributed by New Holdco to the former
holders of Marigold Share-Based Awards promptly following the Merger Effective
Time (and in any event within 20 Business Days). For the avoidance of doubt,
shares of Marigold Common Stock issued in connection with the settlement of
Marigold Share-Based Awards which vest on or prior to the Merger Effective
Time (including vested Marigold Restricted Shares) shall be treated in the
manner set forth in Section 5(a). Each Marigold Rollover Share-Based Award
shall be assumed by New Holdco and shall be subject to the same terms and
conditions, including applicable vesting conditions, as applied to each
Marigold Rollover Share-Based Award immediately prior to the Merger Effective
Time, except that the number of shares of New Holdco Voting Common Stock
relating to each Marigold Rollover Share-Based Award shall be equal to the
product of the number of shares of Marigold Common Stock that were subject to
such Marigold Rollover Share-Based Award immediately prior to the Merger
Effective Time multiplied by the Marigold Equity Award Exchange Ratio, with
the result rounded down to the nearest whole number.

lieu of such fractional shares equal to (i) the fraction of a share of New
Holdco Voting Common Stock, as applicable, to which such Marigold Shareholder

(a) Notice of the place, date and time of all meetings of shareholders
and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the
meeting is called, shall be communicated not fewer than ten (10) days nor more
than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each shareholder
entitled to vote at such meeting. The Board of Directors may establish a
record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice, as
provided in Section 3.5 of these Bylaws. Notice of adjourned meetings need
only be given if required by law or Section 3.7 of these Bylaws.

 



 

(b) In the event corporate action is taken without a meeting in accordance
with Section 3.12 of these Bylaws by less than unanimous written consent,
prompt notice of the taking of such corporate action shall be given to those
shareholders who have not consented in writing.

 



 

(c) If notice of proposed corporate action is required by law to be given
to shareholders not entitled to vote and the action is to be taken by consent
of the voting shareholders, the Corporation shall give all shareholders
written notice of the proposed action at least ten (10) days before the action
is taken. The notice must contain or be accompanied by the same material that
would have been required to be sent to shareholders not entitled to vote in a
notice of meeting at which the proposed action would have been submitted to
the shareholders for action.

 



 

(d) Notice may be communicated in person, by mail, or other method of
delivery, or by telephone, voice mail, or other electronic means. If these
forms of personal notice are impracticable, notice may be communicated by a
newspaper of general circulation in the area where published; or by radio,
television, or other form of public broadcast communication. Written notice by
the Corporation to its shareholders, if in a comprehensible form, is effective
according to one of the following: (i) upon deposit in the United States mail,
if mailed post-paid and correctly addressed to the shareholder's address shown
in the Corporation's current record of shareholders; or (ii) when
electronically transmitted to the shareholder in a manner authorized by the
shareholder.

or (ii) all, but not less than two, payments of dividends on securities during
a twelve month period, or two consecutive payments of dividends on securities
during a period of more than twelve months, have been sent to the shareholder
at such shareholder's address as shown on the records of the Corporation and
have been returned undeliverable. If any such shareholder shall deliver to the
Corporation a written notice setting forth such shareholder's then-current
address, the requirement that notice be given to such shareholder shall be
reinstated.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 3.4 _Waiver of Notice_.

 



 

(a) Any shareholder may waive any notice required by law or these Bylaws
if in writing and signed by any shareholder entitled to such notice, whether
before or after the date and time stated in such notice. Such a waiver shall
be equivalent to notice to such shareholder in due time as required by law or
these Bylaws. Any such waiver shall be delivered to the Corporation for
inclusion in the minutes or filing with the corporate records.

 



 

(b) A shareholder's attendance at a meeting, in person or by proxy, waives
(i) objection to lack of notice or defective notice of such meeting, unless
the shareholder at the beginning of the meeting or promptly upon the
shareholder's arrival objects to holding the meeting or transacting business
at the meeting, and (ii) objection to consideration of a particular matter at
the meeting that is not within the purpose or purposes described in the
meeting notice, unless the shareholder objects to considering the matter when
it is presented.

 



 

Section 3.5 _Record Date_. The Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a date
as the record date for any determination of shareholders for any purpose, such
date in every case to be not more than seventy (70) days prior to the date on
which the particular action or meeting requiring such determination of
shareholders is to be taken or held. If no record date is so fixed for the
determination of shareholders, the close of business on the day before the
date on which the first notice of a shareholders' meeting is communicated to
shareholders or the date on which the Board of Directors authorizes a share
dividend or a distribution (other than one involving a repurchase or
reacquisition of shares), as the case may be, shall be the record date for
such determination of shareholders. When a determination of shareholders
entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders has been made as provided in
this Section, such determination shall apply to any adjournment thereof,
unless the Board of Directors selects a new record date or unless a new record
date is required by law.

 



 

Section 3.6 _Shareholders ' List_. After fixing a record date for a meeting,
the Secretary shall prepare an alphabetical list of the names of all
shareholders who are entitled to notice of a shareholders' meeting. The list
must be arranged by voting group and within each voting group by class or
series of shares, and show the address of and number of shares held by each
shareholder. The shareholders' list must be available for inspection by any
shareholder beginning two (2) business days after notice of the meeting is
given for which the list was prepared and continuing through the meeting, at
the Corporation's principal office or at a place identified in the meeting
notice in the city where the meeting will be held. A shareholder, or a
shareholder's agent or attorney, is entitled on written demand to inspect and,
subject to the requirements of law, to copy the list, during regular business
hours and at the person's expense, during the period it is available for
inspection. The Corporation shall make the shareholders' list available at the
meeting, and any shareholder, or a shareholder's agent or attorney, is
entitled to inspect the list at any time during the meeting or any
adjournment.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 3.7 _Quorum_.

 



 

(a) At any meeting of the shareholders, a majority of the votes entitled
to be cast on the matter by a voting group constitutes a quorum of that voting
group for action on that matter, unless the representation of a different
number is required by law, and in that case, the representation of the number
so required shall constitute a quorum. If a quorum shall fail to attend any
meeting, the chairperson of the meeting or a majority of the votes present may
adjourn the meeting to another place, date or time.

 



 

(b) When a meeting is adjourned to another place, date or time, notice
need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the place, date and time thereof
are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken; provided,
however, that if the date of any adjourned meeting is more than one hundred
twenty (120) days after the date for which the meeting was originally noticed,
or if a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, notice of the
place, date and time of the adjourned meeting shall be given in conformity
with these Bylaws. At any adjourned meeting, any business may be transacted
which might have been transacted at the original meeting.

 



 

(c) Once a share is represented for any purpose at a meeting, it is deemed
present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and for any
adjournment thereof unless a new record date is or must be set for that
adjourned meeting.

 



 

Section 3.8 _Organization_.

 



 

(a) The President, or in the President's absence, such person as the Board

one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of shareholders.
Unless otherwise provided by law, directors shall be elected by a plurality of

other corporation is held by the Corporation. The foregoing does not limit the

form or by an electronic transmission that complies with Section 8.1 of these

meeting is the date the first shareholder signs such a written consent.
Written consents may be delivered to the Corporation by electronic

received by the Corporation prior to the receipt by the Corporation of

ARTICLE 9

 

 _INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES_

 



 

Section 9.1 _Right to Indemnification_. Each person who was or is a party or
is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that such person, or a
person of whom such person is the legal representative, is or was a director,
officer or employee of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as director, officer or employee of another corporation or of
a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service
with respect to employee benefit plans, shall be indemnified and held harmless
by the Corporation to the fullest extent consistent with the laws of Iowa as
the same now or may hereafter exist (but, in the case of any change, only to
the extent that such change authorizes the Corporation to provide broader
indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide
prior to such change) against all costs, charges, expenses, liabilities and
losses (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or
penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or
suffered by such person in connection therewith and such indemnification shall
continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer or employee
and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of
such person; provided, however, that the right to indemnification conferred in
this Section shall be conditioned upon the Corporation being afforded the
opportunity to participate directly on behalf of such person in such
proceeding and any settlement discussions relating thereto. The right to
indemnification conferred in this Section shall be a contract right and shall,
except with respect to an action or proceeding against the Corporation by an
employee who is neither a director nor an officer of the Corporation, include
the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any
such proceeding in advance of its final disposition upon receipt by the
Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such director, officer or
employee to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined
that the director, officer or employee is not entitled to be indemnified under
this Section or otherwise.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 9.2 _Right of Claimant to Bring Suit_. If a claim under Section 9.1 of
this Article is not paid in full by the Corporation within thirty days after a
written claim has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any
time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid
amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall
also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be
a defense to any action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for
expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final
disposition where the required undertaking has been tendered to the
Corporation) that the claimant has failed to meet a standard of conduct which
makes it permissible under Iowa law for the Corporation to indemnify the
claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall
be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its
Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its shareholders) to have
made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that
indemnification of the claimant is permissible in the circumstances because
such person has met such standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by
the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel,
or its shareholders) that the claimant has not met such standard of conduct,
nor the termination of any proceeding by judgment, order, settlement,
conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall create a
presumption that the claimant has failed to meet the required standard of
conduct.

 



 

Section 9.3 _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_. The right to indemnification and the
payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final
disposition conferred in this Article shall not be exclusive of any other
right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute,
provision of the Articles of Incorporation, bylaw, agreement, vote of
shareholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 9.4 _Insurance_. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its
expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
expense, liability or loss under Iowa law.

 



 

Section 9.5 _Expenses as a Witness_. To the extent that any director, officer
or employee of the Corporation is by reason of such position, or a position
with another entity at the request of the Corporation, a witness in any
proceeding, such person shall be reimbursed for all costs and expenses
actually and reasonably incurred in connection therewith.

 



 

Section 9.6 _Effect of Amendment_. Any amendment, repeal or modification of
any provision of this Article by the shareholders or the directors of the
Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director,
officer or employee of the Corporation existing at the time of such amendment,
repeal or modification.

 



 

Section 9.7 _Severability_. In the event any one or more of the provisions
contained in this Article shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability
shall not affect any other provisions of this Article.

 



 



 

ARTICLE 10

 

 _AMENDMENTS_

 



 

Section 10.1 _Amendments to Bylaws_. These Bylaws may be amended or repealed
by the Board of Directors or by the shareholders; provided, however, that the
shareholders may from time to time specify particular provisions of the Bylaws
which shall not be amended or repealed by the Board of Directors.

B. The preferences, limitations, and relative rights of the different

 _(1)_ _ _ _Preferred Shares_

 



 

(a) The Board of Directors is authorized, without shareholder action, to
classify or reclassify any or all of the unissued Preferred Shares from time
to time in one or more series and to provide for the designation, preferences,
limitations and relative rights of the shares of each series by the adoption
of Articles of Amendment to these Articles of Incorporation setting forth:

 



 

(i) The maximum number of shares in the series and the designation of the
series, which designation shall distinguish the shares thereof from the shares
of any other series or class;

 



 

(ii) Whether shares of the series shall have special, conditional or
limited voting rights, or no right to vote, except to the extent prohibited by
law;

 



 

(iii) Whether shares of the series are redeemable or convertible (x) at
the option of the Corporation, a shareholder or another person or upon the
occurrence of a designated event, (y) for cash, indebtedness, securities or
other property, and (z) in a designated amount or in an amount determined in
accordance with a designated formula or by reference to extrinsic data or

 

events;

 



 

(iv) Any right of holders of shares of the series to distributions,
calculated in any manner, including the rate or rates of dividends, and
whether dividends shall be cumulative, noncumulative or partially cumulative;

 



 

 



   



 

(v) The amount payable to holders of shares of the series in the event of
voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs
of the Corporation;

 



 

(vi) Any preference of the shares of the series over the shares of any
other series or class with respect to distributions, including dividends, and
with respect to distributions upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up
of the affairs of the Corporation; and

 



 

(vii) Any other preferences, limitations or specified rights (including a
right that no transaction of a specified nature shall be consummated while any
shares of such series remain outstanding except upon the assent of all or a
specified portion of such shares) now or hereafter permitted by the Virginia
Stock Corporation Act (as it exists on the date hereof or as it may be amended
from time to time, the " _VSCA_ ").

 



 

(b) Before the issuance of any shares of a series of Preferred Shares,
Articles of Amendment establishing such series shall be filed with and made
effective by the State Corporation Commission of Virginia, as required by the
VSCA.

 



 

(c) Each series of Preferred Shares shall be so designated as to
distinguish the shares thereof from the shares of all other series. Different
series of Preferred Shares shall not be considered to constitute different
voting groups of shares for the purpose of voting by voting groups except as
required by the VSCA or as otherwise specified by the Board of Directors with
respect to any series at the time of the establishment thereof.

 



 

 _(2) _ _Common Shares._

 

 _ _

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in the Articles of Amendment establishing
any series of Preferred Shares, the holders of outstanding Voting Common
Shares shall, to the exclusion of the holders of any other class of shares of
the Corporation, have the sole power to vote for the election of directors and
for all other purposes without limitation. Notwithstanding any provision in
the VSCA to the contrary, the holders of the Non-Voting Common Shares shall
not have any voting power with respect to the election of directors, the
adoption of any amendment to or restatement of these Articles, the
authorization of any plan of merger, share exchange or entity conversion or
the authorization of any disposition of assets or dissolution or for any other
purpose, and shall not have the right to participate in any meeting of
shareholders, except as may be required by the VSCA. In the event that the
approval of the holders of the Voting Common Shares shall be required by the
VSCA for the adoption of an amendment to or restatement of these Articles, the
authorization of any plan of merger, share exchange or entity conversion or
the authorization of any disposition of assets or dissolution, then, unless
the Board of Directors requires a greater vote, such approval shall require a
majority of all votes cast in respect thereof by holders of the Voting Common
Shares, in lieu of such vote as would otherwise be required by the VSCA, at a
meeting at which a quorum of the Voting Common Shares exists.

 



 

(b) Except as may be otherwise specifically provided in these Articles, in
all other respects, including, but not by way of limitation, the right to
receive the payment of cash dividends, the right to share in the property or
business of the Corporation in event of its liquidation in whole or in part,
and the right to share in the assets of the Corporation in event of its
dissolution and the distribution of such assets by way of return of capital,
each Voting Common Share and each Non-Voting Common Share shall rank equally
and be identical.

 



 

 



   



 

 _(3) _ _Other Rights._

 



 

(a) The holders of the Voting Common Shares and Non-Voting Common Shares
shall be treated equally, according to the number of Voting Common Shares or
Non-Voting Common Shares they hold, as applicable, in the payment of any share
dividend or other distribution of shares, but the holders of the Voting Common
Shares shall be issued only Voting Common Shares in respect of their shares of
Voting Common Shares in the payment of any such share dividend or
distribution, while the holders of the Non-Voting Common Shares shall be
issued only Non-Voting Common Shares in respect of their shares of Non-Voting
Common Stock in the payment of any such share dividend or other distribution
of shares.

 



 

(b) No holder of shares of any class of the Corporation shall, as such
holder, have any right to subscribe for or purchase (i) any shares of any
class of the Corporation, or any warrants, options or other instruments that
shall confer upon the holder thereof the right to subscribe for or purchase or
receive from the Corporation any shares of any class, whether or not such
shares, warrants, options or other instruments are issued for cash or services
or property or by way of dividend or otherwise, or (ii) any other security of
the Corporation that shall be convertible into, or exchangeable for, any
shares of the Corporation of any class or classes, or to which shall be
attached or appurtenant any warrant, option or other instrument that shall
confer upon the holder of such security the right to subscribe for or purchase
or receive from the Corporation any shares of any class or classes, whether or
not such securities are issued for cash or services or property or by way of
dividend or otherwise, other than such right, if any, as the Board of
Directors, in its sole discretion, may from time to time determine. If the
Board of Directors shall offer to the holders of shares of any class of the
Corporation, or any of them, any such shares, options, warrants, instruments
or other securities of the Corporation, such offer shall not, in any way,
constitute a waiver or release of the right of the Board of Directors
subsequently to dispose of other securities of the Corporation without
offering the same to said holders.

 



 

(c) (i) Subject to Section B(3)(c)(iii) of this Article II and Article
III, each Voting Common Share shall be convertible, at the option of the
holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share into one
fully paid and nonassessable Non-Voting Common Share; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such conversion shall not be permitted if, following and after giving
effect to such conversion, no Voting Common Shares would remain issued and
outstanding.

 



 

(ii) Subject to Section B(3)(c)(iii) of this Article II and Article III,
each Non-Voting Common Share shall be convertible, at the option of the holder
thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share into one fully
paid and nonassessable Voting Common Share.

 



 

 



   



 

(iii) To effect a conversion of Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting Common
Shares permitted by this Section B(3)(c) of this Article II, a holder of
Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares shall deliver to the transfer
agent for the Voting Common Shares or the Non-Voting Common Shares, as the
case may be, the certificate or certificates representing the Voting Common
Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares to be converted, duly endorsed in blank or
accompanied by duly executed proper instruments of conversion and transfer,
or, in the case of shares held in book-entry form, deliver written notice to
the transfer agent for the Voting Common Shares or the Non-Voting Common
Shares, as the case may be, with a copy to the Secretary of the Corporation at
its principal corporate office, stating that such holder elects to convert
such shares and stating the name or names of the person or persons in which
the shares issued upon such conversion are to be issued (and setting forth the
addresses of such persons), together with proper instruments of conversion and
transfer in accordance with the procedures of the transfer agent and The
Depository Trust Company or any successor depositary (" _DTC_ "), as
applicable. Subject to Article III, conversion shall be deemed to have been
effected at the time and date when the conversion is reflected in the books of
the transfer agent following compliance with the requirements described in the
immediately preceding sentence, as applicable, with respect to the shares to
be converted, and the person exercising such conversion (or, if the notice
specifies another person to whom shares are to be issued upon conversion, such
other person) shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the class and
number of shares issuable upon such conversion at such time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, if any such conversion should require the prior approval
from the Federal Communications Commission or any successor governmental
agency (the " _FCC_ "), such approval shall have been received prior to any
such conversion; and _provided further_ , that, if, as a result of such
requested conversion, the holder seeking conversion or any holder of Voting
Common Shares would acquire or be deemed to hold an interest subject to FCC
media ownership and qualifications reporting requirements (including without
limitation an "attributable interest" in the Corporation within the meaning of
Federal Communications Laws (as hereinafter defined)), the conversion shall
not become effective until the Corporation shall have requested and received,
pursuant to Section B of Article III, information sufficient in the
Corporation's reasonable judgment to determine whether to exercise its rights
under Section C of Article III with respect to the conversion and the
Corporation in its reasonable judgment shall have determined not to exercise
such rights. If a requested conversion would cause any holder other than the
converting holder (" _Other Holder_ ") to acquire or be deemed to hold an
attributable interest in the Corporation under the Federal Communications
Laws, the Corporation shall have the discretion to convert shares of Voting
Common Shares held by such Other Holders to Non-Voting Common Shares but only
to the extent reasonably necessary to ensure that such Other Holders will
remain non-attributable in the Corporation, _provided_ , _however_ , that (1)
each such Other Holder will be given prior written notice indicating the
number of shares of such Other Holder's Voting Common Shares that the
Corporation proposes to convert to Non-Voting Common Shares, (2) each such
Other Holder will be given a reasonable opportunity to make a showing that
such Other Holder may hold an attributable interest in the Corporation
consistent with the Federal Communications Laws, (3) at the request of any
such Other Holder, the proposed conversion to Non-Voting Common Shares shall
not be made with respect to such Other Holder if the showing required in the
preceding clause (2) is made to the reasonable satisfaction of the Corporation
and (4) the Corporation shall have no other authority in the circumstances set
forth in this subsection (c) to alter the Voting Common Stock holdings of any
such Other Holder without such Other Holder's prior written consent. As
promptly as practicable following any holder's conversion of Voting Common
Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares as aforesaid, the Corporation shall (1) in
the case of conversions of certificated Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting
Common Shares, issue and deliver to the converting holder, or to such holder's
transferee, as the case may be, one or more certificates (as such holder may
request) evidencing the Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares
issuable upon such conversion and if the certificates surrendered by the
converting holder evidence more Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting Common
Shares than the holder has elected to convert, one or more certificates (as
such holder may request) evidencing the Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting
Common Shares, as applicable, which have not been converted and (2) in the
case of conversions of book-entry Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting Common
Shares, cause the transfer agent to effect (directly or through DTC) a book-
entry deposit of Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares issuable
upon such conversion to the converting holder, or to such holder's transferee,
as the case may be. Subject to Article III, in the case of certificated Voting
Common Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares, after the conversion is reflected
in the books of the transfer agent and pending the issuance and delivery of
such certificates, the certificate or certificates evidencing the Voting
Common Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares that have been surrendered for
conversion shall be deemed to evidence the Non-Voting Common Shares or Voting
Common Shares, as applicable, issuable upon such conversion. Any dividends
declared and not paid on Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares
prior to their conversion as provided above shall be paid, on the payment
date, to the holder or holders entitled thereto on the record date for such
dividend payment notwithstanding such conversion, and no holder of Voting
Common Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares issued upon a conversion occurring
after a record date for a declared and unpaid dividend shall be entitled to
receive any payment of such dividend with respect to such Voting Common Shares
or Non-Voting Common Shares, as applicable. The Corporation shall at all times
reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued Voting Common
Shares and Non-Voting Common Shares, solely for the purpose of effecting the
conversions provided for in this Section B(3)(c) of this Article II, such
number of Voting Common Shares and such number of Non-Voting Common Shares,
respectively, as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect any
conversion provided for in this Section B(3)(c) of this Article II and shall
take all such corporate action as may be necessary to assure that such Voting
Common Shares and such Non-Voting Common Shares shall be validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable upon such conversion.

 



 

 



   



 

C. _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the shareholders of the
Corporation may be called solely by the Chairman of the Board of Directors,
the President of the Corporation or the Board of Directors.

 



 

D. _Control Share Acquisitions._ The provisions of Article 14.1 of the
VSCA shall not apply to acquisitions of shares of any class of capital stock
of the Corporation.

 



 

ARTICLE III

 



 

A. _Restrictions on Stock Ownership or Transfer._ As contemplated by this
Article III, the Corporation may restrict the ownership, conversion, or
proposed ownership, of shares of the Corporation by any person if such
ownership, conversion or proposed ownership, either alone or in combination
with other actual or proposed ownership (including due to conversion) of
shares of capital stock of any other person, would give rise to an FCC
Regulatory Limitation (as hereinafter defined). Ownership, conversion, or
proposed ownership shall be deemed to give rise to an " _FCC Regulatory
Limitation_ " if it (1) is inconsistent with, or in violation of, any
provision of the Federal Communications Laws (as hereinafter defined), (2)
materially limits or impairs or could reasonably be expected to materially
limit or impair any existing business activity or proposed business activity
of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries under the Federal Communications
Laws, (3) materially limits or impairs under the Federal Communications Laws
the acquisition of an attributable interest in a full-power television station
or a full-power radio station by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries
for which the Corporation or its subsidiary has entered into a definitive
agreement with a third party, (4) subjects or could reasonably be expected to
subject the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries to any rule, regulation,
order or policy under the Federal Communications Laws having or which could
reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the Corporation or any
subsidiary of the Corporation to which the Corporation or any subsidiary of
the Corporation would not be subject but for such ownership, conversion or
proposed ownership, or (5) requires prior approval from the FCC and such
approval has not been obtained. For purposes of Section B(3)(c)(iii) of
Article II and this Article III, the term " _Federal Communications Laws_ "
shall mean any law administered or enforced by the FCC, including, without
limitation, the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Communications
Act_ "), and the rules, regulations, orders and policies of the FCC. The
Corporation may, but is not required to, take any action permitted under this
Article III; and the grant of specific powers to the Corporation under this
Article III shall not be deemed to restrict the Corporation from pursuing,
alternatively or concurrently, any other remedy or alternative course of
action available to the Corporation.

 



 

 



   



 

B. _Requests for Information_. If the Corporation believes that the
ownership or proposed ownership of shares of the Corporation by any person
(whether by reason of a change in such person's ownership, a change in the
number of shares outstanding overall or in any class, or for any other reason)
may give rise to an FCC Regulatory Limitation or subject the Corporation to
FCC reporting requirements, such person shall furnish promptly to the
Corporation such information (including, without limitation, information with
respect to its citizenship, ownership structure, and other ownership interests
and affiliations) as the Corporation shall reasonably request.

 



 

C. _Denial of Rights, Refusal to Transfer_. (1) If (a) any person from
whom information is requested pursuant to Section B of this Article III does
not provide all the information requested by the Corporation completely and
accurately in a timely manner or (b) the Corporation shall conclude that a
person's ownership, conversion, or proposed ownership of, or that a person's
exercise of any rights of ownership with respect to, shares of the
Corporation, either alone or in combination with other existing or proposed
ownership of shares of any other person, would give rise to an FCC Regulatory
Limitation, then in the case of either clause (a) or any provision of clause
(b) of this Section C(1), the Corporation may (A) refuse to permit the
transfer to such proposed share owner or conversion by such person of shares
of the Corporation, (B) suspend those rights of share ownership the exercise
of which causes or could cause any situation described in any provision of
clause (b) of this Section C(1) to occur, (C) require the conversion of any or
all shares held by such holder into shares of any other class of shares in the
Corporation with equivalent economic value (it being understood that for such
purposes a Voting Common Share and a Non-Voting Common Share are deemed to
have an equivalent economic value), (D) require the exchange of any or all
shares held by such holder for warrants to acquire, at a nominal exercise
price, the same number and class of shares of the Corporation, (E) condition
the acquisition (including due to conversion) of such shares on the prior
consent of the FCC, to the extent such consent is required, (F) to the extent
that the remedies in the foregoing clauses (A) through (E) are not reasonably
feasible, redeem any or all such shares of the Corporation held by such holder
in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in Section C(2) of this
Article III, and/or (G) exercise any and all appropriate remedies, at law or
in equity, in any court of competent jurisdiction, against any such holder or
proposed holder, with a view towards obtaining such information or preventing
or curing any situation described in clause (a) or in any provision of clause
(b) of this Section C(1); _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent
reasonably feasible without materially adversely affecting the ability of the
Corporation to prevent or cure the situation described in clause (a) and/or
(b) of this Section C(1), the Corporation shall use its good faith efforts (x)
to cause any of the remedies listed in the preceding clauses (A) through (G)
to be imposed in a substantially similar manner when imposed on similarly
situated persons or stockholders at substantially the same time and (y) to
minimize the impact of the exercise of any such remedy on the interests in the
Corporation of the subject holders or persons or other shareholders of the
Corporation or other persons with an interest in the Corporation, subject in
all cases to the primary goal of preventing or curing any situation described
in clause (a) or any provision of clause (b) of this Section C(1); _provided_
, _further_ , that in the circumstances set forth in Section B(3)(c)(iii) of
Article II, the only remedy available to the Corporation with respect to Other
Holders will be the remedy set forth therein. Any such refusal of transfer or
suspension of rights pursuant to clause (A) or (B) of the immediately
preceding sentence shall remain in effect until the requested information has
been received and the Corporation has determined that such transfer, or the
exercise of such suspended rights, as the case may be, will not result in any
of the situations described in clause (b) of this Section C(1).

 



 

 



   



 

(2) Without limiting the foregoing, the terms and conditions of redemption
pursuant to Section C (1)(F) of this Article III shall be as follows:

 



 

(a) the redemption price of any shares of the Corporation to be redeemed
pursuant to Section C(1)(F) of this Article III shall be equal to the Fair
Market Value (as hereinafter defined) of such shares;

 



 

(b) the redemption price of such shares will be paid in cash;

 



 

(c) if less than all such shares are to be redeemed, the shares to be
redeemed shall be selected in such manner as shall be determined by the Board
of Directors in good faith, which may include selection first of the most
recently purchased shares thereof, selection by lot or selection in any other
manner determined by the Board of Directors in good faith;

 



 

(d) at least 15 days' prior written notice of the Redemption Date (as
hereinafter defined) shall be given to the record holders of the shares
selected to be redeemed (unless waived in writing by any such holder);
_provided_ _that_ the Redemption Date shall be the date on which written
notice shall be given to record holders if the cash necessary to effect the
redemption shall have been indefeasibly deposited in trust for the benefit of
such record holders and is then subject to immediate payment to them upon
surrender of the share certificates or compliance with DTC policies and
procedures for the redemption of book-entry securities for their redeemed
shares;

 



 

 



   



 

(e) from and after the Redemption Date, any and all rights of whatever
nature in respect of the shares selected for redemption (including, without
limitation, any rights to vote or participate in dividends declared on shares
(including declared and unpaid dividends) of the same class or series as such
shares), shall cease and terminate and the holders of such shares shall
thenceforth be entitled only to receive the cash payable upon redemption; and

 



 

(f) such other terms and conditions as the Board of Directors shall
determine in good faith.

 



 

(3) For purposes of this Section C:

 



 

(a) " _Fair Market Value_ " shall mean, with respect to a share of the
Corporation of any class or series, the volume weighted average sales price
for such a share on the national securities exchange (if any) on which such
capital stock is then listed during the 20 most recent days on which shares of
stock of such class or series shall have been traded preceding the day on
which notice of redemption shall be given pursuant to Section C(2)(d) of this
Article III; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such shares are not traded on
any national securities exchange, Fair Market Value shall mean the average of
the reported bid and asked prices in any over-the-counter quotation system
selected by the Corporation during the 20 most recent days during which such
shares were traded immediately preceding the day on which notice of redemption
shall be given pursuant to Section C(2)(d) of this Article III, or if trading
of such shares is not reported in any over-the-counter quotation system, Fair
Market Value shall be determined by the Board of Directors in good faith.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Non-Voting Common Share shall be deemed to
have a Fair Market Value equal to the Fair Market Value of a Voting Common
Share determined in accordance with the foregoing sentence.

 



 

(b) " _person_ " shall mean an individual, a corporation, a general or
limited partnership, an association, a limited liability company, a
governmental entity, a trust or other entity or organization.

 



 

(c) " _Redemption Date_ " shall mean the date fixed by the Board of
Directors for the redemption of any shares of the Corporation pursuant to or
on the date specified in Section C(2)(d) of this Article III, as the case may
be.

 



 

(4) The Corporation shall instruct the Corporation's transfer agent that
the shares of the Corporation are subject to the restrictions set forth in
this Article III and such restrictions shall be noted conspicuously on the
certificate or certificates representing such shares or, in the case of
uncertificated securities, contained in the notice or notices sent as required
by law or pursuant to the policies and procedures of DTC in the case of book-
entry securities.

 



 

D. _Authority of Board of Directors_. In the case of an ambiguity in the
application of any of the provisions of Section B(3)(c)(iii) of Article II or
this Article III, including any definition used herein, the Board of Directors
shall have the power to determine the application of such provisions with
respect to any situation based on its reasonable belief, understanding or
knowledge of the circumstances. In the event Section B(3)(c)(iii) of Article
II or this Article III permits any action by the Corporation but fails to
provide specific guidance with respect to such action, the Board of Directors
shall have the power to determine whether to take any action and the action to
be taken (if any) so long as such action is not contrary to the provisions of
Section B(3)(c)(iii) of Article II or this Article III. All such actions,
calculations, interpretations and determinations which are done or made by the
Board of Directors in good faith shall be conclusive and binding on the
Corporation and all other persons for all other purposes of Section
B(3)(c)(iii) of Article II and this Article III. The Board of Directors may
delegate all or any portion of its powers under Section B(3)(c)(iii) of
Article II and this Article III to a committee of the Board of Directors as it
deems necessary or advisable and, to the fullest extent permitted by the VSCA,
may exercise the authority granted by Section B(3)(c)(iii) of Article II and
this Article III through duly authorized officers or agents of the
Corporation. Nothing in Section B(3)(c)(iii) of Article II or this Article III
shall be construed to limit or restrict the Board of Directors in the exercise
of its fiduciary duties under the VSCA.

 



 

 



   



 

E. _Reliance_. To the fullest extent permitted by the VSCA, the
Corporation and the members of the Board of Directors shall be fully protected
in relying in good faith upon any information provided by any person pursuant
to Section B(3)(c)(iii) of Article II or this Article III (including, without
limitation, Section B of this Article III) and the information, opinions,
reports or statements prepared or presented by (1) one or more officers or
employees of the Corporation whom the Director believes, in good faith, to be
reliable and competent in the matters presented, (2) legal counsel, public
accountants, or other persons as to matters the Director believes, in good
faith, are within the person's professional or expert competence, or (3) a
committee of the Board of Directors of which he is not a member if the
Director believes, in good faith, that the committee merits confidence. The
members of the Board of Directors shall not be responsible for any good faith
errors made in connection therewith. For purposes of determining the existence
and identity of, and the amount of any shares of the Corporation owned by any
holder, the Corporation is entitled to rely on the existence or absence of
filings of Schedule 13D or 13G or Form 13F under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (or similar filings), as of any date, subject to its
actual knowledge of the ownership of shares of the Corporation.

 



 

F. _Severability_. If any provision of Section B(3)(c)(iii) of Article II
or this Article III or the application of any such provision to any person
under any circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of Section B(3)(c)(iii)
of Article II or this Article III or the application of such provision to any
other person.

 



 

ARTICLE IV

 



 

A. Every reference in this Article IV to a Director or Officer shall
include every Director or Officer or former Director or Officer of the
Corporation and every person who served at the request of the Corporation or
one of its subsidiaries as a Director, Officer, partner or trustee of any
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise, and, in all of such cases, his or her heirs, executors and
administrators. In addition, in this Article IV, the terms "applicant",
"expenses", "liability", "party", and "proceeding" shall have the respective
meanings set forth in Section 13.1-696 of the VSCA.

 



 

 



   



 

B. In any proceeding brought by or in the right of the Corporation or
brought by or on behalf of shareholders of the Corporation, no Director or
Officer of the Corporation shall be liable to the Corporation or its
shareholders for monetary damages with respect to any transaction, occurrence
or course of conduct, whether prior or subsequent to the effective date of
this Article IV, except for liability resulting from such person's having
engaged in willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the criminal law or
any federal or state securities law.

 



 

C. The Corporation shall indemnify (a) any person who was or is a party to
any proceeding, including a proceeding brought by a shareholder in the right
of the Corporation or brought by or on behalf of shareholders of the
Corporation, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a Director or
Officer of the Corporation, or (b) any Director or Officer who is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a Director, trustee, partner or
Officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee
benefit plan or other enterprise, against any liability incurred by him in
connection with such proceeding unless he or she engaged in willful misconduct
or a knowing violation of the criminal law. A person is considered to be
serving an employee benefit plan at the Corporation's request if his duties to
the Corporation also impose duties on, or otherwise involve services by, him
to the plan or to participants in or beneficiaries of the plan. The Board of
Directors is hereby empowered, by a majority vote of a quorum of disinterested
Directors, to enter into a contract to indemnify any Director or Officer in
respect of any proceedings arising from any act or omission, whether occurring
before or after the execution of such contract.

 



 

D. The provisions of this Article IV shall be applicable to all
proceedings commenced after the adoption hereof by the shareholders of the
Corporation, arising from any act or omission, whether occurring before or
after such adoption. No amendment or repeal of this Article IV shall have any
effect on the rights provided under this Article IV with respect to any act or
omission occurring prior to such amendment or repeal. The Corporation shall
promptly take all such actions, and make all such determinations, as shall be
necessary or appropriate to comply with its obligation to provide any
indemnity under this Article IV and shall promptly pay or reimburse all
reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred by any such Director
or Officer in connection with such actions and determinations or proceedings
of any kind arising therefrom.

 



 

E. The termination of any proceeding by judgment, order, settlement,
conviction or upon a plea of _nolo contendere_ or its equivalent, shall not of
itself create a presumption that the applicant did not meet the standard of
conduct described in Section B or C of this Article IV.

 



 

F. Any indemnification under Section C of this Article IV (unless ordered
by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the
specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the applicant is
proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard
of conduct set forth in Section C of this Article IV.

 



 

The determination shall be made:

 



 

(1) if there are two or more disinterested directors, by the Board of
Directors by a majority vote of disinterested directors, a majority of whom
shall constitute a quorum, or by a majority of the members of a committee of
two or more disinterested directors appointed by such a vote;

 



 

 



   



 

(2) by special legal counsel:

 



 

(a) selected by the Board of Directors or its committee in the manner
prescribed in Section F(1) of this Article IV; or

 



 

(b) if there are fewer than two disinterested directors, selected by the
Board of Directors, in which selection Directors who do not qualify as
disinterested directors may participate; or

 



 

(3) by the shareholders, but shares owned by or voted under the control of
a Director who at the time does not qualify as a disinterested director may
not be voted on the determination.

 



 

Any evaluation as to reasonableness of expenses shall be made in the same
manner as the determination that indemnification is appropriate, except that
if the determination is made by special legal counsel, such evaluation as to
reasonableness of expenses shall be made by those entitled under Section F(2)
of this Article IV to select counsel.

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event there has been a change in the
composition of a majority of the Board of Directors after the date of the
alleged act or omission with respect to which indemnification is claimed, any
determination as to indemnification and advancement of expenses with respect
to any claim for indemnification made pursuant to this Article IV shall be
made by special legal counsel agreed upon by the Board of Directors and the
applicant. If the Board of Directors and the applicant are unable to agree
upon such special legal counsel the Board of Directors and the applicant each
shall select a nominee, and the nominees shall select such special legal
counsel. If the nominees are unable to agree upon such special legal counsel,
such special legal counsel shall be selected upon application to a court of
competent jurisdiction.

 



 

G. (1) The Corporation shall pay for or reimburse the reasonable expenses
incurred by any applicant who is a party to a proceeding in advance of final
disposition of the proceeding or the making of any determination under Section
C of this Article IV if the applicant furnishes the Corporation:

 



 

(a) a written statement of his or her good faith belief that he or she has
met the standard of conduct described in Section C of this Article IV; and

 



 

(b) a written undertaking, executed personally or on his or her behalf, to
repay the advance if it is ultimately determined that he or she did not meet
such standard of conduct.

 



 

(2) The undertaking required by Section G(1)(b) of this Article IV shall
be an unlimited general obligation of the applicant but need not be secured
and may be accepted without reference to financial ability to make repayment.

 



 

 



   



 

(3) Authorizations of payments under this section shall be made by the
persons specified in Section F of this Article IV.

 



 

H. The Corporation may indemnify or contract to indemnify any person not
specified in Section B or C of this Article IV who was, is or may become a
party to any proceeding, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was an
employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise, to the same extent as if such person were specified as one to whom
indemnification is granted in Section C of this Article IV.

 



 

I. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance to indemnify it
against the whole or any portion of the liability assumed by it in accordance
with this Article IV and may also procure insurance, in such amounts as the
Board of Directors may determine, on behalf of any person who is or was a
Director, Officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving
at the request of the Corporation as a Director, Officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan
or other enterprise, against any liability asserted against or incurred by him
in any such capacity or arising from his or her status as such, whether or not
the Corporation would have power to indemnify him against such liability under
the provisions of this Article IV.

 



 

J. The indemnification hereby provided and provided hereafter pursuant to
the power hereby conferred by this Article IV on the Board of Directors shall
not be exclusive of any other rights to which any person may be entitled,
including any right under policies of insurance that may be purchased and
maintained by the Corporation or others, with respect to claims, issues or
matters in relation to which the Corporation would not have the power to
indemnify such person under the provisions of this Article IV. Such rights
shall not prevent or restrict the power of the Corporation to make or provide
for any further indemnity, or provisions for determining entitlement to
indemnity, pursuant to one or more indemnification agreements, bylaws, or
other arrangements (including, without limitation, creation of trust funds or
security interests funded by letters of credit or other means) approved by the
Board of Directors (whether or not any of the Directors of the Corporation
shall be a party to or beneficiary of any such agreements, bylaws or
arrangements); _provided, however_ , that any provision of such agreements,
bylaws or other arrangements shall not be effective if and to the extent that
it is determined to be contrary to this Article IV or applicable laws of the
Commonwealth of Virginia.

 



 

K. Each provision of this Article IV shall be severable, and an adverse
determination as to any such provision shall in no way affect the validity of
any other provision.

 



 

ARTICLE V

 



 

The Corporation shall have all of the powers of a corporation incorporated
under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia.

Article I 
Meetings of Shareholders

 



 



 

Section 1. _Place of Meetings_. Meetings of Shareholders shall be held at
the principal office of the Corporation in Richmond, Virginia or at such other
place, either within or without the Commonwealth of Virginia, as from time to
time may be fixed by the Board of Directors. The Board may, in its sole
discretion, permit Shareholders to participate in any meeting of Shareholders
by means of remote communication as authorized by the Virginia Stock
Corporation Act (as it exists on the date hereof or as it may be amended from
time to time, the " _VSCA_ ") and subject to any guidelines and procedures as
may be adopted by the Board.

 



 

Section 2. _Annual Meetings_. The Annual Meetings of Shareholders shall
be held on a date fixed by the Board of Directors.

 



 

Section 3. _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the Shareholders may
be called solely by the Chairman of the Board, the President or the Board of
Directors. At a special meeting of Shareholders, no business shall be
transacted and no corporate action taken other than that stated in the notice
of the special meeting.

 



 

Section 4. _Notice of Meetings_. Written notice stating the place, day
and hour of the meeting and, in case of a special meeting, the purpose or
purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be given not less than ten nor
more than 60 days before the date of the meeting (except as a different time
is specified in these Bylaws or by the VSCA) either personally or by mail, by
or at the direction of the Chairman of the Board, a Vice Chairman, the
Secretary, or the Officer or persons calling the meeting, to each Shareholder
of record entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be
deemed to be given when deposited in the United States mail addressed to the
Shareholder at his address as it appears on the stock transfer books of the
Corporation, with postage thereon prepaid. Without limiting the manner by
which notice otherwise may be given effectively to Shareholders, any notice to
a Shareholder given by the Corporation may be given by a form of electronic
transmission consented to by the Shareholder to whom the notice is given. Any
such consent shall be revocable by the Shareholder by written or electronic
notice to the Corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked (a) if the
Corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive
notices given by the Corporation in accordance with such consent and (b) such
inability becomes known to the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the
Corporation or to the transfer agent or other person responsible for the
giving of notice, _provided, however_ , the inadvertent failure to treat such
inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action.
For purposes of these Bylaws, "electronic transmission" means any form or
process of communication, not directly involving the physical transfer of
paper or other tangible medium that (i) is suitable for the retention,
retrieval and reproduction of information by the recipient, and (ii) is either
(A) retrievable in paper form by the recipient through an automated process
used in conventional commercial practice or (B) retrievable in perceivable
form and the sender and the recipient have consented in writing to the use of
such form of electronic transmission.

 



 

 



   



 

Notice of a Shareholders' meeting to act on an amendment of the Articles of
Incorporation, on a plan of merger or exchange of shares, on a sale of assets
of the Corporation that requires shareholder approval, a plan of
redomestication or conversion or the dissolution of the Corporation shall be
given, in the manner provided above, not less than 25 nor more than 60 days
before the date of the meeting. Any such notice shall be accompanied, as
appropriate, by such additional documents as may be required by law.

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a written waiver of notice signed by the person
or persons entitled to such notice, either before or after the time stated
therein, shall be equivalent to the giving of such notice. A Shareholder who
attends a meeting shall be deemed to have (A) waived objection to lack of
notice or defective notice of the meeting, unless at the beginning of the
meeting he or she objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at
the meeting, and (B) waived objection to consideration of a particular matter
at the meeting that is not within the purpose or purposes described in the
meeting notice, unless he or she objects to considering the matter when it is
presented.

 



 

Section 5. _Quorum_. A majority of the shares entitled to vote,
represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of
Shareholders; _provided however,_ that when any specified action is required
to be voted upon by a class of stock voting as a class or series, holders of a
majority of the shares of such class or series shall constitute a quorum for
the transaction of such specified action. If a quorum is present, action on a
matter is approved if the votes cast in favor of the action exceed the votes
cast opposing the action, except when a larger vote or a vote by class or
series is required by the VSCA and except that in elections of Directors those
receiving the greatest number of votes shall be deemed elected even though not
receiving a majority. Less than a quorum may adjourn, without notice other
than by announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall attend.

 



 

Section 6. _Organization and Order of Business_. At all meetings of the
Shareholders, the Chairman of the Board or, in the Chairman's absence, the
Vice Chairman (if any), the President (if one shall have been elected by the
Board) or, in the absence of all of the foregoing, the most senior Executive
Vice President, shall act as chairman of the meeting. In the absence of all of
the foregoing officers or, if present, with their consent, a majority of the
shares entitled to vote at such meeting, may appoint any person to act as
chairman. The Secretary of the Corporation or, in the Secretary's absence, an
Assistant Secretary, shall act as secretary at all meetings of the
Shareholders. In the event that neither the Secretary nor any Assistant
Secretary is present, the chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to
act as secretary of the meeting.

 



 

The chairman of the meeting shall have the right and authority to prescribe
such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts and things as
are necessary or desirable for the proper conduct of the meeting, including,
without limitation, the establishment of procedures for the dismissal of
business not properly presented, the maintenance of order and safety,
limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments on the affairs of
the Corporation, restrictions on entry to such meeting after the time
prescribed for the commencement thereof, the opening and closing of the voting
polls and any recess or adjournment of the meeting.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 7. _Voting_. A Shareholder may vote his or her shares in person
or by proxy. Any proxy shall be delivered to the secretary of the meeting at
or prior to the time designated by the chairman of the meeting or in the order
of business for so delivering such proxies. No proxy shall be valid after
eleven months from its date, unless otherwise provided in the proxy. Each
holder of record of stock of any class or series shall, as to all matters in
respect of which stock of such class or series has voting power, be entitled
to such vote as is provided in the Articles of Incorporation for each share of
stock of such class or series standing in the holder's name on the books of
the Corporation. Unless required by the VSCA or determined by the chairman of
the meeting to be advisable, the vote on any question need not be by ballot.
On a vote by ballot, each ballot shall be signed by the Shareholder voting or
by such Shareholder's proxy, if there be such proxy.

 



 

Section 8. _Written Authorization_. A Shareholder or a Shareholder's duly
authorized attorney-in-fact may execute a writing authorizing another person
or persons to act for him or her as proxy. Execution may be accomplished by
the Shareholder or such Shareholder's duly authorized attorney-in-fact or
authorized officer, director, employee or agent signing such writing or
causing such Shareholder's signature to be affixed to such writing by any
reasonable means including, but not limited to, by facsimile signature.

 



 

Section 9. _Electronic Authorization_. The President or the Secretary may
approve procedures to enable a Shareholder or a Shareholder's duly authorized
attorney-in-fact to authorize another person or persons to act for him or her
as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram,
cablegram, internet transmission, telephone transmission or other means of
electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or
to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent
duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive
such transmission, _provided_ that any such transmission must either be set
forth or submitted with information from which the inspectors of elections can
determine that the transmission was authorized by the Shareholder or the
Shareholder's duly authorized attorney-in-fact. If it is determined that such
transmissions are valid, the inspectors shall specify the information upon
which they relied. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable
reproduction of the writing or transmission created pursuant to this may be
substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any
and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used,
_provided_ that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction
shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or
transmission.

 



 

Section 10. _Advance Notice Provisions for Election of Directors_. Only
persons who are nominated in accordance with the following procedures shall be
eligible for election as Directors of the Corporation. Nominations of persons
for election to the Board of Directors may be made at any Annual Meeting of
Shareholders, or at any special meeting of Shareholders called for the purpose
of electing Directors, (a) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or
(b) by any Shareholder of the Corporation (i) who is a Shareholder of record
of Voting Common Shares in respect of which such nomination is made, and is
entitled to vote such shares, on the date of the giving of the notice provided
for in this section and on the record date for the determination of
Shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting and (ii) who complies with the
notice procedures set forth in this section.

 



 

 



   



 

In addition to any other applicable requirements, for a nomination to be made
by a Shareholder such Shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in
proper written form to the Secretary of the Corporation.

 



 

To be timely, a Shareholder's notice to the Secretary must be delivered to or
mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation (a)
in the case of an Annual Meeting, not earlier than the close of business on
the 120th and not later than the close of business on the 90th day prior to
the first anniversary of the preceding year's Annual Meeting; _provided,
however,_ that in the event that the date of the Annual Meeting is more than
30 days before or more than 60 days after such anniversary date, notice by the
Shareholder in order to be timely must be delivered not earlier than the close
of business on the 120th day prior to such Annual Meeting and not later than
the close of business on the 90th day prior to such Annual Meeting or, if the

business brought before the Annual Meeting in accordance with the procedures
set forth in this section; _provided, however,_ that once business has been
properly brought before the Annual Meeting in accordance with such procedures,
nothing in this section shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any
Shareholder of any such business. If the Chairman of an Annual Meeting
determines that business was not properly brought before the Annual Meeting in
accordance with the foregoing procedures, the Chairman shall declare to the
meeting that the business was not properly brought before the meeting, and
such business shall not be transacted. If the Shareholder or its proxy does
not appear at the meeting to present its proposed business, such proposed
business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies with respect to
such vote may have been received by the Corporation.

registered by a Registrar other than the Corporation itself or an employee of
the Corporation. In the event that any officer, transfer agent or registrar
whose signature or facsimile thereof shall have been used on a stock
certificate shall for any reason cease to be such officer, transfer agent or

Within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer of uncertificated
shares of the Corporation, the Corporation shall send, or cause to be sent, to
the holder a written statement that shall include the information required by
the VSCA to be set forth on certificates for shares of capital stock.

 



 

In case any Officer who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been

such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same
effect as if he were such Officer at the date of its issue.

 



 

Section 2. _Transfer Agents and Registrars_. Transfer Agents and/or
Registrars for the stock of the Corporation may be appointed by the Board of
Directors and may be required to countersign stock certificates.

by the Board of Directors for that purpose may in his discretion, cause one or
more new certificates for the same number of shares in the aggregate to be
issued to such Shareholder upon the surrender of the mutilated certificate or
upon satisfactory proof of such loss or destruction and the deposit of a bond

accompanied by a written power of attorney to have the same transferred on the
books of the Corporation. Uncertificated shares shall be transferable or

fix in advance a date as the record date for any such determination of
Shareholders, such date in any case to be not more than 70 days prior to the
date on which the particular action requiring such determination of
Shareholders is to be taken. If no record date is fixed for the determination
of Shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of Shareholders,
or Shareholders entitled to receive payment of a dividend, the date on which
the notice of the meeting is mailed or the date on which the resolution of the
Board of Directors declaring such dividend is adopted, as the case may be,
shall be the record date for such determination of Shareholders. When a
determination of Shareholders has been made as provided in this section with
respect to any meeting, such determination shall apply to any adjournment
thereof.

 _(1)_ _ _ _Preferred Shares_

 



 

(a) The Board of Directors is authorized, without shareholder action, to
classify or reclassify any or all of the unissued Preferred Shares from time
to time in one or more series and to provide for the designation, preferences,
limitations and relative rights of the shares of each series by the adoption
of Articles of Amendment to these Articles of Incorporation setting forth:

 



 

(i) The maximum number of shares in the series and the designation of the
series, which designation shall distinguish the shares thereof from the shares
of any other series or class;

 



 

(ii) Whether shares of the series shall have special, conditional or
limited voting rights, or no right to vote, except to the extent prohibited by
law;

 



 

(iii) Whether shares of the series are redeemable or convertible (x) at
the option of the Corporation, a shareholder or another person or upon the
occurrence of a designated event, (y) for cash, indebtedness, securities or
other property, and (z) in a designated amount or in an amount determined in
accordance with a designated formula or by reference to extrinsic data or

 

events;

 



 

(iv) Any right of holders of shares of the series to distributions,
calculated in any manner, including the rate or rates of dividends, and
whether dividends shall be cumulative, noncumulative or partially cumulative;

 



 

 



   



 

(v) The amount payable to holders of shares of the series in the event of
voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs
of the Corporation;

 



 

(vi) Any preference of the shares of the series over the shares of any
other series or class with respect to distributions, including dividends, and
with respect to distributions upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up
of the affairs of the Corporation; and

 



 

(vii) Any other preferences, limitations or specified rights (including a
right that no transaction of a specified nature shall be consummated while any
shares of such series remain outstanding except upon the assent of all or a
specified portion of such shares) now or hereafter permitted by the Virginia
Stock Corporation Act (as it exists on the date hereof or as it may be amended
from time to time, the " _VSCA_ ").

 



 

(b) Before the issuance of any shares of a series of Preferred Shares,
Articles of Amendment establishing such series shall be filed with and made
effective by the State Corporation Commission of Virginia, as required by the
VSCA.

 



 

(c) Each series of Preferred Shares shall be so designated as to
distinguish the shares thereof from the shares of all other series. Different
series of Preferred Shares shall not be considered to constitute different
voting groups of shares for the purpose of voting by voting groups except as
required by the VSCA or as otherwise specified by the Board of Directors with
respect to any series at the time of the establishment thereof.

 



 

 _(2) _ _Common Shares._

 

 _ _

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in the Articles of Amendment establishing
any series of Preferred Shares, the holders of outstanding Voting Common
Shares shall, to the exclusion of the holders of any other class of shares of
the Corporation, have the sole power to vote for the election of directors and
for all other purposes without limitation. Notwithstanding any provision in
the VSCA to the contrary, the holders of the Non-Voting Common Shares shall
not have any voting power with respect to the election of directors, the
adoption of any amendment to or restatement of these Articles, the
authorization of any plan of merger, share exchange or entity conversion or
the authorization of any disposition of assets or dissolution or for any other
purpose, and shall not have the right to participate in any meeting of
shareholders, except as may be required by the VSCA. In the event that the
approval of the holders of the Voting Common Shares shall be required by the
VSCA for the adoption of an amendment to or restatement of these Articles, the
authorization of any plan of merger, share exchange or entity conversion or
the authorization of any disposition of assets or dissolution, then, unless
the Board of Directors requires a greater vote, such approval shall require a
majority of all votes cast in respect thereof by holders of the Voting Common
Shares, in lieu of such vote as would otherwise be required by the VSCA, at a
meeting at which a quorum of the Voting Common Shares exists.

 



 

(b) Except as may be otherwise specifically provided in these Articles, in
all other respects, including, but not by way of limitation, the right to
receive the payment of cash dividends, the right to share in the property or
business of the Corporation in event of its liquidation in whole or in part,
and the right to share in the assets of the Corporation in event of its
dissolution and the distribution of such assets by way of return of capital,
each Voting Common Share and each Non-Voting Common Share shall rank equally
and be identical.

 



 

 



   



 

 _(3) _ _Other Rights._

 



 

(a) The holders of the Voting Common Shares and Non-Voting Common Shares
shall be treated equally, according to the number of Voting Common Shares or
Non-Voting Common Shares they hold, as applicable, in the payment of any share
dividend or other distribution of shares, but the holders of the Voting Common
Shares shall be issued only Voting Common Shares in respect of their shares of
Voting Common Shares in the payment of any such share dividend or
distribution, while the holders of the Non-Voting Common Shares shall be
issued only Non-Voting Common Shares in respect of their shares of Non-Voting
Common Stock in the payment of any such share dividend or other distribution
of shares.

 



 

(b) No holder of shares of any class of the Corporation shall, as such
holder, have any right to subscribe for or purchase (i) any shares of any
class of the Corporation, or any warrants, options or other instruments that
shall confer upon the holder thereof the right to subscribe for or purchase or
receive from the Corporation any shares of any class, whether or not such
shares, warrants, options or other instruments are issued for cash or services
or property or by way of dividend or otherwise, or (ii) any other security of
the Corporation that shall be convertible into, or exchangeable for, any
shares of the Corporation of any class or classes, or to which shall be
attached or appurtenant any warrant, option or other instrument that shall
confer upon the holder of such security the right to subscribe for or purchase
or receive from the Corporation any shares of any class or classes, whether or
not such securities are issued for cash or services or property or by way of
dividend or otherwise, other than such right, if any, as the Board of
Directors, in its sole discretion, may from time to time determine. If the
Board of Directors shall offer to the holders of shares of any class of the
Corporation, or any of them, any such shares, options, warrants, instruments
or other securities of the Corporation, such offer shall not, in any way,
constitute a waiver or release of the right of the Board of Directors
subsequently to dispose of other securities of the Corporation without
offering the same to said holders.

 



 

(c) (i) Subject to Section B(3)(c)(iii) of this Article II and Article
III, each Voting Common Share shall be convertible, at the option of the
holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share into one
fully paid and nonassessable Non-Voting Common Share; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such conversion shall not be permitted if, following and after giving
effect to such conversion, no Voting Common Shares would remain issued and
outstanding.

 



 

(ii) Subject to Section B(3)(c)(iii) of this Article II and Article III,
each Non-Voting Common Share shall be convertible, at the option of the holder
thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share into one fully
paid and nonassessable Voting Common Share.

 



 

 



   



 

(iii) To effect a conversion of Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting Common
Shares permitted by this Section B(3)(c) of this Article II, a holder of
Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares shall deliver to the transfer
agent for the Voting Common Shares or the Non-Voting Common Shares, as the
case may be, the certificate or certificates representing the Voting Common
Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares to be converted, duly endorsed in blank or
accompanied by duly executed proper instruments of conversion and transfer,
or, in the case of shares held in book-entry form, deliver written notice to
the transfer agent for the Voting Common Shares or the Non-Voting Common
Shares, as the case may be, with a copy to the Secretary of the Corporation at
its principal corporate office, stating that such holder elects to convert
such shares and stating the name or names of the person or persons in which
the shares issued upon such conversion are to be issued (and setting forth the
addresses of such persons), together with proper instruments of conversion and
transfer in accordance with the procedures of the transfer agent and The
Depository Trust Company or any successor depositary (" _DTC_ "), as
applicable. Subject to Article III, conversion shall be deemed to have been
effected at the time and date when the conversion is reflected in the books of
the transfer agent following compliance with the requirements described in the
immediately preceding sentence, as applicable, with respect to the shares to
be converted, and the person exercising such conversion (or, if the notice
specifies another person to whom shares are to be issued upon conversion, such
other person) shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the class and
number of shares issuable upon such conversion at such time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, if any such conversion should require the prior approval
from the Federal Communications Commission or any successor governmental
agency (the " _FCC_ "), such approval shall have been received prior to any
such conversion; and _provided further_ , that, if, as a result of such
requested conversion, the holder seeking conversion or any holder of Voting
Common Shares would acquire or be deemed to hold an interest subject to FCC
media ownership and qualifications reporting requirements (including without
limitation an "attributable interest" in the Corporation within the meaning of
Federal Communications Laws (as hereinafter defined)), the conversion shall
not become effective until the Corporation shall have requested and received,
pursuant to Section B of Article III, information sufficient in the
Corporation's reasonable judgment to determine whether to exercise its rights
under Section C of Article III with respect to the conversion and the
Corporation in its reasonable judgment shall have determined not to exercise
such rights. If a requested conversion would cause any holder other than the
converting holder (" _Other Holder_ ") to acquire or be deemed to hold an
attributable interest in the Corporation under the Federal Communications
Laws, the Corporation shall have the discretion to convert shares of Voting
Common Shares held by such Other Holders to Non-Voting Common Shares but only
to the extent reasonably necessary to ensure that such Other Holders will
remain non-attributable in the Corporation, _provided_ , _however_ , that (1)
each such Other Holder will be given prior written notice indicating the
number of shares of such Other Holder's Voting Common Shares that the
Corporation proposes to convert to Non-Voting Common Shares, (2) each such
Other Holder will be given a reasonable opportunity to make a showing that
such Other Holder may hold an attributable interest in the Corporation
consistent with the Federal Communications Laws, (3) at the request of any
such Other Holder, the proposed conversion to Non-Voting Common Shares shall
not be made with respect to such Other Holder if the showing required in the
preceding clause (2) is made to the reasonable satisfaction of the Corporation
and (4) the Corporation shall have no other authority in the circumstances set
forth in this subsection (c) to alter the Voting Common Stock holdings of any
such Other Holder without such Other Holder's prior written consent. As
promptly as practicable following any holder's conversion of Voting Common
Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares as aforesaid, the Corporation shall (1) in
the case of conversions of certificated Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting
Common Shares, issue and deliver to the converting holder, or to such holder's
transferee, as the case may be, one or more certificates (as such holder may
request) evidencing the Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares
issuable upon such conversion and if the certificates surrendered by the
converting holder evidence more Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting Common
Shares than the holder has elected to convert, one or more certificates (as
such holder may request) evidencing the Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting
Common Shares, as applicable, which have not been converted and (2) in the
case of conversions of book-entry Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting Common
Shares, cause the transfer agent to effect (directly or through DTC) a book-
entry deposit of Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares issuable
upon such conversion to the converting holder, or to such holder's transferee,
as the case may be. Subject to Article III, in the case of certificated Voting
Common Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares, after the conversion is reflected
in the books of the transfer agent and pending the issuance and delivery of
such certificates, the certificate or certificates evidencing the Voting
Common Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares that have been surrendered for
conversion shall be deemed to evidence the Non-Voting Common Shares or Voting
Common Shares, as applicable, issuable upon such conversion. Any dividends
declared and not paid on Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares
prior to their conversion as provided above shall be paid, on the payment
date, to the holder or holders entitled thereto on the record date for such
dividend payment notwithstanding such conversion, and no holder of Voting
Common Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares issued upon a conversion occurring
after a record date for a declared and unpaid dividend shall be entitled to
receive any payment of such dividend with respect to such Voting Common Shares
or Non-Voting Common Shares, as applicable. The Corporation shall at all times
reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued Voting Common
Shares and Non-Voting Common Shares, solely for the purpose of effecting the
conversions provided for in this Section B(3)(c) of this Article II, such
number of Voting Common Shares and such number of Non-Voting Common Shares,
respectively, as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect any
conversion provided for in this Section B(3)(c) of this Article II and shall
take all such corporate action as may be necessary to assure that such Voting
Common Shares and such Non-Voting Common Shares shall be validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable upon such conversion.

 



 

 



   



 

C. _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the shareholders of the
Corporation may be called solely by the Chairman of the Board of Directors,
the President of the Corporation or the Board of Directors.

 



 

D. _Control Share Acquisitions._ The provisions of Article 14.1 of the
VSCA shall not apply to acquisitions of shares of any class of capital stock
of the Corporation.

 



 

ARTICLE III

 



 

A. _Restrictions on Stock Ownership or Transfer._ As contemplated by this
Article III, the Corporation may restrict the ownership, conversion, or
proposed ownership, of shares of the Corporation by any person if such
ownership, conversion or proposed ownership, either alone or in combination
with other actual or proposed ownership (including due to conversion) of
shares of capital stock of any other person, would give rise to an FCC
Regulatory Limitation (as hereinafter defined). Ownership, conversion, or
proposed ownership shall be deemed to give rise to an " _FCC Regulatory
Limitation_ " if it (1) is inconsistent with, or in violation of, any
provision of the Federal Communications Laws (as hereinafter defined), (2)
materially limits or impairs or could reasonably be expected to materially
limit or impair any existing business activity or proposed business activity
of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries under the Federal Communications
Laws, (3) materially limits or impairs under the Federal Communications Laws
the acquisition of an attributable interest in a full-power television station
or a full-power radio station by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries
for which the Corporation or its subsidiary has entered into a definitive
agreement with a third party, (4) subjects or could reasonably be expected to
subject the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries to any rule, regulation,
order or policy under the Federal Communications Laws having or which could
reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the Corporation or any
subsidiary of the Corporation to which the Corporation or any subsidiary of
the Corporation would not be subject but for such ownership, conversion or
proposed ownership, or (5) requires prior approval from the FCC and such
approval has not been obtained. For purposes of Section B(3)(c)(iii) of
Article II and this Article III, the term " _Federal Communications Laws_ "
shall mean any law administered or enforced by the FCC, including, without
limitation, the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Communications
Act_ "), and the rules, regulations, orders and policies of the FCC. The
Corporation may, but is not required to, take any action permitted under this
Article III; and the grant of specific powers to the Corporation under this
Article III shall not be deemed to restrict the Corporation from pursuing,
alternatively or concurrently, any other remedy or alternative course of
action available to the Corporation.

 



 

 



   



 

B. _Requests for Information_. If the Corporation believes that the
ownership or proposed ownership of shares of the Corporation by any person
(whether by reason of a change in such person's ownership, a change in the
number of shares outstanding overall or in any class, or for any other reason)
may give rise to an FCC Regulatory Limitation or subject the Corporation to
FCC reporting requirements, such person shall furnish promptly to the
Corporation such information (including, without limitation, information with
respect to its citizenship, ownership structure, and other ownership interests
and affiliations) as the Corporation shall reasonably request.

 



 

C. _Denial of Rights, Refusal to Transfer_. (1) If (a) any person from
whom information is requested pursuant to Section B of this Article III does
not provide all the information requested by the Corporation completely and
accurately in a timely manner or (b) the Corporation shall conclude that a
person's ownership, conversion, or proposed ownership of, or that a person's
exercise of any rights of ownership with respect to, shares of the
Corporation, either alone or in combination with other existing or proposed
ownership of shares of any other person, would give rise to an FCC Regulatory
Limitation, then in the case of either clause (a) or any provision of clause
(b) of this Section C(1), the Corporation may (A) refuse to permit the
transfer to such proposed share owner or conversion by such person of shares
of the Corporation, (B) suspend those rights of share ownership the exercise
of which causes or could cause any situation described in any provision of
clause (b) of this Section C(1) to occur, (C) require the conversion of any or
all shares held by such holder into shares of any other class of shares in the
Corporation with equivalent economic value (it being understood that for such
purposes a Voting Common Share and a Non-Voting Common Share are deemed to
have an equivalent economic value), (D) require the exchange of any or all
shares held by such holder for warrants to acquire, at a nominal exercise
price, the same number and class of shares of the Corporation, (E) condition
the acquisition (including due to conversion) of such shares on the prior
consent of the FCC, to the extent such consent is required, (F) to the extent
that the remedies in the foregoing clauses (A) through (E) are not reasonably
feasible, redeem any or all such shares of the Corporation held by such holder
in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in Section C(2) of this
Article III, and/or (G) exercise any and all appropriate remedies, at law or
in equity, in any court of competent jurisdiction, against any such holder or
proposed holder, with a view towards obtaining such information or preventing
or curing any situation described in clause (a) or in any provision of clause
(b) of this Section C(1); _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent
reasonably feasible without materially adversely affecting the ability of the
Corporation to prevent or cure the situation described in clause (a) and/or
(b) of this Section C(1), the Corporation shall use its good faith efforts (x)
to cause any of the remedies listed in the preceding clauses (A) through (G)
to be imposed in a substantially similar manner when imposed on similarly
situated persons or stockholders at substantially the same time and (y) to
minimize the impact of the exercise of any such remedy on the interests in the
Corporation of the subject holders or persons or other shareholders of the
Corporation or other persons with an interest in the Corporation, subject in
all cases to the primary goal of preventing or curing any situation described
in clause (a) or any provision of clause (b) of this Section C(1); _provided_
, _further_ , that in the circumstances set forth in Section B(3)(c)(iii) of
Article II, the only remedy available to the Corporation with respect to Other
Holders will be the remedy set forth therein. Any such refusal of transfer or
suspension of rights pursuant to clause (A) or (B) of the immediately
preceding sentence shall remain in effect until the requested information has
been received and the Corporation has determined that such transfer, or the
exercise of such suspended rights, as the case may be, will not result in any
of the situations described in clause (b) of this Section C(1).

 



 

 



   



 

(2) Without limiting the foregoing, the terms and conditions of redemption
pursuant to Section C (1)(F) of this Article III shall be as follows:

 



 

(a) the redemption price of any shares of the Corporation to be redeemed
pursuant to Section C(1)(F) of this Article III shall be equal to the Fair
Market Value (as hereinafter defined) of such shares;

 



 

(b) the redemption price of such shares will be paid in cash;

 



 

(c) if less than all such shares are to be redeemed, the shares to be
redeemed shall be selected in such manner as shall be determined by the Board
of Directors in good faith, which may include selection first of the most
recently purchased shares thereof, selection by lot or selection in any other
manner determined by the Board of Directors in good faith;

 



 

(d) at least 15 days' prior written notice of the Redemption Date (as
hereinafter defined) shall be given to the record holders of the shares
selected to be redeemed (unless waived in writing by any such holder);
_provided_ _that_ the Redemption Date shall be the date on which written
notice shall be given to record holders if the cash necessary to effect the
redemption shall have been indefeasibly deposited in trust for the benefit of
such record holders and is then subject to immediate payment to them upon
surrender of the share certificates or compliance with DTC policies and
procedures for the redemption of book-entry securities for their redeemed
shares;

 



 

 



   



 

(e) from and after the Redemption Date, any and all rights of whatever
nature in respect of the shares selected for redemption (including, without
limitation, any rights to vote or participate in dividends declared on shares
(including declared and unpaid dividends) of the same class or series as such
shares), shall cease and terminate and the holders of such shares shall
thenceforth be entitled only to receive the cash payable upon redemption; and

 



 

(f) such other terms and conditions as the Board of Directors shall
determine in good faith.

 



 

(3) For purposes of this Section C:

 



 

(a) " _Fair Market Value_ " shall mean, with respect to a share of the
Corporation of any class or series, the volume weighted average sales price
for such a share on the national securities exchange (if any) on which such
capital stock is then listed during the 20 most recent days on which shares of
stock of such class or series shall have been traded preceding the day on
which notice of redemption shall be given pursuant to Section C(2)(d) of this
Article III; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such shares are not traded on
any national securities exchange, Fair Market Value shall mean the average of
the reported bid and asked prices in any over-the-counter quotation system
selected by the Corporation during the 20 most recent days during which such
shares were traded immediately preceding the day on which notice of redemption
shall be given pursuant to Section C(2)(d) of this Article III, or if trading
of such shares is not reported in any over-the-counter quotation system, Fair
Market Value shall be determined by the Board of Directors in good faith.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Non-Voting Common Share shall be deemed to
have a Fair Market Value equal to the Fair Market Value of a Voting Common
Share determined in accordance with the foregoing sentence.

 



 

(b) " _person_ " shall mean an individual, a corporation, a general or
limited partnership, an association, a limited liability company, a
governmental entity, a trust or other entity or organization.

 



 

(c) " _Redemption Date_ " shall mean the date fixed by the Board of
Directors for the redemption of any shares of the Corporation pursuant to or
on the date specified in Section C(2)(d) of this Article III, as the case may
be.

 



 

(4) The Corporation shall instruct the Corporation's transfer agent that
the shares of the Corporation are subject to the restrictions set forth in
this Article III and such restrictions shall be noted conspicuously on the
certificate or certificates representing such shares or, in the case of
uncertificated securities, contained in the notice or notices sent as required
by law or pursuant to the policies and procedures of DTC in the case of book-
entry securities.

 



 

D. _Authority of Board of Directors_. In the case of an ambiguity in the
application of any of the provisions of Section B(3)(c)(iii) of Article II or
this Article III, including any definition used herein, the Board of Directors
shall have the power to determine the application of such provisions with
respect to any situation based on its reasonable belief, understanding or
knowledge of the circumstances. In the event Section B(3)(c)(iii) of Article
II or this Article III permits any action by the Corporation but fails to
provide specific guidance with respect to such action, the Board of Directors
shall have the power to determine whether to take any action and the action to
be taken (if any) so long as such action is not contrary to the provisions of
Section B(3)(c)(iii) of Article II or this Article III. All such actions,
calculations, interpretations and determinations which are done or made by the
Board of Directors in good faith shall be conclusive and binding on the
Corporation and all other persons for all other purposes of Section
B(3)(c)(iii) of Article II and this Article III. The Board of Directors may
delegate all or any portion of its powers under Section B(3)(c)(iii) of
Article II and this Article III to a committee of the Board of Directors as it
deems necessary or advisable and, to the fullest extent permitted by the VSCA,
may exercise the authority granted by Section B(3)(c)(iii) of Article II and
this Article III through duly authorized officers or agents of the
Corporation. Nothing in Section B(3)(c)(iii) of Article II or this Article III
shall be construed to limit or restrict the Board of Directors in the exercise
of its fiduciary duties under the VSCA.

 



 

 



   



 

E. _Reliance_. To the fullest extent permitted by the VSCA, the
Corporation and the members of the Board of Directors shall be fully protected
in relying in good faith upon any information provided by any person pursuant
to Section B(3)(c)(iii) of Article II or this Article III (including, without
limitation, Section B of this Article III) and the information, opinions,
reports or statements prepared or presented by (1) one or more officers or
employees of the Corporation whom the Director believes, in good faith, to be
reliable and competent in the matters presented, (2) legal counsel, public
accountants, or other persons as to matters the Director believes, in good
faith, are within the person's professional or expert competence, or (3) a
committee of the Board of Directors of which he is not a member if the
Director believes, in good faith, that the committee merits confidence. The
members of the Board of Directors shall not be responsible for any good faith
errors made in connection therewith. For purposes of determining the existence
and identity of, and the amount of any shares of the Corporation owned by any
holder, the Corporation is entitled to rely on the existence or absence of
filings of Schedule 13D or 13G or Form 13F under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (or similar filings), as of any date, subject to its
actual knowledge of the ownership of shares of the Corporation.

 



 

F. _Severability_. If any provision of Section B(3)(c)(iii) of Article II
or this Article III or the application of any such provision to any person
under any circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of Section B(3)(c)(iii)
of Article II or this Article III or the application of such provision to any
other person.

 



 

ARTICLE IV

 



 

A. Every reference in this Article IV to a Director or Officer shall
include every Director or Officer or former Director or Officer of the
Corporation and every person who served at the request of the Corporation or
one of its subsidiaries as a Director, Officer, partner or trustee of any
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise, and, in all of such cases, his or her heirs, executors and
administrators. In addition, in this Article IV, the terms "applicant",
"expenses", "liability", "party", and "proceeding" shall have the respective
meanings set forth in Section 13.1-696 of the VSCA.

 



 

 



   



 

B. In any proceeding brought by or in the right of the Corporation or
brought by or on behalf of shareholders of the Corporation, no Director or
Officer of the Corporation shall be liable to the Corporation or its
shareholders for monetary damages with respect to any transaction, occurrence
or course of conduct, whether prior or subsequent to the effective date of
this Article IV, except for liability resulting from such person's having
engaged in willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the criminal law or
any federal or state securities law.

 



 

C. The Corporation shall indemnify (a) any person who was or is a party to
any proceeding, including a proceeding brought by a shareholder in the right
of the Corporation or brought by or on behalf of shareholders of the
Corporation, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a Director or
Officer of the Corporation, or (b) any Director or Officer who is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a Director, trustee, partner or
Officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee
benefit plan or other enterprise, against any liability incurred by him in
connection with such proceeding unless he or she engaged in willful misconduct
or a knowing violation of the criminal law. A person is considered to be
serving an employee benefit plan at the Corporation's request if his duties to
the Corporation also impose duties on, or otherwise involve services by, him
to the plan or to participants in or beneficiaries of the plan. The Board of
Directors is hereby empowered, by a majority vote of a quorum of disinterested
Directors, to enter into a contract to indemnify any Director or Officer in
respect of any proceedings arising from any act or omission, whether occurring
before or after the execution of such contract.

 



 

D. The provisions of this Article IV shall be applicable to all
proceedings commenced after the adoption hereof by the shareholders of the
Corporation, arising from any act or omission, whether occurring before or
after such adoption. No amendment or repeal of this Article IV shall have any
effect on the rights provided under this Article IV with respect to any act or
omission occurring prior to such amendment or repeal. The Corporation shall
promptly take all such actions, and make all such determinations, as shall be
necessary or appropriate to comply with its obligation to provide any
indemnity under this Article IV and shall promptly pay or reimburse all
reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred by any such Director
or Officer in connection with such actions and determinations or proceedings
of any kind arising therefrom.

 



 

E. The termination of any proceeding by judgment, order, settlement,
conviction or upon a plea of _nolo contendere_ or its equivalent, shall not of
itself create a presumption that the applicant did not meet the standard of
conduct described in Section B or C of this Article IV.

 



 

F. Any indemnification under Section C of this Article IV (unless ordered
by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the
specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the applicant is
proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard
of conduct set forth in Section C of this Article IV.

 



 

The determination shall be made:

 



 

(1) if there are two or more disinterested directors, by the Board of
Directors by a majority vote of disinterested directors, a majority of whom
shall constitute a quorum, or by a majority of the members of a committee of
two or more disinterested directors appointed by such a vote;

 



 

 



   



 

(2) by special legal counsel:

 



 

(a) selected by the Board of Directors or its committee in the manner
prescribed in Section F(1) of this Article IV; or

 



 

(b) if there are fewer than two disinterested directors, selected by the
Board of Directors, in which selection Directors who do not qualify as
disinterested directors may participate; or

 



 

(3) by the shareholders, but shares owned by or voted under the control of
a Director who at the time does not qualify as a disinterested director may
not be voted on the determination.

 



 

Any evaluation as to reasonableness of expenses shall be made in the same
manner as the determination that indemnification is appropriate, except that
if the determination is made by special legal counsel, such evaluation as to
reasonableness of expenses shall be made by those entitled under Section F(2)
of this Article IV to select counsel.

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event there has been a change in the
composition of a majority of the Board of Directors after the date of the
alleged act or omission with respect to which indemnification is claimed, any
determination as to indemnification and advancement of expenses with respect
to any claim for indemnification made pursuant to this Article IV shall be
made by special legal counsel agreed upon by the Board of Directors and the
applicant. If the Board of Directors and the applicant are unable to agree
upon such special legal counsel the Board of Directors and the applicant each
shall select a nominee, and the nominees shall select such special legal
counsel. If the nominees are unable to agree upon such special legal counsel,
such special legal counsel shall be selected upon application to a court of
competent jurisdiction.

 



 

G. (1) The Corporation shall pay for or reimburse the reasonable expenses
incurred by any applicant who is a party to a proceeding in advance of final
disposition of the proceeding or the making of any determination under Section
C of this Article IV if the applicant furnishes the Corporation:

 



 

(a) a written statement of his or her good faith belief that he or she has
met the standard of conduct described in Section C of this Article IV; and

 



 

(b) a written undertaking, executed personally or on his or her behalf, to
repay the advance if it is ultimately determined that he or she did not meet
such standard of conduct.

 



 

(2) The undertaking required by Section G(1)(b) of this Article IV shall
be an unlimited general obligation of the applicant but need not be secured
and may be accepted without reference to financial ability to make repayment.

 



 

 



   



 

(3) Authorizations of payments under this section shall be made by the
persons specified in Section F of this Article IV.

 



 

H. The Corporation may indemnify or contract to indemnify any person not
specified in Section B or C of this Article IV who was, is or may become a
party to any proceeding, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was an
employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise, to the same extent as if such person were specified as one to whom
indemnification is granted in Section C of this Article IV.

 



 

I. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance to indemnify it
against the whole or any portion of the liability assumed by it in accordance
with this Article IV and may also procure insurance, in such amounts as the
Board of Directors may determine, on behalf of any person who is or was a
Director, Officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving
at the request of the Corporation as a Director, Officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan
or other enterprise, against any liability asserted against or incurred by him
in any such capacity or arising from his or her status as such, whether or not
the Corporation would have power to indemnify him against such liability under
the provisions of this Article IV.

 



 

J. The indemnification hereby provided and provided hereafter pursuant to
the power hereby conferred by this Article IV on the Board of Directors shall
not be exclusive of any other rights to which any person may be entitled,
including any right under policies of insurance that may be purchased and
maintained by the Corporation or others, with respect to claims, issues or
matters in relation to which the Corporation would not have the power to
indemnify such person under the provisions of this Article IV. Such rights
shall not prevent or restrict the power of the Corporation to make or provide
for any further indemnity, or provisions for determining entitlement to
indemnity, pursuant to one or more indemnification agreements, bylaws, or
other arrangements (including, without limitation, creation of trust funds or
security interests funded by letters of credit or other means) approved by the
Board of Directors (whether or not any of the Directors of the Corporation
shall be a party to or beneficiary of any such agreements, bylaws or
arrangements); _provided, however_ , that any provision of such agreements,
bylaws or other arrangements shall not be effective if and to the extent that
it is determined to be contrary to this Article IV or applicable laws of the
Commonwealth of Virginia.

 



 

K. Each provision of this Article IV shall be severable, and an adverse
determination as to any such provision shall in no way affect the validity of
any other provision.

 



 

ARTICLE V

 



 

The Corporation shall have all of the powers of a corporation incorporated
under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia.
