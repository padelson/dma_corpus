2 ARTICLE II



 

CONVERSION OF JEFFERSON-PILOT COMMON STOCK;

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES



2.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Jefferson-Pilot Common Stock:



(a) _Conversion of Jefferson-Pilot Common Stock_. Each share of Jefferson-
Pilot Common Stock, par value $1.25 per share (the " _Jefferson-Pilot Common
Stock_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into, as provided in and subject to the limitations set
forth in this Agreement and the election and allocation procedures set forth
in this Section 2.1, the right to receive at the election of the holder
thereof as provided in this Section 2.1 (i) 1.0906 shares (the " _Exchange
Ratio_ ") of Lincoln Common Stock (the " _Stock Consideration_ "), or (ii)
$55.96 in cash (the " _Cash Consideration_ "). The shares of Lincoln Common
Stock and the cash into which the shares of Jefferson-Pilot Common Stock are
to be converted are collectively referred to herein as the " _Merger
Consideration_." At the Effective Time, each share of Jefferson-Pilot Common
Stock shall cease to be outstanding and cease to exist and each holder of such
shares shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such shares
except the right to receive shares of Lincoln Common Stock or cash in
accordance with this Section 2.1 and cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Lincoln Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.2(e).



(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Lincoln Owned Stock_. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, all shares of Jefferson-Pilot Common Stock that are owned by
Jefferson-Pilot as treasury stock or by Lincoln, but excluding any shares of
Jefferson-Pilot owned by any of their respective Subsidiaries (other than,
for the avoidance of doubt, trading account shares and trust account shares,
as each such term is defined in Section 3.1(b)) shall be canceled and retired
and shall cease to exist, and no stock of Lincoln and no other consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor.



(c) _Certain Adjustments_. If between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time: (i) the outstanding shares of Lincoln Common Stock shall have
been changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason
of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, combination or exchange of shares or any similar event, the Exchange
Ratio shall be correspondingly adjusted to the extent appropriate to reflect
such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination or exchange of shares or similar event; or (ii) the outstanding
shares of Jefferson-Pilot Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination
or exchange of shares or any similar event, the Exchange Ratio and the Cash
Consideration shall be correspondingly adjusted to the extent appropriate to
reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, combination or exchange of shares or similar event; it being understood
that nothing in the foregoing shall be deemed in any way to require an
increase or decrease in the Total Cash Amount.



 

3 (d) _Elections by Holders of Shares of Jefferson-Pilot Common Stock_. Subject
to the election and allocation procedures set forth in this Section 2.1, each
holder of shares of Jefferson-Pilot Common Stock shall be entitled with
respect to the shares of Jefferson-Pilot Common Stock held by such holder, to
(i) elect to receive the Stock Consideration for all or a portion of such
shares (a " _Stock Election_ ") or (ii) elect to receive the Cash
Consideration for all or a portion of such shares (a " _Cash Election_ ").



(e) _Certain Definitions_. The aggregate amount of Cash Consideration to be
paid to holders of Jefferson-Pilot Common Stock in the Merger (not including
cash in lieu of fractional shares) shall be $1,800,000,000 (the " _Total Cash
Amount_ ") and the total number of shares of Jefferson-Pilot Common Stock
to be converted into the right to receive the Total Cash Amount shall equal
the Total Cash Amount divided by the Cash Consideration (rounded down to the
nearest whole share, the " _Cash Conversion Number_ "). Shares of Jefferson-
Pilot Common Stock as to which a holder has elected to receive Cash
Consideration are referred to as " _Cash Election Shares_ ," and the aggregate
number of Cash Election Shares are referred to as the " _Cash Election
Number_." Shares of Jefferson-Pilot Common Stock as to which a holder has
elected to receive the Stock Consideration are referred to as " _Stock
Election Shares_." Shares of Jefferson-Pilot Common Stock as to which a valid
election has not been made pursuant to this Section 2.1 are referred to as "
_Non-Election Shares_."



(f) _Election Adjustments_. The allocation among the holders of Jefferson-
Pilot Common Stock of rights to receive the Stock Consideration or the
Cash Consideration in the Merger will be made as follows:



(i) _Number of Cash Election Shares Less Than or Equal to Cash Conversion
Number_. If the number of Cash Election Shares is less than or equal to the
Cash Conversion Number, then:



(A) each Cash Election Share will be, as of the Effective Time, converted
into the right to receive the Cash Consideration;



(B) the Exchange Agent will allocate from among the Non-Election Shares, pro
rata to the holders of Non-Election Shares in accordance with their respective
numbers of Non-Election Shares, a sufficient number of Non-Election Shares so
that the sum of such number and the number of Cash Election Shares equals the
Cash Conversion Number, and each such allocated Non-Election Share (each, a "
_Deemed Cash Election Share_ ") will be, as of the Effective Time, converted
into the right to receive the Cash Consideration; provided that if the sum of
all Non-Election Shares and Cash Election Shares is equal to or less than the
Cash Conversion Number, all Non-Election Shares will be Deemed Cash Election
Shares;



(C) if the sum of Cash Election Shares and Non-Election Shares is less than
the Cash Conversion Number, the Exchange Agent will allocate from among the
Stock Election Shares, pro rata to the holders of Stock Election Shares in
accordance with their respective numbers of Stock Election Shares, a
sufficient number of Stock Election Shares so that the sum of such number, the
number of all Cash Election Shares and the number of all Non-Election Shares
equals the Cash Conversion Number, and each such allocated Stock  



 

4  Election Share (each, a " _Converted Stock Election Share_ "), will be, as
of the Effective Time, converted into the right to receive the
Cash Consideration; and



(D) each Non-Election Share and Stock Election Share that is not a Deemed
Cash Election Share or a Converted Stock Election Share (as the case may be)
will be, as of the Effective Time, converted into the right to receive the
Stock Consideration; or



(ii) _Number of Cash Election Shares Greater Than Cash Conversion Number_. If
the number of Cash Election Shares is greater than the Cash Conversion Number,
then:



(A) each Stock Election Share and Non-Election Share will be, as of the
Effective Time, converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration;



(B) the Exchange Agent will allocate from among the Cash Election Shares, pro
rata to the holders of Cash Election Shares in accordance with their
respective numbers of Cash Election Shares, a sufficient number of Cash
Election Shares (each, a " _Converted Cash Election Share_ ") so that the
difference of (x) the number of Cash Election Shares less (y) the number of
the Converted Cash Election Shares equals the Cash Conversion Number, and each
Converted Cash Election Share will be, as of the Effective Time, converted
into the right to receive the Stock Consideration; and



(C) each Cash Election Share that is not a Converted Cash Election Share will
be, as of the Effective Time, converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration.



(g) _Exercise of Election_. All Cash Elections and Stock Elections shall be
made on a form designed for that purpose and mutually acceptable to Lincoln
and Jefferson-Pilot (a " _Form of Election_ ") and mailed to holders of record
of shares of Jefferson-Pilot Common Stock who are holders on the record date
for the Jefferson-Pilot Shareholders Meeting, together with the Joint Proxy
Statement / Prospectus (the " _Election Form Record Date_ "). Lincoln and
Jefferson-Pilot shall make available one or more Election Forms as may be
reasonably requested by all persons who become holders (or beneficial owners)
of Jefferson-Pilot Common Stock between the Election Form Record Date and the
Election Deadline. Elections shall be made by submitting to the Exchange
Agent a Form of Election. To be effective, a Form of Election must be properly
completed, signed and submitted to the Exchange Agent by a holder (or
beneficial owner) and accompanied by (i) Jefferson-Pilot Certificates
representing the shares of Jefferson-Pilot Common Stock as to which the Form
of Election relates, duly endorsed in blank or in form acceptable for transfer
on the books of Jefferson-Pilot (or accompanied by an appropriate guarantee
of delivery of such Jefferson-Pilot Certificates as set forth in such Form of
Election from a firm which is an "eligible guarantor institution" (as defined
in Rule 17Ad-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "
_Exchange Act_ ")); provided that such Jefferson-Pilot Certificates are in
fact delivered to the Exchange Agent by the time set forth in such guarantee
of delivery) or (ii) in the case of shares in book entry form, any
additional documents specified in the procedures set forth in the Form of
Election. Lincoln shall have the discretion, which it may delegate in whole or
in part to the Exchange Agent, to reasonably determine whether Forms of
Election have been properly completed, signed and submitted or revoked and to
disregard immaterial defects in Forms of Election. The decision of Lincoln (or
 



 

5  the Exchange Agent) in such matters shall be conclusive and binding. None of
Lincoln, Jefferson-Pilot or the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation
to notify any person of any defect in a Form of Election submitted to the
Exchange Agent. The Exchange Agent shall also make all computations
contemplated by this Section 2.1 and all such computations shall be conclusive
and binding on the holders and beneficial owners of Jefferson-Pilot Common
Stock.



(h)  _Election Deadline_. A properly signed and completed Form of Election
must be received by the Exchange Agent not later than the Election Deadline in
order to be effective. The " _Election Deadline_ " shall be the date that is
ten Business Days prior to the date that Lincoln and Jefferson-Pilot
estimate, in good faith, will be the Closing Date; provided, that, in the
event Lincoln and Jefferson-Pilot cannot agree on the estimated Closing Date,
the Election Deadline shall be the date that is 20 Business Days after the
date of the Jefferson-Pilot Shareholders Meeting. The Election Deadline shall
be publicly announced by Jefferson-Pilot and Lincoln by January 15, 2006,
unless otherwise agreed, but in no event less than twenty calendar days prior
to the estimated Closing Date. Any holder of Jefferson-Pilot Common Stock who
has made an election by submitting a Form of Election to the Exchange Agent
may at any time prior to the Election Deadline change such holders election
by submitting a revised Form of Election, properly completed and signed that
is received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. Any holder
of Jefferson-Pilot Common Stock may at any time prior to the
Election Deadline revoke his election by written notice to the Exchange Agent
received prior to the Election Deadline.



(i) _Deemed Non-Election Shares_. For the purposes hereof, a holder of
Jefferson-Pilot Common Stock who does not submit a Form of Election which
is received by the Exchange Agent on or prior to the Election Deadline shall
be deemed to hold Non-Election Shares. If Lincoln or the Exchange Agent shall
determine that any purported Cash Election or Stock Election was not properly
made, such purported Cash Election or Stock Election shall be deemed to be of
no force and effect and the shares subject to such election shall for all
purposes hereof be deemed to be Non-Election Shares.



2.2. _Exchange of Certificates_.



(a) _Exchange Agent_. As of the Effective Time, Lincoln shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by
Lincoln and reasonably acceptable to Jefferson-Pilot (the " _Exchange Agent_
"), for the benefit of the holders of certificates or evidence of shares in
book entry form which immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced
shares of Jefferson-Pilot Common Stock (collectively, the " _Jefferson-Pilot
Certificates_ "), for exchange in accordance with this Article II, (i)
certificates or, at Lincolns option, shares in book entry form (collectively
" _certificates_ ") representing the aggregate Stock Consideration issuable
pursuant to Section 2.1 in exchange for such shares of Jefferson-Pilot Common
Stock, and (ii) an amount in cash representing the aggregate Cash
Consideration to be paid pursuant to Section 2.1 in exchange for such shares
of Jefferson-Pilot Common Stock and any payments of cash in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to Section 2.2(e). Such Stock Consideration and cash so
deposited, together with any dividends or distributions with respect to the
Stock Consideration, are hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_."



 

6 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable following the Effective
Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail, to each holder of record of shares of
Jefferson-Pilot Common Stock (other than holders who properly made an election
to receive cash and/or shares of Lincoln Common Stock in accordance with
Section 2.1) as of the Effective Time, (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Jefferson-Pilot Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Jefferson-Pilot Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as the parties hereto may reasonably
specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Jefferson-Pilot Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares
of Lincoln Common Stock or the Cash Consideration. After the Effective Time,
with respect to properly made elections to receive Cash Consideration or Stock
Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1 or upon surrender of
a Jefferson-Pilot Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.2, together
with such letter of transmittal, each duly executed, and such other documents
as the Exchange Agent may reasonably require, the holder of such Jefferson-
Pilot Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a
certificate representing that number of whole shares of Lincoln Common Stock
or the Cash Consideration which such holder has the right to receive in
respect of the Jefferson-Pilot Certificate surrendered pursuant to the
provisions of this Article II, and the Jefferson-Pilot Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Jefferson-Pilot Common Stock which is not registered in
the transfer records of Jefferson-Pilot, a certificate representing the
proper number of shares of Lincoln Common Stock may be issued or, as
applicable, the Cash Consideration may be paid, to a transferee if the
Jefferson-Pilot Certificate representing such Jefferson-Pilot Common Stock is
presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid.



(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made with respect to Lincoln Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Jefferson-Pilot Certificate with respect to the shares of
Lincoln Common Stock represented thereby, nor the cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.2(e),
until the holder of such Jefferson-Pilot Certificate shall surrender such
Jefferson-Pilot Certificate in accordance with the procedures set forth in
this Article II. Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following the
surrender of any such Jefferson-Pilot Certificate in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Article II, the holder of such Jefferson-Pilot
Certificate shall be entitled to receive, in addition to the consideration set
forth in Section 2.1, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the
amount of any dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid (but withheld pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence) with respect to such whole shares of Lincoln Common Stock
which the holder of such Jefferson-Pilot Certificate is entitled to receive
hereunder, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior
to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect
to such whole shares of Lincoln Common Stock which the holder of such
Jefferson-Pilot Certificate is entitled to receive hereunder.



(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Jefferson-Pilot Common Stock_. All Cash
Consideration paid and all shares of Lincoln Common Stock issued
upon conversion of shares of Jefferson-Pilot Common Stock in accordance with
the terms hereof (including any cash paid  



 

7  pursuant to Section 2.2(e)) shall be deemed to have been paid or issued, as
applicable, in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares
of Jefferson-Pilot Common Stock; subject, however, to Lincolns obligation to
pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to
the Effective Time which may have been declared or made by Jefferson-Pilot on
such shares of Jefferson-Pilot Common Stock in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement on or prior to the Effective Time and which remain unpaid at
the Effective Time, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the stock transfer books of Lincoln of the shares of Jefferson-Pilot Common
Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Jefferson-Pilot Certificates are presented to
Lincoln for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in
this Article II.



(e) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Lincoln Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange
of Jefferson-Pilot Certificates evidencing Jefferson-Pilot Common Stock, and
such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or
to any rights of a shareholder of Lincoln. In lieu thereof, upon surrender of
the applicable Jefferson-Pilot Certificates, Lincoln shall pay each holder of
Jefferson-Pilot Common Stock an amount in cash equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (i) the fractional share interest to which such holder (after
taking into account all shares of Jefferson-Pilot Common Stock held at the
Effective Time by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (ii) the
closing price on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (" _NYSE_ "), as reported
on the Consolidated Tape at the close of the NYSE regular session of trading,
for a share of Lincoln Common Stock on the last trading day immediately
preceding the Effective Time.



(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger Consideration and
any dividends or other distributions as may be required pursuant to this
Article II in respect of the shares of Jefferson-Pilot Common Stock
represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates; provided,
however, that Lincoln may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition
precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Lincoln or the
Exchange Agent with respect to the certificates alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.



(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the shareholders of Jefferson-Pilot for six months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Lincoln, upon demand, and any
shareholders of Jefferson-Pilot who have not theretofore complied with this
Article II shall thereafter look only to Lincoln for payment, as applicable,
of their claim for Lincoln Common Stock, the Cash Consideration, any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Lincoln Common Stock and any dividends or
distributions with respect to Lincoln Common Stock.



(h) _No Liability_. Neither Lincoln nor Jefferson-Pilot shall be liable to
any holder of shares of Jefferson-Pilot Common Stock for shares of Lincoln
Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law.



 

8 (i) _Withholding_. Lincoln shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
shares of Jefferson-Pilot Common Stock such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of
state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
Lincoln, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Jefferson-Pilot
Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
Lincoln. The parties agree to cooperate with each other for purposes of
determining whether any taxes are required to be withheld with respect to the
Merger.

the " _Lincoln Contracts_ ") are valid and in full force and effect, except
to the extent they have previously expired in accordance with their terms or

necessary for the conduct of their respective business substantially as
currently conducted and as proposed to be conducted, except where such
failures to own or possess valid, subsisting and enforceable licenses to use
such Lincoln Intellectual Property, either individually or in the aggregate,
would not, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Lincoln. Neither Lincoln nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice
of infringement or conflict with, and to Lincolns knowledge, there are no
infringements of or conflicts with the rights of any third party with respect
to the use or ownership of any Lincoln Intellectual Property by Lincoln and

35  Sub was formed by Lincoln solely for the purpose of effecting the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except as contemplated

contemplated by this Agreement, except with respect to job eliminations or
terminations without cause occurring within two years of the Effective Time.

Third Party Consent shall be obtained with Lincolns participation,
cooperation and approval.

as reasonably practicable with regard to the approval of, new investment
advisory contracts with the applicable Jefferson-Pilot Adviser, all to the
extent required by, and consistent with all requirements of the Investment
Company Act applicable thereto; provided, however, that, except as set forth
in Section 4.1(o) of the Jefferson-Pilot Disclosure Letter, such new
investment advisory contracts shall be identical in all material respects to
the existing investment advisory contracts; (ii) for any Jefferson-Pilot Fund
for which a Jefferson-Pilot Broker-Dealer serves as principal underwriter or

company advisory clients of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and shall, in compliance with the Investment Advisers Act and any other
applicable law, request such clients consent as may be necessary to effect

supplemental procedure, in which case such different or supplemental
procedures must be followed), by providing each such client with the
notice contemplated by the first sentence of this Section 4.1(p) and
obtaining either a new investment advisory contract with such client effective
at the Closing Date or such clients consent in the form of an actual written
consent or in the form of an implied consent as permitted by law and

respective businesses in the usual, regular and ordinary course consistent
with past practice and use all reasonable efforts to preserve intact their

relationships with employees, customers, suppliers and others having business

and approval.

Stock to be issued in the Merger and (ii) Lincoln Common Stock to be reserved

contemplated hereby, Lincoln shall, and shall cause each Lincoln Adviser to,
use all reasonable efforts to solicit and obtain the approval of the board of
trustees, directors or similar governing body of any Lincoln Fund to: (i)
approve, and to solicit their respective shareholders as promptly as
reasonably practicable with regard to the approval of, new investment advisory
contracts with the applicable Lincoln Adviser, all to the extent required by,
and consistent with all requirements of the Investment Company Act applicable

Lincoln Disclosure Letter, such new investment advisory contracts shall be
identical in all material respects to the existing investment advisory
contracts; (ii) for any Lincoln Fund for which a Lincoln Broker-Dealer serves
as principal underwriter or distributor, approve a new principal underwriting
or distribution agreement with the applicable Lincoln Broker-Dealer, all to
the extent required by, and consistent with all requirements of the Investment
Company Act applicable thereto; provided, however, that, except as set forth
in Section 4.2(p) of the Lincoln Disclosure Letter, such new principal

clients of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall, in
compliance with the Investment Advisers Act and any other applicable law,
request such clients consent as may be necessary to effect the assignment of
their investment advisory agreements and any related agreements. Jefferson-
Pilot agrees that Lincoln may satisfy this obligation, insofar as it relates
to noninvestment company advisory clients (other than collective investment
arrangements managed by a Lincoln Adviser as to which the governing
instruments or applicable law require any different or supplemental procedure,
in which case such different or supplemental procedures must be followed), by
providing each such client with the notice contemplated by the first sentence
of this Section 4.2(q) and obtaining either a new investment advisory contract
with such client effective at the Closing Date or such clients consent in the
form of an actual written consent or in the form of an implied consent as
permitted by law and complying with any other legal requirements.



4.3. _Transition_. In order to facilitate the integration of the operations of
Jefferson-Pilot and Lincoln and their Subsidiaries and to permit the
coordination of their related operations on a timely basis, and in an effort
to accelerate to the earliest time practicable following the Effective Time
the realization of synergies, operating efficiencies and other benefits
expected to be realized by the parties as a result of the Merger, each of
Jefferson-Pilot and Lincoln shall, and shall cause its respective
Subsidiaries to, identify strategic and operational matters and consult and
cooperate with each other in connection therewith to the extent such
consultation and cooperation are not in violation of antitrust and other
applicable laws. Each of Jefferson-Pilot and Lincoln shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, make available to the other at its facilities and those
of its Subsidiaries, where reasonably determined by Lincoln or Jefferson-
Pilot, as the case may be, to be appropriate and necessary, office space in
order to assist it in observing all operations and reviewing, to the extent
not in violation of applicable laws, all matters concerning the affairs of the
other party. Without in any way limiting the provisions of Section 5.2,
Jefferson-Pilot and Lincoln, their respective Subsidiaries and their
respective officers, employees, counsel, financial advisors and other
representatives shall, upon reasonable notice to the other party, be entitled
to review the operations and visit the facilities of the other party and its
Subsidiaries at all times as may be deemed reasonably necessary by Lincoln or
Jefferson-Pilot, as the case may be, in order to accomplish the
foregoing arrangements, subject to antitrust and other applicable laws.



4.4. _Advice of Changes; Government Filings_. Each party shall confer on a
regular and frequent basis with the other, report on operational matters and
promptly advise the other orally and in writing of any change or event having,
or which would reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on
such party or which would cause or constitute a material breach of any of the
representations, warranties or covenants of such party contained herein;
provided, however, that any noncompliance with the foregoing shall not
constitute the failure to be satisfied of a condition set forth in Article VI
or give rise to any right of termination under Article VII unless the
underlying breach shall independently constitute such a failure or give rise
 



 

44  to such a right. Jefferson-Pilot and Lincoln shall file all reports required
to be filed by each of them with the SEC between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time and shall deliver to the other party copies of all
such reports promptly after the same are filed. Each of Jefferson-Pilot and
Lincoln shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each will consult with the other, in each case subject to
applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, with respect to all
the information relating to the other party, and any of their respective
Subsidiaries, which appears in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing
right, each of the parties hereto agrees to act reasonably and as promptly
as practicable. Each party hereto agrees that to the extent practicable it
will consult with the other party hereto with respect to the obtaining of all
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other party
apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby.



4.5. _Control of Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement (including Section 4.3) shall give Lincoln, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of Jefferson-Pilot
or shall give Jefferson-Pilot, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct the operations of Lincoln prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, each of Jefferson-Pilot and Lincoln shall exercise, consistent
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and
supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS



5.1. _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Shareholders Meetings_. (a) As promptly
as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, Lincoln and Jefferson-
Pilot shall cooperate in preparing and each shall cause to be filed with the
SEC mutually acceptable proxy materials which shall constitute the
proxy statement/prospectus relating to the matters to be submitted to the

Lincoln Common Stock in the Merger (such Form S-4, and any amendments or
supplements thereto, the " _Form S-4_ "). Lincoln and Jefferson-Pilot shall
each supply all such information as is necessary for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the registration statement on Form S-4 and the
Joint Proxy Statement / Prospectus, and such information, with respect to (A)
the Form S-4, at the time the Form S-4 becomes effective under the Securities
Act, and at the time of any post-effective amendment thereto, shall not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, and (B) the Joint Proxy Statement / Prospectus, at the
time the Joint Proxy Statement / Prospectus is first mailed to the
shareholders of Jefferson-Pilot and Lincoln, and at the time of the
Jefferson-Pilot  



 

45  Shareholders Meeting and the Lincoln Shareholders Meeting, shall not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. Each of Lincoln and Jefferson-Pilot shall use reasonable
best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective by the SEC and to keep
the Form S-4 effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and
the transactions contemplated thereby. Lincoln and Jefferson-Pilot shall, as
promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other party with
copies of any written comments and advise the other party of any oral comments
with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement / Prospectus or Form S-4 received
from the SEC. Each party shall cooperate and provide the other party with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Form S-4, and any
amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement / Prospectus or the Form
S-4 prior to filing such with the SEC, and each party will provide the other
party with a copy of all such filings made with the SEC. Each party shall use
its reasonable best efforts to take any action required to be taken under any
applicable state securities laws in connection with the Merger and each party
shall furnish all information concerning it and the holders of its capital
stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action. Each
party will advise the other party, promptly after it receives notice thereof,
of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective, the issuance of any stop
order, the suspension of the qualification of the Lincoln Common Stock
issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy
Statement / Prospectus or the Form S-4. If at any time prior to the Effective
Time any information relating to either of the parties, or their respective
affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by either party which
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or
the Joint Proxy Statement / Prospectus so that such documents would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other party hereto and, to the extent
required by law, rules or regulations, an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the shareholders of Jefferson-Pilot and Lincoln. All documents
that Lincoln and Jefferson-Pilot are responsible for filing with the SEC
in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will comply as to form and substance in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder.



(b) Jefferson-Pilot shall promptly take all lawful action to call, give
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders, such meeting to
take place as promptly as practicable following the date upon which the Form
S-4 becomes effective (the " _Jefferson-Pilot Shareholders Meeting_ ") for
the purpose of obtaining the Required Jefferson-Pilot Vote with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Board of Directors of
Jefferson-Pilot shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the
Jefferson-Pilot shareholders the Required Jefferson-Pilot Vote and shall
recommend to the Jefferson-Pilot shareholders that they vote to approve this
Agreement and the plan of merger contained herein; provided, however, that
Jefferson-Pilot shall not be obligated to make the foregoing recommendation to
the extent that the Board of Directors of Jefferson-Pilot reasonably
determines in good faith (upon advice of outside legal counsel) that
such failure to so recommend is required in order to comply with its
fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided, further, however, that
notwithstanding  



 

46  anything to the contrary in the foregoing, nothing contained in this
Agreement shall be deemed to relieve Jefferson-Pilot of its obligation to
submit this Agreement to its shareholders for a vote on the approval thereof.



(c) Lincoln shall promptly take all lawful action to call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders, such meeting to take place as
promptly as practicable following the date upon which the Form S-4 becomes
effective (the " _Lincoln Shareholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of
obtaining the Required Lincoln Vote with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Board of Directors of Lincoln shall use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the Lincoln shareholders the
Required Lincoln Vote and shall recommend to the Lincoln shareholders that
they vote to approve the issuance by Lincoln of shares of Lincoln Common Stock
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; provided, however, that Lincoln
shall not be obligated to make the foregoing recommendation to the extent that
the Board of Directors of Lincoln reasonably determines in good faith (upon
advice of outside legal counsel) that such failure to so recommend
is required in order to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable
law; provided, further, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to
relieve Lincoln of its obligation to submit this Agreement to its
shareholders for a vote on the approval thereof.



(d) Any disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act) made pursuant to Rule 14e-2(a) or 14d-9 shall be deemed to be a Change
in Jefferson-Pilot Recommendation or a Change in Lincoln Recommendation, as
the case may be, unless the Board of Directors of the party making such
disclosure expressly reaffirms its recommendation to its shareholders in favor
of approval of this Agreement.



(e) Jefferson-Pilot and Lincoln shall each use their reasonable best efforts
to cause the Jefferson-Pilot Shareholders Meeting and the Lincoln Shareholders
Meeting to be held on the same date.



 

5.2. _Access to Information_. (a) Upon reasonable notice, Jefferson-Pilot and
Lincoln shall each (and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to)
afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors
and other representatives of the other, access, during normal business hours
during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties,
books, contracts, records, commitments, officers and employees and, during
such period, each of Jefferson-Pilot and Lincoln shall (and shall cause each
of their respective Subsidiaries to) make available to the other (i) a copy of
each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or
received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of Federal or
state securities laws, or the HSR Act, state or insurance laws or the rules
and regulations of self regulatory organizations or the FCC (other than
reports or documents which such party is not permitted to disclose under
applicable law) and (ii) all other information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as such other party may reasonably request.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither party nor any of its Subsidiaries shall
be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access
or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of its customers,
jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the  



 

47  institution in possession or control of such information or contravene any
law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree or binding agreement entered
into prior to the date of this Agreement.



(b) The parties will hold any such information which is nonpublic in
confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions
of the Confidentiality Agreement dated July 7, 2005, between Jefferson-Pilot
and Lincoln (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which Confidentiality
Agreement will remain in effect as provided under Section 8.5.



(c) No such investigation by either Lincoln or Jefferson-Pilot shall affect
the representations and warranties of the other.



5.3. _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Each of Jefferson-Pilot and Lincoln shall,
and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, use all reasonable best

connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and (iii) to cooperate in connection with any financing transaction
undertaken by Lincoln to fund any portion of the Cash Consideration,
including, but not limited to, cooperation in the preparation and filing
of any registration statement or offering memorandum, the issuance of any
comfort letter, the receipt of any auditors consents, the delivery of
consolidated pro forma financial information and the use of commercially
reasonable efforts to cause each independent auditor to so cooperate;
provided, however, that a party shall not be obligated to take any action
pursuant to the foregoing if the taking of such action or such compliance or
the obtaining of such consent, authorization, order, approval or exemption
will result in such party being required to hold separate or to divest any of
its respective material businesses or assets, or will result in a condition or
restriction on such party or on the Surviving Corporation having an effect
of the type referred to in Section 6.1(f). Each of Jefferson-Pilot and
Lincoln will promptly cooperate with and furnish information to the other in
connection with any such efforts by, or requirement imposed upon, any of them
or any of their Subsidiaries in connection with the foregoing.



5.4.  _Acquisition Proposals_. (a) Each of Lincoln and Jefferson-Pilot agrees
that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and
directors of it or its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries employees, agents
and representatives (including any investment banker, attorney or accountant
retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the
making of any proposal or offer with respect to, or a transaction to effect, a
merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
it or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any purchase or sale of 10% or
more of the consolidated assets (including stock of its Subsidiaries) of it
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any purchase or sale of, or tender
or exchange offer for, its voting securities that, if consummated, would
result in any person (or the shareholders of such person) beneficially owning
securities representing 10% or more of its total voting power (or of the
surviving parent entity in such transaction) or the  



 

48  voting power of any of its Significant Subsidiaries (any such proposal,
offer or transaction (other than a proposal or offer made by the other party
to this Agreement or an affiliate thereof) being hereinafter referred to as
an " _Acquisition Proposal_ "), (ii) have any discussions with or provide any
confidential information or data to any person relating to an Acquisition
Proposal, or engage in any negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal,
or knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an
Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) approve, adopt or recommend, or propose to
approve, adopt or recommend, or execute or enter into, any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, asset purchase or share exchange
agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement related to any
Acquisition Proposal or propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.



(b) (i) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement, the Board of Directors of each party shall be permitted, prior to
its respective meeting of shareholders to be held pursuant to Section 5.1, and
subject to compliance with the other terms of this Section 5.4 and to first
entering into a confidentiality agreement with such initiating person, which
confidentiality agreement shall have provisions that are no less favorable to
such party than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, to engage
in discussions and negotiations with, and provide nonpublic information or
data to, any person that has made a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal that the Board of Directors of such party has determined in good
faith by majority vote, after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, (A) is, or is reasonably likely to be, a Superior
Proposal and (B) for which the failure to take such action in connection
therewith would cause it to violate its fiduciary duties under applicable
law; provided, that such party shall have delivered written notice to the
other party at least two Business Days in advance of taking any action
pursuant to this Section 5.4(b)(i).



(ii) Each party shall notify the other party promptly (but in no event later
than 24 hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any request for
nonpublic information relating to such party or any of its Subsidiaries by any
person that informs such party or any of its Subsidiaries that it
is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry
from any person seeking to have discussions or negotiations with such party
relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall be made orally
and confirmed in writing, and shall indicate the identity of the person
making the Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request and the material terms and
conditions of any inquiries, proposals or offers (including a copy thereof if
in writing and any related documentation or correspondence). Each party shall
also promptly, and in any event within 24 hours, notify the other party,
orally and in writing, if it enters into discussions or negotiations
concerning any Acquisition Proposal or provides nonpublic information or data
to any person in accordance with this Section 5.4(b) and keep the other party
informed of the status and terms of any such proposals, offers, discussions or
negotiations on a current basis, including by providing a copy of all
material documentation or correspondence relating thereto.



(c) Each of Lincoln and Jefferson-Pilot agrees that (i) it will and will cause
its Subsidiaries, and its and their officers, directors, agents,
representatives and advisors to, cease immediately and terminate any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any third parties
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) it
will not release any third party from, or waive any provisions of, any
confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party with respect to any Acquisition  



 

49  Proposal. Each of Lincoln and Jefferson-Pilot agrees that it will use
reasonable best efforts to promptly inform its and its Subsidiaries
respective directors, officers, key employees, agents and representatives of
the obligations undertaken in this Section 5.4.



(d) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal which the Board of Directors of Lincoln or
Jefferson-Pilot, as the case may be, concludes in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal advisor, taking
into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the
proposal and the person making the proposal (including any break-up fees,
expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation), (i) is more
favorable to the shareholders of Lincoln or Jefferson-Pilot, as the case may
be, from a financial point of view, than the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) is fully financed or
reasonably capable of being fully financed, reasonably likely to receive all
required governmental approvals on a timely basis and otherwise reasonably
capable of being completed on the terms proposed; provided, however, that, for
purposes of this definition of "Superior Proposal," the term Acquisition
Proposal shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 5.4(a),
except that the reference to "10% or more of its total voting power" in the
definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be a reference to "a
majority of its total voting power" and the reference to "10% or more of the
consolidated assets" shall be deemed to be a reference to "all or
substantially all of the consolidated assets" and "Acquisition Proposal" shall
only be deemed to refer to a transaction involving Lincoln or Jefferson-
Pilot, as the case may be.



5.5.  _Affiliates_. Jefferson-Pilot shall use all reasonable efforts to cause
each person who is an "affiliate" (for purposes of Rule 145 under the
Securities Act) to deliver to Lincoln, as soon as reasonably practicable and
in any event prior to the Jefferson-Pilot Shareholders Meeting, a written
agreement substantially in the form attached as Exhibit 5.5.



5.6. _Jefferson-Pilot Equity Awards_. (a) Except as provided in Section
5.6(b), at the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of
Jefferson-Pilot Common Stock (an " _Jefferson-Pilot Stock Option_ "), issued
pursuant to any Jefferson-Pilot Stock Plan shall be assumed by Lincoln and
shall become an option to acquire a number of shares of Lincoln Common Stock
determined by multiplying the number of shares of Jefferson-Pilot Common Stock
subject to such option by the Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole
share), with an exercise price determined by dividing the exercise price of
such option by the Exchange Ratio (rounding down to the nearest whole cent).
Except for the changes contemplated by this Section 5.6(a), the Jefferson-
Pilot Stock Options assumed by Lincoln shall remain subject to the same terms
and conditions as were in effect with respect to such awards immediately
prior to the Effective Time.



(b) To the extent any Jefferson-Pilot Stock Plan requires a different method
of assumption and conversion of any Jefferson-Pilot Stock Option as
contemplated by Section 5.6(a), the treatment of such award in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be governed by the
terms of the applicable Jefferson-Pilot Stock Plan; provided, however, that to
the extent such terms provide discretion with respect to the treatment of
such awards, Jefferson-Pilot shall only exercise such discretion with the
prior written consent of Lincoln, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld.



 

50 (c) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Lincoln shall deliver to
the holders of Jefferson-Pilot Stock Options appropriate notices setting
forth such holders rights pursuant to the Jefferson-Pilot Stock Plans.



(d) Lincoln shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance
a sufficient number of shares of Lincoln Common Stock for delivery
upon exercise of Jefferson-Pilot Stock Options assumed by it in accordance
with this Section 5.6. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
Lincoln shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 with respect to the
shares of Lincoln Common Stock that (i) are subject to such Jefferson-Pilot
Stock Options and (ii) may be registered on Form S-8, and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement for so long as such equity awards remain outstanding.



(e) Following the delivery to Lincoln of the Section 16 Information in a
timely fashion prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Lincoln,
or a committee of Non-Employee Directors thereof (as such term is defined for
purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall reasonably promptly
thereafter and in any event prior to the Effective Time adopt a resolution
providing that the receipt by the Jefferson-Pilot Insiders of Lincoln Common
Stock in exchange for shares of Jefferson-Pilot Common Stock, and of options
to purchase Lincoln Common Stock upon conversion of Jefferson-Pilot Stock
Options pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby and to the extent
such securities are listed in the Section 16 Information provided by
Jefferson-Pilot to Lincoln prior to the Effective Time, are intended to be
exempt from liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act such
that any such receipt shall be so exempt. " _Section 16 Information_ "
shall mean information accurate in all material respects regarding the
Jefferson-Pilot Insiders, the number of shares and description of terms of the
Jefferson-Pilot Common Stock held by each such Jefferson-Pilot Insider and the
number and description of terms of the Jefferson-Pilot Stock Options held by
each such Jefferson-Pilot Insider. " _Jefferson-Pilot Insiders_ " shall mean
those officers and directors of Jefferson-Pilot who are subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and who are
listed in the Section 16 Information.



(f) Prior to the Effective Time, Jefferson-Pilot shall take, or cause to be
taken, such action as shall be necessary so that (i) as of the Effective Time,
"phantom units" under the Jefferson-Pilot Deferred Fee Plan for Non-Employee
Directors will represent, and be payable in, shares of Lincoln Common Stock
rather than Jefferson-Pilot Common Stock (with the number of such Lincoln
phantom units credited to each participants account as of the Effective Time
determined by multiplying the number of Jefferson-Pilot phantom units in the
participants account as of the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio (rounded
up to the nearest whole share)), and (ii) to the extent any long-term
incentive compensation plan, agreement or guideline (other than the Jefferson-
Pilot Stock Options) provides for payment, in whole or in part, in shares of
Jefferson-Pilot Common Stock and such amounts have not been paid prior to
the Effective Time, as of the Effective Time such plan, agreement or
guideline shall provide for payment in Lincoln Common Stock).



5.7. _Fees and Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expense, except
as otherwise provided in Section 7.2  



 

51  and except that expenses incurred in connection with filing, printing and
mailing the Joint Proxy Statement / Prospectus and the Form S-4 shall
be shared equally by Lincoln and Jefferson-Pilot.



5.8.  _Governance_. (a) Effective upon the Effective Time, Lincoln shall take
all actions necessary to adopt the amendment to the Bylaws of Lincoln set
forth in Exhibit 1.7(a) hereof.



(b) On or prior to the Effective Time, Lincoln shall take or cause to be taken
such actions as are necessary to cause the persons indicated in Exhibit
5.8(b) to be elected or appointed to the offices and, by the affirmative vote
of not less than two-thirds of the directors of the full board as currently
constituted, the directorships of Lincoln specified in such Exhibit as of the
Effective Time.



5.9. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. (a) From and
after the Effective Time, Lincoln shall, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and provide advancement
of expenses to, each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the
date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer, director
or employee of Jefferson-Pilot or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified
Parties_ ") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities
or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of or in connection with
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation based in whole or in part
on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was
a director, officer or employee of Jefferson-Pilot or any Subsidiary of
Jefferson-Pilot, and pertaining to any matter existing or occurring, or any
acts or omissions occurring, at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time (including
matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) ("
_Indemnified Liabilities_ ") to the same extent such persons are indemnified
or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement
by Jefferson-Pilot pursuant to Jefferson-Pilots Articles of Incorporation,
Bylaws and indemnification agreements and resolutions, if any, in existence on
the date hereof with any directors, officers and employees of Jefferson-Pilot
and its Subsidiaries.



(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Lincoln shall
cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance maintained by Jefferson-Pilot (provided that
Lincoln may substitute therefor policies with a substantially comparable
insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to
claims arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective
Time; provided, however, that Lincoln shall not be obligated to make annual
premium payments for such insurance to the extent such premiums exceed 350% of
the premiums paid as of the date hereof by Jefferson-Pilot for such insurance
(" _Jefferson-Pilot s Current Premium_"), and if such premiums for such
insurance would at any time exceed 350% of Jefferson-Pilots Current Premium,
then Lincoln shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in
Lincolns good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available at
an annual premium equal to 350% of Jefferson-Pilots Current Premium. In the
event that Lincoln acts as its own insurer for its directors and officers
generally with respect to matters typically covered by a directors
and officers liability insurance policy, Lincolns obligations under this
Section 5.9(b) may be satisfied by such self-insurance, so long as Lincolns
senior debt ratings by Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investors
Services, Inc. are no lower than such ratings as in effect as of the date of
this Agreement.



 

52 (c) The provisions of this Section 5.9 (i) are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and
representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have
by contract or otherwise. 



5.10. _Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement, each of Lincoln and
Jefferson-Pilot shall coordinate with the other the payment of dividends with
respect to the Lincoln Common Stock and Jefferson-Pilot Common Stock and the
record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of
the parties hereto that holders of Lincoln Common Stock and Jefferson-Pilot
Common Stock shall not receive two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend,
for any single calendar quarter with respect to their shares of Lincoln Common
Stock and/or Jefferson-Pilot Common Stock or any shares of Lincoln Common
Stock that any such holder receives in exchange for such shares of Jefferson-
Pilot Common Stock in the Merger.



5.11. _Public Announcements_. Lincoln and Jefferson-Pilot shall use reasonable
best efforts (i) to develop a joint communications plan, (ii) to ensure that
all press releases and other public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint
communications plan, and (iii) except in respect of any announcement required
by applicable law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of any securities exchange, to consult with each other before issuing
any press release or, to the extent practical, otherwise making any public
statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby. In addition to the foregoing, except to the extent disclosed in or
consistent with the Joint Proxy Statement / Prospectus in accordance with the
provisions of Section 5.1, no party shall issue any press release or
otherwise make any public statement or disclosure concerning the other party
or the other partys business, financial condition or results of operations
without the consent of such other party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Each party shall provide the other party
with its shareholder lists and allow and facilitate the other partys contact
with its shareholders and prospective investors and following a Change in
Jefferson-Pilot Recommendation or Change in Lincoln Recommendation, as the
case may be, such contacts may be made without regard to the above limitations
of this Section 5.11.



5.12. _Additional Agreements_. In case any further action is necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving
Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals,
immunities and franchises of Jefferson-Pilot, the proper officers and
directors of each party to this Agreement shall take all such necessary
action.



5.13.  _Community Commitments_. Lincoln and Jefferson-Pilot each acknowledge
and agree that it is their intent that, after the Effective Time, Lincoln (or
its charitable foundation) will engage in charitable giving and other
charitable activities to the same or a greater degree as currently undertaken
by Lincoln. Without limiting the foregoing, after the Effective Time, Lincoln
(or its charitable foundation) shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
honor and fulfill all charitable commitments made by Jefferson-Pilot prior to
the date of this Agreement, provided such commitments do not exceed $2,500,000
in the aggregate or five years in duration, and (ii) each year for a period of
five years, engage in charitable giving in respect of the communities to
which Jefferson-Pilot currently gives, at a level equal to the greater of (x)
$2.5 million in aggregate per year or (y) the level determined using Lincolns
charitable giving formula.



 

53 5.14. _Tax Treatment_. Prior to and at the Effective Time, each party hereto
shall use its best efforts (including by delivering customary representations
required by each partys counsel to render its opinion described in Sections
6.2(c) and 6.3(c)) to cause the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and to obtain the opinion set forth
in Section 6.2(c) or 6.3(c), as the case may be.

failure to comply with Section 5.3 or any other provision of this Agreement
has been the cause of, or resulted in, such action;



(c) by either Lincoln or Jefferson-Pilot, upon written notice to the other
party, if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before the first
anniversary of the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that the right

lending rate prevailing at such time, as published in the Wall Street Journal,
from the date such amounts were required to be paid until the date actually
received by Jefferson-Pilot.



(c) Jefferson-Pilot shall pay Lincoln and Lincoln shall accept as its
exclusive remedy, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the sum of

following such termination; and if within twelve months of the date of such
termination of this Agreement, Jefferson-Pilot or any of its
Subsidiaries enters into any definitive agreement with respect to, or
consummates, any Acquisition Transaction, then Jefferson-Pilot shall pay the
remaining two-thirds of the Jefferson-Pilot Termination Fee upon the earlier
of the date of such execution or consummation.



If Jefferson-Pilot fails to pay all amounts due to Lincoln on the dates
specified, then Jefferson-Pilot shall pay all costs and expenses (including
legal fees and expenses) incurred by Lincoln in connection with any action or
proceeding (including the filing of any lawsuit) taken by it to collect such
unpaid amounts, together with interest on such unpaid amounts at the prime
lending rate prevailing at such time, as published in the Wall Street Journal,
from the date such amounts were required to be paid until the date actually
received by Lincoln. 



7.3. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any
time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the
Merger by the shareholders of Jefferson-Pilot or of Lincoln, but, after any

Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties hereto.



7.4. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party hereto,
(ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such
party. The failure of a party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement
or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights. No single or
partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, remedy, power or privilege. Any waiver shall be effective only in the
specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given and shall not

be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability and,
unless the effect of such invalidity or unenforceability would prevent the
parties from realizing the major portion of the economic benefits of the
Merger that they currently anticipate obtaining therefrom, shall not render
invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement
or affect the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of
this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement
is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be

ARTICLE I



Shareholders



Section 1\. _Annual Meeting._ An annual meeting of the shareholders shall be
held at such hour as shall be designated by the chief executive officer or the
board of directors on the fourth Wednesday of May, or such other date within
six months after the close of the fiscal year of the corporation as the chief
executive officer or the board of directors may select, in each year for the
purpose of electing directors for the terms hereinafter provided and for
the transaction of such other business as may properly come before the
meeting; except that no annual meeting need be held if all actions, including
the election of directors, required by the North Carolina Business Corporation
Act to be taken at an annual meeting of shareholders are taken by written
consent without a meeting pursuant to Section 12 of this Article. If the day
fixed for the annual meeting shall be a legal holiday, such meeting shall be
held on the next succeeding business day.



Section 2\. _Special Meetings._ Special meetings of the shareholders may be
called by the chief executive officer, by the board of directors, or by
shareholders holding not less than 10% of all votes entitled to be cast on any
issue to be considered at the special meeting who sign, date and deliver to
the secretary of the corporation one or more written demands for the meeting
describing the purpose or purposes for which it is to be held. Any such
written demand shall cease to be effective on the sixty-first day after the
date of signature appearing on the demand unless prior to the sixty-first day
enough written demands have been received from holders sufficient to call a
special meeting. The special meeting shall be held within 30 days after such
sufficient demands have been received. Only business within the purpose or
purposes described in the meeting notice may be conducted at a special
shareholders meeting.



Section 3\. _Place of Meetings._ All meetings of shareholders shall be held at
any place as may be specified in the respective notices, or waivers of
notice, of such meetings.



Section 4\. _Notice of Meetings._ A written or printed notice, stating the
place, day and hour of the meeting, and in the case of a special meeting or
when required by law or by the articles of incorporation or these bylaws, the
purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be delivered or
mailed by the secretary, or by the officer or persons calling the meeting, no
fewer than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before    the date of the meeting, to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at
such meeting at such address as appears upon the stock records of the
corporation. 



Section 5\. _Waiver of Notice._ Notice of any meeting of shareholders may be
waived in writing by any shareholder if the waiver sets forth in reasonable
detail the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called and the time
and place thereof. Attendance at any meeting in person, or by proxy when the
instrument of proxy sets forth in reasonable detail the purpose or purposes
for which the meeting is called, shall constitute a waiver of notice of such
meeting.



Section 6\. _Adjourned Meetings._ At any adjourned meeting at which a quorum
shall be represented, any business may be transacted as might have been
transacted at the meeting as originally notified. If a new record date is or
must be established pursuant to law, notice of the adjourned meeting must be
given to persons who are shareholders as of the new record date.



Section 7\. _Record Date._ For the purpose of determining shareholders
entitled to notice of a shareholders meeting, to demand a special meeting, to
vote, to receive payment of any dividend or in order to make a determination
of shareholders for any other proper purpose, the board of directors may
provide by resolution that the stock transfer books shall be closed for a
stated period, but not to exceed, in any case, seventy (70) days, or may fix
in advance a record date for such purpose, such date in any case to be not
more than seventy (70) days prior to the date on which the action requiring
such determination of shareholders is to be taken.



Section 8\. _Voting at Shareholders  Meetings._



Subsection 1. _Voting Rights._ Unless otherwise provided by the articles of
incorporation or by these bylaws or by law, every shareholder shall have the
right at every shareholders meeting to one vote for each share standing in
his or her name on the books of the corporation on the date established by the
board of directors as the record date for determination of shareholders
entitled to vote at such meeting; provided that if such date is not
established by the board of directors, such date shall be the close of
business on the day before the first notice is delivered to shareholders. Any
shareholder acquiring title to a share after the record date has been
established shall upon written request to the shareholder of record be
entitled to receive from the shareholder of record a proxy, with power of
substitution, to vote that share.

 



Subsection 2. _Prohibition Against Voting Shares._  No share shall be voted
at any meeting:



(a) upon which any installment is due and unpaid; or



(b) which belongs to this corporation.



 

2 Subsection 3. _Voting of Shares Owned by Corporations and Fiduciaries._ Shares
of this corporation standing in the name of another corporation may be voted
by such officer, agent or proxy as the board of directors of such other
corporation may appoint, or as the bylaws of such other corporation may
prescribe. Shares held by fiduciaries may be voted by the fiduciaries in such
manner as the instrument or order appointing such fiduciaries may direct. In
the absence of such direction, or the inability of the fiduciaries to act in
accordance therewith, the following provisions shall apply:



(a) where shares are held jointly by three (3) or more fiduciaries, such
shares shall be voted in accordance with the will of the majority;



(b) where the fiduciaries, or a majority of them, cannot agree, or where they
are equally divided upon the question of voting such shares, any court
of general equity jurisdiction may, upon petition filed by any of such
fiduciaries, or by any party in interest, direct the voting of such shares as
it may deem to be for the best interests of the beneficiaries, and such shares
shall be voted in accordance with such direction.



Subsection 4.  _Voting of Jointly Held Shares._ Shares issued and held in the
name of two or more persons shall be voted in accordance with the will of the
majority, and if a majority of them cannot agree, or if they are equally
divided as to the voting of such shares, the shares shall be divided equally
between or among such persons for voting purposes.



Subsection 5. _Proxies._ A shareholder may vote either in person or by proxy
executed in writing by the shareholder or a duly authorized attorney-in-fact.
No proxy shall be valid after eleven (11) months from the date of its
execution, unless a longer time is expressly provided therein.



Section 9\. _Order of Business._ The order of business at each shareholders
meeting shall be established by the person presiding at the meeting.



Section 10.  _Quorum._ Unless otherwise provided by the articles of
incorporation or by these bylaws, at any meeting of shareholders a majority of
the outstanding shares entitled to vote at such meeting, represented in person
or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum. If less than a majority of such
shares are represented at a meeting, a majority of the shares so represented
may adjourn the meeting from time to time. The shareholders present at a duly
organized meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment,
notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a
quorum.



Section 11\. _Required Votes._ A majority of the votes entitled to vote on a
matter represented at a meeting of shareholders at which a quorum is present
shall be required to take action on the matter, except for elections of
directors which shall  



 

3  require a plurality of votes, unless a different number is required by the
articles of incorporation, these bylaws, or by law.



Section 12\. _Action Without Meeting._ Any action required by law to be taken
at a meeting of shareholders, or any action which may be taken at a meeting of
shareholders, may be taken without a meeting if a consent in writing setting
forth the action to be taken shall be signed by all of the shareholders
entitled to vote with respect to the subject matter thereof, and such written
consent is filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the shareholders.



Section 13\. _Meeting by Conference Call._ Any or all shareholders may
participate in any meeting of shareholders by, or through the use of,
any means of communication by which all shareholders participating may
simultaneously hear each other during the meeting.



ARTICLE II



Board of Directors



Section 1\. _Number, Election and Term of Directors._ The business of the
corporation shall be managed by a board of directors composed of not less than
one nor more than thirty (30) members. The number of directors to serve for
each year shall be determined from time to time by the board of directors. The
directors shall be elected annually by the shareholders by a plurality of
votes, each for a term of one year, and shall hold office until the next
annual meeting of shareholders and until a successor, if any, has been
elected and has qualified or until his earlier death, resignation or removal.



Section 2\. _Regular Meetings._ A regular meeting of the board of directors
shall be held without other notice than this bylaw immediately after, and at
the same place as, the annual meeting of shareholders, or within thirty days
thereafter upon notice in the manner provided by these bylaws for calling
special meetings of the board. The board of directors may provide by
resolution the time and place for the holding of additional regular meetings
without other notice than such resolution. In lieu of a regular meeting of the
board of directors, any action required or permitted to be taken therein may
be taken without a meeting in the manner described in Section 10 of this
Article.



Section 3\. _Special Meetings._ Special meetings of the board of directors may
be called by the chairperson of the board, or in his absence or incapacity or
if such office is vacant, by the president. The secretary shall call special
meetings of the board of directors when requested in writing to do so by any
member thereof. All special meetings of the board of directors shall be held
at the principal office of the corporation or at such other place as may be
specified in the respective notices, or waivers of notice, of such meetings.



 

4 Section 4\. _Notice of Meetings._ Unless otherwise provided by these bylaws,
notice of any meeting of the board of directors shall be given not less than

corporation.



Section 5\. _Waiver of Notice._ A director may sign a written waiver of notice
either before the time of the meeting, at the time of the meeting or after
the time of the meeting, if the waiver sets forth in reasonable detail the
purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called and the time and place
thereof. A directors attendance at, or participation in, a meeting waives
any required notice to the director of the meeting.



Section 6\. _Vacancies._ Unless otherwise provided in the articles of
incorporation, any vacancy occurring in the membership of the board of
directors caused by an increase in the number of directors, death,
resignation, disqualification, removal or otherwise, may be filled by a
majority vote of the remaining members of the board, though less than a
quorum, for a term of office which expires at the end of the term for which
the predecessor was elected, or, at the discretion of the board of directors,
such vacancy may be filled by a vote of the shareholders.



Section 7\. _Committees of the Board._ The board of directors may, by
resolution adopted by a majority of the whole board, designate from among its
members an executive committee and one or more other committees, each of
which, to the extent provided in the resolution, may exercise all the
authority of the board of directors; however, no such committee shall (1)
authorize distributions; (2) approve or propose to shareholders action
required by law to be approved by shareholders; (3) fill vacancies on the
board of directors or on any committee thereof; (4) amend the articles of
incorporation pursuant to Section 10-02 of the North Carolina Business
Corporation Act; (5) adopt, amend, or repeal the bylaws; (6) approve a plan of
merger not requiring shareholder approval; (7) authorize or approve
reacquisition of shares, except according to a formula or method prescribed
by the board of directors; or (8) authorize or approve the issuance or sale or
contract for sale of shares, or determine the designation and relative rights,
preferences, and limitations of a class or series of shares, except that the
board of directors may authorize a committee (or a senior executive officer of
the corporation) to do so within limits specifically prescribed by the board
of directors.



Section 8\. _Quorum._ The attendance of not less than a majority of the
members of the whole board of directors shall be necessary to constitute a
quorum for the transaction of any business except the filling of vacancies,
but if fewer than a majority of the directors is present at a meeting, a
majority of the directors present may adjourn the meeting from time to time
without further notice.



 

5 Section 9\. _Required Votes._ The act of a majority of the directors present
at any meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the board of
directors, unless a greater number is required by the articles of
incorporation or by these bylaws or by law.



Section 10\. _Action Without Meeting_. Unless otherwise provided in the
articles of incorporation, any action required or permitted to be taken at
any meeting of the board of directors or of any committee thereof may be taken
without a meeting if a written consent to such action is signed by all members
of the board or of such committee as the case may be, and such written
consent is filed with the minutes of proceedings of the board or committee.



Section 11\. _Meeting by Conference Call_. Unless otherwise provided in the
articles of incorporation, any or all members of the board of directors or of
a committee designated by the board may participate in a meeting of the board
or committee by means of a conference telephone or similar communications
equipment by which all persons participating in the meeting can communicate
with each other, and participation in this manner constitutes presence
in person at the meeting.



Section 12\. _Removal of Directors._ Unless otherwise provided in the
articles of incorporation, any member of the board of directors may be
removed, with or without cause, by the board of directors or, at a meeting of
the shareholders called expressly for that purpose, by a vote of the holders
of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors.

ARTICLE V



Stock Certificates, Transfer of Shares, Books and Records



Section 1\. _Certificates for Shares._ Each shareholder shall be entitled to
a certificate, signed by the president or a vice president and the secretary
or an assistant secretary of the corporation, certifying the number of shares
owned by him or her in the corporation. The signatures of the officers of
the corporation may be facsimiles. If such certificate is countersigned by
the written signature of a registrar other than the corporation or an employee
of the corporation, the signatures of the transfer agent and the officers of
the corporation may be facsimiles. In case any officer, transfer agent, or
registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a
certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent, or registrar
before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with
the same effect as if he or she were such officer, transfer agent, or
registrar at the date of its issue. Certificates representing shares of the
corporation shall be in such form consistent with the laws of this state as
shall be determined by the board of directors. All certificates for shares
shall be consecutively numbered or otherwise identified. The name and address
of the person to whom the shares represented thereby are issued, with the
number of shares and the date of issue, shall be entered on the stock
transfer records of the corporation.



Section 2\. _Transfer of Shares._ Transfer of shares of the corporation shall
be made on the stock transfer records of the corporation by the holder of
record thereof or by his or her legal representative, who shall furnish proper
evidence of authority to transfer, or by his or her attorney thereunto
authorized by power of attorney duly executed and filed with the corporation,
and, except as otherwise provided in these bylaws, upon surrender for
cancellation of the certificates for such shares.



Section 3\. _Lost, Destroyed or Wrongfully Taken Certificates._ Any person
claiming a certificate of stock to have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully
taken, and who requests the issuance of a new certificate before the
corporation has notice that the certificate alleged to have been lost,
destroyed or wrongfully taken has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser,
shall make an affidavit of the fact and shall give the corporation and its
transfer agents and registrars a bond of indemnity with unlimited liability,
in form and with one or more corporate sureties satisfactory to the chief
executive officer or treasurer of the corporation (except that the chief
executive officer or treasurer may authorize the acceptance of a bond of
different amount, or a bond with personal surety thereon, or a personal
agreement of indemnity), whereupon in the discretion of the chief executive
officer or the treasurer and except as otherwise  



 

9  provided by law a new certificate may be issued of the same tenor and for
the same number of shares as the one alleged to have been lost, destroyed
or wrongfully taken. In lieu of a separate bond of indemnity in each case,
the chief executive officer or the treasurer may accept an assumption of
liability under a blanket bond issued in favor of the corporation and its
transfer agents and registrars by one or more corporate sureties satisfactory
to the chief executive officer or treasurer.



Section 4\. _Transfer Agent and Registrars._ The board of directors by
resolution may appoint a transfer agent or agents or a registrar or registrars
of transfer, or both. All such appointments shall confer such powers, rights,
duties and obligations consistent with the laws of this state as the board of
directors shall determine. The board of directors may appoint the treasurer of
the corporation and one or more assistant treasurers to serve as transfer
agent or agents.



Section 5\. _Books and Records._ The corporation shall keep correct and
complete books of account and minutes of the proceedings of its shareholders
and directors, and shall likewise keep, at its principal office, a complete
and accurate list of shareholders giving the names and addresses of all
shareholders and the number of shares held by each. All such books, records
and lists of the corporation shall be open to inspection and examination
during normal business hours for all proper purposes by every shareholder, or
his or her duly authorized agent or attorney. Upon written request of any
shareholder, the corporation shall mail to such shareholder its most recent
annual financial statements showing in reasonable detail its assets and
liabilities and the results of its operations.



ARTICLE VI



Liability



No person or his personal representatives shall be liable to the corporation
for any loss or damage suffered by it on account of any action taken or
omitted to be taken by such person in good faith as an officer or employee of
the corporation, or as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, or
agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise, whether for profit or not,
which he serves or served at the request of the corporation, if such person
(a) exercised and used the same degree of care and skill as an
ordinarily prudent person would have exercised and used under like
circumstances, charged with a like duty, or (b) took or omitted to take such
action in reliance upon advice of counsel for the corporation or such
enterprise or upon statements made or information furnished by persons
employed or retained by the corporation or such enterprise upon which he had
reasonable grounds to rely. The foregoing shall not be exclusive of other
rights and defenses to which such person or his personal representatives may
be entitled under law.



 

10 ARTICLE VII



Indemnification



Section 1\. _Actions by a Third Party._ The corporation shall indemnify any
person who is or was a party, or is threatened to be made a defendant or
respondent, to a proceeding, including any threatened, pending or completed
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (other than actions by or in the right of the corporation), and
whether formal or informal, who is or was a director, officer, or employee of
the corporation or who, while a director, officer, or employee of the
corporation, is or was serving at the corporations request as a director,
officer, partner, trustee, employee, or agent of another foreign or domestic
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or
other enterprise, whether for profit or not, against:



(a) any reasonable expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred with respect
to a proceeding, if such person is wholly successful on the merits or
otherwise in the defense of such proceeding, or



(b) judgments, settlements, penalties, fines (including excise taxes assessed
with respect to employee benefit plans) and reasonable expenses (including
attorneys fees) incurred with respect to a proceeding where such person is
not wholly successful on the merits or otherwise in the defense of the
proceeding if:



(i) the individuals conduct was in good faith; and



(ii) the individual reasonably believed:



(A) in the case of conduct in the individuals capacity as a director, officer
or employee of the corporation, that the individuals conduct was in the
corporations best interests; and



(B) in all other cases, that the individuals conduct was at least not
opposed to the corporations best interests; and



(c) in the case of any criminal proceeding, the individual had no reasonable
cause to believe the individuals conduct was unlawful.



The termination of a proceeding by a judgment, order, settlement, conviction,
or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent is not, of itself,
determinative that the director, officer, or employee did not meet the
standard of conduct described in this section.



Section 2\. _Actions by or in the Right of the Corporation_. The corporation
shall indemnify any person who is or was a party or is threatened to be made a
defendant or  



 

11  respondent, to a proceeding, including any threatened, pending or completed
action, suit or proceeding, by or in the right of the corporation to procure
a judgment in its favor, by reason of the fact that such person is or was a
director, officer, or employee of the corporation or is or was serving at the
request of the corporation as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee,
or agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise, whether for profit
or not, against any reasonable expenses (including attorneys fees):



(a) if such person is wholly successful on the merits or otherwise in
the defense of such proceeding, or



(b) if not wholly successful: 



(i) the individuals conduct was in good faith; and 



(ii) the individual reasonably believed:



(A) in the case of conduct in the individuals capacity as a
director, officer, or employee of the corporation, that the individuals
conduct was in the corporations best interests; and



(B) in all other cases that the individuals conduct was at least not opposed
to the corporations best interests,



except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim,
issue, or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be
liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the court in
which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application, that
despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all circumstances of the
case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification for
such expenses which such court shall deem proper.



Section 3\. _Methods of Determining Whether Standards for Indemnification Have
Been Met_. Any indemnification under Sections 1 or 2 of this Article (unless
ordered by a court) shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in the
specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director,
officer, or employee is proper in the circumstances because he has met the
applicable standards of conduct set forth in Section 1 or 2. In the case of
directors of the corporation, such determination shall be made by any one of
the following procedures:



(a) by the board of directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting
of directors not at the time parties to the proceeding;



(b) if a quorum cannot be obtained under (a), by majority vote of a committee
duly designated by the board of directors (in which designation  



 

12  directors who are parties may participate), consisting solely of two or more
directors not at the time parties to the proceeding;



(c) by special legal counsel:



(i) selected by the board of directors or a committee thereof in the
manner prescribed in (a) or (b); or



(ii) if a quorum of the board of directors cannot be obtained under (a) and a
committee cannot be designated under (b), selected by a majority vote of the
full board of directors (in which selection directors who are parties may
participate); or



(d) by the shareholders, but shares owned by or voted under the control
of directors who are at the time parties to the proceeding may not be voted
on the determination.



In the case of persons who are not directors of the corporation, such
determination shall be made (a) by the chief executive officer of the
corporation or (b) if the chief executive officer so directs or in his
absence, in the manner such determination would be made if the person were a
director of the corporation.



Section 4\. _Advancement of Defense Expenses_. The corporation may pay for or
reimburse the reasonable expenses incurred by a director, officer, or
employee who is a party to a proceeding described in Section 1 or 2 of this
Article in advance of the final disposition of said proceeding if:



(a) the director, officer, or employee furnishes the corporation a written
affirmation of his good faith belief that he has met the standard of
conduct described in Section 1 or 2; and



(b) the director, officer, or employee furnishes the corporation a written
undertaking, executed personally or on his behalf, to repay the advance if it
is ultimately determined that the director, officer, or employee did not meet
the standard of conduct; and 



(c) a determination is made that the facts then known to those making the
determination would not preclude indemnification under Section 1 or 2.



The undertaking required by this Section must be an unlimited general
obligation of the director, officer, or employee but need not be secured and
may be accepted by the corporation without reference to the financial ability
of such person to make repayment.



Section 5.  _Non-Exclusiveness of Indemnification_. The indemnification and
advancement of expenses provided for or authorized by this Article does not
exclude  



 

13  any other rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses that a person
may have under:



(a) the corporations articles of incorporation or bylaws;



(b) any resolution of the board of directors or the shareholders of
the corporation;



(c) any other authorization adopted by the shareholders; or



(d) otherwise as provided by law, both as to such persons actions in his
capacity as a director, officer, or employee of the corporation and as to
actions in another capacity while holding such office.



Such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
director, officer, or employee, and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs
and personal representatives of such person.



ARTICLE VIII



Fiscal Year



The fiscal year of the corporation shall begin on the first day of January
of each year and end upon the last day of December next succeeding.



ARTICLE IX



Amendments



Except as otherwise provided in these bylaws, the articles of
incorporation or the North Carolina Business Corporation Act, these bylaws
may be amended or repealed and new bylaws may be adopted by the affirmative
vote of a majority of the number of directors then in office at any regular or
special meeting of the board of directors. The board of directors shall not
have power to amend, repeal or adopt a bylaw (i) requiring more than a
majority of the voting shares for a quorum at a meeting of shareholders or
more than a majority of the votes cast to constitute action by the
shareholders, except where higher percentages are required by law, (ii)
increasing or decreasing the authorized number of directors beyond the maximum
number or minimum number set forth in Article 2 of these bylaws or (iii)
inconsistent with, or (as to any matter covered by said Article 2) in a manner
other than as prescribed by, Article 2 of these bylaws.

directors to the board of directors, any shareholder may nominate a person or
persons (as the case may be) for election to such position(s) as specified in

Control shares of the corporation acquired in a control share acquisition
shall have only such voting rights as are conferred by the Act. Control
shares of the corporation acquired in a control share acquisition with respect
to which the acquiring person has not filed with the corporation the statement
required by the Act may, at any time during the period ending sixty days
after the last acquisition of control shares by the acquiring  



 

3  person, be redeemed by the corporation at the fair value thereof pursuant to
procedures authorized by a resolution of the board of directors. Such
authority may be general or confined to specific instances. (Added May 7,
1987).



Section 13. Voting Procedures on Change of Control. In addition to any other
authority granted under Indiana law for the corporation to enter into any
arrangement, agreement or understanding with respect to the voting of voting
shares, pursuant to the authority granted in Indiana Code Section 23-1-22-4,
the corporation shall have the power to enter into any arrangement, agreement
or understanding of any nature whatsoever and for any duration whereby the
board of directors or any group of directors of the corporation can specify
or direct the voting by any other person of any shares of any class or series
beneficially owned by such person, or as to which such person has the direct
or indirect power to direct the voting, in connection with a change of
control of the corporation. As used in this Section 13, the term "control"
shall have the same meaning as set forth in Indiana Code Section 23-1-22-4.



In the event that an arrangement, agreement or understanding is in
effect, and the voting shares of the corporation are not voted in accordance
with any such arrangement, agreement or understanding, neither such voting
shares nor such votes shall be counted in connection with any vote of the
corporations shareholders relating to any aspect of a change of control.
(Added June 25, 1990).



ARTICLE II.



Board of Directors



Section 1. General Powers, Number, Classes and Tenure. The business of the
corporation shall be managed by a board of directors. The number of directors
which shall constitute the whole board of directors of the corporation shall
be fifteen. Except as otherwise provided in these bylaws, the number of
directors may be increased or decreased from time to time by amendment of
these bylaws, but no decrease shall have the effect of shortening the term of
any incumbent director. The directors shall be divided into three classes,
each class to consist, as nearly as may be, of one-third of the number of
directors then constituting the whole board of directors, with one class to be
elected annually by shareholders for a term of three years, to hold office
until their respective successors are elected and qualified; except that



(1) the terms of office of directors initially elected shall be staggered so
that the term of office of one class shall expire in each year;



(2) the term of office of a director who is elected by either the directors or
shareholders to fill a vacancy in the board of directors shall expire at the
end of the term of office of the succeeded directors class or at the end of
the term of office of such other class as determined by the board of directors
to be necessary or desirable in order to equalize the number of directors
among the classes;



 

4 (3) the board of directors may adopt a policy limiting the time beyond which
certain directors are not to continue to serve, the effect of which may be to
produce classes of unequal size or to cause certain directors either to be
nominated for election for a term of less than three years or to cease to be a
director before expiration of the term of the directors class.



In case of any increase in the number of directors, the additional directors
shall be distributed among the several classes to make the size of the classes
as equal as possible. (Last amended May 8, 2003).



Section 2. Additional Provisions. Notwithstanding anything else to the
contrary in these bylaws, the following provisions in Article II, Section 2
of these bylaws shall be effective until [a date 30 months after the Effective
Time], 2008 (the " _Transition Date_ "):



 

(A) _Qualifications for Directors_. Subject to the provisions of this Section
2 and subject to the terms of any class or series of stock having a

an annual or special meeting of shareholders or by written consent of

entitled to vote in the election of directors who has complied with all
requirements for such nomination as provided in Article I, Section 11 of
these bylaws or (b) the board of directors as provided for in this Section 2

the board of directors to fill a vacancy or newly created directorship, an
individual must be appointed by the board of directors as provided for in this

clause (i)(b) or (ii) above, or in connection with the designation of
directors to serve on any committee, in any such case occurring prior to the
2007 annual shareholders meeting, an individual must have been a Former
Lincoln Director, with respect to Former Lincoln Directorships, and a Former
Jefferson-Pilot Director, with respect to Former Jefferson-Pilot

corporation shall be comprised of seven Former Jefferson-Pilot Directors and
eight Former Lincoln Directors. Each committee of the board of directors shall
consist of an equal number of Former Jefferson-Pilot Directors and Former

Committee shall be selected from among the Former Lincoln Directors; the
chairman of other committees of the initial board of directors shall be
designated by the board of directors and allocated evenly among Former Lincoln

Former Jefferson-Pilot Directors can have one more chairmanship).



(4) _Reduction in the Board_. If, at any time prior to the 2007 annual
shareholders meeting, the board of directors determines to decrease the
number of members comprising the board of directors, (i) if the resulting

Section 1. Certificates for Shares. Shares may, but need not be, represented
by certificates. Each shareholder, upon request, shall be entitled to a
certificate, signed by the president or a vice president and the secretary or
any assistant secretary of the corporation, certifying the number of shares
owned by him in the corporation. If such certificate is countersigned by the
written signature of a transfer agent other than the corporation or its
employee, the signatures of the officers of the corporation may be facsimiles.
If such certificate is countersigned by the written signature of a registrar
other than the corporation or its employee, the signatures of the transfer
agent and the officers of the corporation may be facsimiles. In case any
officer, transfer agent, or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile
signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such
officer, transfer agent, or registrar before such certificate is issued, it
may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if he were such
officer, transfer agent, or registrar at the date of its issue. Certificates
representing shares of the corporation shall be in such form consistent with
the laws of the State of Indiana as shall be determined by the board of
directors. All certificates for shares shall be consecutively numbered or
otherwise identified. The name and address of the person to whom the shares
are issued, with the number of shares and date of issue, shall be entered on
the stock transfer records of the corporation. (Amended May 13,1999).



Section 2. Transfer of Shares. Transfer of shares of the corporation shall
be made on the stock transfer records of the corporation by the holder of
record thereof or by his legal representative, who shall furnish proper
evidence of authority to transfer, or by his attorney thereunto authorized by
power of attorney duly executed and filed with the corporation, and, except
as otherwise provided in these bylaws, on surrender for cancellation of the
certificates for such shares. (Amended May 28, 1969).



Section 3. Lost, Destroyed or Wrongfully Taken Certificates. Any person
claiming a certificate of stock to have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully
taken, and who requests the issuance of a new certificate before the
corporation has notice that the certificate alleged to have been lost,
destroyed or wrongfully taken has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser,
shall make an affidavit of that fact and shall give the corporation and its
transfer agents and registrars a bond of indemnity with unlimited liability,
in form and with one or more corporate sureties satisfactory to the chief
executive officer or treasurer of the corporation (except that the chief
executive officer or treasurer may authorize the acceptance of a bond of
different amount, or a bond with personal surety thereon, or a personal
agreement of indemnity), whereupon in the discretion of the chief executive
officer or the treasurer and except as otherwise provided by law a new
certificate may be issued of the same tenor and for the same number of shares
as the one alleged to have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken. In lieu
of a separate bond of indemnity in each case, the chief executive officer of
the corporation may accept an assumption of liability under a blanket bond
issued in favor of the corporation and its transfer agents and registrars by
one or more corporate sureties satisfactory to him. (Amended September 14,
1972).



Section 4. Transfer Agent and Registrars. The board of directors by
resolution may appoint a transfer agent or agents or a registrar or registrars
of transfer, or both. All such appointments  



 

13  shall confer such powers, rights, duties and obligations consistent with the
laws of the State of Indiana as the board of directors shall determine.
The board of directors may appoint the treasurer of the corporation and one
or more assistant treasurers to serve as transfer agent or agents. (Amended
May 28, 1969).

such determination of shareholders, such date in any case to be not more than
seventy days before the meeting or action requiring a determination of
shareholders. (Amended November 6, 1986).



ARTICLE VII.



Liability



No person or his personal representatives shall be liable to the corporation
for any loss or damage suffered by it on account of any action taken or
omitted to be taken by such person in good faith as an officer or employee of
the corporation, or as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, or
agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise, whether for profit or not,
which he serves or served at the request of the corporation, if such person
(a) exercised and used the same degree of care and skill as a prudent
man would have exercised and used under like circumstances, charged with a
like duty, or (b) took or omitted to take such action in reliance upon advice
of counsel for the corporation or such enterprise or upon statements made or
information furnished by persons employed or retained by the corporation or
such enterprise upon which he had reasonable grounds to rely. The foregoing
shall not be exclusive of other rights and defenses to which such person or
his personal representatives may be entitled under law. (Last amended
November 6, 1986).

person who is or was a party, or is threatened to be made a defendant or
respondent, to a proceeding, including any threatened, pending or completed
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (other than actions by or in the right of the corporation), and
whether formal or informal, who is or was a director, officer, or employee of
the corporation or who, while a director, officer, or employee of the
corporation, is or was serving at the corporations request as a director,
officer, partner, trustee, employee, or agent of another foreign or domestic
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or
other enterprise, whether for profit or not, against: 



 

14 (A) any reasonable expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred with respect
to a proceeding, if such person is wholly successful on the merits or
otherwise in the defense of such proceeding, or



(B) judgments, settlements, penalties, fines (including excise taxes assessed
with respect to employee benefit plans) and reasonable expenses
(including attorneys fees) incurred with respect to a proceeding where such
person is not wholly successful on the merits or otherwise in the defense of
the proceeding if:



(i) the individuals conduct was in good faith; and



(ii) the individual reasonably believed:



(C) in the case of conduct in the individuals capacity as a
director, officer or employee of the corporation, that the individuals
conduct was in the corporations best interests; and



(D) in all other cases, that the individuals conduct was at least not opposed
to the corporations best interests; and



(i) in the case of any criminal proceeding, the individual either:



(E) had reasonable cause to believe the individuals conduct was lawful; or



(F) had no reasonable cause to believe the individuals conduct was unlawful.



(G) The termination of a proceeding by a judgment, order, settlement,
conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent is not, of
itself, determinative that the director, officer, or employee did not meet the
standard of conduct described in this section. (Last amended November 6,
1986).



Section 2. Actions by or in the Right of the Corporation. The corporation
shall indemnify any person who is or was a party or is threatened to be made a
defendant or respondent, to a proceeding, including any threatened, pending
or completed action, suit or proceeding, by or in the right of the corporation
to procure a judgment in its favor, by reason of the fact that such person is
or was a director, officer, or employee of the corporation or is or was
serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, partner,
trustee, employee, or agent of another foreign or domestic corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise,
whether for profit or not, against any reasonable expenses (including
attorneys fees):



(A) if such person is wholly successful on the merits or otherwise in the
defense of such proceeding, or



(B) if not wholly successful:



(i) the individuals conduct was in good faith; and



(ii) the individual reasonably believed:



 

15 (C) in the case of conduct in the individuals capacity as a director,
officer, or employee of the corporation, that the individuals conduct was in
the corporations best interests; and



(D) in all other cases, that the individuals conduct was at least not opposed
to the corporations best interests, except that no indemnification shall be
made in respect of any claim, issue, or matter as to which such person shall
have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the
extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought
shall determine upon application, that despite the adjudication of liability
but in view of all circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and
reasonably entitled to indemnification for such expenses which such court
shall deem proper. (Last amended November 6, 1986).



Section 3. Methods of Determining Whether Standards for Indemnification Have
Been Met. Any indemnification under Sections 1 or 2 of this Article (unless
ordered by a court) shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in the
specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director,
officer, or employee is proper in the circumstances because he has met the
applicable standards of conduct set forth in Section 1 or 2. In the case of
directors of the corporation such determination shall be made by any one
of the following procedures:



(A) by the board of directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of
directors not at the time parties to the proceeding;



(B) if a quorum cannot be obtained under (a), by majority vote of a committee
duly designated by the board of directors (in which designation directors who
are parties may participate), consisting solely of two or more directors not
at the time parties to the proceeding;



(C) by special legal counsel:



(i) selected by the board of directors or a committee thereof in the manner
prescribed in (a) or (b); or



(ii) if a quorum of the board of directors cannot be obtained under (a) and a
committee cannot be designated under (b), selected by a majority vote of the
full board of directors (in which selection directors who are parties may
participate).



In the case of persons who are not directors of the corporation, such
determination shall be made (a) by the chief executive officer of
the corporation or (b) if the chief executive officer so directs or in his
absence, in the manner such determination would be made if the person were a
director of the corporation. (Last amended November 6, 1986).



Section 4. Advancement of Defense Expenses. The corporation may pay for
or reimburse the reasonable expenses incurred by a director, officer, or
employee who is a party to a proceeding described in Section 1 or 2 of this
Article in advance of the final disposition of said proceeding if:



(A) the director, officer, or employee furnishes the corporation a
written affirmation of his good faith belief that he has met the standard of
conduct described in Section 1 or 2; and



 

16 (B) the director, officer, or employee furnishes the corporation a written
undertaking, executed personally or on his behalf, to repay the advance if it
is ultimately determined that the director, officer or employee did not meet
the standard of conduct; and



(C) a determination is made that the facts then known to those making the
determination would not preclude indemnification under Section 1 or 2.



(D) The undertaking required by this Section must be an unlimited general
obligation of the director, officer, or employee but need not be secured and
may be accepted by the corporation without reference to the financial ability
of such person to make repayment. (Last Amended November 6, 1986).



Section 5. Non-Exclusiveness of Indemnification. The indemnification and
advancement of expenses provided for or authorized by this Article does not
exclude any other rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses that a
person may have under:



(A) the corporations articles of incorporation or bylaws;

 



(B) any resolution of the board of directors or the shareholders of
the corporation;



(C) any other authorization adopted by the shareholders; or



(D) otherwise as provided by law, both as to such persons actions in his
capacity as a director, officer, or employee of the corporation and as to
actions in another capacity while holding such office.



Such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
director, officer, or employee, and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs
and personal representatives of such person. (Last amended November 6, 1986).



ARTICLE IX.

Ladies and Gentlemen:



Lincoln National Corporation, an Indiana corporation (" _Lincoln_ "), Quartz

Lincoln (" _Merger Sub_ ") and Jefferson-Pilot Corporation, a North
Carolina corporation (" _Jefferson-Pilot_ "), have entered into an Agreement
and Plan of Merger, dated as of October , 2005 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "),
pursuant to which Jefferson-Pilot would be merged with and into Merger
Sub (the " _Merger_ "), and outstanding shares of common stock of Jefferson-
Pilot would be converted into the right to receive cash and/or shares of
common stock of Lincoln (" _Shares_ "). Capitalized terms used but not
defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Merger
Agreement.



The undersigned has been advised that as of the date the Merger is submitted
to shareholders of Jefferson-Pilot for approval, the undersigned may be an
"affiliate" of Jefferson-Pilot as that term is defined for purposes of
paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the Rules and Regulations (the " _Rules
and Regulations_ ") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "
_Commission_ ") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Act_ ").



The undersigned represents, warrants and covenants to Lincoln that, in the
event the undersigned receives any Shares as a result of the Merger:



A. At the time the Merger was submitted for a vote of the shareholders of
Jefferson-Pilot, (a) the undersigned may be deemed to have been an affiliate
of Jefferson-Pilot and (b) if in fact the undersigned was at such time an
affiliate of Jefferson-Pilot under the Act, the undersigned may not sell,
transfer or otherwise dispose of Shares issued to the undersigned in the
Merger unless (i) such sale, transfer or other disposition has been
registered under the Act, (ii) such sale, transfer or other disposition is
made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145 promulgated by the
Commission under the Act (as such rule may hereinafter from time to time be
amended) or (iii) in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to Lincoln,
or in accordance with a "no action" letter obtained by the undersigned from
the staff of the Commission, such sale, transfer or other disposition will
not violate or is otherwise exempt from registration under the Act.



B. The undersigned understands that Lincoln is under no obligation to register
the sale, transfer or other disposition of the Shares by the undersigned
or on the undersigneds behalf under the Act. C. The undersigned also understands that stop transfer instructions will be
given to Lincolns transfer agents with respect to the Shares issued to the
undersigned and that there will be placed on the certificates for the Shares
issued to the undersigned, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in
substance:



The shares represented by this certificate were issued in a transaction
to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933 applies. The
shares represented by this certificate may only be transferred in accordance
with the terms of an agreement dated  _ _, 200 _ _
between the registered holder hereof and Lincoln National Corporation, a copy
of which is on file at the principal offices of Lincoln National Corporation.



D. The undersigned also understands that unless the transfer by the
undersigned of the undersigneds Shares has been registered under the Act or
is a sale made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145 under the Act,
Lincoln reserves the right to put the following legend on the certificates
issued to any transferee of such Shares from the undersigned:



The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under the
Securities Act of 1933 and were acquired from a person who received
such shares in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the
Securities Act of 1933 applies. The shares have been acquired by the holder
not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof
within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be offered,
