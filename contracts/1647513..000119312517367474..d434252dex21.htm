PURCHASE AND SALE

 

Section 2.1 _Purchase and Sale of the Membership Interests_. Upon the terms
and subject to the conditions contained in this Agreement, at the Closing,
the Seller will sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver to the Buyer, and
the Buyer will purchase and accept from the Seller, all of the Membership
Interests in exchange for the consideration provided in  _Section_ __ _ 2.2_
below.

Section 2.2 _Purchase Price; Deposit_.

 

(a) Each party or its Affiliates has delivered or shall promptly deliver to
the Escrow Agent all information requested by the Escrow Agent to open the
Deposit Escrow Account. By the later of (i) three (3) Business Days following
the Execution Date and (ii) the date that the Deposit Escrow Account is open,
but in no event later than ten (10) days following the Execution Date,
the Buyer shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the Deposit Escrow Account, the sum of $37,500,000 (the "
__ _Deposit_ __"), which Deposit shall be held and disbursed by the Escrow
Agent in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement and
this Agreement. If Closing occurs, the Deposit shall be applied towards the
Closing Amount at Closing and the Parties shall execute and deliver joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent directing the disbursement of the
Deposit (and all interest and other amounts earned thereon) from the Deposit
Escrow Account to the Seller. If the Closing does not occur, the Deposit (and
all interest and other amounts earned thereon) shall be distributed in
accordance with the terms of _Section_ __ _ 9.3_. If the Deposit is not
delivered to the Escrow Agent as provided above, then, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the Agreement, the Seller shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement by delivery of written notice to the Buyer.

(b) Subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, as
consideration for the sale, assignment, transfer and conveyance of the
Membership Interests and the performance of the Sellers obligations hereunder
and under the other Transaction Documents, the aggregate unadjusted
consideration to be paid by the Buyer to the Seller is $625,000,000 (the " __
_Unadjusted Purchase Price_ __"), subject to adjustment upward or downwards by
the positive or negative amount of the Adjustment Amount (as adjusted, the "
__ _Adjusted Purchase Price_ __"). At the Closing, as and to the extent set
forth in the Preliminary Settlement Statement (as defined below), the Seller
may instruct the Buyer to direct, on behalf of Seller, the remainder of (A)
the Adjusted Purchase Price (as set forth in the Preliminary Settlement
Statement) _minus_ (B) the Indemnity Escrow Amount _minus_ (C) the Deposit
(such remainder, the " __ _Closing Amount_ __") to such Persons by wire
transfer of immediately available funds as follows:

 

(i) to the holders of any and all Indebtedness of the Acquired Companies, as
necessary to satisfy the Sellers obligations under _Section_ __ _ 8.2(e)_
to pay off the entirety of the Indebtedness of the Acquired Companies;

(ii) to any Persons that any Acquired Company owes any and all Transaction
Expenses included in the determination of the Company Transaction Expense
Amount, as necessary to satisfy the Sellers obligations under  _Section_ __
_ 1.1(a)(iii)_ of _Exhibit A_ to pay and bear any and all Transaction
Expenses; and

 

(iii) to such other Persons and in such amounts as the Seller may direct.

 

Section 2.3 _Estimated Adjustment Amount and Post-Closing Final Adjustment
Amount_.

 

(a) Not later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Seller will prepare and deliver to the Buyer a preliminary settlement
statement in substantially the form attached hereto on _Exhibit A_ (the " __
_Preliminary Settlement Statement_ __"), which shall include a

 



17  calculation and good faith estimate of the Adjustment Amount and the
Adjusted Purchase Price to be prepared in accordance with the principles set
forth on _Exhibit A_ (such estimated amount, the " __ _Estimated Adjustment
Amount_ __") and such supporting evidence, data and information as reasonably
necessary to verify the amounts and adjustments reflected on the Preliminary
Settlement Statement. To the extent the Buyer timely objects to the
Estimated Adjustment Amount or the Adjusted Purchase Price set forth in the
Preliminary Settlement Statement (or any component thereof), the Buyer and the
Seller shall attempt to resolve their differences; _provided_ that, if the
Buyer and the Seller are unable to resolve any such dispute prior to the
Closing Date, then, subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)_, the Sellers good
faith calculations as reflected in the Estimated Adjustment Amount and
Adjusted Purchase Price shall control for purposes of all payments to be made
at the Closing. To the extent the Parties resolve any of their differences
prior to the Closing, then the Parties shall jointly agree on a revised
Estimated Adjustment Amount, Adjusted Purchase Price and Preliminary
Settlement Statement that will control for purposes of the payments to be made
at the Closing.

 

(b) Not later than ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, the Buyer
shall prepare and deliver to the Seller a settlement statement in
substantially the form attached hereto on _Exhibit A_ (the " __ _Post-Closing
Statement_ __") setting forth the calculation of the final Adjustment Amount
(the " __ _Final Adjustment Amount_ __") and the Adjusted Purchase Price.
The Post-Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the principles
set forth on _Exhibit A_. The Buyer will provide to the Seller such additional
data and information as the Seller may reasonably request to verify the
amounts reflected on the Post-Closing Statement. Not later than thirty (30)
days following receipt of the Post-Closing Statement hereunder, the Seller may
deliver to the Buyer a written notice (an " __ _Adjustment Notice_ __")
containing any changes the Seller proposes to be made in the Post-Closing
Statement, together with reasonable supporting explanation for such changes.
If the Seller does not deliver to the Buyer an Adjustment Notice within such
30-day period, then the Seller will be deemed to have irrevocably accepted and
agreed to all items in the Post-Closing Statement, and the Final Adjustment
Amount set forth therein will, without limiting Buyers rights under _Section_
__ _ 10.2(c)_, be considered final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. If
the Seller does timely deliver to the Buyer an Adjustment Notice, all items
in the Post-Closing Statement, other than such matters that are specifically
disputed therein, shall be deemed to be accepted and agreed to by the Seller.
The Parties will negotiate in good faith to agree on the Final Adjustment
Amount no later than thirty (30) days after delivery of any Adjustment Notice
in accordance with the foregoing (such 30-day period, the " __
_Resolution Period_ __").

(c) If an Adjustment Notice is timely delivered to the Buyer in accordance
with  _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)_ and the Final Adjustment Amount is mutually
agreed upon in writing by the Parties during such Resolution Period, then the
Final Adjustment Amount as so agreed will, without limiting Buyers rights
under  _Section_ __ _ 10.2(c)_, be considered final, conclusive and binding
on the Parties.

(d) If an Adjustment Notice is timely delivered to the Buyer in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)_ and the Final Adjustment Amount is not mutually
agreed upon by the Parties during such Resolution Period, then Grant Thornton
LLP (the " __ _Accountant_ __") will be engaged by the Parties to resolve any
remaining disagreements with respect to the Final Adjustment Amount. If such
accounting firm does not agree to serve as the Accountant within ten (10)
days after written request from the Parties to serve, then the Parties will
mutually select and engage an

 



18  alternative independent nationally recognized accounting firm that has not
acted or been engaged by any of the Parties or its Affiliates during the five
(5) year period from such date of mutual selection or, if the Parties are
unable to agree upon such firm or such firm declines to serve as the
Accountant, then any Party may request that the American Arbitration
Association select the Accountant, and the Parties will engage
such Accountant. In connection with the engagement of the Accountant, each
Party will execute such engagement, indemnity and other agreements as the
Accountant and the American Arbitration Association may reasonably require as
a condition to such engagement. Each Party will use reasonable efforts to
cause the Accountant to render its decision as soon as practicable after such
engagement, including by promptly complying with all reasonable requests by
the Accountant for information, books, records and similar items. The Parties
will instruct the Accountant to make a determination of whether the Post-
Closing Statement requires adjustment (i) in writing, (ii) as promptly as
practicable after the dispute has been referred to the Accountant and the
Parties shall have submitted their position statements and briefing to the
Accountant (but in no event later than thirty (30) days thereafter) and (iii)
in accordance with this Agreement. The Parties agree to instruct the
Accountant to consider only those items and amounts with respect to the
calculation of the Final Adjustment Amount which the Parties are unable to
resolve following expiration of the Resolution Period. In resolving any
such disputed item, the Accountant may not assign a value to any item greater
than the greatest value for such item claimed by a Party or less than the
smallest value for such item claimed by a Party. The Accountant may not award
damages or penalties. The fees, costs and expenses of the Accountant shall be
borne by the Buyer, on the one hand, and by the Seller, on the other, based
upon the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to
each Party bears to the amount actually contested by such Party. For example,
if the Buyer claims that the Post-Closing Statement is $1,000 less than the
amount determined by the Seller, and the Seller contests only $500 of the
amount claimed by the Buyer, and if the Accountant ultimately resolve the
dispute by awarding the Buyer $300 of the $500 contested, then the costs and
expenses of the Accountant will be allocated 60% (i.e., 300/500) to the Seller
and 40% (i.e., 200/500) to the Buyer. No Party will disclose to
the Accountant, and the Accountant will not consider for any purpose, any
settlement discussions or settlement offer made by any Party. The Accountants
determination of the disputed items will, without limiting Buyers rights
under  _Section_ __ _ 10.2(c)_, be final, conclusive and binding upon each
of the Parties. The date on which the Final Adjustment Amount is finally
determined in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)_,  _Section_ __ _
2.3(c)_ or this _Section_ __ _ 2.3(d)_, as applicable, is referred to as the
" __ _Determination Date_ __."

 

(e) If the Final Adjustment Amount is _greater_ than the Estimated Adjustment
Amount, then the Buyer will pay to the Seller the difference in Dollars
between the Final Adjustment Amount and the Estimated Adjustment Amount. If
the Final Adjustment Amount is _less_ than the Estimated Adjustment Amount,
then the Seller will pay to the Buyer an amount equal to the difference in
Dollars between the Final Adjustment Amount and the Estimated Adjustment
Amount. Any payments made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.3(e)_ shall be
paid within five (5) Business Days of the Determination Date in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 2.3(f)_.

(f) All payments made, or to be made, under this Agreement by a Party to or
on behalf of the other Party will be made by electronic transfer of
immediately available funds to the receiving Partys account set forth on
_Schedule_ _2.3(f)_ , or to such other bank and account as may be specified by
the receiving Party in writing to the paying Party.

 



19 Section 2.4 _Tax Classification; Purchase Price Allocation_.

 

(a) For federal income Tax purposes, the Parties agree that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are properly characterized as the sale of all
of the assets of the Acquired Companies by the Seller to the Buyer and
assumption by the Buyer of all of the Acquired Companies liabilities (other
than liabilities for which Buyer is required to be indemnified pursuant to
this Agreement). The Parties agree not to voluntarily take any position on a
United States federal income Tax Return or in any administrative or judicial
proceeding relating to the Tax reporting of the transactions under this
Agreement that is inconsistent with this _Section_ __ _ 2.4(a)_ for United
States federal income Tax purposes.

(b) Following the Closing Date, the Seller and the Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to agree to an allocation of the Adjusted
Purchase Price, as adjusted hereunder, among the assets of the Acquired
Companies for Tax purposes in a manner consistent with Section 1060 of the
Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder (the " __ _Treasury
Regulations_ __"), based upon the fair market values of such assets (the " __
_Allocation_ __"). Accordingly, the Seller and the Buyer agree that the
Allocation shall be allocated to Class I assets, Class II assets, Class III
assets, Class IV assets, Class V assets, Class VI assets and Class VII assets
(all as defined below) based on fair market values.

(c) The terms "Class I assets," "Class II assets," "Class III assets," "Class
IV assets," "Class V assets," "Class VI assets" and "Class VII assets"
shall have the meaning ascribed to them in Section 1.338-6 of the Treasury
Regulations. If Seller and Buyer reach an agreement with respect to the
Allocation, (i) the Seller and the Buyer shall report the transactions
contemplated hereby on all Tax Returns, including, but not limited to Form
8594, in a manner consistent with the Allocation, (ii) if there is an
adjustment to the Adjusted Purchase Price and if such difference requires
an adjustment to the Allocation in order for such Allocation to comply with
_Section_ __ _ 2.4(b)_ and this _Section_ __ _ 2.4(c)_, the Seller shall
prepare such adjustment to the Allocation which adjustment shall be submitted
to the Buyer, and the Seller and the Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to agree on the final adjustment to the Allocation, and (iii) the
Seller and the Buyer agree to (x) be bound by the Allocation, (y) file all
information reports and Tax Returns (including IRS Form 8594) in a manner
consistent therewith, and (z) take no position inconsistent with the
Allocation in any Tax Return, any audit or examination by, or any proceeding
before, any Taxing Authority; _provided, however_ , that neither Party shall
be unreasonably impeded in its ability and discretion to negotiate, compromise
and/or settle any Tax audit, claim or similar proceedings in connection with
such allocation notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary.

(d) In connection with the procedures relating to the Indemnity Escrow
Account, for federal income Tax purposes, the Parties intend that Seller will
be eligible to report any distributions from the Indemnity Escrow Account
under the installment method under Section 453 of the Code. The Parties agree
to structure the Escrow Agreement so that such Indemnity Escrow Fund
represents an installment obligation of the Buyer under Section 453 of the
Code. Accordingly, for federal income Tax purposes, the Parties agree to treat
the amounts held in the Indemnity Escrow Account in accordance with Section
1.468B-8 (as issued February 1, 1999) of the Proposed Treasury Regulations
promulgated under the Code (the " __ _Proposed Treasury Regulations_ __").
The Parties acknowledge that as of the date hereof, if such Proposed

 



20  Treasury Regulations were to apply, then prior to any "determination date"
(as such term is defined in the Proposed Treasury Regulations), all interest
or other income earned from the investment of the Indemnity Escrow Account in
any Tax year would be reported as income of the Buyer. After any determination
date, the Buyer and the Seller shall be treated as the owners for Tax purposes
of their respective shares of the Indemnity Escrow Account. The Parties also
agree, for federal income Tax purposes, to treat the Buyer as the owner of the
Indemnity Escrow Account prior to any determination date. The ownership
treatment in this _Section_ __ _ 2.4(d)_ applies solely for Tax purposes and
does not affect the Parties rights to distributions of the Indemnity Escrow
Account.

 

Section 2.5 _Escrow_.

 

(a) At the Closing, the Buyer shall deposit the Indemnity Escrow Amount with
the Escrow Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to the
Indemnity Escrow Account, to be held in escrow in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement.

(b) On the date that is nine (9) months following the Closing Date (the " __
_First Escrow Release Date_ __") and in accordance with the Escrow Agreement,
the Parties shall execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent joint
written instructions authorizing the Escrow Agent to release from the
Indemnity Escrow Account to Seller an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of
the Indemnity Escrow Amount _minus_ an amount equal to the aggregate amount
disbursed to the Buyer from the Indemnity Escrow Account prior to the First
Escrow Release Date, if any, _minus_ an amount equal to the aggregate amount
of unsatisfied or disputed claims for Losses specified in a Claim Notice
delivered by a Buyer Indemnified Party to the Seller prior to the First
Escrow Release Date, if any.

(c) On the date that is fifteen (15) months following the Closing Date (the "
__ _Second Escrow Release Date_ __") and in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement, the Parties shall execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent joint
written instructions authorizing the Escrow Agent to release from the
Indemnity Escrow Account to Seller any remaining portion of the Indemnity
Escrow Fund _minus_ an amount equal to the aggregate amount of unsatisfied or
disputed claims for Losses specified in a Claim Notice delivered by a Buyer
Indemnified Party to the Seller prior to the Second Escrow Release Date, if
any (such aggregate amount of unsatisfied or disputed claims for Losses, the "
__ _Pending Claims Amount_ _"_ ). The Escrow Agent shall continue to hold the
Pending Claims Amount corresponding to each claim for Losses until the final
resolution of such claim, at which point, as and when such claim is resolved,
the Escrow Agent shall release such Pending Claims Amount (i) to the Seller
or (ii) to the Buyer, as the case may be, depending upon resolution of such
claim.

(d) The Seller and the Buyer each agree to promptly take commercially
reasonable actions (including executing and delivering joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent) requested by the other to effect releases
from the Indemnity Escrow Account as required by and in accordance with this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

its respective Affiliates, including selling, licensing, divesting, holding
separate, or otherwise limiting its freedom of action with respect to any

or indirect portfolio companies of investment funds advised or managed by one
or more Affiliates of such Party.

(e) Each of the Parties shall, or shall cause their respective counsel to,
furnish the other Party with such necessary information and reasonable

Documents, except for documents filed pursuant to Items 4 through 8 of the HSR
Notification and Report Form (which shall be provided in the event any
Governmental Authority issues a request for additional information and
documentary material under the HSR Act) or communications regarding the same,
documents or information that reveal any Partys negotiating objectives,
strategies or purchase price expectations or a Partys communications
containing information covered by the attorney-client or work product
privilege, unless the Parties enter into a mutually acceptable joint defense
agreement. To the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Authority, the
Parties will (i) give each other reasonable advance notice of

 



44  all meetings and communications with any Governmental Authority relating to
obtaining the necessary authorizations, approvals or consents as may
reasonably be required in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents, including any such meetings and communications, (ii) not
participate independently in any such meeting or communication without first
giving the other Parties (or the other Parties outside counsel) an
opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting or communication, (iii)
give the other Parties reasonable advance notice of all oral communications
with any Governmental Authority relating to obtaining the necessary
authorizations, approvals or consents as may reasonably be required in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this

Authority initiates an oral communication regarding the obtaining the
necessary authorizations, approvals or consents as may reasonably be required

the substance of such communication, and (v) provide each other with a
reasonable advance opportunity to review and comment upon, and consider in
good faith the views of the other in connection with, all written
communications (including any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any
Party relating to obtaining the necessary authorizations, approvals or
consents as may reasonably be required in connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents) with a Governmental Authority regarding obtaining the necessary
authorizations, approvals or consents as may reasonably be required
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents; _provided, however_ , that each
Party will be solely responsible for the final content of any substantive oral
or written communications of such Party with any applicable Governmental
Authority. The Parties shall jointly determine all tactics and strategies
relating to their compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ and obtaining the

Agreement, the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.4_ will survive the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article 9_ and the Closing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party may disclose the terms of this
Agreement to (a) any direct and indirect holders of Securities in such Party
or any Affiliate of such Party or any of their respective employees, officers,
directors, agents, attorneys, accountants or advisors with a reasonable need-
to-know, (b) any investor meetings or conference calls to the extent necessary
to discuss or respond to questions regarding any press release or public
filing required under the requirements of Law or any listing agreements with,
or rules and regulations of, Securities exchanges, (c) any Financing Sources
and (d) any Governmental Authority as required in connection with filings
under the HSR Act by the Parties if, in each case, in making any disclosure
of the terms of this Agreement, the disclosing Party advises of the
confidentiality obligations accompanying such information.

 

Section 6.5 _Transfer Taxes_. The transactions contemplated by this Agreement
involve the transfer of the Membership Interests, which are intangible
assets. Accordingly, the Parties do not expect any state and local transfer,
sales, use, stamp, registration or other similar Taxes to arise by reason of
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any such Taxes imposed on
any transfer made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.25_, _Section_ __ _ 6.26_ or
_Section_ __ _ 6.27_ (" _Transfer Taxes")_. To the extent that any Transfer
Taxes are assessed, such Transfer Taxes will be borne by the Buyer. The
Parties will cooperate in good faith to minimize, to the extent permissible
under Law, the amount of any Transfer Taxes.

 

Section 6.6 _Tax_.

 

(a) The Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all Seller Consolidated Returns and shall pay all Taxes owed with
respect to such Seller Consolidated Returns.

 



47 (b) The Seller shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) all Tax Returns (other
than the Tax Returns described in _Section_ __ _ 6.6(a)_) of the Acquired
Companies required to be filed after the Closing Date with respect to (i)
Income Taxes for any Pre-Closing Period and (ii) Non-Income Taxes for any
Pre-Effective Time Period, in each case, on a basis consistent with past
practice, except to the extent otherwise required by Law. Reasonably in
advance of filing any such Tax Return (which in the case of a Tax Return that
relates to Income Taxes, shall not be later than 30 days prior to such
filing), the Seller shall deliver a copy of such Tax Return, together with all
supporting documentation and workpapers, to the Buyer for its review and
reasonable comment. The Buyer will cause any such Tax Return required to be
filed after the Closing Date (as revised to incorporate the Buyers reasonable
comments) to be timely filed and will provide a copy to the Seller. Not later
than five days prior to the due date for payment of Taxes with respect to any
such Tax Return required to be filed after the Closing Date, the Seller shall
pay to the Buyer the amount of any Seller Taxes with respect to such
Tax Return.

(c) The Buyer shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) all Tax Returns of the
Acquired Companies required to be filed after the Closing Date for any
Straddle Period on a basis consistent with past practice, except to the extent
otherwise required by Law. Reasonably in advance of filing any such Tax Return
(which in the case of a Tax Return that relates to Income Taxes, shall not be
later than 30 days prior to such filing), the Buyer shall deliver a copy of
such Tax Return, together with all supporting documentation and workpapers, to
the Seller for its review and reasonable comment. The Buyer will cause such
Tax Return (as revised to incorporate the Sellers reasonable comments) to be
timely filed and will provide a copy to the Seller. Not later than five (5)
days prior to the due date for payment of Taxes with respect to any such Tax
Return, the Seller shall pay to the Buyer the amount of any Seller Taxes with
respect to such Tax Return.

(d) In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to any Straddle
Period, the portion of any such Taxes that is attributable to the portion of
such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date or the day immediately prior
to the Effective Time, as applicable, shall be:

 

(i) with respect to Taxes that are Income Taxes, deemed equal to the amount
that would be payable if the Tax year of the Acquired Companies ended on (and
included) the Closing Date; _provided_ , that, all exemptions, allowances, or
deductions for the Straddle Period which are calculated on an annual basis
(including depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated in
proportion to the number of days in such period prior to and including the
Closing Date;

(ii) with respect to Taxes that are imposed in connection with any sale or
other transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or
intangible) or imposed on specific transactions, including payroll Taxes,
deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if the Tax year of the
Acquired Companies ended at the end of the day immediately preceding the day
on which the Effective Time occurs; and

 

(iii) with respect to Property Taxes that are ad valorem, real property,
personal property or other Property Taxes imposed on a periodic basis, deemed
to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period __multiplied by__ a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion
of the period ending on and including the day immediately preceding the day
on which the Effective Time occurs, and the denominator of which is the number
of calendar days in the entire period.

 



48 Section 6.7 _Cooperation on Tax Returns and Tax Proceedings_. The Parties
will cooperate fully as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any audit, litigation
or other proceeding (each a " _Tax Proceeding_ ") with respect to Taxes
imposed on or with respect to the assets, operations or activities of the
Acquired Companies. Such cooperation will include the retention and (upon the
request of the other Party) the provision of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or Tax Proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
Notwithstanding the above, the control and conduct of any Tax Proceeding that
involves an Asserted Liability will be governed by _Section_ __ _ 10.5_;
_provided, however_ , that the Seller shall not settle or compromise, without
the Buyers prior written consent, any such Tax Proceeding that Seller
controls pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.5(b)_ the resolution of which would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Buyer.

 

Section 6.8 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. Any payments made to
any Party pursuant to _Article 10_ shall constitute an adjustment of the
Adjusted Purchase Price for Tax purposes and shall be treated as such by the
Parties on their Tax Returns to the extent permitted by Law.

 

Section 6.9 _Non-Solicitation; Non-Compete_.

 

(a) For the applicable Restricted Period, the Seller shall not, and shall not
permit any Restricted Persons to, directly or indirectly, (i) engage in any
Restricted Opportunity, as applicable, within the Restricted Area, (ii) have
an interest in any Person that engages directly or indirectly in any
Restricted Opportunity, as applicable, within the Restricted Area in
any capacity, including as a partner, shareholder, member, employee,
principal, agent, trustee or consultant or (iii) interfere or attempt to
interfere in any material respect with the business relationships (whether
formed prior to or after the Execution Date) between any Acquired Company and
its Affiliates, on the one hand, and any Acquired Companys customers or
suppliers on the other hand, that relate to engaging in any Restricted
Opportunity, as applicable, within the Restricted Area. Notwithstanding the
foregoing to the contrary, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ shall prevent
or otherwise restrict any Restricted Person from being employed by an employer
that engages in Restricted Opportunities in the Restricted Area so long as
such Restricted Persons job responsibilities do not include, and such
Restricted Person does not participate or engage, directly or indirectly,
including supervisory responsibility, in any such Restricted Opportunities in
the Restricted Area. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller and its
Affiliates may own, directly or indirectly, solely as an investment,
Securities of any Person traded on any national Securities exchange if the
Seller is not a controlling Person of, or a member of a group which controls,
such Person and does not, directly or indirectly, own five percent (5%) or
more of any class of Securities of such Person.

 

(b) For a period of two years commencing on the Closing Date, the Seller shall
not, and shall not permit any Restricted Persons to, directly or indirectly,
hire or solicit any Subject Employee or encourage or induce any such employee
to leave such employment or hire any such employee who has left such
employment or in any way interfere with the relationship between an Acquired
Company or its Affiliates and such employees, except (i) any solicitation or
hiring pursuant to a general solicitation that is not directed specifically to
such employees or (ii) after 180 days from the termination of employment, any
solicitation or hiring of any employee whose employment has been terminated
by the applicable Acquired Company or its Affiliates without cause.

 



49 (c) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.13_, the Buyer covenants and agrees that, as
an express incentive to induce the Seller to enter into this Agreement,
during the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the date that
is one year following the Closing Date, the Buyer will not, and will cause its
Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, solicit any employee of the Seller
or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company Service Providers) for
employment with any of the Acquired Companies or their Affiliates; provided,
that this  _Section_ __ _ 6.9(c)_ shall not preclude the Buyer or its
Affiliates from (i) any solicitation or hiring pursuant to a general
solicitation that is not directed specifically to such employees or (ii) after
180 days from the termination of employment, any solicitation or hiring of
any employee whose employment has been terminated by the Seller or its
Affiliates without cause.

 

(d) The Seller acknowledges that a breach or threatened breach of _Section_ __
_ 6.9(a)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 6.9(b)_ may give rise to irreparable harm to
the Buyer, and that the Buyer may seek equitable relief in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 11.16_, and the Buyer acknowledges that a breach or
threatened breach of _Section_ __ _ 6.9(c)_ may give rise to irreparable
harm to the Seller, and that the Seller may seek equitable relief in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 11.16_.

 

(e) The Parties acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this _Section_
__ _ 6.9_ are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests
of the Parties and constitute a material inducement to the Parties to enter
into this Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In the event that any covenant contained in this  _Section_ __ _
6.9_ should ever be adjudicated to exceed the time, scope or geographic
limitations permitted by applicable Law, then such provision shall be deemed
reformed to the maximum time, scope or geographic limitations permitted by
applicable Law.

Section 6.10 _Amendment to Schedules_. The Buyer agrees that, with respect to
the representations and warranties contained in _Article 3_ and _Article 4_ ,
the Seller shall have the continuing right until Closing to add, supplement or
amend the Schedules to its representations and warranties (including the
addition of schedules that are responsive to the representations and
warranties contained herein but for which no schedule is contemplated as of
the date hereof) with respect to any event, development, occurrence or non-
occurrence of an event hereafter first occurring, or any condition first
existing, after the Execution Date (and not resulting from the breach of any
of the covenants or agreements herein by the Seller), which, if such event had
occurred, or such condition had existed, prior to or on the Execution Date,
would have been required to be set forth or described in such Schedules (each,
a " _Schedule Supplement_ "). Subject to _Section_ __ _ 10.4(f)_, for all
purposes of this Agreement, including for purposes of determining whether the
conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ have been fulfilled, the
Schedules to the representations and warranties contained in _Article 3_ and
_Article 4_  shall be deemed to include only that information contained
therein on the Execution Date and shall be deemed to exclude all information
contained in the Schedule Supplement.

 



50 Section 6.11 _Casualty Loss_.

 

(a) If, after the Execution Date but prior to the Closing, all or any portion
of the Company Assets (i) are destroyed or damaged by fire, flood,
earthquake, storm, theft, vandalism, explosion, blowout, riot, sabotage,
accident or any other casualty of a similar nature (a " _Casualty Loss_ ") or
(ii) becomes subject to any condemnation or eminent domain proceeding (a "
_Condemnation_ "), then the Seller shall notify the Buyer promptly in writing
of such event (a " _Casualty Notice_ ").

 

(b) If the final Restoration Cost is less than $2,000,000 (the " _Restoration
Cost Threshold_ "), then at the Closing (i) the Buyer shall assume all risk
and loss associated with such Casualty Losses (and the Seller shall have no
liability for such Casualty Losses) and (ii) the Seller shall pay to the Buyer
all sums paid to the Seller or its Affiliates by third parties by reason of
such Casualty Loss with respect to the applicable Company Assets and shall
assign, transfer and set over to the Buyer or subrogate the Buyer to all of
the Sellers (or its applicable Affiliates) right, title and interest (if
any) in insurance claims, unpaid awards and other rights (in each case)
against third parties arising out of such Casualty Loss insofar as with
respect to the applicable Company Assets

 

(c) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(h) _and _Section_ __ _ 7.2(g)_, if the
final Restoration Cost exceeds the Restoration Cost Threshold, the Seller
shall elect, by notice to the Buyer within thirty (30) days after the
determination date of the final Restoration Cost, to either (i) reduce the
Unadjusted Purchase Price by the amount of the final Restoration Cost in
excess of the Restoration Cost Threshold or (ii) repair, replace or restore
the affected Company Asset, prior to Closing and at the Sellers sole cost and
expense, to a condition comparable in all material respects to such Company
Assets condition immediately prior to the Casualty Loss or Condemnation, as
applicable; _provided_ , that, all insurance proceeds received by the Seller,
any Acquired Company or their respective Affiliates, whether before or after
the Closing, will be retained by or promptly paid to the Seller upon receipt,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_.

 

(d) The occurrence of a Casualty Loss or Condemnation after the Execution Date
but prior to the Closing will not, in and of itself, be deemed a breach of
the Sellers representations and warranties, covenants or other obligations
under this Agreement absent some other breach of the representations and
warranties, covenants or other obligations of the Seller under this Agreement.

 

(e) In the event of any Casualty Loss or Condemnation, the Parties agree, as
applicable, to use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue claims and
collect any amounts to which an Acquired Company may be entitled under the
applicable insurance policies in respect of such Casualty Loss or
Condemnation.

 

Section 6.12 _No Solicitation of Other Bids_. From the Execution Date until
the earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement, the
Seller agrees that it will not, and shall cause its Affiliates or any of its
or their Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, engage in any
negotiations with any Person other than the Buyer and its Affiliates
regarding any Acquisition Proposals (as hereinafter defined) or solicit,
initiate, market, knowingly encourage or facilitate the submission of any
Acquisition Proposals from any Person other than the Buyer and its Affiliates;
_provided, however_ , that the Buyer hereby acknowledges that prior to the
Execution

 



51  Date, the Seller, its Affiliates and its and their respective
Representatives provided information relating to the Acquired Companies and
the Company Business and afforded access to, and engaged in discussions with,
other Persons in connection with an Acquisition Proposal. For purposes hereof,
" _Acquisition Proposal_ " will mean any inquiry, proposal or offer (whether
or not in writing) from any Person (other than the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates) concerning (i) a merger, consolidation, liquidation,
recapitalization, membership interest exchange or other business combination
transaction involving the Acquired Companies, (ii) the issuance
or acquisition of Securities in the Acquired Companies, or (iii) the sale,
lease, exchange or other disposition of any material portion of the Company
Assets outside of the Ordinary Course of Business.

 

Section 6.13 _Transferred Employees_. Prior to the Closing, the Buyer or its
Affiliate (a) shall make offers to each of the Company Service Providers
designated as a "Field Employee" on _Schedule_ __ _ 1.1(a)_ and (b) may make
offers to any of the Company Service Providers designated as a "Non-Field
Employee" on _Schedule 1.1(a)_ for employment with the Buyer or its Affiliate
on terms of employment (with respect to levels of compensation and benefits)
that are substantially similar in the aggregate to the terms of employment in
effect for such Company Service Providers in effect on the date hereof, and as
disclosed pursuant to the sentence below (the " _Employment Offers_ "). No
later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, to the extent not
previously provided, the Seller will provide the Buyer with the terms of
employment reasonably requested by the Buyer (including with respect to levels
of compensation and benefits) in effect for such Company Service Providers.
Each Employment Offer will comply with the requirements of Law and will
specify that, if the Employment Offer is accepted by the Company Service
Provider, such Company Service Providers employment with the Buyer or its
Affiliate (as applicable) will commence as of the Closing Date (the " _Start
Date_ "). As of the Start Date, each Company Service Provider who accepts an
Employment Offer and assumes employment with Buyer or its Affiliate (each, a
" _Transferred Employee_ ") will cease to be employed by the Seller and any of
its Affiliates, as applicable, and will assume employment with the Buyer or
its Affiliate (including, following the Start Date, any of the Acquired
Companies). If, after the Start Date, the Buyer or its Affiliate (including,
any Acquired Company), as applicable, elect to terminate the employment of any
such Company Service Provider at its discretion, it shall be responsible for
any associated WARN Act compliance with respect to such Company Service
Provider. This _Section_ __ _ 6.13_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to
the benefit of each of the Parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.13_, express or implied, shall confer upon any other Person
any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.13_. Nothing contained herein, express or implied, shall be
construed to establish, amend, or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement,
or arrangement. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 6.13_ shall not create any right of any employee or any
other Person to any continued employment with the Seller, the Buyer or any of
their respective Affiliates or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind
whatsoever. In addition, the Seller shall, and shall cause each of
its Affiliates to waive any applicable noncompetition, notice, or
confidentiality obligations with respect to any Transferred Employee to the
extent that such obligations would prohibit, delay or restrict him or her from
accepting an Employment Offer or performing the services required in his or
her employment with the Buyer or any of its Affiliates.

 



52 Section 6.14 _Access to Information_. From and after the Closing Date, the
Buyer will grant to the Seller (or its Representatives), access at all
reasonable times to all of the books, records, documents, instruments,
accounts, correspondence, writings, evidences of title and other papers and
electronic files relating to the business of the Acquired Companies (the "
_Records_ "), including the reasonable assistance of employees responsible for
maintaining such Records, and will afford the Seller the right to take
extracts therefrom and to make copies thereof, for such purposes as
determined by the Seller to be reasonably necessary, including investigating,
settling, preparing for, prosecuting, or defending any Claim or Legal
Proceeding, preparing reports to Securities holders and Governmental
Authorities, preparing and delivering accounting or other statements provided
for under this Agreement or otherwise, preparing Tax Returns, pursuing Tax
refunds, or responding to or disputing any Tax Proceeding, audit or the
determination of any matter relating to the rights and obligations of the
Seller, its members or any of their respective Affiliates under this Agreement
or any other Transaction Document or for such other purpose as the Seller may
reasonably request. The Buyer will maintain such Records until the seventh
anniversary of the Closing Date (or for such longer period of time as the
Seller may reasonably determine is necessary in order to have the Records
available with respect to Tax matters), or if any of the Records pertain
to any Claim or dispute pending on the seventh anniversary of the Closing
Date, the Buyer will maintain any of the Records designated by the Seller or
its Representatives until such Claim or dispute is finally resolved and the
time for all appeals has been exhausted. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the Seller will be entitled to retain a copy of the Records
after the Closing.

 

Section 6.15 _Insurance Matters_.

 

(a) The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the Closing Date
(i) the Seller or its Affiliates may terminate coverage for any claims made
after the Closing Date with respect to the properties and assets of the
Acquired Companies under any claims made insurance policies maintained by the
Seller or its Affiliates or with respect to which any Acquired Company or
Company Asset is a named insured or otherwise the beneficiary of coverage
under such claims made insurance policies (the " _Seller Claims Made Insurance
Policies_ "), and (ii) none of the properties or assets of the Acquired
Companies will be covered under Seller Claims Made Insurance Policies
following the Closing Date.

(b) The Buyer and its respective Affiliates shall be entitled to make and
enforce any claims, and receive and retain any and all amounts paid to insured
Persons, pursuant to any Seller Claims Made Insurance Policy in respect of any
insurance claim thereunder relating to the conduct of the business of the
Acquired Companies or the Company Assets prior to the Closing Date.

(c) In addition to the foregoing, from and after the Closing Date, the Buyer
and its respective Affiliates shall be entitled to make and enforce any
claims, and receive and retain any and all amounts paid to insured Persons,
pursuant to any insurance policies (other than any Seller Claims Made
Insurance Policies) maintained by the Seller or its Affiliates or with
respect to which any Acquired Company or Company Asset is a named insured or
otherwise the beneficiary of coverage under such policies in respect of any
insurance claim thereunder relating to the conduct of the business of the
Acquired Companies or the Company Assets.

 



53 Section 6.16 _D andO Coverage_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Acquired Companies shall purchase a "tail"
policy of directors and officers liability insurance covering acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing with respect to the Seller, and
the Seller and the Acquired Companies respective members, shareholders,
partners, directors, officers, managers, employees, representatives, and
agents for six (6) years after the Closing, which policy shall contain
coverage, terms and conditions satisfactory to the Seller (such policy or
policies, the " _D andO Policy_").

 

(b) For a period of six (6) years following the Closing, the Buyer shall not,
and shall cause the Acquired Companies not to, make any alteration or
amendment to any directors or officers liability insurance or to provisions
under the Organizational Documents of the Acquired Companies or any
indemnification agreements to which any Acquired Company is a party that,
in either case, would negatively affect coverage, exculpation or
indemnification of the Seller or any of the Sellers Affiliates or any of
their respective members, shareholders, partners, directors, officers,
managers, employees, representatives, or agents (collectively, the " _Member
Indemnified Persons_ "). The Buyer shall, and shall cause the Acquired
Companies to, require any successor to any Acquired Company (whether by
merger, purchase or otherwise) to be bound by the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.16_, it being the intent of the Buyer and the Seller that
the Member Indemnified Persons shall continue to be entitled to such coverage,
exculpation and indemnification to the greatest extent permitted under the
Laws of the State of Delaware.

(c) The obligations of the Buyer under this _Section_ __ _ 6.16 _shall not
be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Person
to whom this _Section_ __ _ 6.16_ applies without the consent of the affected
Person, it being expressly agreed that each Person to whom this _Section_ __
_ 6.16_ applies shall be a third party beneficiary of this _Section_ __ _
6.16_.

 

Section 6.17 _Company Guarantees_. As soon as practicable after the Execution
Date, the Buyer will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from the
respective beneficiaries, effective as of the Closing, the release of the
Seller and its Affiliates from any of the Company Guarantees listed in
_Schedule_ __ _ 6.17_. From and after the Closing, the Buyer shall cause the
Acquired Companies to indemnify and hold harmless the Seller and its
Affiliates against any Losses incurred or suffered by the Seller or any of its
Affiliates pursuant to or arising out of the Company Guarantees listed in 
_Schedule 6.17_. Neither the Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall have any
obligation to keep any such Company Guarantees in effect from and after the
Closing.

 

Section 6.18 _Use of Name and Seller_ __ _s Marks_.

 

(a) With respect to the phase-out of the use of the names, business names,
trade names, brand names, registered and unregistered trademarks, logos,
service marks or any other similar Intellectual Property (or any variation or
derivative of such names, business names, trade names, brand names, registered
and unregistered trademarks, logos, service marks or any other similar
Intellectual Property confusingly similar thereto) of the Seller or any of its
Affiliates, including the use of the name or trademarks of "Saddle Butte"
(collectively, the " _Seller s Marks_"), the Buyer agrees as follows: (i) as
soon as practicable following the Closing, but in no event later than seven
(7) days after the Closing, the Buyer shall file the documentation to, and

practicable following the Closing, but in no event later than forty-five (45)
days after the Closing, the Buyer shall, and after the Closing shall cause the
Acquired Companies to, cease and permanently discontinue any and all uses of
any of the Sellers Marks and any colorable imitations thereof, and remove or

provide the Seller with written confirmation thereof. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Buyer shall have a period of up to six (6) months from the
Closing to cause the Acquired Companies to permanently remove the Sellers
Marks from pipeline markers on the assets of the Acquired Companies.

 

(b) In no event shall the Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, after
Closing, the Acquired Companies) use any of the Sellers Marks after the
Closing in any manner or for any purpose different from the use of the
Sellers Marks by the Acquired Companies preceding the Closing, and none of
them shall affix or include any of the Sellers Marks, or any colorable
imitations thereof, on any publications, signage, corporate letterhead,
invoices, stationery, business cards, marketing materials, website content or
other materials that are created or produced after the Closing. The Buyer, for
itself and its Affiliates (including, after Closing, the Acquired Companies),
agrees that, after the Closing Date, the Buyer and its Affiliates (including,
after Closing, the Acquired Companies) will not do business or represent
themselves as having any affiliation or business relationship with the Seller
or any Affiliates of the Seller, except pursuant to any separate agreement
entered into, or assumed by, the Buyer or its Affiliates on one hand, and the
Seller or its Affiliates, on the other hand.

 

(c) The Buyer expressly acknowledges and confirms that the Seller is not
transferring or assigning, and the Buyer shall not receive, any right, title
or interest in or to the Sellers Marks, except the limited right to use for
the sole purpose of permitting the Buyer to complete the phase-out in strict
compliance with this  _Section_ __ _ 6.18_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein or in the other Transaction Documents, prior to the Closing
Date, the Seller shall be permitted to cause the Acquired Companies to assign
and transfer to the Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Acquired
Companies) any and all right, title and interest that any of the Acquired
Companies have or may have in or to the Sellers Marks, including any goodwill
therein. Furthermore, all use of the Sellers Marks hereunder during the
phase-out period shall be at all times subject to the direction and control of
the Seller and any and all use thereof by the Buyer or the Acquired Companies
hereunder shall inure to the exclusive benefit of the Seller, and the Buyer
shall, and after the Closing shall cause the Acquired Companies to, comply
with the applicable Sellers instructions and direction at all times.

remedy and (iii) not to assert that a remedy of specific performance is
unenforceable, invalid or contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, or to
assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy.
Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that such right of the Buyer of
specific performance under _Section_ __ _ 9.3(a)_ is an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, the Buyer
would not have entered into this Agreement.

survive for two (2) years after the Closing Date) will survive for fifteen
(15) months from the Closing Date. The covenants and agreements of the Parties
contained in this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents will survive
the Closing in accordance with their terms; _provided_ that the right of any
Party to make a claim for breach of any covenant of a Party that is (a) to be
performed or satisfied at or before the Closing, will survive for fifteen (15)
months after the Closing Date or (b) to be performed or satisfied after the
Closing, will terminate thirty (30) days following the satisfaction or
performance of such covenant.

 



66 Section 10.2 _Indemnification by the Seller_. Subject to the limitations on
recourse and recovery set forth in this _Article 10_ , from and after the
Closing, the Seller will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Buyer, the
Acquired Companies and each of their respective Affiliates and each of their
respective officers, directors, managers, members, partners and employees
(the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and all Losses
imposed upon or incurred in connection with, arising out of or resulting from:

 

(a) the inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty made by the
Seller in _Article 3_ or _Article 4_ of this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document;

(b) any non-fulfillment or breach by the Seller of any covenant or agreement
on the part of the Seller contained in this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document;

(c) Seller Taxes; and

 

(d) Transaction Expenses (other than those taken into account in determining
the Adjustment Amount).

 

Section 10.3 _Indemnification by Buyer_. Subject to the limitations on
recourse and recovery set forth in this _Article 10_ , from and after the

upon or incurred in connection with, arising out of or resulting from:

(a) the inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty made by the
Buyer in _Article 5_ of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document;

made by the Buyer under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document; and

(c) any Taxes imposed by any applicable Laws on or with respect to the
Acquired Companies from and after the Effective Time other than Seller Taxes.

Section 10.4  _Limitations_.

(a) None of the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to assert any
right to indemnification under  _Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)_ with respect to any
breach of representation or warranty of the Seller (other than any Fundamental
Representations, Specified Representations or the representations and
warranties set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 3.13_) with respect to a claim or
series of related claims if such claim or series of related claims arising out
of the same set of facts or circumstances where the Losses related thereto are
less than $75,000 (each, a " _De Minimis Loss_ "). The Seller will not have
liability pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)_ with respect to any breach of
representation or warranty of the Seller (other than any Fundamental
Representations, Specified Representations or the representations and
warranties set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.13_) until the aggregate amount of
all Losses, not including any De Minimis Losses, incurred by the Buyer 

 



67  Indemnified Parties with respect to such matters exceeds one percent (1%) of
the Unadjusted Purchase Price (the " _Deductible_ "), in which case the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall have the right to seek indemnification for all
Losses in excess of, but not including, the Deductible (it being understood
that any Claim (including any related Claims) for amounts less than the De
Minimis Loss shall be ignored in determining whether the Deductible has been
exceeded); _provided_ , _however_ , that the limitations set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 10.4(a)_ shall not apply to Losses based on breaches of the
Fundamental Representations, Specified Representations or the representations
and warranties set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.13_.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary but
except for any Fraud on the part of any Seller Indemnified Party, the Sellers
aggregate liability under _Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)_ with respect to any breach
of representation or warranty of the Seller (other than any Fundamental
Representations, Specified Representations or the representations and
warranties set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.13_) shall be limited to the amount
then remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Fund (the " _Indemnity Cap_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnity Cap shall not apply to Losses
based on breaches of the Fundamental Representations, Specified
Representations or the representations and warranties set forth in _Section_
__ _ 3.13_. Except for any Fraud on the part of any Seller Indemnified Party,
the aggregate liability of the Seller with respect to indemnifiable Losses
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)_ (including Losses based upon a breach
of a Fundamental Representation, Specified Representation and the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.13_), 
_Section_ __ _ 10.2(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 10.2(c)_ and _Section_ __ _
10.2(d)_ shall be limited to the amount of the aggregate Purchase Price
actually received by the Seller.

 

(c) No indemnifying Person will be liable for any Losses that are subject to
indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 10.2_ or  _Section_ __ _ 10.3_ unless
a written demand for indemnification under this Agreement is delivered by the
indemnified Person to the indemnifying Person with respect thereto prior to
5:00 P.M. Central Time on the date pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 10.1_ on
which the survival period of the applicable representations and warranties or
covenants expires, to assert a Claim for indemnification describing such Claim
in reasonable detail. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Claim for
indemnification under this Agreement that is duly brought prior to such time
will survive until such matter is finally resolved.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
under no circumstances will any Party or any of its Affiliates be entitled to
recover more than one time for any Loss under this Agreement, and to the
extent a Party or any of its Affiliates is compensated for specific Losses
through the adjustments provided for in _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ or otherwise,
such Party and its Affiliates will not have a separate right to
indemnification for such Losses. Without limiting the generality of the prior
sentence, if a set of facts, conditions or events constitutes a breach of more
than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that is subject to
the indemnification obligations under this _Article 10_ , as applicable, only
one recovery of Losses shall be allowed, and in no event shall there be any
indemnification or duplication or recovery of Losses under different
provisions of this Agreement, including without limitation, to the extent such
Losses are taken into account and actually included in the calculation of the
Adjustment Amount; _provided_ that each Buyer Indemnified Party and Seller
Indemnified Party may have separate and distinct Losses arising out of any
particular set of facts, conditions or events.

 



68 (e) Notwithstanding anything in this _Article 10_ to the contrary and except
for any Fraud on the part of any Seller Indemnified Party, recovery against
the Indemnity Escrow Fund constitutes the Buyer Indemnified Parties sole and
exclusive remedy following the Closing for any and all Losses under 
_Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the limitations set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 10.4(e)_ shall not apply to Losses based on
breaches of the Fundamental Representations, the Specified Representations or
the representations and warranties set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.13_. For
Losses based on breach of any representations and warranties (other than the
Fundamental Representations, the Specified Representations and the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.13)_ and
indemnifiable Losses pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)_ arising thereunder,
to the extent a monetary obligation or payment is due and owing by the Seller
to any Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to this _Article 10_ , the Buyer
Indemnified Parties sole recourse for payment shall be against the Indemnity
Escrow Fund until the Indemnity Escrow Fund is exhausted or has been fully
and finally disbursed. For Losses based on breaches of the representations and
warranties set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.4(b)_ (excluding _clause (ii)_
thereof) and indemnifiable Losses pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)_
arising thereunder, to the extent a monetary obligation or payment is due and
owing by the Seller to any Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to this _Article
10_ , the Buyer Indemnified Parties first recourse for payment shall be
against the Indemnity Escrow Fund until the Indemnity Escrow Fund is exhausted
or has been fully and finally disbursed. For any other indemnifiable Losses
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.2_, to the extent a monetary obligation or
payment is due and owing by the Seller to any Buyer Indemnified Parties
pursuant to this _Article 10_ , the Buyer Indemnified Parties recourse for
payment shall first be against Seller; _provided, however_ , to the extent
that Buyer Indemnified Parties have not asserted or are entitled to any
indemnified Losses based on breach of any representations and warranties
(other than the Fundamental Representations, the Specified Representations
and the representations and warranties set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.13_) and
indemnifiable Losses pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)_ arising thereunder
after the date fifteen (15) months from the Closing Date, either Party may
elect to have any indemnifiable Losses of Buyer Indemnified Parties from
Seller or the Indemnity Escrow Fund.

 

(f) The right to indemnification or other remedy based on any of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in this Agreement shall
not be affected by any investigation or audit conducted with respect to, or
any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether
before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing
Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any
such representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement; _provided_ , _however_
, that notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, neither Party shall be liable under this
_Article 10_ for any Losses based upon or arising out of any inaccuracy in or
breach of any of the representations or warranties of the other Party
contained in this Agreement if (i) the other Party had Knowledge of such
inaccuracy or breach prior to the Closing and (ii) such other Party had the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ as a result
of such breach or inaccuracy.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if there has
been a breach of any representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement for which any Person is entitled to indemnification under this
_Article 10_ , for the purposes of determining the breach of any
representations and warranties and calculating the amount of any Losses in
connection therewith, any dollar, materiality, material adverse effect,
Material Adverse Effect or Buyer Material Adverse Effect qualifiers in such
representations or warranties shall be disregarded.

 



69 (h) Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, the Buyer and the Seller
hereby waive any and all rights to rescind, reform, cancel, terminate, revoke
or void this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided_ , _however_ , each Party shall have the right to specific
performance and other equitable remedies available at law or equity
(including injunctive relief) for the breach or failure of the other Party to
perform its obligations required to be performed after the Closing.

 

Section 10.5 _Claims Procedures_.

 

(a) Promptly after receipt by any indemnified Person of notice of the
commencement or assertion of any Claim or Legal Proceeding by a third party
or circumstances which, with the lapse of time, such indemnified Person
believes is likely to give rise to a Claim or Legal Proceeding by a third
party or of facts causing any indemnified Person to believe it has a Claim for
indemnification hereunder (an " _Asserted Liability_ "), such indemnified
Person will give prompt written notice thereof (the " _Claim Notice_ ") to the
relevant indemnifying Person; _provided_ that in any event, such
indemnified Person will give the Claim Notice to the indemnifying Person no
later than sixty (60) days after becoming aware of such Asserted Liability. As
long as the Claim Notice is given in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 10.4(c)_,
the failure to so notify the indemnifying Person will not relieve the
indemnifying Person of its obligations or liability hereunder, except to the
extent such failure prejudices the indemnifying Person. The Claim Notice will
describe the Asserted Liability in reasonable detail, and will indicate the
amount (estimated, if necessary) of the Loss that has been or may be suffered.
The indemnified Person and the indemnifying Person agree to keep each other
reasonably appraised of any additional information concerning any Asserted
Liability.

(b) As to an Asserted Liability arising from a third-party action, if the
indemnifying Party irrevocably admits its liability hereunder to fully
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the indemnified Person(s), the
indemnifying Person will be, subject to the limitations set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 10.5_, entitled to assume control of and appoint lead counsel
for such defense only for as long as it conducts such defense with reasonable
diligence. The indemnifying Person will keep the indemnified Persons advised
of the status of such third-party action and the defense thereof on a
reasonably current basis and will consider in good faith the recommendations
made by the indemnified Persons with respect thereto. If the indemnifying
Person assumes the control of the defense of any third-party action
in accordance with the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 10.5_, the
indemnified Person will be entitled to participate in the defense of any such
third-party action and to engage, at its expense, separate counsel of its
choice for such purpose, it being understood, however, that the indemnifying
Person will continue to control such defense; _provided_ that notwithstanding
the foregoing, the indemnifying Person will pay the reasonable costs and
expenses of such defense (including reasonable attorneys fees) of the
indemnified Persons if (x) the indemnified Persons outside counsel will have
reasonably concluded and advised in writing (with a copy to the indemnifying
Person) that 

 



70  there are defenses available to such indemnified Person that are different
from or additional to those available to the indemnifying Person, or (y) the
indemnified Persons outside counsel will have advised in writing (with a
copy to the indemnifying Person) the indemnified Person that there is a
conflict of interest that would make it inappropriate under applicable
standards of professional conduct to have common counsel for the indemnifying
Person and the indemnified Person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
indemnifying Person will obtain the prior written consent of the indemnified
Person before entering into any settlement, compromise, admission or
acknowledgement of the validity of such Asserted Liability if the settlement
requires an admission of guilt or wrongdoing on the part of the indemnified
Person, subjects the indemnified Person to criminal liability, does not
unconditionally release the indemnified Person from all liabilities and
obligations with respect to such Asserted Liability or the settlement imposes
injunctive or other equitable relief against, or any continuing obligation or
payment requirement on, the indemnified Person or its Affiliates or, in the
case of any Buyer Indemnified Party, would limit or impact the ownership or
operation of the Company Business.

(c) Each Party will cooperate in the defense or prosecution of any Asserted
Liability arising from a third-party action and will furnish or cause to be
furnished such records, information and testimony (subject to any applicable
confidentiality agreement and to the extent such cooperation would not be
reasonably likely to violate any agreement binding on such Party or would be
reasonably likely to result in the wavier of any legal privilege), and attend
such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals as may
be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

(d) In the case of a Claim not based upon a third party action (" _Direct
Claim_ "), the indemnifying Person shall have forty-five (45) days from its
receipt of the Claim Notice to either (i) admit its obligation to provide
indemnification or (ii) dispute the Claim for indemnification, and provide a
written explanation for its position and supporting documentation. In the
event that the indemnifying Person disputes a Claim Notice for a Direct Claim,
the Parties, including appropriate management representatives, shall promptly
seek to negotiate a resolution in good faith. If the Parties are unable to
resolve the dispute within ninety (90) days after the indemnifying Person
first receives the Claim Notice for a Direct Claim, then the indemnified
Person may seek any remedy available to it under this Agreement. If the
indemnifying Person fails to respond to the Claim Notice relating to a Direct
Claim within such 45-day period, then the indemnifying Person shall be
conclusively deemed to reject and dispute any obligation to provide indemnity
for any and all costs and expenses relating to the Direct Claim referenced in
the Claim Notice.

 

(e) With respect to any Direct Claims, the indemnifying Person shall pay an
indemnification payment due under this _Article 10_ to the indemnified Person
within five (5) Business Days after it is established (by final nonappealable
court Order or agreement of the Parties) that the indemnified Person is
entitled to such payment under this _Article 10_. If a Claim involves an
undisputed and disputed portion, the indemnifying Person will promptly pay the
undisputed portion, and the disputed portion will be paid as, if and when
determined.

 

Section 10.6 _Waiver of Remedies_.

 

(a) THE PARTIES HEREBY AGREE THAT FROM AND AFTER THE CLOSING NO PARTY WILL
HAVE ANY LIABILITY, AND NO PARTY WILL (AND EACH PARTY WILL CAUSE ITS
RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES NOT TO) MAKE ANY CLAIM, FOR ANY LOSS OR ANY OTHER
MATTER, UNDER, RELATING TO OR

 



71  ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING BREACH OF REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY,
COVENANT OR AGREEMENT) OR ANY OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT
LIABILITY, OTHER LAW OR OTHERWISE, EXCEPT FOR ANY ACTS OF FRAUD BY ANY PERSON
OR ANY CLAIM FOR INDEMNIFICATION PURSUANT TO THIS _ARTICLE 10_ , AND EXCEPT IN
THE EVENT OF ANY ACTS OF FRAUD BY ANY PERSON, THIS  _ARTICLE 10_ SETS FORTH
THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO THE PARTIES AND ANY OTHER PERSON
ENTITLED TO INDEMNIFICATION HEREUNDER RELATING TO THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, SUBJECT TO  _SECTION_ __ _ 6.11_, _SECTION_
__ _ 6.16_ AND _SECTION_ __ _ 11.16_.

(b) IN FURTHERANCE OF THE FOREGOING, EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES AND RELEASES
FROM AND AFTER THE CLOSING, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER LAW, AND
AGREES NOT TO SUE, FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS (OTHER THAN CLAIMS FOR EQUITABLE
RELIEF RELATED TO THE BREACH OF ANY COVENANT OR AGREEMENT OF A PARTY
CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT REQUIRING PERFORMANCE AFTER THE CLOSING OR ANY
ACTS OF FRAUD BY ANY PERSON) THE OTHER PARTY OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, MAY
HAVE AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, OR ANY OF THEIR
RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, MANAGERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR ADVISORS
RELATING TO OR ARISING FROM (I) THE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS AND THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED THEREBY, OR (II) THE COMPANY BUSINESS, THE MEMBERSHIP
INTERESTS, OR THE ASSETS OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY
ASSETS, OR (III) ANY ACTIONS OR OMISSIONS BY ANY OFFICER, DIRECTOR OR EMPLOYEE
OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES, THE SELLER OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, IN SUCH
PERSONS CAPACITY AS SUCH, OR BY THE SELLER, IN ITS CAPACITY AS A MEMBER OF
THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES PRIOR TO THE CLOSING, PROVIDED ANY SUCH ACTIONS WERE
TAKEN OR OMISSIONS WERE AVOIDED, IN EACH CASE, IN GOOD FAITH, EXCEPT FOR ANY
ACTS OF FRAUD BY ANY PERSON OR PURSUANT TO THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS SET
FORTH IN THIS _ARTICLE 10_ AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT,
STRICT LIABILITY, OTHER LAW OR OTHERWISE AND WHETHER OR NOT ARISING FROM THE
SELLERS OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE,
STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT.

(c) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, NO PARTY NOR
ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES WILL BE LIABLE FOR THE FOLLOWING (" __ _NON-REIMBURSABLE
DAMAGES_ __"): INDIRECT DAMAGES, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL
(UNLESS PROBABLE AND REASONABLY FORESEEABLE CONSEQUENCES OF THE RELEVANT
BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT) DAMAGES OR LOST PROFITS, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT,
TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OTHER LAW OR OTHERWISE AND WHETHER OR NOT ARISING FROM
THE OTHER PARTY S OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT
NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT AND/OR THE

 



72  TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND EACH OF BUYER AND SELLER, FOR ITSELF
AND ON BEHALF OF THEIR RESPECTIVE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, RESPECTIVELY, HEREBY
EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO INDIRECT DAMAGES, CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES,
SPECIAL DAMAGES, EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR LOST PROFITS UNDER OR
IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY;
_PROVIDED, HOWEVER_ , THAT THIS _SECTION 10.6(c)_  SHALL NOT LIMIT A PARTYS
RIGHT TO RECOVERY UNDER THIS _ARTICLE 10_ FOR ANY SUCH DAMAGES TO THE EXTENT
SUCH PARTY IS REQUIRED TO PAY SUCH DAMAGES TO AN UNAFFILIATED THIRD PARTY IN
CONNECTION WITH A MATTER FOR WHICH SUCH PARTY IS OTHERWISE ENTITLED TO
INDEMNIFICATION UNDER THIS _ARTICLE 10_.

Section 10.7 _Determination of Amount of Damages; Mitigation_ (a). The amount
of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this _Article 10_
will be limited to the Losses suffered by the indemnified Person and will be
computed net of (i) any insurance or other proceeds actually received by
the indemnified Person in connection with such Losses, (ii) any indemnity,
contribution or other similar payment the indemnified Person actually received
from any Person with respect to such Loss, and (iii) any other payment or
monetary recoupment received, realized or retained by the indemnified Person
as a result of the events giving rise to the Claim. Any indemnified Person
that becomes aware of Losses for which it intends to seek indemnification
hereunder will use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue claims and
collect any amounts to which it may be entitled under insurance policies or
from third parties (pursuant to indemnification agreements or otherwise) and
will use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate such Losses; _provided_
that the indemnified Person will promptly notify either (i) the Seller, if
such indemnified Person is the Buyer, or (ii) the Buyer, if such indemnified
Person is the Seller, in each case, of any efforts to mitigate. If any third-
party recovery or insurance recovery is realized after having previously
received indemnity Claim proceeds hereunder, such indemnified Person will
promptly tender to the respective indemnifying Person an amount equal to
such third-party recovery or insurance recovery equal to the amount of the
indemnity Claim proceeds paid by the indemnifying Person.

Party will bear its own expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement

77 Section 11.12 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Schedules

relating to the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The Parties have
voluntarily agreed to define their rights, liabilities and obligations
respecting the sale and purchase of the Membership Interests exclusively in
contract pursuant to the express terms and provisions of this Agreement. The
Parties expressly disclaim they are owed any duties or are entitled to any
remedies not expressly set forth in this Agreement, and each acknowledge that

Agreement have been inserted for convenience of reference only and will not

Section 11.17 _No Inducements_. No director, employee, or agent of any Party
will give or receive any commission, fee, rebate, gift or entertainment of
significant cost or value in connection with this Agreement.

Section 11.18 _No Partnership_. This Agreement does not give rise now or in
the future to an agency or partnership relationship among the Seller and its
Affiliates, on one hand, and the Buyer and its Affiliates, on the other hand.
It is not the intention of the Parties to form, 

 



78  and nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as forming, a partnership
or joint venture among the Buyer and the Seller. Each Party agrees that the
Seller, on one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand, have not been, are not
will not be a fiduciary, partner or joint venturer to the other or to any of
the Buyers or the Sellers Affiliates, as applicable, and each Party agrees
not to assert that the Seller, on one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand,
have ever acted as a fiduciary with respect to any aspect of the activities
contemplated herein. Except in the case of Fraud by and Person, each Party
agrees not to assert that (a) it did not understand, (b) it mistakenly
signed, (c) it signed under duress or coercion, (d) it lacks mental or other
capacity, (e) one Party has discriminated against the other Party in any way
or (f) it has made any representations or has any understanding or agreement
other than as set forth in this Agreement, which fully recites all agreements
between the Parties.

 

Section 11.19 _Conflict Waiver; Attorney-Client Privilege_. Each of the
Parties acknowledges and agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its
directors, managers, members, shareholders, partners, officers, employees and
Affiliates, that:

(a) Locke Lord LLP has acted as counsel to the Seller and its Affiliates
(individually and collectively, the " _Seller Group_ "), and the Acquired
Companies in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Buyer agrees, and shall cause the Acquired Companies
to agree, that, following consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, such representation and any prior representation of the Acquired
Companies by Locke Lord LLP (or any successor) (the " _Seller Group Law Firm_
") shall not preclude the Seller Group Law Firm from serving as counsel to the
Seller Group or any director, member, shareholder, partner, officer
or employee of the Seller Group, in connection with any litigation, claim or
obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

(b) The Buyer shall not, and shall cause the Acquired Companies not to, seek
or have the Seller Group Law Firm disqualified from any representation of the
Seller in connection with the negotiation or consummation of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby based upon the prior representation of
the Acquired Companies by the Seller Group Law Firm. Each of the
Parties hereby consents thereto and waives any conflict of interest arising
from such prior representation in connection with the negotiation or
consummation of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and
each of such parties shall cause any of its Affiliates to consent to waive
any conflict of interest arising from such representation. Each of the Parties
acknowledges that such consent and waiver is voluntary, that it has been
carefully considered, and that the Parties have consulted with counsel or
have been advised they should do so in connection herewith. The covenants,
consent and waiver contained in this _Section_ __ _ 11.19_ shall not be
deemed exclusive of any other rights to which the Seller Group Law Firm is
entitled whether pursuant to law, contract or otherwise.

(c) All communications between the Seller Group or the Acquired Companies, on
the one hand, and the Seller Group Law Firm, on the other hand, relating to
the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (the "
_Privileged Communications_ ") shall be deemed to be attorney-client
privileged and the expectation of client confidence relating thereto shall
belong solely to the Seller Group and shall not pass to or be claimed by the
Buyer or the Acquired 

 



79  Companies. Accordingly, the Buyer and the Acquired Companies shall not have
access to any Privileged Communications or to the files of the Seller Group
Law Firm relating to the negotiation or consummation of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby from and after the Closing. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, from and after the Closing, (i) the Seller
Group (and not the Buyer or the Acquired Companies) shall be the sole holders
of the attorney-client privilege with respect to such engagement, and none of
the Buyer or the Acquired Companies shall be a holder thereof, (ii) to the
extent that files of the Seller Group Law Firm in respect of such engagement
constitute property of the client, only the Seller Group (and neither the
Buyer nor the Acquired Companies) shall hold such property rights and (iii)
Seller Group Law Firm shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any
such attorney-client communications or files to the Buyer or the Acquired
Companies by reason of any attorney-client relationship between the Seller
Group Law Firm and the Acquired Companies or otherwise. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between the Buyer or its
Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies), on the one hand, and a third
party other than any of the Seller Group, on the other hand, the Buyer and its
Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) may assert the attorney-client
privilege to prevent disclosure of Privileged Communications to such third
party. In the event that the Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including any of
the Acquired Companies) is legally required by an Order or otherwise legally
required to access or obtain a copy of all or a portion of the Privileged
Communications, to the extent (x) permitted by applicable Law, and (y)
advisable in the written opinion of the Buyers counsel, then the Buyer
shall immediately (and, in any event, within five (5) Business Days) notify
the Seller in writing so that the Seller can seek a protective order.

 

(d) This Section is intended for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
the Seller Group Law Firm. This  _Section_ __ _ 11.19_ shall be irrevocable,
and no term of this _Section_ __ _ 11.19_ may be amended, waived or modified,
without the prior written consent of the Seller Group Law Firm.

 

Section 11.20 _Non-Recourse_. Except in connection with any acts or omissions
of Fraud or fraudulent conveyance, this Agreement may only be enforced
against, and any claim or cause of action based upon, arising under, out of,
or in connection with, or related in any manner to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby may only be brought against, the entities
that are expressly named as Parties in the preamble of this Agreement (the "
_Contracting Parties_ ") and then only with respect to the specific
obligations set forth herein with respect to such Contracting Party. Except
in connection with any acts or omissions of Fraud or fraudulent conveyance, no
Person that is not a Contracting Party, including any past, present or future
Representative or Affiliate of any Contracting Party or any Affiliate of any
of the foregoing (each, a " _Nonparty Affiliate_ "), shall have any liability
(whether in contract, tort, at law or in equity, or granted by statute or
otherwise) for any claims, causes or action or other obligations or
liabilities arising under, out of, or in connection with, or related in any
manner to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or based on,
in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or its negotiation,
execution, performance or breach. To the maximum extent permitted by
applicable Law, except in connection with any acts or omissions of Fraud or
fraudulent conveyance, (a) each Contracting Party hereby waives and releases
all such liabilities, claims, causes of action and other obligations and
liabilities against any such Nonparty Affiliates, (b) each Contracting Party
hereby waives and releases any and all rights, claims, demands, or causes of
action that may otherwise be available to avoid or disregard the entity

 



80  form of a Contracting Party or otherwise impose liability of a Contracting
Party on any Nonparty Affiliate, whether granted by statute or based on
theories of equity, agency, control, instrumentality, alter ego, domination,
sham, single business enterprise, piercing the veil, unfairness,
undercapitalization, or otherwise, and (c) each Contracting Party disclaims
any reliance upon any Nonparty Affiliates with respect to the performance of
this Agreement or any representation or warranty made in, in connection with,
or as an inducement to this Agreement.

 

Section 11.21 _Seller Release_. Effective upon the Closing, the Seller agrees,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to agree, that under no circumstance
shall the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries bring any Legal Proceeding against
any Acquired Company or any of its officers, managers, directors or employees
arising out of any breach of the representations and warranties or covenants
made by the Seller under this Agreement (including representations and
warranties and/or covenants made in respect of the Acquired Companies). The
Seller understands and hereby agrees, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
to agree, that the release under this _Section_ __ _ 11.21_ shall remain
effective in all respects notwithstanding the existence of additional or
different facts and legal theories or the discovery of those additional or
different facts or legal theories.

Section 11.22 _Invalid Provisions_. If any provision of this Agreement is held
to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future Law, and
if the rights or obligations of any Party under this Agreement will not be
materially and adversely affected thereby, then (a) such provision shall be
fully severable, (b) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if
such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part
hereof, (c) the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision or by its severance herefrom and (d) in lieu of such
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there shall be added
automatically as a part of this Agreement a legal, valid and
enforceable provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision as may be possible.
