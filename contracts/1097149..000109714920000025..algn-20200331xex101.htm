respective recipient's account (which is to be notified without undue delay by

reasonably be expected to make it more difficult to consummate, or otherwise
prevent, delay or interfere with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement.

The Purchaser may waive the fulfillment of the Closing Condition set forth in
Section 9.1, in whole or in part, by written notice to the Seller. The effect

and 10.2(h) may be unilaterally waived in writing by the Seller, and (ii) each
of the Closing Actions pursuant to Sections 10.2(c), 10.2(d) and 10.2(e) may

the relevant Closing Action (or parts thereof) shall be fulfilled as soon as possible, and the
waiving Party shall be entitled to request such due performance after the

(Governing Law and Place of Jurisdiction) and 25 (Severability) of this
Agreement shall also survive and remain in full force and effect after a
termination of this Agreement.

11.Seller's Guarantees

a.The Parties have intensively discussed and negotiated if and to what extent
the Seller shall be liable for defects relating to the Sold Shares, the
Shareholder Loan Receivable, the Group and the Business and have decided to
depart from the statutory warranties regarding a sale (gesetzliche Kaufgewahrleistung). Instead, they have agreed to replace the
statutory system and provide for an independent catalogue of specific rights
of the Purchaser individually agreed between the Parties as set forth in
Sections 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15. Subject to the limitations of liabilities and
the explicit restrictions and exclusions of certain legal rights agreed in
this Agreement, the Seller represents and warrants to the Purchaser by way of
an independent promise of guarantee (selbstandiges Garantieversprechen)
pursuant to section 311 paragraph 1 BGB that the statements set out in
Sections 11.2 to 11.5 and in 11.6 and Exhibit 11.6 (each a "Seller's
Guarantee" and together the "Seller's Guarantees" and the Seller's Guarantees
pursuant to Sections 11.2 through 11.5 the "Fundamental Guarantees") are true
and correct as at the Signing Date and the Fundamental Guarantees also as of
the Closing Date, unless a different date is set out in the relevant Seller's
Guarantee, whereby it is understood and agreed by the Parties that:

(i)the Seller's Guarantees and the Tax Warranties shall be the sole and
exclusive guarantees (i.e. there shall be no other guarantees, confirmations
or assurances) by the Seller under or in connection with this Agreement;

(ii)the Seller's Guarantees and the Tax Warranties are given on the grounds
(Geschaftsgrundlage) that for the purpose of giving the Seller's Guarantees
and the Tax Warranties (i) the Seller may not have first-hand knowledge with
respect to the subject matters of the Seller's Guarantees set forth in Exhibit
11.6 or the Tax Warranties and, except as explicitly and specifically set out
in Section 11.7, neither the Seller nor any of its managers (gerant),
employees or advisors have independently examined or verified the underlying
facts, matters, circumstances or statements made in such Seller's Guarantees
set forth in Exhibit 11.6 or the Tax Warranties or the Exhibits or the
Schedules as prepared by the Company or any other Group Company and their
management, but had rather to rely on documentation and information made
available by the management and employees of the Group Companies as well as
the reasonable assurances given by the management and employees of the Group
Companies in the inquiry as set out in Section 11.7(b) and the related
disclosures, provided that all of the foregoing shall not in any way change
any liability of the Seller which it explicitly has under the provisions of
this Agreement, and (ii) nothing in this Agreement shall imply a duty of the
Seller (including its managers (gerant), employees or advisors) to make
specific or other enquiries or researches of whatever nature, in particular
beyond the inquiry as set out in Section 11.7(b) and (iii) the lack of (x)
such first-hand knowledge, (y) the ability to independently verify such
Seller's Guarantees and such Tax Warranties, and (z) such examinations or
verifications of the Seller, or the need to rely on reasonable assurances made
by the management and employees of the Group Companies shall as such in no
event be regarded as acting in a fraudulent manner (keine Arglist aufgrund von
Angaben "ins Blaue hinein" wegen unterbliebener Untersuchungen oder
Überprufungen des Verkaufers), and the Purchaser waives any rights and/or
claims against the Seller based on such legal grounds - other than for other
intent or wilful misconduct of the Seller - to the largest extent legally
permissible.

b.Power and Authority

(i)On the Signing Date and on the Closing Date,

(1)the Seller has the full corporate and legal authority to enter into this
Agreement and to carry out the Transaction. This Agreement has been duly executed by or on behalf of the Seller and constitutes its binding obligation;

(iii) sale, contribution or other contractual arrangement creating an

correct.

(iv)The Sold Shares constitute the entire share capital of the Company, and
the shares in the Subsidiaries as referred to in Exhibit 2.1(d) constitute the
entire share or other equity capital of the Group Companies, all as set forth
therein. Neither the Seller, nor any Seller\'s Affiliate nor any other third
party has, with respect to any Sold Shares or such shares in Subsidiaries, any
pre-emptive right (Vorkaufsrecht), right of first refusal (Vorerwerbsrecht),
subscription right (Bezugsrecht), option right (Optionsrecht), conversion
right (Wandlungsrecht) or similar right, or is party to an agreement that may
result in any such rights. There are no agreements which require the allotment, issue or transfer of any debentures in, or securities of, the
Group Companies.

(v)No Group Company is a party to any written and binding agreement relating
to the acquisition or sale of, or a similar transaction involving, any
interests in other legal entities or any business (Betrieb) or parts thereof
(Betriebsteile), other than agreements which have already been fully performed
by all parties thereto.

(vi)Regarding any of the Group Companies there are no silent partnerships
(stille Beteiligung), stock-appreciation rights, stock-based performance
units, "phantom" stock rights or other agreements, arrangements or commitments

may be entitled to receive any payment or other value based on the revenues,
earnings or financial performance, stock price performance or other similar
attribute of any Group Company.

(i)the Subsidiaries have been duly established and are validly existing under
the laws of their respective jurisdiction or formation; and

(ii)except under the Finance Documents, the shares in the Subsidiaries as set
out in Exhibit 2.1(d) are free from any third party rights and clear of any
encumbrances (Belastungen), are validly issued and the contributions thereon
(Einlagen) are fully paid up and have not been repaid; there is no additional

f.Operational Guarantees

Exhibit 11.6 sets out further Seller's Guarantees.

g.Seller's Knowledge

(i)For the purpose of and in connection with this Agreement, "Seller's
Knowledge" means exclusively the actual and individual knowledge (positive
Kenntnis) of the Seller's managers (gerant) as set forth in Exhibit 11.7 or
another natural person managing director of the Seller at the relevant point
in time (each a "Knowledge Bearer") at the Signing Date (and for purposes of
the Closing Disclosure Letter, at the date of the Closing Disclosure Letter)
after the written (including by e-mail) inquiry pursuant to Section 11.7(b). Whenever there is a reference to "subject
to Seller's Knowledge" this shall be read and understood as "to Seller's
Knowledge".

Seller's Knowledge shall be determined

(1)for each Knowledge Bearer separately, i.e., there shall be no attribution
of knowledge between the Knowledge Bearers; and

(2)without the attribution of any actual knowledge of any person, other than
in the course of the inquiry as provided to [***] - or another natural person
managing director of the Seller - as one of the Knowledge Bearers by an
Inquired Individual pursuant to Section 11.7(b); and

(3)without the attribution of any deemed knowledge of any person.

Any liability of the Seller with regard to constructive knowledge or with
regard to information available in any files, documents or correspondence of
the Group or the Seller or any of the Knowledge Bearers, but not actually
known by the respective Knowledge Bearer (aktenmaßig verfugbar, aber nicht
positiv bekannt), shall be excluded and waived and therefore do not form part
of Seller's Knowledge.

(ii)No earlier than one (1) calendar day prior to the Signing Date and one (1)
calendar day prior to the Closing Date for purposes of the preparation and
issuance of the Closing Disclosure Letter, [***] - or another natural person
managing director of the Seller - as one of the Knowledge Bearers discussed
(in case of the Closing Disclosure Letter, will discuss) the Seller's
Guarantees and the Tax Warranties with each of [***] (each an "Inquired
Individual") and inquired them, on the basis of a (written) document providing
the Seller's Guarantees and the Tax Warranties and the Exhibits and Schedules
thereto, whether to the individual actual knowledge of each of the Inquired
Individuals at the time of their inquiry by [***] - or another natural person
managing director of the Seller - there are any facts or circumstances that
would render the Seller's Guarantees and the Tax Warranties which are
qualified "to the Seller's Knowledge" or "subject to Seller's Knowledge" as
being not true or incorrect as at the respective date of such inquiry.
Notwithstanding the provisions set forth in Section 14.9, the Parties agree
that the information explicitly provided by the Inquired Individuals to [***]-
or another natural person managing director of the Seller - during such
inquiry shall be attributable to the Knowledge Bearers' actual knowledge as at
the relevant date as set forth above.

"Closing Disclosure Letter" shall mean a disclosure letter substantially in
the form as attached in Exhibit 10.2(c), according to which the Seller
warrants to the Purchaser by way of an independent promise of guarantee
irrespective of fault (selbstandiges, verschuldensunabhangiges
Garantieversprechen) in accordance with section 311 para. 1 BGB that, to the
Seller's Knowledge, the statements set forth in Sections 11.2 through 11.5,
Section 15.2 and in Exhibit 11.6 are correct as of the date of the Closing
Disclosure Letter, with the understanding that the Seller shall disclose any
facts and circumstances which have occurred between the Signing Date
(excluding) and (including) the date of the Closing Disclosure Letter and
which had resulted in a breach of the Tax Warranties in Section 15.2 and/or
the Seller's Guarantees in Sections 11.2 through 11.5 and/or in Exhibit 11.6
had they been given as at the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Closing Disclosure Letter shall not establish any rights of the Purchaser to
rescind or challenge or contest or nullify this Agreement and shall not extent
the liability of the Seller towards the Purchaser under this Agreement beyond what has been explicitly agreed between the Parties in
this Agreement.

h.The Seller does not make any representations, warranties or guarantees
regarding the Sold Shares, the Shareholder Loan Receivable, the Group
Companies and/or the Business other than the Seller's Guarantees and the Tax
Warranties as set forth and based on the terms of this Agreement. The
Purchaser hereby expressly confirms and agrees to acquire the Sold Shares, the
Shareholder Loan Receivable, the Group Companies and the Business based upon
Purchaser's own inspection, examination and evaluation/assessment with respect
thereto, including the due diligence investigation with assistance of the
Purchaser's Representatives as was usual in the context of an auction process
(as defined below) (the "Due Diligence"), without reliance upon any express or
implied representations, warranties or guarantees of any nature made by the
Seller except for the Seller's Guarantees and the Tax Warranties. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Purchaser acknowledges that the
Seller gives no representation, warranty or guarantee with respect to:

(i)any projections, estimates or budgets delivered or made available to the
Purchaser or its Affiliates or any of their respective (managing) directors,
employees, agents, advisors or other representatives ("Purchaser's
Representatives") of future revenues, future results of operations (or any
component thereof), future cash flows or future financial condition (or any
component thereof) or the future business operations of the Group Companies;
or

(ii)any other information or documents made available to the Purchaser's
Representatives with respect to the past, current or future business or the
Group, except as expressly set forth in the Seller's Guarantees and the Tax
Warranties.

"Permitted Leakage" shall mean any distribution, payment, cost, action, matter
or transaction

1.specifically and explicitly provided for in this Agreement, such as, e.g.
the Shareholder Loan Receivable and its repayment; 2.in relation to which the Group Companies have received an arm's-length
consideration, benefit or service or the Group Companies have otherwise been

Affiliates.

c.Related Party Agreements

Except as otherwise set forth on Exhibit 12.3, prior to the Closing, the
Sellers shall cause all Related Party Agreements to be terminated and settled
and all liabilities of the Group Companies thereunder to be fully discharged
at the expense of the Seller as of no later than immediately prior to the
Closing.

d.No Other Seller's Covenants

The Seller's obligations under Section 12.1 through 12.3 (collectively the
"Seller's Covenants") shall lapse (erloschen) as of the Closing. The Seller's
Covenants shall be the sole and exclusive covenants for the respective period
of time (i.e. there shall be no other covenants) by the Seller under or in
connection with this Agreement.

13.Remedies

a.Self-Contained Regime

The Parties hereby expressly exclude the application of sections 434 through
453 BGB as well as any and all statutory warranty claims thereunder and hereby
agree that the Seller's Guarantees in particular do not qualify as guarantees
(Beschaffenheitsgarantien) within the meaning of sections 443 and 444 BGB, and
that the consequences of any breach of the Seller's Guarantees, the Seller's
Covenants and of any other obligations, covenants, agreements, undertaking by
or claim against the Seller under or in connection with this Agreement shall
exclusively be governed by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
Furthermore, the Parties confirm that the limitations to the Seller's
Guarantees and Seller's Covenants as specified in this Section 13 or otherwise
in this Agreement shall form an integral part of the Seller's Guarantees and
the Seller's Covenants, and that the Seller's Guarantees and the Seller's
Covenants are only given subject to such provisions and limitations. b.Administration of Purchaser Claims

7.The Purchaser undertakes to notify the Seller as to any potential breach of
any of the Seller's Guarantees or Seller's Covenants or any other obligation,
covenant, agreement, undertaking by or claim against the Seller under or in
connection with this Agreement (the "Purchaser Claim") without undue delay,
but in any event within a period of three (3) weeks as from the Purchaser's or
the Purchaser's Representatives' respective actual knowledge of the relevant
facts or circumstances relating to a Purchaser Claim in order to preserve any
rights and claims under this Agreement, provided, however, that any failure to
duly notify the Seller shall not forfeit the Purchaser\'s Claim, but the
Purchaser shall only be forfeited from making a claim for an increase in
damages caused by such non-compliance; provided that such notice (the "Claim
Notice") shall state the nature of the Purchaser Claim in reasonable detail,
including the amount involved to the extent such amount can already be
reasonably determined at the time when such notice is given.

8.In case of any Purchaser Claim, the Seller may attempt to remedy the
notified potential breach (alleged to give rise to the Purchaser Claim). If
the Seller fails to remedy the potential breach within a period not to exceed
one (1) calendar month after the Seller has received a Claim Notice or the
potential breach cannot be remedied or the Seller has finally refused towards
the Purchaser in writing to remedy the breach, the Purchaser shall be entitled
to claim from the Seller compensation of any Losses suffered by the Purchaser
or the Group Companies in accordance with this Agreement.

9.Without prejudice to the validity of the Purchaser Claim, the Purchaser
shall allow, and shall procure (steht dafur ein) that the Group Companies
allow, the Seller and its Seller's Representatives to investigate the matter
and circumstances alleged to give rise to such Purchaser Claim, and whether
and to what extent any amount is payable in respect of such Purchaser Claim,
and, for such purpose, the Purchaser shall give, and shall procure (steht
dafur ein) that the Group Companies give, in each case at their own cost such
reasonably requested information and assistance, including reasonable access
to the Purchaser's and the Group Companies' premises and personnel during
normal business hours and including the right to examine and copy or
photograph any assets, accounts, documents and records as the Seller and its
Seller's Representatives may reasonably request. This provision shall also
apply in case of court or arbitration proceedings pending among the Parties in
connection with this Agreement, provided, however, that in such case the
Seller shall have to bear the Group Companies\' costs and expenses for any
such assistance and access.

c.Calculation of Damages

[***].

d.Consideration of Advantages

10.Any liability of the Seller for a Purchaser Claim shall be excluded if and
to the extent:

i.the amount of the Purchaser Claim is actually recovered under insurance
policies or claims against third parties (with the Purchaser hereby
undertaking to pursue any such insurance claim or claim against third parties
with the care of a prudent business man and to the extent legally possible,
but always being permitted to take the interest of the Business, in particular
customer and supplier relations, into account) or would have been recovered if the
insurance policies of the Group Companies in effect prior to the Closing Date
had been maintained after the Closing;

ii.the Purchaser Claim arises, or the amount of the Purchaser Claim is
increased, as a result of changes in circumstances or changes in the legal
position (including changes in law, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation,
general accounting policies or administrative practice of Governmental
Authorities) which occurred after the Signing Date;

iii.the Purchaser Claim is based on the same circumstances or facts that have
already been considered or claimed in relation to any other claim of the
Purchaser against the Seller under this Agreement (no double dip);

iv.the matter to which the Purchaser Claim relates has explicitly been taken
into account in the 2019 Financial Statements as a write-off (Abschreibung),
value adjustment (Wertberichtigung), liability (Verbindlichkeit) or provision
(Ruckstellung), not including however, general adjustments or provisions made
for the relevant risk category (e.g. Pauschalwertberichtigungen,
Pauschalruckstellungen);

v.either the Purchaser or any of the Purchaser's Representatives, or
(following the Closing Date) any of the Group Companies or any of their
respective (managing) directors, employees or other representatives have
aggravated (erhoht) such Purchaser Claim or any Losses resulting therefrom or
failed to mitigate Losses pursuant to section 254 BGB; or

vi.in case of Purchaser Claims other than Exempted Claims, the Purchaser has
failed to comply with any of its covenants, obligations and other commitments
under Section 13.2 or Section 13.6 or Section 17.1, in which case, however,
only such increase of Loss or similar shall be forfeited which is actually
caused by such non-compliance.

11.Any payments actually made by the Seller in order to discharge a liability,
which is or becomes excluded or reduced under this Section 13.4, shall be
refunded by the Purchaser to the Seller without undue delay upon the
notification of the Purchaser by the Seller thereof.

e.Effects of Knowledge

12.A Purchaser Claim cannot be raised against the Seller, and the Seller's
liability shall be excluded if and to the extent the facts or circumstances
giving rise to a Purchaser Claim are known on the Signing Date by the
Purchaser or any of the Purchaser's Representatives based on the standard of a
person that is aware of the legal framework, laws and regulations applicable
to the Business and the Group Companies and that has performed a professional
due diligence exercise customary for transactions of the size and kind as the
Transaction.

13.The Purchaser shall, other than with respect to Tax Warranties pursuant to
Section 15, be deemed to have positive knowledge of all matters explicitly set
out in this Agreement, including its Exhibits and Schedules, as well as all
matters Fairly Disclosed in: vii.other than with respect to Exempted Claims, the written statements
(including in e-mails) made, and written answers given (including in e-mails),
to the Purchaser and/or the Purchaser's Representatives during the question and
answer (QandA) process instituted with respect to the Due Diligence and written
correspondence (including in e-mails) with any of (A) the Group's
representatives (including the Subsidiaries' (managing) directors, employees,
advisors and counsel) and/or (B) the Seller and/or the Seller's
Representatives, including in the course of the negotiation of this Agreement;
or

viii.other than with respect to Exempted Claims, in the electronic data room
[***] The contents of the Data Room has been set aside in electronic form on a
USB memory stick (the "USB Stick DR"). One (1) copy of the USB Stick DR have
been handed over to the Seller, two (2) copies of the USB Stick DR has been
handed over to the Purchaser and two (2) copies of the USB Stick DR have been
handed over to the acting notary on the Signing Date, in each case together
with a freeze letter from the provider of the Data Room, provided, however,
that this Section 13.5(b)(ii) shall not apply to Exempted Claims. The Parties
hereby instruct the acting notary to keep these USB Sticks in custody for a
period of five (5) years after the Closing and grant each Party access to
these USB Sticks, unless the Seller and the Purchaser jointly instruct the
acting notary otherwise in writing. The acting notary shall only release the
USB Sticks in his custody to the Parties (one USB Stick to the Purchaser and
one USB Stick to the Seller) upon the joint written request of the Seller and
the Purchaser or upon expiry of the aforementioned custody period, but each
Party may at its own cost request at any time prior thereto a copy of such USB
Stick. The notary bears no obligations for proper storage and readability of
the USB Sticks.

For the purposes of this Agreement, "Fairly Disclosed" shall mean disclosed in
a manner/description and at a place in the Data Room that is not misleading
and in such reasonable detail that the relevant circumstances, facts and/or
risks could be identified by an experienced and professional (A) purchaser
and/or (B) advisor, in each case by applying the standard of care of a prudent
businessman (ordentlicher Geschaftsmann) that has been advised by
appropriately experienced professional advisers for a transaction of the size
and kind of the Transaction.

f.Cooperation regarding Third Party Claims

14.In case of circumstances that may give rise to a Purchaser Claim and which
relate to court rulings, awards or decisions of any arbitral tribunals or
public orders issued or third party claims raised against the Purchaser or any
of the Group Companies (collectively the "Third Party Claim"), any liability
of the Seller shall be subject to the Purchaser's full and strict compliance
with the obligation to procure (steht dafur ein) that, in each case to the
extent legally permitted and permissible for the Purchaser pursuant to the
terms of the WandI Insurance,

ix.the Seller shall without undue delay be properly informed and provided with
all relevant documentation and assistance by the Purchaser regarding any
judgment, ruling, decision, order, claim or proceeding which may give rise to
a Third Party Claim (including copies of those documents that relate to or
trigger a certain time limit (fristbezogene Dokumente)); x.the Seller shall be given the opportunity to comment on, participate in and
review any reports, audits, meetings and other measures or actions taken in
respect of a Third Party Claim, provided, however, that the Seller has to
comply with the Purchase's reasonable timing suggestions in any such respect;

xi.no admission of liability, disposal, settlement, compromise or binding
declaration shall be made by or on behalf of the Purchaser or any Group
Companies vis-a-vis any court, arbitral tribunal, public authority or third
party regarding a Third Party Claim without the prior written instruction or
written consent (including fax and e-mail) of the Seller;

xii.such measures or actions (not including, however, the selection of the
advisors to be retained) shall be taken or omitted as the Seller may instruct
to avoid, defend, dispute, appeal, resist, contest, compromise, settle or
otherwise administer such Third Party Claim;

xiii.if legally permitted and requested by the Seller, the Group Companies
give the Seller the opportunity to defend or settle the Third Party Claim at
the Seller's sole discretion, provided, however, that the Seller shall be
obliged to take the interest of the Business, in particular customer and
supplier relations, into account. The Seller shall insofar be entitled to
participate in and direct all negotiations and correspondence with the
relevant third party and to appoint and instruct legal counsel to act on
behalf and as representative of the Group Companies (and the Purchaser shall
procure (steht dafur ein) that the Group Companies issue any power of attorney
as may be required for such purpose).

15.If the Seller is not in breach of a Seller's Guarantee or Seller's Covenant
or any other obligation, covenant, agreement, undertaking or claim under or in
connection with this Agreement relating to a Third Party Claim based on an
enforceable arbitral award in accordance with Section 24.2 below or if the
respective Third Party Claim has been withdrawn by such third party, any costs
and expenses reasonably incurred by such Seller in connection with the defense
of such alleged Third Party Claim shall be borne by the Purchaser as set forth
in the enforceable arbitral award. The failure of the Purchaser to fully
comply with its obligations under this Section 13.6 shall release the Seller
from its obligations and liabilities with regard to any Purchaser Claim in
respect of such Third Party Claim, if and to the extent such non-compliance
has caused the Third Party Claim or increased the amount under or pursuant to
the Third Party Claim.

16.This Section 13.6 shall not apply if the Third Party Claim results in a
claim of the Purchaser under the WandI Insurance taken out by the Purchaser, and
the Insurer under Purchaser's WandI Insurance decides to take over the defense
against such Third Party Claim. The preceding sentence shall not apply with
regard to Third Party Claims that might reasonably result in a breach of a
Fundamental Guarantee; provided that in case the Purchaser receives
conflicting instructions from the Seller and the Insurer, the Seller and the
Insurer shall endeavour to come to a joint position as to the relevant
instruction and if they fail to do so, the Seller or the Insurer shall have
the final instruction right, whoever has the greater liability exposure from
the respective Third Party Claim. The Purchaser, if and to the extent
exercising its discretion, shall act as prudent businessmen (ordentlicher
Geschaftsmann) using reasonable commercial efforts to avoid and mitigate
damages; in such case, the Purchaser shall be obliged, before exercising its discretion, to (i) provide the Seller with the
instructions received from the Insurer and (ii) take into consideration the
arguments of both the Seller and the Insurer.

g.No Gross-up

The Seller shall in no event owe to the Purchaser any gross-up for Taxes
falling due in connection with any compensation for any Losses received from
the Seller.

h.Adjustment of Share Purchase Price

Any payment by the Seller or the Purchaser or the Guarantor under this
Agreement for damages or otherwise shall be deemed to be and treated as a
subsequent adjustment of the Share Purchase Price.

14.Limitation of the Seller's Liability

a.All Purchaser Claims shall be time-barred (verjahrt) [***] after the
Closing Date, except for:

17.all claims arising from a breach of any of the Fundamental Guarantees which
shall be time-barred (verjahrt) on [***]; and

18.all claims arising as a result of a willful (vorsatzlich) or fraudulent
(arglistig) breach of any of the Seller's obligations under this Agreement,
which shall be time-barred (verjahrt) in accordance with the statutory
provisions set forth in sections 195, 199 BGB; and

19.all claims pursuant to Section 15, which shall be time-barred (verjahrt) as
set forth therein,

(collectively the "Time Limitations").

b.Suspension of Purchaser Claims

The Time Limitations for any Purchaser Claim shall be suspended (gehemmt)
pursuant to section 209 BGB only by commencing of arbitral proceedings in
accordance with Section 24.2 by the Purchaser pursuant to section 204 para. 1
no. 11 BGB. Section 203 BGB shall not apply.

c.All Purchaser Claims

20.arising as a result of a willful (vorsatzlich) or fraudulent (arglistig)
breach of the Seller's obligations under this Agreement;

21.resulting from a breach of specific performance to transfer the Sold Shares
and/or the Shareholder Loan Receivable to the Purchaser under this Agreement
(Erfullungsanspruch); and

22.resulting from a breach of a Seller's Guarantee contained in Sections 11.2
(Power and Authority) and 11.3 (Title to Sold Shares) and 11.4 (Subsidiaries)
as well as 11.5 (Ownership of Shareholder Loan Receivables); and

23.resulting from a breach of the Seller's Covenant pursuant to Section 12.1
(Conduct of Business) or Section 12.2 (No Leakage); 24.resulting from a breach of the Seller's specific obligation towards the
Purchaser explicitly provided for

xiv.pursuant to Sections 6.1, 6.2, 6.4, 6.6, 6.7(c), 6.7(d) (if Seller is the
retaining Party), 6.8 and 6.10;

xv.pursuant to Sections 7.2 and 7.3;

xvi.pursuant to Section 8;

xvii.pursuant to Section 10.2(c), 10.2(d) and 10.2(e);

xviii.pursuant to Section 12.3;

xix.pursuant to Sections 21(b) and 21(d); and

xx.pursuant to Section 22.

are collectively referred to as the "Exempted Claims".

d.De Minimis Amount; Deductible

Subject to any other limitation or exclusion of Seller's liability under this
Agreement, the Seller shall only be liable for Losses resulting from any
Purchaser Claim if and to the extent that such Losses exceed an amount of
[***] in the individual case (provided that a series of claims based on
similar facts or circumstances is considered to be one such claim) and the
aggregate amount of all Losses resulting from individual Purchaser Claims
exceeds an amount of [***], in which case only the amount of Losses exceeding
the Deductible shall be recoverable (Freibetrag), subject to the other
provisions of this Section 14.

The limitations of this Section 14.4 shall not apply to any Exempted Claims.

e.Liability Cap

The Seller's aggregate liability for any and all claims of the Purchaser under
or in connection with this Agreement, including for breaches of any of the
Seller's Guarantees, Tax Warranties, or any other obligation, covenant,
indemnity, agreement, undertaking or any claim under Section 15 or claim under
or in connection with this Agreement, except for Purchaser Claims as a
consequence of Exempted Claims and/or breaches thereof, shall not exceed an
amount of EUR [***]. The Seller's overall liability under or in connection
with this Agreement, including for Exempted Claims and/or breaches resulting
therein, but except for claims of the Purchaser arising as a result of
fraudulent (arglistige) or willful (vorsatzliche) breaches of the Seller's
obligations under or in connection with this Agreement, shall in no event
exceed an aggregate amount of 100% (in words: one hundred per cent) of the
Purchase Price.

f.No other Remedies

The remedies which the Purchaser may have against any of the Seller under or
in connection with this Agreement, including for breaches of any of the
Seller's Guarantees and Tax Warranties or any other claim under Section 15,
Seller's Covenants or any other obligation, covenant, agreement, undertaking
or claim under or in connection with this Agreement, shall solely be governed
by this Agreement and shall be the exclusive remedies available to the
Purchaser. If and to the extent permitted by law, any claims and remedies
other than those explicitly provided for in this Agreement, regardless of their nature, amount
or legal basis, are hereby expressly excluded and waived by the Purchaser,
such waiver hereby being accepted by the Seller.

g.WandI Insurance

The Purchaser declares that it intends to take out, at its free discretion and
choice, a warranty and indemnity insurance under an insurance policy on or
about the date hereof (the "WandI Insurance" and the relevant insurance provider
as therein identified, the "Insurer") to obtain warranty and indemnity
insurance coverage for the Seller's Guarantees, the Tax Warranties and the
Purchaser\'s claims under Section 15\. The Purchaser irrevocable and
unconditionally agrees that, notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement and regardless of whether the Purchaser actually takes out an
effective WandI Insurance the following shall apply (Exhibit 14.7 contains a
copy of the executed WandI Insurance):

25.It is hereby acknowledged and agreed by the Parties that any liability of
the Seller for any claims of the Purchaser against the Seller under or in
connection with this Agreement, including for breaches of any of the Seller's
Guarantees, Tax Warranties or any (other) claim under Section 15 or any other
indemnities, covenants, agreements or undertakings set forth in this
Agreement, except for Purchaser Claims as a consequence of Exempted Claims
and/or breaches by the Seller resulting therein, in excess of the Liability
Cap shall be excluded and be [***]; with the clarification that this shall in
no event affect a liability on the basis of a reason (Haftung dem Grunde nach)
[***] (the "Liability Exclusion"). Consequently, the Purchaser's sole recourse
for any claims under or in connection with this Agreement, including for
breaches of any of the Seller's Guarantees, Tax Warranties or any claim under
Section 15 or any other indemnities, covenants, agreements or undertakings set
forth in this Agreement, except for Purchaser Claims as a consequence of
Exempted Claims and/or breaches resulting therein, beyond the Liability Cap
shall, to the extent applicable, be only against the Insurer if the Purchaser
has taken out a WandI Insurance; otherwise, the Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees that no further recourse is available to the Purchaser against the
Seller for any claims under or in connection with this Agreement beyond the
Liability Cap, except for Purchaser Claims as a consequence of Exempted Claims
and/or breaches resulting therein. The Purchaser expressly acknowledges, and
the other Parties agree, that the risk of non-implementation of the WandI
Insurance as well as the validity and collectability risk in respect of the
WandI Insurance and hence, the risk to successfully claim and/or recover from
the Insurer any Losses of the Purchaser under or in connection with this
Agreement, including in connection with any breaches of any of the Seller's
Guarantees, Tax Warranties or any (other) claim under Section 15 or any other
indemnities, covenants, agreements or undertakings set forth in this
Agreement, except for Exempted Claims and/or breaches resulting therein, shall
solely and irrevocably rest with the Purchaser.

26.If and to the extent that any Purchaser Claim in connection with a breach
of a Fundamental Guarantee and/or any other claim of the Purchaser which is
not already covered by the Liability Exclusion as set forth in lit. (a) above
is subject to a valid and collectible claim of the Purchaser against the
Insurer under the WandI Insurance, any liability of any Seller for such claim
shall also be excluded, provided, however, that the Purchaser has no
obligation to try to recover any such claim under the WandI Insurance coverage. 27.The Purchaser shall procure (steht dafur ein) that under the WandI Insurance
the Insurer shall not be entitled to subrogate against the Seller except if
the payment under the WandI Insurance or any loss as defined in the WandI
Insurance arises out of the Seller's fraud (Arglist) or willful misconduct
(Vorsatz). If the Insurer makes any claims against the Seller under or in
connection with the WandI Insurance or otherwise, the Purchaser shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Seller from any damages, losses and liabilities
resulting therefrom, including all out-of-pocket costs and expenses, legal
fees and expenses and disbursements and Taxes resulting from or arising in
connection therewith, except the claim arises out of the Seller's fraud
(Arglist) or willful misconduct (Vorsatz).

28.The Purchaser hereby undertakes and covenants to the Seller that no
amendments to or waivers of, the subrogation provisions or the rights of third
party provisions of the WandI Insurance will be made without the prior written
consent of the Seller to the extent it would relate to the Seller or its
liability.

For the avoidance of doubt, should the Purchaser decide not to take out a WandI
Insurance, the Purchaser hereby confirms to the Seller that the liability
regime as agreed between the Parties herein shall remain unaffected.

h.Exclusion of Statutory Liability Regime

Without limiting the generality of Section 14.6, in particular, any right of
the Purchaser to lower the Purchase Price or any portion thereof (Minderung),
to withdraw (Rucktritt) from this Agreement or to require the winding up of
the Transaction contemplated hereunder on any other legal basis (e.g. by way
of großer Schadensersatz or Schadensersatz statt der ganzen Leistung), any
claims for breach of pre-contractual obligations (culpa in contrahendo) - it
being clarified in particular that it is agreed that such claims may not and
cannot be based on any alleged requirement of the Seller (or for any person
whose knowledge is attributed, or purported to be attributed, to the Seller)
under or in connection with this Agreement to undertake investigations or
inquiries in respect of Seller's Guarantees and Tax Warranties (whether
qualified by Seller's Knowledge or not) as it is understood and agreed that
the Seller's Guarantees and Tax Warranties and any Purchaser Claim shall
solely be governed by the terms of this Agreement and that the Purchaser Claim
shall solely entail such consequences as expressly provided for in this
Agreement in respect of the Purchaser Claim, including but not limited to
claims arising under sections 241 para. 2, 311 para. 2 and 3 BGB or ancillary
obligations (Nebenpflichten), including but not limited to claims arising
under sections 241 para. 2, 280 BGB, or based on the principles of disturbance
of the fundamentals of the transaction (Storung der Geschaftsgrundlage), or
ancillary obligations (positive Forderungsverletzung) are hereby expressly
excluded and waived (verzichtet) by the Purchaser, such waiver hereby being
accepted by the Seller.

If and to the extent the exclusion of claims based on the principles of
disturbance of the fundamentals of the transaction (Storung der

Parties in this Agreement, held invalid, such exclusion shall be construed, to
the extent legally permissible, to set the thresholds for such principles to

33.Remedies

xxv.After Closing, the Purchaser shall be obliged to notify the Seller in

the respective damage.

c.Tax Indemnity

34.The Seller shall pay at the Purchaser's discretion either (i) to the Group
Company or (ii) to the Purchaser, the amount of any Indemnified Taxes ("Tax
Indemnification Claim"), but in any case only if and to the extent that:

xxix.the Indemnified Taxes have not been paid to the competent Tax Authority
before the Effective Date; xxx.none of the relevant Group Companies has a valid, legally enforceable and
fully creditworthy claim for repayment, reimbursement or indemnification
against a third party other than under the WandI Insurance and against current
or past employees and managers of the Group Companies;

xxxi.the Indemnified Taxes are not the result of any change in law, rule or
regulation (including subordinate legislation) on or after the Effective Date;

xxxii.the Indemnified Taxes have not been caused or increased by a failure of
the Purchaser to comply with any of its covenants, obligations or any other
kind of commitment under this Section 15 if the Seller demonstrates that the
non-compliance caused or increased, and affected the defence against, the
respective Indemnifiable Tax;

xxxiii.the Indemnified Taxes are not directly or indirectly caused or
triggered by any change in the accounting and taxation principles or practices
of the respective Group Company or any transaction, action, omission or other
measure (including any change in the exercise of any Tax election right,
termination of any Tax consolidation scheme, approval or implementation of any
reorganisation measure) initiated or executed by the Purchaser or - after the
Closing Date - by any of the Group Companies except that this exclusion shall
not apply where such change, transaction, action, omission or other measure
was (i) required by mandatory law or (ii) carried out with the prior written
consent of the Seller;

xxxiv.the Purchaser and/or any relevant Group Company is not entitled to any
benefit by refund, set-off or reduction of Taxes as a result of the
circumstances giving rise to a Tax Indemnification Claim in which context the
amount of any such benefits shall be calculated on the basis of the applicable
statutory tax rates as of the Effective Date and under the assumption that the
relevant entity is and will remain in a Tax paying position (an
"Indemnification Tax Benefit"); in such case the Indemnification Tax Benefit
shall, by applying a discount rate of [***] and an equal allocation of the
reverse effect over five (5) years as from the relevant date in the case of
fixed assets, and one (1) year as from the relevant date in the case of
current assets and liabilities and any other accruals and, be discounted to
the Effective Date and shall reduce the Tax Indemnification Claim. In
particular, without limitation, this shall apply to any Indemnification Tax
Benefit resulting from a lengthening of any amortization or depreciation
period, higher depreciation allowances or loss carry forwards or deductions;

xxxv.the Indemnified Tax cannot or could not be avoided by offsetting taxable
profits against any Tax loss carry backs or Tax loss carry forwards (or any
other Tax credit, allowance, deduction or similar Tax item) that are or were
available (including as a result of subsequent Tax Audits) in the Pre-
Effective Date Period (excluding for the avoidance of doubt any Tax loss carry
backs that stem from periods after the Effective Date); and

xxxvi.the aggregate amount of the Indemnified Taxes is reflected neither as a
liability (Verbindlichkeit) nor as an accrual (Ruckstellung) in the Financial
Statements (for the avoidance of doubt, irrespective of the facts and
circumstances underlying such liabilities or accruals), but only to the extent
that the respective liabilities, accruals and provisions have actually reduced the Purchase Price, in particular with respect to Exhibit 4.1(b)-2, lit. (c)
and/or Exhibit 4.1(b)-3, lit. (h). For purposes of this Section 15.3(a)(viii),
only those Indemnified Taxes shall be taken into account where the respective
Tax Indemnity Claim is not otherwise excluded or reduced by any of the
exemptions pursuant to Sections 15.3(a)(i) through 15.3(a)(vii).

35.Any payment on the Tax Indemnification Claim shall be due and payable by
the Seller on the tenth (10th) Business Day after the Seller has been notified
in writing by the Purchaser about the payment obligation and the corresponding
payment date and all material circumstances giving rise to the payment
obligation pursuant and in accordance with this Agreement and has received a
copy of the relevant Tax assessment notice (Steuerbescheid) of the competent
Tax Authority, but in no case earlier than on the fifth (5th) Business Day
before the Tax to be indemnified is due and payable to the Tax Authority. Upon
request of the Seller, the Purchaser shall provide to the Seller any document
which may enable the Seller to review the validity of the indemnification
request. Upon request of the Seller the Purchaser shall, and shall procure
that the relevant Group Company does, apply for a deferred payment date. It is
understood that any kind of security to be granted in order to receive a
deferral of payment is provided by the Seller, who will bear any interest been
charged in case of an unsuccessful objection against a respective tax. If an
Indemnified Tax case is not finally assessed but Taxes are due and payable any
indemnification payment shall be considered as an advanced payment to the
Purchaser. If subsequently the Tax for which the advanced payment has been
made is reduced again by way of Tax assessment or otherwise lowered the
difference between the higher advanced payment and the lower Tax liability
shall be without undue delay reimbursed by the Purchaser to the Seller,
including all interest related thereto.

d.Tax Refunds, Purchaser's Obligations, Tax Benefits etc.

36.The Purchaser shall - unless the amount has already reduced the
indemnification pursuant to Section 15.3(a) - pay to the Seller the amount of
any refund of Taxes (other than a refund which is a Indemnification Tax
Benefit) including interest thereon received by any of the Group Companies by
cash payment, set-off, deduction or otherwise, relating to the Pre-Effective
Date Tax Period ("Tax Refund"), after the Effective Date if and to the extent
that the respective Tax Refund exceeds the amount of the respective Tax
Refunds shown in the Financial Statements, but only if the Tax Refund shown in
the Financial Statements has actually increased the Purchase Price. Any
payment under this Section 15.4(a) shall be due and payable within ten (10)
Business Days after such Tax Refund has been received by the recipient. The
Purchaser shall notify the Seller in writing and without undue delay of any
relevant decision by the Tax Authority or expiration of any applicable statute
of limitation, as the case may be, resulting in a Tax Refund.

37.The Purchaser shall pay to the Seller any surplus of provisions for Taxes
(Steuerruckstellungen) or liabilities for Taxes (sonstige Verbindlichkeiten
aus Steuern) as recorded in the 2019 Financial Statements, if and to the
extent the amount of non-appealable liabilities for Indemnified Taxes falls
short of the amount of the provisions for Taxes or the amount of the
liabilities for Taxes as recorded in the 2019 Financial Statements, but only
if the respective balance sheet item in the 2019 Financial Statements has
actually reduced the Purchase Price. Any amount to be paid by the Purchaser
under this Section 15.4(b) shall be due and payable on the tenth (10th) Business Day after all Tax assessment notices for the Pre-Effective
Date Tax Period have become non-appealable.

38.The Seller shall pay to the Purchaser an amount by which the surplus of
receivables for Taxes (Steuerforderungen) as recorded in the 2019 Financial
Statements, if and to the extent the amount of recovered receivables for Taxes
falls short of the amount of the receivables for Taxes as recorded in the 2019

Financial Statements has actually increased the Purchase Price. Section
15.4(b) shall apply mutatis mutandis.

e.Tax Covenants of the Purchaser

39.The Purchaser shall - without the Seller's prior written approval - not
take, and shall procure that after Closing no Group Company will take, any
action, or omit to take any action, including the making of any Tax elections,
the effect of which could give rise to any Tax liability (including any Tax
Indemnification Claim pursuant to Section 15.3(a)) of the Seller or a Seller's
Affiliate, or result in any increase thereof, or in the reduction of any
Indemnification Tax Benefit, Tax Refund or Tax Benefit, including any action
or omission of action:

xxxvii.performed after Closing with retroactive effect to a period before the
Effective Date; or

xxxviii.changing or issuance of any Tax Returns for a period prior to the
Effective Date; or

xxxix.with respect to accounting and Tax accounting methods (including
election rights) not consistent with past practice of the Group Companies; or,

xl.provided, however, that the Seller acknowledges that the Purchaser may make
- and is therefore permitted to make - an election under section 338(g) of the
United States Internal Revenue Code and corresponding elections under state or
local law with respect to Non-US Entities. The Purchaser shall provide the
Seller with notice of any such election as required by the Treasury
Regulations under section 338 of the United States Internal Revenue Code

unless such action or omission of action, as the case may be, is required by
mandatory law or carried out or effected under a legally binding obligation
entered into on or before Closing by any Group Company. The Seller shall be
deemed to have given its consent if the Seller did not provide any comment to
Purchaser or the relevant Group Company within fifteen (15) Business Days
following the receipt (Zugang) of a respective request of the Purchaser or any
Group Company.

40.If the Purchaser fails to comply with any of its obligations under this
Section 15.5 or Section 15.6, the Purchaser shall indemnify the Seller from
and against all and any Taxes of the Seller and the Seller's Affiliates
(including, but not limited to, the reduction of current losses or loss carry
forwards of the Seller or a Seller's Affiliate), if the Seller demonstrates
that the non-compliance caused or increased the respective Tax. Any amount
payable pursuant to this Section 15.5 shall be due and payable on the tenth
(10th) Business Day after receipt by the Purchaser of a payment notice by the
Seller setting out all material circumstances giving rise to the payment
obligation pursuant and in accordance with this Section 15.5(b). f.Cooperation of Tax Matters

Authority with potential impact on a Pre-Effective Date Tax Period; any such
notice shall be deemed to have been made timely if it is made within ten (10)
Business Days after the receipt of such communication by either the Purchaser
or any of the Group Companies unless an immediate response is required (e.g.,
in the event of tax investigations (Steuerfahndungsprufungen). Such notice
shall be reasonably detailed and shall include copies of the respective
notices.

43.For all Tax Proceedings relating to a Pre-Effective Date Tax Period, the
Purchaser shall reasonably involve the Seller or its counsel in such Tax
Proceeding. In particular, but without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Seller shall have the opportunity to (i) participate from the
beginning until the end in a Tax Audit in relation to a Pre-Effective Date Tax
Period at the cost and expense of the Seller, (ii) ask the Purchaser to
procure that the Group Companies challenge and litigate any Tax assessment or
other decision of any Taxing Authority or Tax court if and to the extent it is

Seller, as the case may be, under or in connection with this Agreement, the
Seller's respective claims and remedies, and the Purchaser's and/or the

limited to Losses.

20.GUARANTOR'S UNDERTAKING

doubt, the Guarantor hereby waives, and the Seller hereby accepts such waiver,
any rights which the Guarantor may have to require the Seller to proceed first
against, or claim payment from, the Purchaser such that as between the Seller
and the Guarantor the latter shall be liable as principal debtor as if it had
entered into the undertaking to perform such obligations under or in
connection with this Agreement jointly and severally with the Purchaser.

withholding, contribution falling due on such payment ("Bonus Withholding
Taxes") to the extent permissible under the respective bonus agreements.

66.The amount of the Bonus Withholding Taxes withheld by the Seller or the
respective Seller's Affiliate (other than the Group Companies) from the Seller
Exit Bonuses shall be paid by the Seller, or, as the case may be, the Seller
shall procure that the respective Seller\'s Affiliate (other than the Group
Companies) pays, to the respective Group Company being the employer of the
Bonus Recipients ("Employer").

67.The Purchaser shall ensure that the Employers (i) co-operate with the
Seller or the respective Seller\'s Affiliate (other than the Group Companies)

(after receipt of the respective amounts from the Seller or the Bonus
Recipients).

68.In case the Bonus Recipient object to the deduction of the Bonus
Withholding Taxes or the withholding of the Bonus Withholding Taxes is
otherwise not permissible, the Seller shall in the necessary timely manner for
the necessary filing inform the Purchaser on the amount of the Seller Exit
Bonuses in order to enable the Purchaser and the respective Employer to file a
notification to the Tax Authorities pursuant to section 38 para. 4 German
Income Tax Act (Einkommensteuergesetz).
