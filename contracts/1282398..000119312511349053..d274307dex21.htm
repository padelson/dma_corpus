iii  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of December 21, 2011 (this " _Agreemen_
t"), among Cod Intermediate, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("
_Parent_ "), Cod Merger Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and WCA Waste Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").

W I T N E S S E T H :

 

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Company, the Parent and
Merger Sub have approved and declared advisable, this Agreement and the
merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), in
accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "
_DGCL_ "), and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;
and

WHEREAS, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Board of Directors of
the Company (the " _Board_ ") is recommending that the holders of the
Companys capital stock entitled to vote thereon vote in favor of the adoption
of this Agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated hereby;
and 

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and also to
prescribe certain conditions to the Merger as specified herein.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as
follows:

ARTICLE 1

THE MERGER

__Section 1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the DGCL, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into
the Company, whereupon the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving company in the Merger
(the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

 

 __Section 1.2 _Closing_. Subject to _Section 5.19_ and the schedule thereto,
the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices
of Andrews Kurth LLP, 600 Travis, Suite 4200, Houston, Texas 77002 at 10:00
a.m., local time, on a date to be specified by the Company and Parent, which
shall be no later than fifteen (15) Business Days following the day on which
the last to be satisfied or (to the extent permitted by this Agreement and
applicable Law) waived of the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE 6_ (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by this Agreement and
applicable Law, waiver of such conditions) shall be satisfied or waived in
accordance with this Agreement, or such other place, date and time as the
Company and Parent may agree in writing, unless this Agreement has theretofore
been terminated pursuant to its  terms; provided, however, that Parent or Merger Sub shall not be required to
effect the Closing on or before the date that is fifty (50) Business Days
after the date on which the Company first files the Proxy Statement with the
SEC in accordance with _Section 5.4_ (the " _Parent Financing Date_ ") unless
Parent otherwise consents in writing. In the event the conditions set forth in
the schedule to  _Section 5.19_ or in _Section 6.1(c)_ are delayed beyond
the date on which the Company and Parent currently anticipate such conditions
shall be satisfied then the Company and Parent shall negotiate in good faith
for a reasonable extension of the Parent Financing Date to account for such
delay. The day on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to herein as
the " _Closing Date_ ".

 

 __Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable on the Closing Date
after the Closing, a certificate of merger prepared and executed in
accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ")
shall be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective at the time of such filing or at such later time as may be agreed by
the parties in writing and specified in the Certificate of Merger (such time
as the Merger becomes effective is referred to herein as the " _Effective
Time_ ").

__Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

 

 __Section 1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation_.

 

(a) The certificate of incorporation of the Company, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended and restated in the Merger to
read in the form of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation set
forth on _Exhibit A_ hereto and, as so amended and restated, shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and applicable Law, in each
case consistent with the obligations set forth in _Section 5.8_.

 

(b) The bylaws of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be amended and restated at the Effective Time to read in their
entirety in the form set forth on _Exhibit B_ hereto and, as so amended and
restated, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and applicable Law, in each
case consistent with the obligations set forth in _Section 5.8_.

__Section 1.6 _Directors_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation
and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and
qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal.

__Section 1.7 _Officers_. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Closing Date shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and
shall hold office until their respective successors are duly appointed and
qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal.

(a) _Conversion of Company Capital Stock_

 

(i) _Common Stock Merger Consideration_. Subject to _Section 2.1(b)_ and
_Section 2.1(d)_, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Company issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(such shares, collectively, " _Company Common Stock_ ," and each, a "
_Common Share_ "), other than any Cancelled Shares (to the extent provided in
_Section 2.1(b)_) and any Shares held by Dissenting Stockholders, if any,
shall thereupon be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent
the right to receive $6.50 in cash in accordance with _Section 2.2 _(the "
_Common Stock Merger Consideration_ "), without interest. All Common Shares
that have been converted into the right to receive the Common Stock Merger
Consideration as provided in this _Section 2.1(a)(i)_ shall be automatically
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate (or Common Shares in book-entry form) which immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented such Common Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Common Shares other than the right to receive the
Common Stock Merger Consideration, without interest, in accordance with this 
_Section 2.1(a)(i)_ and _Section 2.2_ hereof.

(ii) Preferred Stock Merger Consideration. Subject to _Section 2.1(b)_ and
_Section 2.1(d)_, each share of Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Company issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (such shares, collectively, " _Company Preferred Stock_ ,"
and, together with the Company Common Stock the " _Company Capital Stock_ ",
and each, a " _Preferred Share_ ", a Preferred Share or Common Share may
be referred to herein as a " _Share_ "), other than any Shares held by
Dissenting Stockholders, if any, shall thereupon be converted automatically
into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive $130.565 (as such
amount may be adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(ii)_ of the Company
Exceptions Letter), in accordance with _Section 2.2_ (the " _Preferred Stock
Merger Consideration_ " and, together with the Common Stock
Merger Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ "), without interest. All
Preferred Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the
Preferred Stock Merger Consideration as provided in this _Section
2.1(a)(ii)_ shall be automatically cancelled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a certificate (or Preferred Shares in book-entry
form) which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Preferred
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Preferred Shares
other than the right to receive the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration,
without interest, in accordance with this _Section 2.1(a)(ii)_ and _Section
2.2 _hereof.

 

(b) _Parent and Merger Sub-Owned Shares_. Each Common Share and Preferred
Share that is owned, directly or indirectly, by Merger Sub immediately prior
to the Effective Time or held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time (in each case, other than any such
Common Shares or Preferred Shares held on behalf of third parties) (the "
_Cancelled Shares_ ") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any

 



3  action on the part of the holder thereof, (i) be cancelled, (ii) not be
converted into the right to receive the Common Stock Merger Consideration or
the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration and (iii) cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such cancellation and
retirement.

(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each
share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and such
shares shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates
representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes
to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence.

(d) _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change, other than such changes
expressly permitted herein or set forth in  _Section 2.1(d)_ of the Company
Exceptions Letter, in the outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock, or
securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of
Company Capital Stock, shall occur as a result of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or subdivision
or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or
stock distribution with a record date during such period, merger,
issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Common
Stock Merger Consideration and/or Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, as
applicable, shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change; provided that
nothing herein shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action
with respect to its securities that is prohibited or not expressly permitted
by the terms of this Agreement.

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. On or before the Closing Date and prior to the Effective
Time, Parent and Merger Sub will enter into an agreement with a U.S. bank or
trust company that shall be appointed by Parent and reasonably acceptable to
the Company to act as agent for the holders of the Shares and holders of the
Company Stock Options in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ")
and to receive the Merger Consideration and the Option Consideration to which
such holders shall become entitled pursuant to this _ARTICLE 2_. As promptly
as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Paying Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of
Company Capital Stock and Company Stock Options, for payment in accordance
with this _ARTICLE 2_ through the Paying Agent, cash in an amount sufficient
to permit payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration payable pursuant to
_Section 2.1_ (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment
Fund_ ").

 



4 (b) _Payment Procedures_.

 

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any
event not later than five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares
whose Shares were converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section
2.1_, a customary letter of transmittal, agreed to by Parent and the Company
prior to the Closing, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the certificates that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented Shares (" _Certificates_ ") shall pass, only upon
delivery of Certificates to the Paying Agent (or delivery of effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section 2.2(g)_) or
upon adherence to the procedures relating to transfer and the risk of loss
with respect to non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-
Entry Shares_ "). Such letter of transmittal shall contain instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or, in the case of Book-
Entry Shares, the surrender of such Shares, in exchange for the Merger
Consideration.

(ii) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to
establish procedures with the Paying Agent and the Depository Trust Company ("
_DTC_ ") to ensure that (A) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m.
(Eastern time) on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or
its nominee on the Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available
funds equal to (x) the product of (1) the number of Common Shares (other than
any Shares held by Dissenting Stockholders, if any) held of record by DTC or
such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (2) the Common Stock
Merger Consideration plus (y) the product of (1) the number of Preferred
Shares (other than any Shares held by Dissenting Stockholders, if any) held of
record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (2)
the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration (such amount, the " _DTC Payment_
"), and (B) if the Closing occurs after 11:30 a.m. (Eastern time) on the
Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominee promptly on
the first Business Day after the Closing Date an amount in cash in
immediately available funds equal to the DTC Payment.

(iii) Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent together with a letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be required
by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor payment in an amount equal
to the product of (x) the number of Common Shares or Preferred Shares, as
applicable, formerly represented by such holders properly surrendered
Certificates (or subject to such effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)
or Book-Entry Shares multiplied by (y) the Common Stock Merger Consideration
or Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, as applicable. No interest will be
paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Certificates (or
delivery of effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry
Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not
registered in the transfer or stock records of the Company, payment for any
cash to be paid upon compliance with the procedures described above may be
paid to such a transferee if the applicable letter of transmittal is
presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer or other Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. 

 



5 (iv) The Surviving Corporation, Parent and the Paying Agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable under this
Agreement to any holder of Shares or holder of Company Stock Options such
amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of U.S. state or
local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted and paid over to the
applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld or deducted amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the Shares or holder of the Company Stock Options, in respect of which such
deduction and withholding were made.

(c) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the
Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, any Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented to
the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, they shall
be marked "cancelled" and exchanged for a payment in the proper amount
pursuant to and subject to the requirements of this  _ARTICLE 2_.

(d) _Termination of Rights and Payment Fund_. All Merger Consideration paid
upon the surrender of and in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock and
Company Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company
Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock. Any portion of the Payment Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed
to the former holders of Shares on the 365th day after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, and any former holders of
Shares or Company Stock Options who have not surrendered their Shares or
Company Stock Options in accordance with this _Section 2.2_ or _Section
2.3_, as applicable, shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation
for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon, upon due surrender of their Certificates (or effective affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares; provided, that such former
holders shall have no greater rights against the Surviving Corporation than
may be accorded to general creditors of the Surviving Corporation under
applicable Laws.

 

(e) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent
or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any
amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(f) _Investment of Payment Fund; Fees and Expenses of Paying Agent_. The
Payment Fund shall be invested as reasonably directed by Parent; provided
that it shall be invested in short-term obligations of the United States of
America with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days or guaranteed by the
United States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the
United States of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1
or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively; _provided_ , _however_ , that any interest or other income
resulting from the investment of the Payment Fund shall be solely for the
account of Parent or the Surviving Corporation. If for any reason (including
losses) the Payment Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts to which holders of
shares of Company Capital Stock and Company Stock Options shall be entitled
under _Section 2.1_ and _Section 2.3_, respectively, Parent shall take all
steps necessary to enable or cause the Surviving Corporation promptly to
deposit additional cash with the Paying Agent sufficient to

 



6  make all such payments required under _Section 2.1_ and _Section 2.3_, and
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall in any event be liable for payment
thereof. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The
Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses of the Paying Agent.

(g) _Lost Certificates_. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the provision or posting by such
person of an indemnity agreement or, at the election of Parent or the Paying
Agent, a bond in reasonable amount as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate payment in the
amount of the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate multiplied by the applicable Merger Consideration.

Section 2.3 ___Company Stock Options; Restricted Company Common Stock_ _._

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary
to provide that each option issued under the Company Stock Plan that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not then
vested or exercisable) that represents the right to acquire shares of Company
Common Stock (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ") shall accelerate vesting
and the time at which such Company Stock Option may be exercised so that such
Company Stock Option may be exercised in full for a limited period of time
prior to, but contingent upon the occurrence of, the Effective Time, after
which all unexercised Company Stock Options shall terminate. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall make any amendments to the terms of the
Company Stock Plan and obtain any consents from holders of Company Stock
Options that, in each case, are necessary to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this _Section 2.3 _and, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, payment may be withheld in respect of any Company Stock Option
until any necessary consents are obtained. Without limiting the foregoing,
except as otherwise agreed by Parent, the Company shall take all actions
necessary to ensure that the Company will not at the Effective Time be bound
by any options, stock appreciation rights, deferred stock units, warrants or
other rights or agreements which would entitle any Person, other than Parent
and its Subsidiaries, to own or have any rights with respect to any capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation or to receive any payment in respect
thereof. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
necessary to terminate the Company Stock Plan and all awards thereunder, such
termination to be effective at or before the Effective Time. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Company Stock Plan_ " shall mean the Fourth Amended and
Restated 2004 WCA Waste Corporation Incentive Plan.

 

(b) All restrictions on shares of Company Common Stock issued as restricted
Company Common Stock pursuant to the Company Stock Plan (" _Restricted
Shares_ ") will lapse immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall be
deemed to be Company Common Stock and shall be entitled to receive Common
Stock Merger Consideration pursuant to  _Section 2.1_.

(c) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, any Tax deductions
arising from the lapse of restrictions on Restricted Shares, any change in
control, bonus or similar payments arising from or pursuant to, or the
exercise of the Company Stock Options in connection with, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (i) shall be treated as arising

 



7  on the day of, but arising and properly allocable to the portion of the day
after, the Effective Time and (ii) shall be treated as arising in, and shall
be allocated to, the Companys taxable period or portion thereof beginning
after the day of the Effective Time (the " _Post-Closing Period_ "). The
parties shall report consistently with the preceding sentence for all Tax
purposes, and shall not take any inconsistent position in any Tax proceeding.
In making such allocation, the parties agree that the lapse of restrictions on
Restricted Shares, and the acceleration of the Company Stock Options, pursuant
to this Agreement arises outside the ordinary course of business of the
Company as carried on prior to the day of the Effective Time and therefore is
appropriately allocated to the Post-Closing Period.

Section 2.4 _Appraisal Rights._

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by a holder of
Shares (including any Book-Entry Shares or shares held by holders that have
delivered to the Company effective affidavits of loss in lieu of
Certificates) who shall have:

(i) demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with and in compliance
in all respects with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL;

(ii) not voted such Shares in favor of the Merger; and

(iii) not withdrawn, waived or otherwise lost or forfeited such holders
appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL prior to the Effective Time
(collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ", and the holder of any such
Dissenting Shares is referred to as a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ "), shall
not be converted into or represent the right to receive any part of the Merger
Consideration. Such Dissenting Shares shall instead be converted into the
right to receive from the Surviving Corporation payment of the "fair value"
thereof in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL.

(b) The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by
the Company for appraisal of Dissenting Shares, attempted withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL that are
received by the Company for appraisal of any Shares, and Parent shall have
the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands, and the Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect
or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under
Section 262 of the DGCL or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine
that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the
DGCL, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders
Dissenting Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL shall be forfeited and cease,
and each of such holders Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been
converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to
receive, without interest thereon, the applicable Merger Consideration, upon
surrender, in the manner provided in  _Section 2.1(a)(i)_, of the
Certificate or Certificates (or effective affidavits in lieu of loss thereof)
or Book-Entry Shares that formerly evidenced such Shares.

 



8 Section 2.5 _Assumption of Earn-Out_. At the Effective Time, the Surviving
Company shall assume the obligations of the Company pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ") dated as of December 31, 2009 by and
among the Company, HBK Master Fund L.P., Bernard Global Loan Investors, Ltd.,
Bernard National Loan Investors, Ltd., Live Earth Funding LLC, Brian Fenwick-
Smith (collectively, the " _Earn-Out Parties_ ") and Bank of Texas, N.A., as
escrow agent, and the Earn-Out Certificates (the " _Earn-Out Certificates_ ")
issued December 31, 2009, each by and between the Company and each of the
Earn-Out Parties. Pursuant to the Escrow Agreement and the Earn-Out
Certificates, at the Effective Time each Escrow Share (as defined in the
Escrow Agreement) shall automatically convert, without any further action
required by any person, into the right to receive an amount equal to the
Common Stock Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of
Common Stock each Escrow Share would have converted into had the Merger not
occurred, pursuant to the terms, and subject to the conditions, set forth in
the Escrow Agreement.

(including partnership interests and limited liability company interests) of
the Companys Subsidiaries held by the Company or any other Subsidiary have
been duly and validly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable and were not issued in violation of any preemptive or similar
rights, purchase option, call or right of first refusal or similar rights. All
such equity interests are free and clear of any Liens or any other limitations

Section 3.4 _Corporate Authority Relative to this Agreement; No Violation._

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into
this Agreement and, subject to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, to

other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and

the ability of the Company to perform its obligations hereunder.

the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with
the provisions hereof will not, (i) result in any violation of, or default
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, require consent
under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of

indebtedness or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease,
agreement, contract, instrument, permit, Company Permit, concession,
franchise, right or license binding upon the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or result in the creation of any liens, claims, mortgages,

13 Section 3.5 _Reports and Financial Statements._

 

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries have filed or furnished all forms,
documents, statements and reports required to be filed or furnished prior to
the date hereof by them with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "
_SEC_ ") since January 1, 2009 (the forms, documents, statements and reports
filed with or furnished to the SEC since January 1, 2009 and those filed or
furnished with the SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement, if any,
including any amendments thereto, the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). As of
their respective dates, or, if amended, as of the date of the last such
amendment prior to the date hereof, the Company SEC Documents complied, and
each of the Company SEC Documents filed or furnished subsequent to the date of
this Agreement will comply, in all material respects with the requirements of
the Securities Act of 1933 and the rules promulgated thereunder (the "
_Securities Act_ ") and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and complied or
will comply, as applicable, in all material respects with the then-applicable
accounting standards. None of the Company SEC Documents so filed or furnished
or that will be filed or furnished subsequent to the date of this Agreement
contained or will contain, as the case may be, any untrue statement of
a material fact or omitted or will omit, as the case may be, to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made
or will be made, not misleading. None of the Companys Subsidiaries is

As of the date hereof, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments from
the SEC staff with respect to any of the Company SEC Documents.

(b) The financial statements (including all related notes and schedules) of
the Company and its Subsidiaries included in or incorporated by reference
into the Company SEC Documents fairly present, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries, as at the respective
dates thereof, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
the respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and to any other adjustments
described therein, including the notes thereto) in conformity with United
States generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") (except, in the
case of the unaudited statements, as permitted by the SEC) applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated
therein or in the notes thereto).

Section 3.6 _Internal Controls and Procedures_. The Company has established
and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act. The Companys disclosure controls and
procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
furnishes under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to the
management of the Company as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley
Act_ "). The management of the Company has completed its assessment of the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
the

 



14  year ended December 31, 2010, and such assessment concluded that such
controls were effective. The Company has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluations, to the Companys outside auditors and the audit committee of the
Board (A) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
or operation of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect in any material respect the Companys ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data and (B) any fraud or allegation of fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Companys internal controls over financial
reporting. Since January 1, 2010, the Company has not identified any material
weaknesses in internal controls. There are no facts or circumstances that
would prevent its chief executive officer and chief financial officer from
giving the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, without qualification, when next due.

Section 3.7 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_ _._ Except (a) as reflected or
reserved against in the Companys consolidated balance sheets (or the notes
thereto) included in the Company SEC Documents filed or made available to
Parent (in a data room) prior to the date hereof, (b) for transactions
expressly contemplated by this Agreement, (c) for liabilities and obligations
incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
since September 30, 2011 (the " _Balance Sheet Date_ "), (d) for liabilities
or obligations which have been discharged or paid in full in the ordinary
course of business and (e) as set forth in _Section 3.7_ of the Company
Exceptions Letter, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company has
any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether or not accrued,
contingent or otherwise, whether known or unknown and whether due or to become
due, that would have or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.8 _Compliance with Law; Permits._

(a) Except (i) as would not have or would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, or
(ii) as set forth in _Section 3.8(a)_ of the Company Exceptions Letter, the
Company and its Subsidiaries are, and since January 1, 2009 have been,
in compliance with and are not in default under or in violation of any
applicable federal, state, local or foreign or provincial law, statute,
ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, injunction, decree or agency
requirement of or undertaking to or agreement with any Governmental Entity,
including common law, (collectively, " _Laws_ " and each, a " _Law_ ").

(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries are in possession of all material
franchises, tariffs, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements,
variances, exceptions, consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any
Governmental Entity necessary for the Company and its Subsidiaries to own,
lease and operate their properties and assets or to carry on their businesses
as they are now being conducted (the " _Company Permits_ "). All Company
Permits are in full force and effect, except where the failure to be in full
force and effect would not be material to the Company or any Subsidiary. No
suspension or cancellation of any of the Company Permits is pending or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, except where such suspension or
cancellation would not be material to the Company or any Subsidiary. The
Company and its Subsidiaries are not, and since January 1, 2009 have not been
in material

 



15  violation or breach of, or default under, any Company Permit. No event or
condition has occurred or exists which would be reasonably likely to result in
a violation of, breach, default or loss of a benefit under, or acceleration
of an obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under, any Company
Permit (in each case, with or without notice or lapse of time or both). Prior
to Effective Time, the Company or one of its Subsidiaries shall have obtained
the draft permit described in _Section 3.8(b)_ of the Company Exceptions
Letter with no material conditions thereto outside the ordinary course of
business.

 

Section 3.9 _Environmental Laws and Regulations._

of the Code (without regard to Section 280G(b)(4) and 280G(b)(5) thereof).
Except as set forth on _Section 3.10(h)_ of the Company Exceptions Letter, no

power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as presently conducted.

 

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub is qualified to do business and is in good
standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership,
leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business
requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in

ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby (a " _Parent Material Adverse Effect_ ").

Section 4.2 _Corporate Authority Relative to this Agreement; No Violation._  

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and

validly authorized by the Sole Member of Parent and the Board of Directors of
Merger Sub, and by Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, and no other
limited liability company or corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or
Merger Sub are necessary to authorize the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming this Agreement constitutes
the valid and binding agreement of the Company, this Agreement constitutes the
valid and binding agreement of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against
each of Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, subject to the
effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization,
moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors rights
generally and general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding
in equity or at law).

the DGCL, (ii) the Exchange Act and (iii) the HSR Act and other applicable
Regulatory Laws, no authorization, consent or approval of, notification to or
filing with, any Governmental Entity is necessary, under applicable Law, for
the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated
hereby, except for such authorizations, consents, approvals or filings that,
if not obtained or made, would not have or would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(c) The execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement
does not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
compliance with the provisions hereof will not (i) result in any violation of,
or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, require
consent under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of any benefit under any loan,
guarantee of indebtedness or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, lease, agreement, contract, instrument, permit, concession,
franchise, right or license binding upon Parent or Merger Sub or result in the
creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of Parent or Merger
Sub, (ii) conflict with or result in any violation of any provision of the
limited liability company agreement, certificate of incorporation or by-laws
or other equivalent organizational document, in each case as amended, of
Parent or Merger Sub or (iii) conflict with or violate any applicable Laws,
other than, in the case of clauses (i) and (iii), any such violation,
conflict, default, termination, cancellation, acceleration, right, loss, Lien
or failure to obtain consent that would not have or would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

Section 4.3  _Proxy Statement; Other Information_. Parent and Merger Sub will
supply in writing for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement any information about them required to be disclosed therein (the "
_Parent Proxy Information_ ") and any additional information about them

the filing of the Proxy Statement (the " _Parent Additional Information_ ").
The Parent Proxy Information, in and of itself, will, at the time of the
mailing of the Proxy Statement to the stockholders of the Company, at the time
of the Company Meeting, and at the time of any amendments thereof
or supplements thereto, and the Parent Additional Information, in and of
itself, will, at the time of its filing with the SEC, and at the time of any
amendments thereof or supplements thereto, not contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 

Section 4.4 _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct and
complete copies, as of the date hereof, of (i) an executed commitment letter
(the " _Equity Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to which certain Buyer Group
Parties have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to
provide equity financing to Parent or a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent in
connection with the Merger (collectively, the " _Buyer Group Financing_ "),
and (ii) an executed debt commitment letter and related term sheets (the "
_Debt Commitment Letter_ " and together with the Equity Commitment Letter,
the " _Financing Commitments_ "), pursuant to which, and subject to the terms
and conditions thereof, the lenders specified therein have committed
to provide Parent or the Surviving Corporation with loans in the amounts set
forth therein (the " _Debt Financing_ " and together with the Buyer Group

 



29  Financing, the " _Financing_ "). As of the date hereof, the Financing
Commitments are in full force and effect and have not been withdrawn or
terminated or otherwise amended or modified in any respect. Parent or Merger
Sub has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in connection
with the Financing Commitments that are payable on or prior to the date hereof
and the Financing Commitments are the valid, binding and enforceable
obligations of Parent and the other parties thereto in accordance with their
terms subject, as to enforceability, to bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and other laws of general applicability relating to
or affecting creditors rights and to general principles of equity. The
Financing, subject to the terms and conditions of the Financing Commitments,
and cash on hand in the Company constitute all of the financing required for
the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, and are sufficient for the payment of the aggregate Merger
Consideration and the aggregate Option Consideration, any repayment or
refinancing of debt contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter and fees and
expenses of Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives incurred
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and any other amounts
required to fund the payments required to be made by Parent or Merger
Sub pursuant to this Agreement (including any payments that may be required
pursuant to the Indenture or any Parent Termination Fee). Assuming the
accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in _ARTICLE 3_ , the
performance in all material respects by the Company of its obligations under
this Agreement and satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_,
_Section 6.2_, and _Section 6.3_, as of the date hereof, Parent has no
reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing contemplated by
the Financing Commitments will not be satisfied or that the Financing will not
be available to Parent or Merger Sub on the date of the Closing; however,
notwithstanding the foregoing, without limiting any of the Companys
covenants hereunder, Parent acknowledges and agrees that its and the Merger
Subs obligations hereunder are not subject to or conditioned upon the
availability of the Financing. The Financing Commitments contain all of the
conditions precedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder to make
Financing available to Parent (or its designee) on the terms therein and the
Financing Commitments are not subject to any conditions other than as set
forth in the Financing Commitments.

Section 4.5 _Ownership and Operations of Merger Sub._ As of the date of this
Agreement, the authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares
of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, all of which are validly issued
and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Merger
Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent or a direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent. Merger Sub has not conducted any
business other than incident to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and the financing of
such transactions.

Section 4.6 _Finders or Brokers._ Except for Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc.,
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged any investment banker,
broker or finder in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement who might be entitled to any fee or any commission in
connection with or upon consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



30 Section 4.7 _Ownership of Shares._ As of the date of this Agreement, neither
Parent nor Merger Sub "beneficially owns" (as such phrase is defined in Rule
13d-3 of the Exchange Act) shares of capital stock of the Company representing
more than 5% of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company. As of
the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor any of their
"affiliates" or "associates" is, and at no time during the last three (3)
years has been, an "interested stockholder" of the Company, as such terms are
defined in Section 203 of the DGCL.

Section 4.8 _No Other Representations or Warranties._ The Company agrees
that, except for the representations and warranties contained in _ARTICLE 4_
of this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor any other person or
entity on its behalf makes or has made any other express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to Parent or Merger Sub or any

adopt, endorse or recommend, any Alternative Proposal, (D) adopt, endorse or
recommend or execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other
similar agreement relating to any Alternative Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement as provided in _Section 5.3(b)_), or (E) except to
facilitate the making of a Superior Proposal which facilitation is otherwise
in compliance with this _Section 5.3_, amend, terminate, waive or fail to
enforce, or grant any consent under, any confidentiality, standstill or
similar agreement, unless the Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that compliance with the terms of
this _Section 5.3_ would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable law. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that
any violation of the foregoing restrictions by any Subsidiary of the Company
or Representatives of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed
to be a breach of this  _Section 5.3_ by the Company.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, 

(i) the Company may comply with Rule 14e-2(a), Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that none of the Company, the Board or its transaction committee shall, except
as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.3_, recommend any Alternative
Proposal or withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent the
Recommendation in any disclosure document or communication filed or publicly
issued or made in conjunction with the compliance with such requirements;

 

(ii) as to Persons making an unsolicited written Alternative Proposal, until
but not following receipt of Company Stockholder Approval:

(A) during the Window-Shop Period, and thereafter with respect to any Excluded
Person, the Company or its Board or its transaction committee may engage in
activities that would otherwise be prohibited by _Section 5.3(a)(ii)(B)_; and

 



35 (B) except as permitted pursuant to _Section 5.3(b)(ii)(A)_, after the
Window-Shop Period, the Company or its Board or its transaction committee may
engage in activities prohibited by Section _5.3(a)(ii)(B)_ only with respect
to unsolicited Alternative Proposals as to which the Board or its transaction
committee makes a prior determination, in good faith and after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such Alternative
Proposal could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and
that failing to engage in such activities with respect to such Alternative
Proposal would be inconsistent with the Boards exercise of its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law.

 

The Company will not furnish non-public information to any Persons pursuant to
_Section 5.3(b)(ii)(A)_ or _(B)_ before the Company shall have obtained
from any such Person a confidentiality agreement on terms and conditions that
are no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement. In addition, Parent shall be entitled to receive
an executed copy of such confidentiality agreement prior to or substantially
simultaneously with the Company furnishing information to any such Person or
its Representatives. Moreover, the Company shall simultaneously provide to
Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that is provided to any such Person or its Representatives which
was not previously provided or made available (in a data room) to Parent.

 

(iii) in response to an Alternative Proposal, the Company or the Board or its
transaction committee may (A) recommend such Alternative Proposal to its
stockholders or withdraw, amend or modify the Recommendation and (B) if the
Board (or its transaction committee) so chooses, cause the Company to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 7.1(a)(iii)(B)_ but only if
prior to taking any such action described in clause (A) or (B) of this
subsection, (x) the Board (or its transaction committee) determines in good
faith after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel that such Alternative Proposal is a Superior Proposal (taking into
account any adjustment to the terms and conditions of the Merger proposed by
Parent in response to such Alternative Proposal), and (y) the Company shall
have given notice to Parent, within 24 hours of receipt thereof, that the
Company has received such Superior Proposal, attaching a copy of such Superior
Proposal, and specifying the identity of the Person making such Superior
Proposal and informing Parent that the Company intends to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof and negotiate in good faith with
Parent (the " _Negotiation Period_ ") during the three (3) Business Day
period following delivery of such notice to make such revisions to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement as would permit the Board not to withdraw,
amend or modify the Recommendation; _provided_ , _that_ in the event the
Person making a Superior Proposal revises such Superior Proposal in response
to revisions proposed by the Parent, the Company shall notify and provide a
copy to Parent of such revised Superior Proposal within 24 hours of receipt
thereof and the Parent and Company shall enter into a Negotiation Period
during the two (2) Business Day period following delivery of such revised
Superior Proposal to Parent. If Parent proposes no such revisions during such
period as would permit the Board not to withdraw, amend or modify the
Recommendation, then the Company and the Board may take the actions described
in (A) and (B) if after consultation with the Companys financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, the Board shall have determined in good faith that the
third partys Alternative Proposal remains a Superior Proposal (even in light
of any of Parents revised proposals) and that, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, the failure of the Board to withdraw or modify the
Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law; and

 



36 (iv) the Board or its transaction committee shall be permitted, other than in
connection with an Alternative Proposal, (A) to withdraw, amend or modify the
Recommendation, and (B) if the Board (or its transaction committee) so
chooses, cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section
7.1(a)(iii)(B)_ but only if prior to taking any such action described in
clause (A) or (B) of this subsection, the Board (or its transaction committee)
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel,
that, failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable law and the Company has given three (3) Business Days
advance notice to Parent that the Company intends to take such action.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any factually
accurate public statement by the Company that describes the Companys receipt
of a Alternative Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect
thereto, shall not be deemed to be a recommendation of such Alternative
Proposal or the withdrawal, amendment or modification of the Recommendation;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall, to the extent practicable,
provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to comment on and review any such
statement.

 

(d) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) advise
Parent of the receipt by the Company of any Alternative Proposal or any
request for non-public information or data relating to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries made by any Person that has made or informs the Company that
it is considering making an Alternative Proposal or any request for
discussions or negotiations with the Company or a Representative of the
Company relating to a Alternative Proposal or which is reasonably likely to
lead to an Alternative Proposal.

 

(e) Any action permitted pursuant to this _Section 5.3_ shall not constitute
a breach of the Companys representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement.

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Board from making any disclosure to its stockholders if the failure to so
disclose would be inconsistent with the Boards fiduciary duties, or any
disclosure requirements, under applicable Law, or from disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act; _provided_ _however_ , that the Recommendation shall
be deemed to have been withdrawn for all purposes of  _Section
7.1(a)(iv)(B)_, and _Section 7.2_ hereunder if the Board makes any such
disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" letter or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act) unless the Board expressly publicly reaffirms, without qualification, the
Recommendation at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Company Meeting.

 

(g) As used in this Agreement,

(i) " _Alternative Proposal_ " means (A) any proposal or offer from any Person
or group of Persons other than Parent or one of its Subsidiaries for a merger,
consolidation, business combination, share exchange, recapitalization,
reorganization, dissolution, liquidation or other similar transaction
involving the Company or any of its material Subsidiaries, (B) any proposal
for the issuance by the Company of over 25% of the Company Common Stock or
other equity securities or (C) any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner,

 



37  directly or indirectly, (1) over 25% of the Company Common Stock or other
equity securities of the Company or (2) assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (including securities of Subsidiaries) equal to 25% or more of
the Companys consolidated assets or to which 25% or more of the Companys
revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are attributable, in each case
other than the Merger.

 

(ii) " _Excluded Person_ " means any Person or Group of Persons (including
their Affiliates) from whom the Company has received during the Window-Shop
Period a written Alternative Proposal that the Board or transaction committee
determines, in good faith during the Window-Shop Period and after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, is reasonably likely
to lead to a Superior Proposal. A person or group of persons shall cease to be
an Excluded Person when the ultimate equityholder(s) of such person or group,
including the ultimate equityholder(s) of any affiliates of such person or
group, following the Window-Shop Period, cease to provide (directly or
indirectly) at least 50% of the equity financing (measured by voting power and
value) of such person or group.

 

(iii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any Alternative Proposal (with the
percentages set forth in the definition of such term changed from 25% to
50%), that in the good faith determination of the Board or its transaction
committee, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors and after taking into account relevant legal, financial, regulatory,
estimated timing of consummation and other aspects of such proposal and the
Person or group making such proposal, (A) would, if consummated in accordance
with its terms, result in a transaction more favorable to the holders of
Company Common Stock than the Merger (taking into account all the terms and
conditions of such proposal, and this Agreement, including any proposal or
offer by Parent to amend the terms of the Merger or this Agreement) and (B)
is reasonably likely to be consummated; and

(iv) " _Window-Shop Period_  means the twenty-five (25) calendar day period
following the date the initial press release regarding the Merger is issued.

 

 __Section 5.4 _Filings; Other Actions._

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement
(and in any event on or before the date that is eighteen (18) Business Days
after the date hereof, provided that if the Company requests that Parent agree
to a reasonable extension of such period, then consent to such request shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Company shall
prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement (which shall include the
Recommendation), and, if necessary, the Company and Parent shall prepare any
other document required by applicable Law to be filed with the SEC ("
_Additional Filings_ "). Parent shall furnish all information concerning
Parent and its Subsidiaries to the Company as the Company shall reasonably
request, and provide the Company other assistance, as may be
reasonably requested in connection with the preparation of the Proxy
Statement and any Additional Filings, and the Proxy Statement and any
Additional Filings shall include all information reasonably requested by
Parent to be included therein. The Company agrees that at the date of mailing
to stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Company Meeting, (i) the
Proxy Statement will comply with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder and (ii) none of the information
supplied by the Company or

 



38  any of its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Proxy Statement will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. Parent and Merger Sub agree that none of
the information supplied by either of them for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts
to have the Proxy Statement and, to the extent necessary, any Additional
Filings cleared by the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable after such
filing. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders as promptly as
practicable after the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC (and in any event
within five (5) Business Days, provided that if the Company requests that
Parent agree to a reasonable extension of such period, then consent to such
request shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The
Company shall as promptly as practicable notify Parent of the receipt of any
oral or written comments from the SEC relating to the Proxy Statement. The
Company shall cooperate and provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the draft of the Proxy Statement (including each
amendment or supplement thereto), and Parent and the Company shall cooperate
and provide each other with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
any Additional Filings (including each amendment or supplement thereto) and
all responses to requests for additional information by and replies to
comments of the SEC, prior to filing such with or sending such to the SEC, and
Parent and the Company will provide each other with copies of all such filings
made and correspondence with the SEC. If at any time prior to the Effective
Time, any information should be discovered by any party hereto which should be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or any
Additional Filings so that the Proxy Statement or any Additional Filings would
not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other parties hereto and, to the extent required by applicable Law, an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed by the Company with the SEC and disseminated by the Company to
the stockholders of the Company.

(b) The Company shall (i) take all action necessary in accordance with the
DGCL and the Company Charter Documents to duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold a meeting of its stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable
(and in any event no more than twenty-five (25) Business Days provided that
if the Company requests that Parent agree to a reasonable extension of such
period, then consent to such request shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) following the mailing of the Proxy Statement for
the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (such meeting or
any adjournment or postponement thereof, the " _Company Meeting_ "), and (ii)
subject to _Section 5.3(b)_, use reasonable best efforts to solicit from its
stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and approval
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby; provided that,
in the event of a change in the Recommendation pursuant to  _Section
5.3(b)_, notwithstanding clause (ii) of this _Section 5.4(b)_, (x) the
Company may disclose the fact of such change in the Recommendation in any
solicitation made by the Company to its stockholders and (y) the Company
shall not be required to solicit proxies in favor of the Company Stockholder
Approval unless the Board thereafter reaffirms the Recommendation.

 



39 __Section 5.5 _Efforts._

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall, and the Company shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts (subject to, and in
accordance with, applicable Law) to take promptly, or to cause to be taken,
all actions, and to do promptly, or to cause to be done, and to assist and
to cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, including (i) obtaining all necessary
actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals, including the Company
Approvals, from Governmental Entities or other persons and the making of all
necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may be
necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, including under any Regulatory Laws
(ii) defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and taking all reasonable actions with
respect to such lawsuits or legal proceedings necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) the execution
and delivery of any additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub will
use reasonable best efforts to effect the Closing as promptly as practicable
after the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions set forth in _ARTICLE 6_
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by this
Agreement and applicable Law, waiver of such conditions), subject to the
other terms and conditions of this Agreement.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without limiting
the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall:

(i) promptly, but in no event later than eighteen (18) Business Days after
the date hereof, provided that if the Company requests that Parent agree to an
extension of such period then such request shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, make their respective filings under the HSR Act as
promptly as reasonably practicable, and promptly thereafter make any other
required submissions thereunder;

 

(ii) use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other in (x)
determining whether any other filings are required to be made with, or
consents, permits, authorizations, waivers or approvals are required to be
obtained from, any third parties or other Governmental Entities in connection
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and (y) timely making all such filings and
timely seeking all such consents, permits, authorizations or approvals. To the
extent not prohibited by applicable Law, each party shall use reasonable best
efforts to furnish to the other all information required for any application
or other filing to be made by the other pursuant to any applicable Law in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company
shall (and shall cause its Representatives to) give Parent reasonable prior
notice of any substantive communication with, and any proposed understanding,
undertaking or agreement

 



40  with, any Governmental Entity (including any Antitrust Authority) regarding
any such registrations, declarations and filings or any such transaction. The
Company shall not (or permit its respective Representatives to) participate
independently in any meeting, or engage in any substantive conversation, with
any Governmental Entity in respect of any such filing, investigation or other
inquiry without giving Parent prior notice of the meeting or conversation
and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend
or participate. The Company shall consult and cooperate with Parent in
connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf
of any party in connection with investigations or proceedings under or
relating to the HSR Act or any other Regulatory Laws. The Company shall
cooperate in coordinating any registration, declaration and filings and
obtaining any necessary actions or nonactions, waivers or consents under the
HSR Act or any other Regulatory Laws;

(iii) use reasonable best efforts to take, or to cause to be taken, all other
actions and to do, or to cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, including taking all such further action as
reasonably may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the United
States Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice, state or foreign antitrust enforcement authorities or
competition authorities, other Governmental Entities, or other state or
federal regulatory authorities of any other nation or other jurisdiction or
any other person may assert under Regulatory Law with respect to the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, an " _Antitrust
Authority_ "), and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any
Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible
(and in any event no later than the End Date). Without limiting the foregoing,
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub and any of their respective Affiliates
shall not take any action with the intention to or that could reasonably be
expected to hinder or delay the obtaining of clearance or any necessary
approval of any Antitrust Authority under a Regulatory Law or the expiration
of the required waiting period under the HSR Act, any other applicable
Regulatory Law, and related rules; and

(iv) subject to applicable Laws, the instructions of any Governmental Entity,
and applicable confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements keep each other
apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including to the extent permitted
by Law promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other
communications sent or received by the Company or Parent, as the case may be,
or any of their Subsidiaries, to or from any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity with respect thereto, and permit the other to review in
advance any proposed written communication by such party to any supervisory or
Governmental Entity. 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (but subject to the last
sentence of this  _Section 5.5(c)_), Parent shall take any and all action
necessary, including but not limited to (i) selling or otherwise disposing of,
or holding separate and agreeing to sell or otherwise dispose of, assets,
categories of assets or businesses of the Company or Parent or their
respective Subsidiaries; (ii) terminating existing relationships, contractual
rights or obligations of the Company or Parent or their respective
Subsidiaries; (iii) terminating any venture or other arrangement; (iv)
creating any relationship, contractual rights or obligations

 



41  of the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries or (v)
effectuating any other change or restructuring of the Company or Parent or
their respective Subsidiaries (and, in each case, to enter into agreements or
stipulate to the entry of an order or decree or file appropriate applications
with any Antitrust Authority in connection with any of the foregoing and in
the case of actions by or with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or
its or their businesses or assets; by consenting to such action by the Company
and _provided_ , that any such action may, at the discretion of the Company,
be conditioned upon consummation of the Merger) (each a " _Divestiture
Action_ ") to ensure that no Governmental Entity enters any order, decision,
judgment, decree, ruling, injunction (preliminary or permanent), or
establishes any law, rule, regulation or other action preliminarily or
permanently restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the consummation of the
Merger, (" _Antitrust Prohibition_ ") or to ensure that no Antitrust Authority
with the authority to clear, authorize or otherwise approve the consummation
of the Merger, fails to do so by the Termination Date. In the event that any
action is threatened or instituted challenging the Merger as violative of any
Premerger Notification Rule or other Antitrust Law, Parent shall take
all action necessary, including but not limited to any Divestiture Action to
avoid or resolve such action. In the event that any permanent or preliminary
injunction or other order is entered or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be
entered in any proceeding that would make consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or
that would restrain, enjoin or otherwise prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent shall
take promptly any and all steps necessary to vacate, modify or suspend such
injunction or order so as to permit such consummation prior to the Termination
Date. If any Divestiture Action agreed to by Parent requires action by or
with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or its or their businesses or
assets, and such action would constitute a breach of this Agreement, the
Parent hereby agrees to consent to the taking of such action by the Company
and any such action may, at the discretion of the Company, be conditioned upon
consummation of the Merger. The Company shall cooperate with Parent and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to assist Parent in resisting and reducing
any Divestiture Action. The parties shall use reasonable best efforts to
share information protected from disclosure under the attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other
privilege pursuant to this section so as to preserve any applicable
privilege. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
including this _Section 5.5_, Parent shall not be required to take any
Divestiture Action or agree to any conditions in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, if such
action or condition (x) would have, or be reasonably likely to have, a
material adverse effect on the business, assets, liabilities (contingent or
otherwise) or financial condition of the Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, or the business, assets, liabilities (contingent or otherwise) or
financial condition of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole or (y) in any way involves Macquarie Infrastructure Partners
A, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, Macquarie Infrastructure Partners
Canada, L.P., an Ontario limited partnership, or Macquarie Infrastructure
Partners International, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (collectively, "
_MIP I_ ") or any entity in which MIP I directly or indirectly owns any equity
interests (collectively, the " _MIP I Entities_ "); _provided_ , for
the avoidance of doubt, that the exception contained in this clause (y) shall
not eliminate Parents obligation to agree to Divestiture Action with respect
to the Company or its Subsidiaries to the extent otherwise required under
this  _Section 5.5_.

 



42 (d) Subject to the rights of Parent in _Section 5.10_, and in furtherance
and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in this
_Section 5.5_, if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding,
including any proceeding by a private party, is (or has been prior to the
date hereof) instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, each of the
Company and Parent shall cooperate in all respects with each other and shall
use their respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such
action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
nothing in this _Section 5.5_ shall limit a partys right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(a)(ii)(A)_ or _Section 7.1(a)(ii)(B)_ so
long as such party has, prior to such termination, complied with its
obligations under this _Section 5.5_.

 

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Regulatory Law_ " means any and all
state, federal and foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees,
administrative and judicial doctrines and other Laws, including the HSR Act,
requiring notice to, filings with, or the consent or approval of, any
Governmental Entity, or that otherwise may cause any restriction, in
connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby,
including (i) the Sherman Act of 1890, the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, the
HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 and all other Laws that
are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the
purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening
competition through merger or acquisition, (ii) any Law governing the direct
or indirect ownership or control of any of the operations or assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries or (iii) any Law with the purpose of protecting
the national security or the national economy of any nation.

 

Section 5.6 _Takeover Statute_. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control
share acquisition," "affiliate transaction," "business combination" or other
form of anti-takeover statute or regulation shall become applicable to the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to which
an exemption is not available therefrom, each of the Company and Parent and
the members of the Board shall grant such approvals and take such actions as
are necessary so that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated herein and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of
such statute or regulation on the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

Section 5.7 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release regarding the
Merger shall be a joint press release and thereafter, unless the Board has
effected a change of the Recommendation in accordance with _Section 5.3(b)_
hereof, the Company and Parent will consult with and provide each other the
opportunity to review and comment upon any press release or other public
statement or comment prior to the issuance of such press release or other
public statement or comment relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated herein and shall not issue any such press release or
other public statement or comment prior to such consultation except as may be
required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement
with any national securities exchange. Parent and the Company agree to issue a
joint press release announcing the execution and delivery of this Agreement.

 



43 __Section 5.8 _Indemnification and Insurance._

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation, advancement of
expenses and indemnification for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, now existing in favor of the current or former directors,
officers or employees (in their capacity as such and not as stockholders or
option holders of the Company or its Subsidiaries), as the case may be, of the
Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in the Company Charter Documents or
Subsidiary Documents, or in any agreement in effect on the date of
this Agreement and listed in _Section 3.20(a)_ of the Company Exceptions
Letter, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect.
For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, to the extent permitted
under applicable Law, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to adopt
or maintain exculpation, advancement of expenses and indemnification
provisions no less favorable, taken as a whole, than those set forth in the
Company Charter Documents and Subsidiary Documents in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify
any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective Time were current or
former directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation in respect of any Action pending or
asserted or any claim made within such six (6) year period shall continue
until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim.

(b) Without limiting any other rights that any Indemnified Party (as defined
below) may have pursuant to any employment agreement or indemnification
agreement in effect on the date hereof and listed in  _Section 3.20(a)_ of
the Company Exceptions Letter, from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, each current and former director or
officer of the Company or of a Subsidiary of the Company (each, together with
such persons heirs, executors, administrators or personal representatives, an
" _Indemnified Party_ " and, collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ")
against any costs or expenses, judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or
threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, based on or arising out of (i) the
fact that such Indemnified Party was a director or officer of the Company or
such Subsidiary or (ii) acts or omissions by an Indemnified Party in the
Indemnified Partys capacity, and in the scope of authority, as a director or
officer of the Company or such Subsidiary or taken at the request of the
Company or such Subsidiary, in each case under (i) or (ii), at, or at any
time prior to, the Effective Time (including any claim, suit, action,
proceeding or investigation relating in whole or in part to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) (each, an " _Action_ "). Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall use their reasonable best efforts to assist
in the defense of any Action; _provided_ , that neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected without
Parents prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, and the Surviving Corporation shall not be
obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (selected by a
plurality of the applicable Indemnified Parties) for all Indemnified Parties
in any one jurisdiction with respect to any single Action except to the extent
there is, in the reasonable opinion of counsel to Parent and the Surviving
Corporation, under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict
on any material issue between positions of such Indemnified Party and any
other Indemnified Party or Indemnified Parties.

 



44 (c) Parent and the Surviving Corporation will cause to be put in place,
and Parent shall fully prepay immediately prior to the Effective Time, "tail"
insurance policies with a claims period of at least six (6) years from the
Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating
as the Companys and its Subsidiaries current insurance carrier with respect
to directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions that are no less advantageous in the aggregate than such policy
with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time; provided,
however, that Parent and Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay
with respect to such insurance policies in respect of any one policy year
more than 250% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the
date hereof in respect of the coverages required to be obtained pursuant
hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably
practicable for such amount.

(d) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have
under the Company Charter Documents or Subsidiary Documents or the
organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation, any other
indemnification arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise. Notwithstanding _Section
1.5_, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not amend, repeal or
otherwise modify the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder
or under the Company Certificate of Incorporation or Company Bylaws of any
Indemnified Party to indemnification, exculpation and advancement except to
the extent required by Law. The provisions of this  _Section 5.8_ shall
survive the consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit,
and are enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

 

(e) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 5.8_. The Surviving Corporation shall pay
all expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and
costs of investigation, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in
enforcing the indemnity and other obligation provided in this _Section 5.8_
or under any charter, bylaw or contract, such amounts payable as incurred
upon request.

(f) As of the Closing, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause all
of the Companys current officers and directors who will not be officers or
directors of the Surviving Company to be removed from any responsibility with
respect to bank accounts, bonding facilities, and any other financial
arrangements and to substitute the officers of the Surviving Corporation
therefor.

 



45 __Section 5.9 _Financing; Solvency._

 

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all lawful actions and to do, or cause to be done, all lawful things
necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and consummate Financing on the
terms and conditions described in the Financing Commitments, including using
its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Financing
Commitments, (ii) negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on the
terms and conditions contained in the Financing Commitments, (iii) satisfy on
a timely basis and comply with all terms, covenants, obligations
and conditions set forth in the Commitment Letters and in such definitive
agreements applicable to Parent, or Merger Sub, (iv) consummate the Financing
at or prior to Closing, and (v) enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment
Letter. 

(b) Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken
all lawful actions, and to do or cause to be done all lawful things necessary
or advisable, to obtain the Equity Financing contemplated by the Equity
Commitment Letter and to fully enforce the Equity Commitment Letter.

 

(c) Parent and Merger Sub agree that they will not permit or agree to any
amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any material provision or
remedy under the Financing Commitments, if such amendment, modification or
waiver would (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing, (ii) impose
additional conditions precedent to the initial availability of the Financing
or amend or modify any of the existing conditions to the availability of the
Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to materially delay,
prevent or render less likely to occur the Financing, or any material
portion thereof, on the Closing Date, or (iii) adversely impact the ability
of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce their rights against other parties to the
Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements with respect thereto.

 

(d) Parent shall keep the Company informed in reasonable detail with respect
to all material activity concerning the status of the Financing contemplated
by the Financing Commitments and shall give the Company prompt notice of any
material adverse change with respect to such Financing. Without limiting the
foregoing, Parent agrees to notify the Company promptly, and in any event
within one (1) Business Day, if at any time (i) any Debt or Equity Commitment
Letter shall expire or be terminated for any reason, (ii) any financing source
that is a party to a Debt or Equity Commitment Letter notifies Parent that
such source no longer intends to provide financing to Parent on the terms set
forth therein, (iii) for any reason Parent no longer believes in good faith
that it will be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing
contemplated by the Financing Commitments on the terms described therein, or
(iv) Parent becomes aware of any breach by any party of the Financing
Commitments that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
Financing Commitments or delay or impair the consummation of the Financing.

(e) Parent shall provide to the Company copies of all documents related to
the Financing Commitments and the Financing upon reasonable request and, in
any event, the final documents, including without limitation all definitive
agreements, (other than any ancillary documents subject to confidentiality
agreements, including fee letters and engagement letters).

(f) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that obtaining the Financing
is not a condition to Closing. Without limiting any of the obligations of
Parent under this Agreement or any of the Companys remedies, if any of the
Financing becomes unavailable 

 



46  on the terms and conditions contemplated in any of the Financing Commitments
or any of the Financing Commitments shall be terminated (in each case other
than due to the failure of the condition to Closing set forth in _Section
6.3(g)_ to be satisfied), Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable
best efforts to obtain alternative financing commitments for the portion of
such Financing that becomes unavailable or is the subject of a terminated
Financing Commitment; provided, that if Parent is unable to obtain Alternative
Financing despite the use by Parent and Merger Sub of their reasonable best
efforts then the Company shall have the remedies described in  _Section
7.1(a)(v)_. Parent and Merger Sub may also replace any of the Financing
Commitments to obtain more favorable economic terms with the Companys prior
approval, which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (it
being understood that any replacement involving Comerica Bank on terms
substantially similar to those previously discussed between the parties is
hereby approved by the Company). The alternative Financing Commitments
described in this subsection are referred to as the " _Alternative Financing
Commitments_ " and the debt financing to be provided pursuant to such
Alternative Financing Commitments is referred to as the " _Alternative
Financing_ ". In the event that Alternative Financing Commitments are
required to be obtained because any of the Financing has become unavailable or
been terminated due to an event outside Parents control, then Parent shall
use reasonable best efforts to obtain the Alternative Financing Commitments
within ten (10) Business Days after Parent is first notified that such
Financing has or will become unavailable or terminated, but not later than the
Closing Date or, if earlier, the tenth (10th) Business Day prior to the End
Date, and in the event Alternative Financing Commitments are obtained for any
other reason, such Alternative Financing Commitments shall be in place
immediately upon termination of the Financing being replaced. The Alternative
Financing Commitments shall be on terms and conditions (including termination
rights and funding conditions) no less favorable to Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company than the current Financing Commitments that are being replaced.
Parent shall provide the Company with a copy of the commitment letters
evidencing such Alternative Financing Commitments (the " _Alternative
Commitment Letters_ "). Such Alternative Financing Commitments shall be
deemed to be included in the Financing Commitments, all references to
"Financing Commitments" shall be deemed to include the Alternative Financing
Commitments, all references to "Financing" shall be deemed to include the
Alternative Financing, all references to "Equity Commitment Letter" or "Debt
Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include the Alternative Commitment
Letters, and Parent and Merger Sub shall have the same obligations with
respect thereto (including under this _Section 5.9_) as they had with
respect to the Financing Commitments being replaced.

(g) The Company shall provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and each of
its and their respective Representatives, including its legal and accounting
Representatives, to provide, such cooperation as may be necessary and
reasonably requested by Parent to assist Parent in causing the conditions in
the Debt Commitment Letter to be satisfied and to obtain the Financing,
including (i) providing all periodic filings pursuant to the Exchange
Act, (ii) subject to obtaining confidentiality agreements with respect to
information that is not made publicly available, such other reasonably
requested financial information necessary for the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, including information for
inclusion in pro forma financial information, and other financial information
as may be reasonably requested in writing by Parent to assist in preparation
of customary offering or information documents to be used for the completion
of the Financing, (iii) making available, at times mutually agreed upon,
appropriate members of senior management of the Company for the purpose of
meeting

 



47  with proposed lenders providing or arranging the Financing, rating agencies,
diligence sessions relating to the Company and road shows, (iv) cooperating
with reasonable requests relating to the marketing efforts for the Financing
(including consenting to the reasonable use of the Companys logos), (v)
providing access to the most recent appraisals, environmental reports,
evidence of title (including copies of deeds, lease documentation, title
insurance policies and/or commitments for title insurance, title opinions,
surveys, and similar information), and similar information with respect to the
properties and assets of the Company as may be reasonably requested by Parent
and that are in the possession of the Company or its advisors, (vi) reviewing
and commenting on information relating to the Company within the Companys
Knowledge included in materials for rating agency presentations,
confidential information memoranda and other customary offering and marketing
materials requested in connection with the Financing, (vii) furnishing Parent
with information in the Companys possession that any lender providing or
arranging Financing has reasonably requested and that is required by
regulatory authorities in connection with such Financing under applicable
"know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations,
including without limitation the PATRIOT Act, and (viii) subject to obtaining
confidentiality agreements with respect to information that is not made
publicly available, providing Financing Source Parties with access to the due
diligence files prepared in connection with this Agreement and otherwise
cooperating with diligence efforts of the Financing Source Parties to the
extent customary and reasonable. In no event shall the Company and its
officers be required to take any action that would create any liability to the
Company to any Financing Source Parties prior to the Effective Time or after
the termination of this Agreement, and Parent shall be solely responsible (and
will make clear in any presentations to Financing Source Parties that it is
solely responsible) for the information provided to Financing Source Parties;
provided that the foregoing shall not limit the Companys liability to Parent
and Merger Sub for any breach of any representations, warranties and covenants
in this Agreement, subject to the terms and limitations set forth herein or
limit the Companys responsibility for the accuracy of the historical
information of the Company. Subject to the preceding sentence, the Company
will make its executive officers reasonably available to assist Parent in
Parents preparation for and presentations to Financing Source Parties and to
review any historical information of the Company; provided that in no event
shall any information be furnished about the Company if the
disclosure thereof would require the Company to make a filing or public
disclosure as to material non-public information without the written consent
of the Company (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, and provided, further, that none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or
incur any other liability in connection with the Financing prior to the
Effective Time. The Company will provide Parent with (A) customary pay-off
letters with respect to the current credit facilities of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and (B) recordable form lien releases, canceled notes and other
documents reasonably requested by Parent prior to the Closing indicating that
all Liens resulting from such credit facilities shall be satisfied, terminated
and discharged on or prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary, the condition set forth in _Section 6.3(b)_, as it applies to
the Companys obligations under this _Section 5.9(g)_, shall be deemed
satisfied unless there has occurred a Willful Breach of its obligations under
this _Section 5.9(g)_.

 

(h) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts, and shall cause its
Affiliates to use their reasonable best efforts, to refrain from such actions
and from entering into any transaction, including any merger, acquisition,
joint venture, disposition, lease, contract or debt or equity financing, that
is taken with the knowledge that such action would reasonably be expected to
materially impair, delay or prevent consummation of the Financing contemplated
by the Financing Commitments.

 



48 (i) If Parent or any of its Affiliates obtain or perform, whether for
its benefit or for the benefit of any Financing Source Party, a letter or
other evaluation of the solvency or financial capacity of Parent or Merger Sub
after giving effect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby (including the Financing), Parent shall provide the Company with a
copy of any such letter or evaluation.

(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this _Section 5.9_ shall require, and in no event shall
the reasonable best efforts of Parent be deemed or construed to require,
either Parent or Merger Sub to (i) bring any enforcement action against any
source of the Financing to enforce its respective rights under the Financing
Commitments, except that Parent shall seek enforcement of the Equity
Commitment Letter solely if the Company seeks and is granted a decree of
specific performance after all conditions to the granting therefor set forth
in _Section 8.5_ of this Agreement have been satisfied, (ii) seek payment
from any source other than those counterparty to, or in any amount in excess
of that contemplated by, the Equity Commitment Letter or (iii) pay any fees in
excess of those contemplated by the Financing Commitments (whether to secure
waiver of any conditions contained therein or otherwise).

 

Section 5.10 _Stockholder Litigation._

 

(a) The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate at its own
expense in the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against
the Company and/or its directors relating to the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that no such settlement
shall be agreed to without Parents consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(b) The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any claims received by it
relating to any Dissenting Shares or Dissenting Stockholders, and Parent shall
have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to such claims. The Company shall not settle or compromise prior to
the Effective Time any claim of a Dissenting Stockholder without the prior
written consent of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Parent and Merger Sub consent to the Company providing
its stockholders with dissenters rights in connection with the Merger as
required by the DGCL.

Section 5.11 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i)
any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may
be required in connection with the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of such communication or the
failure of such party to obtain such consent could reasonably be expected to
be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of
their Subsidiaries, (ii) any actions, suits, claims, investigations
or proceedings commenced or, to such partys Knowledge, threatened against,

 



49  relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its
Subsidiaries which relate to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby, (iii) the discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of
which, would or would reasonably be expected to cause or result in any of the
conditions to the Merger set forth in _ARTICLE 6_ not being satisfied or
satisfaction of those conditions being materially delayed in violation of any
provision of this Agreement; provided, however, that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this _Section 5.11_ shall not (x) cure any breach of, or
non-compliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or (y) limit the
remedies available to the party receiving such notice. The Company shall
notify Parent, on a current basis, of any events or changes with respect to
any criminal or regulatory investigation or action involving the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, and shall reasonably cooperate with Parent or its
Affiliates in efforts to mitigate any adverse consequences to Parent or its
Affiliates which may arise (including by coordinating and providing
assistance in meeting with regulators).

Section 5.12 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all commercially reasonable steps to cause dispositions of Company equity
securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a director or
officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

Section 5.13 _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any partys
rights or obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand and agree
that (i) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys operations prior to
the Effective Time, and (ii) prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
complete control and supervision over its operations.

Section 5.14 _Standstill_. Except as expressly contemplated by this
Agreement, from the date hereof until the earlier to occur of the Effective
Time or the last day of the Restricted Period, Parent and its Representatives
will not, and will not encourage or assist others to: (a) acquire, offer or
propose to acquire, or agree or seek to acquire, directly or indirectly, by
purchase or otherwise, any securities or direct or indirect rights or options
to acquire any securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries with the intent
or effect of acquiring a controlling interest in the Company or its
Subsidiaries or of any successor to or person in control of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, or any assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries or
divisions thereof or of any such successor or controlling person, (b) enter
into or agree, offer, propose or seek to enter into, or otherwise be involved
in or part of, directly or indirectly, any acquisition transaction or other
business combination relating to all or part of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or any acquisition transaction for all or part of the assets of
the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses; (c)
make, or in any way participate in, directly or indirectly, any "solicitation"
of "proxies" (as such terms are used in the rules of the SEC) to vote, or seek
to advise or influence any person or entity with respect to the voting of,
any voting securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (d) form,
join or in any way participate in a "group" (within the meaning of Section

Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (e) seek or propose, alone or in concert
with others, to influence or control the Companys management or policies; (f)

activities to any other Person; (g) advise, assist, encourage, act as a
financing source for or otherwise invest in any other Person in connection

foregoing, (y) prior to the commencement of the Restricted Period, Parent and
its Representatives may take the actions permitted by this Agreement in order
to effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
cooperating with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement and
Additional Filings and furnishing information for inclusions therein and (z)
the provisions of this _Section 5.14_ shall be inoperative and of no force or
effect (1) if and while the Company is in breach of its obligations pursuant
to  _Section 5.3(b)(iii)_ or the Company has failed to pay the Company
Termination Fee and Expenses required to be paid in connection with the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(a)(iii)(B)_, (2) if,
from and after the date hereof, (A) any Person or group shall have acquired
or entered into a binding definitive agreement that has been approved by the
Board (or any duly constituted committee thereof) to acquire more than 50% of
the outstanding voting securities of the Company or assets of the Company or
its Subsidiaries representing more than 50% of the consolidated earnings power
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (B) any Person
publicly announces or commences a tender or exchange offer which, if
consummated, would result in such Persons acquisition of beneficial ownership
of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the Company and
within 10 days of such announcement or commencement the Board (or any duly
constituted committee thereof) has not recommended to its stockholders that
they reject such tender or exchange offer; or (3) if the Board (or any duly
constituted committee thereof) shall have determined in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to waive,
limit, amend or otherwise modify the provisions of this paragraph would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board
under applicable Law. 

Section 5.15 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) For a period of not less than 12 months following the Effective Time, the
employees of the Company and each Subsidiary of the Company, other than the
Executives, who remain in the employment of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent
during this time (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") shall receive compensation
and benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the
compensation and benefits provided to such employees of the Company and the
Subsidiaries of the Company during the 12 month period immediately prior to
the Effective Time; provided, however, that in no event shall Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) be required to take
into account any amounts owed in connection with a change in control, equity
compensation or bonus performance targets when determining whether
compensation and benefits are substantially comparable.

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent in which Continuing Employees and their eligible
dependents will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time,
for purposes of determining eligibility to participate (but not for purposes
of early retirement programs), level of benefits including benefit accruals
(other than benefit accruals and early retirement subsidies under any defined
benefit pension plan) and vesting, service recognized by the Company and any
Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
treated as service with Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent; provided, however,
that, notwithstanding that service to the Company shall

 



51  be recognized by Parents benefit plans in accordance with the forgoing, the
date of initial participation of each Continuing Employee in any Parent
benefit plan shall be no earlier than the Effective Time; further provided,
however, that such service need not be recognized to the extent that (i) such
Parent employee benefit plan does not recognize service of similarly situated
employees of Parent or Subsidiaries of Parent or (ii) such recognition would
result in any duplication of benefits.

(c) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and the Company
shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring, Parent to
continue any specific plans or to continue the employment, or to make any
changes to the terms and conditions of the employment, of any specific
person. Furthermore, no provision of this Agreement shall be construed as
prohibiting or limiting the ability of Parent to amend, modify or terminate
any plans, programs, policies, arrangements, agreements or understandings of
Parent or the Company. Without limiting the scope of _Section 8.10_, nothing
in this _Section 5.15_ shall confer any rights or remedies of any kind or
description upon any Continuing Employee or any other person other than the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

(d) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Parent or any Subsidiary
of Parent in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after the
Effective Time, Parent or such Subsidiary of Parent shall (i) to the extent
allowed by Law and such plan, waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions and exclusions with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to such employees to the extent such
conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did not apply to such employees
under the analogous welfare plans of the Company and the Subsidiaries of the
Company prior to the Effective Time and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee
with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid and for out-of-pocket
maximums incurred prior to the Effective Time and during the portion of the
plan year of the applicable Company welfare plan ending at the Effective Time,
in satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket requirements to the
extent applicable under any such plan.

 

(e) From the date hereof until the earlier to occur of the Effective Time or
the last day of the Restricted Period, neither Parent nor the Company will
directly or indirectly, solicit for employment any employee of the other party
or any of its Subsidiaries with whom it has contact or who became known to
them in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (not
including a general solicitation of employment not specifically directed
towards employees of such party or its Subsidiaries); provided that the
foregoing provision shall not prevent the hiring party from employing any
such person who contacts it on his or her own initiative without any direct
or indirect solicitation by, or encouragement from the hiring party.

(f) Nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to
constitute an amendment to any Parent benefit plan or Company Benefit Plan or
any other compensation or benefits plan maintained for or provided to
employees, directors or consultants of Parent or the Company prior to or
following the Effective Time.

Section 5.16 _Employment Agreements._ Upon the Effective Time, the employment
of each executive officer (each, an " _Executive_ ") of the Company listed
in  _Section 5.16_ of the Company Exceptions Letter shall be terminated,
with such termination deemed to be an involuntary termination without cause.
The Company shall pay each Executive an amount in 

 



52  cash set forth next to such Executives name on _Section 5.16_ of the
Company Exceptions Letter, which is the amount owed to such Executive in
connection with a change in control pursuant to the employment agreement by
and between the Company and such Executive. The Company shall pay each other
employee of the Company who is terminated in connection with the Closing and
owed a payment pursuant to a contract with the Company in effect on the date
hereof the amount owed pursuant to such contract. Such payments shall be made
to each Executive and other employee on the Closing Date or, if such payment
would result in the payment of an excise tax or deferral of such
payment pursuant to Section 409A of the Code, then Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to make such payment as soon as allowable without an
excise tax. The Company shall cause each such Executive or other employee, as
a condition to receipt of such payment, to execute and deliver to the Company
a release, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, stating
that the amount paid to such person at the Closing satisfies all amounts
payable by the Company to such person in connection with a change in control
or in connection with termination of such persons employment following a
change in control. Parent and Surviving Corporation agree that all of their
income and employment tax returns and other applicable filings will reflect
that all payments described above in this _Section 5.16 _have been made in
compliance with Section 409A of the Code, that no such payments shall be
reported on Form W-2 using Code Z in Box 12 (or its successor) and that
neither Parent nor Surviving Corporation shall take any position (whether in
audits, tax returns or otherwise) that is inconsistent with such treatment;
provided, that the foregoing shall not apply to any payment that is made under
a nonqualified deferred compensation plan (within the meaning of Section 409A
of the Code) that does not satisfy the requirements of Section 409A of the
Code as of the Closing Date (or did not satisfy such requirements at any time
prior to the Closing Date).

Section 5.17 _Senior Notes._ The parties agree to take the actions set forth
on  _Schedule 5.17_ to this Agreement with respect to the Companys 7.50%
senior notes due 2019 (the " _Notes_ ").

Section 5.18 _Certain Tax Matters._ During the period from the date of this
Agreement to the date of the Effective Time, (i) the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries shall timely file all Tax Returns required to be filed by each
such entity during such period (after taking into account any extensions)
(each, a " _Post-Signing Return_ "), which Post-Signing Returns shall be
complete and correct in all respects and, except as otherwise required by
Law, shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the past practice of the
Company; provided, however, that no material Post-Signing Returns shall be
filed with any Governmental Entity without Parents written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; (ii) the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries shall timely pay all Taxes due and payable with
respect to the Tax periods covered by such Post-Signing Returns; (iii) the
Company shall accrue a liability in its books and records and financial
statements in accordance with GAAP and past practice for all Taxes payable by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for which no Post-Signing Return
is due prior to the day of the Effective Time; (iv) the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries shall promptly notify Parent of any suit, claim, action,
investigation, proceeding or audit pending against or with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of any material amount of Tax
and will not settle or compromise any such suit, claim, action, investigation,
proceeding or audit without Parents prior written consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; and (v) the Company and each
of its Subsidiaries shall retain all books, documents and records necessary
for the preparation of Tax Returns and reports and Tax audits consistent with
its standard policy.

 



53 Section 5.19 _Certain Regulatory Approvals._ The Parties agree to take the
actions set forth on _Schedule 5.19_ to this Agreement with respect to seeking
certain regulatory approvals in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

determination shall be grounds for the Company to terminate this Agreement;
and provided further that the Company shall not have breached or failed to

date, irrevocably confirming that fact; or

(D) there exists a Company SF Termination Right pursuant to _Schedule 5.19_ of
this Agreement.

(iv) by Parent, if:

listen" communication by the Board to the Companys stockholders pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, or any substantially similar communication
to the Companys stockholders shall not be deemed to constitute a withdrawal,
modification or change of its Recommendation.

(C) there exists a Parent SF Termination Right pursuant to _Schedule 5.19_ of
this Agreement.

(v) The Company shall be entitled to all remedies, including specific
performance to require Parent to enforce the Equity Commitment Letter, if the

or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature can only be
satisfied at Closing) and there has not been a prior termination pursuant to
_Section 7.1(a)(iii)(B)_ or _Section 7.1(a)(iv)(B)_; provided that the
Company or Parent shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement,

(A) at any time if a Financing Failure occurs at any time on or after the date
of this Agreement and has not been replaced with Alternative Financing
Commitments in the time period and in the manner provided in _Section
5.9(f)_, despite Parents satisfaction of its obligations in _Section 5.5
_and  _Section 5.9_, provided that Parent shall not be entitled to terminate
this Agreement under this _Section 7.1(a)(v)(A)_ if it has breached in any
material respect its obligations under this Agreement, or

 

(B) if the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.3
_are satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature
can only be satisfied at Closing) and, despite Parents satisfaction of its
obligations in _Section 5.5_ and _Section 5.9_, Parent has not received the
proceeds from the Financing on or before the date that _Section 1.2_ fixes
as the Closing Date following the satisfaction of such conditions, provided
that Parent shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 7.1(a)(v)(B)_ if it has breached in any material respect its
obligations under this Agreement.

In the case of any termination under this  _Section 7.1(a)(v)_, the Company
shall not be entitled to specific performance or to damages (other than for
fraud or Willful Breach) against Parent if within three (3) Business Days
after such termination Parent shall have paid the Company the Parent
Termination Fee and the Expenses of the Company not exceeding the Expense Cap.
If Parent has paid the Company the Parent Termination Fee and the Expenses of
the Company not exceeding the Expense Cap in accordance with the terms
of this _Section 7.1(a)(v)_, the receipt of

 



58  the Parent Termination Fee and the Expenses of the Company shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of the Company (and any of its stockholders, partners,
members, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, Representatives or
agents) against any financing source with which Parent obtains or seeks to
obtain financing in connection with the Merger or any of the stockholders,
partners, members, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees or agents of
Parent and any of their Affiliates and any of such entities or their
Affiliates respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
shareholders, managers, members, directors, officers, employees,
Representatives or agents (collectively, " _Financing Source Parties_ "), in
connection with this Agreement, the Financing Commitments, the Debt Commitment
Letter, the Financing or the performance of services thereunder, whether at
law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. As used herein, "
_Financing Failure_ " means (i) a failure by Parent and/or Merger Sub to
receive the proceeds from the Financing by the date the Closing should have
occurred pursuant to _Section 1.2_, and (1) all conditions to Closing set
forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.3_ had been satisfied or waived (other
than those conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at Closing)
and (2) the Company stood ready, willing and able to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement on that date and the Company had
given Parent written notice on or prior to such date, irrevocably confirming
that fact, (ii) the termination, withdrawal or expiration of any of the
Financing Commitments, (iii) the disclosure or notice by any of the Financing
Source Parties that financing under a Financing Commitment will not be
available or will likely not be available, (iv) Parent no longer believes in
good faith that it will be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing
contemplated by the Financing Commitments substantially on the terms described
therein unless Parent obtains (and provides to the Company) written
confirmations that such Financing will in fact be available substantially on
the terms of the Financing Commitments within two (2) Business Days after it
makes its original determination or (v) Parent becomes aware of any material
breach by any party of the Financing Commitments and such breach is not cured
within two (2) Business Days thereafter or, if earlier, the tenth (10th)
Business Day prior to the End Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties
acknowledge and agree that a failure of the condition set forth in _Section
6.3(f)_ shall not constitute a Financing Failure.

(b) A terminating party shall provide written notice of termination to the
other party specifying with particularity the reason for such termination,
and, except as otherwise provided in  _Section 7.1(a)_; any termination
shall be effective immediately upon delivery of such written notice to the
other party. provided that with respect to a termination under _Section
7.1(a)(ii)(A)_ such termination shall be effective only if the Company
concurrently with the termination of this Agreement pays the fee due under
_Section 7.2_.

(c) In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
7.1_, this Agreement shall terminate (except no such termination shall relieve
any party of any liability under the Confidentiality Agreement and the
provisions of _Section 5.14_, _Section 5.15(e)_, _Section 7.1(c)_, _Section
7.2_ and _ARTICLE 8_ shall survive such termination), and there shall be no
other liability or obligation on the part of the Company or Parent and Merger
Sub to the other, except as specified in _Section 7.1(c)_, _Section 7.2_ and
_Section 8.5_ (subject to any other provisions pertaining thereto expressly
set forth in this Agreement). Except as provided in this _Section 7.1(c)_,
nothing contained in this Agreement and no actual or purported termination of
this Agreement:

 

(i) shall limit, restrict, extinguish or otherwise affect the remedies
available to Company, Parent and Merger Sub specified in this Agreement,
including _Section 7.1(c)_, _Section 7.2 _and _Section 8.5_;

 



59 (ii) shall relieve either party for damages with respect to fraud or
Willful Breach of this Agreement or a breach of this Agreement as to which
specific performance is not available pursuant to _Section 8.5_ (provided
that if Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(a)(v) _the
Company shall be entitled to seek damages and any other remedies at law or in
equity unless Parent shall have paid the Parent Termination Fee as provided in
_Section 7.1(a)(v)_). In the event that the Company is entitled to recover
damages, such damage award may also include damages based on the
consideration that would have otherwise been payable to the Companys
stockholders, and in the event that Parent and Merger Sub are entitled to
recover damages, such damage award may also include damages based on loss of
the economic benefits of the transaction. Any action permitted pursuant to
_Section 5.3_ and the termination by the Company pursuant to _Section
7.1(a)(iii)(B)_ shall not constitute a breach of the Company covenants
hereunder. Neither party shall be liable for damages (actual, consequential or
otherwise) with respect to any breach of a representation, warranty covenant
or agreement set forth in this Agreement except as set forth in this 
_Section 7.1(c)(ii)_. In the event that a party is entitled to a termination
fee and expense reimbursement pursuant to _Section 7.2_, and such fee and
expense reimbursement is paid in full, such partys receipt of such fee shall
be the sole and exclusive remedy of such party and its subsidiaries and
Affiliates against the other party and its subsidiaries and Affiliates for any
loss, cost, damage or expense suffered with respect to this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated hereby, the termination of this Agreement, the
failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated
or any breach of this Agreement by any party, and in no event shall any party
be liable for damages in addition to a termination fee and reimbursement of
Expenses pursuant to _Section 7.2_; _provided_ , _however_ , that a party may
concurrently plead or otherwise seek in the alternative damages pursuant to
this  _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_, a termination fee and reimbursement of Expenses
pursuant to _Section 7.2 _and the equitable remedies available pursuant to
_Section 8.5_, but in no event shall a party be entitled to recover
all three remedies but will be required to make an election of remedies at
the time of any award of remedies.

Section 7.2  _Termination Fee and Expenses_ _._

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each party hereto shall
pay its own expenses incident to preparing for, entering into and carrying out
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
whether or not the Merger shall be consummated.

 

(b) In the event that:

(i) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(a)(iii)(B)_; or

60  Person who has made, or publicly disclosed or announced, a Qualifying
Alternative Proposal after the date of this Agreement but prior to such
termination shall have entered into a Qualifying Definitive Agreement with
the Company within twelve (12) months after such termination; or

(iii) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(a)(iv)(A)_
or _Section 7.1(a)(iv)(B)_,

(A) all of the Expenses of Parent and Merger Sub; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company will under no circumstances be required to pay Expenses
exceeding the Expense Cap; and

(B) the Company Termination Fee in cash. As used herein, the " _Company
Termination Fee_ " means (A) an amount equal to $11,000,000 if the Company
Termination Fee becomes payable in connection with the Company entering into
an Alternative Proposal with an Excluded Person and (B) an amount equal to
$16,500,000 in all other circumstances other than as set forth in _Section
7.2(b)(iii)(C)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company
be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion. If
the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to clause (i) above, the
Company Termination Fee will be payable on the date of the termination of this
Agreement; if the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to clause (ii)
above, the Company Termination Fee will be payable within one (1) Business Day
after the date on which the Company enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to the Alternative Proposal; if Parent terminates this Agreement
pursuant to clause (iii) above, the Company Termination Fee will be payable no
later than three (3) Business Days after notice of termination of this
Agreement.

 

(C) Notwithstanding _Section 7.2(b)(iii)(B)_, in the event that Parent
terminates this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 7.1(a)(ii)(A)_ and the
conditions set forth in clauses (B) and (C) of _Section 7.2(b)(ii)_ have
occurred, then the Company Termination Fee shall mean an amount equal to the
lesser of (i) the Company Termination Fee as defined in _Section
7.2(b)(iii)(B)_ or (ii) the difference between (x) the aggregate purchase
price to be paid to all holders of shares of Company Common Stock for such
shares of Company Common Stock upon the closing of the transactions
contemplated by the Qualifying Definitive Agreement _minus_ (y) the product of
$6.50 times the number of Common Shares eligible to receive Common Stock
Merger Consideration that are outstanding as of the date hereof. Any Company
Termination Fee payable pursuant to this _Section 7.2(b)(iii)(C) _will be
payable no later than one (1) Business Day after the Company enters into a
Qualifying Definitive Agreement.

 

(c) In the event that the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1(a)(iii)(A)_ or  _Section 7.1(a)(iii)(C)_ or the Company or
Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(a)(v)_, then Parent
shall pay to the Company:

 

(i) all of the Expenses of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent
and Merger Sub will under no circumstances be required to pay Expenses
exceeding the Expense Cap; or

 



61 (ii) a fee of $16,500,000 in cash (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ "), it
being understood that in no event shall the Parent be required to pay the
Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion. The Parent Termination Fee
will be payable no later than three (3) Business Days after notice
of termination of this Agreement.

(d) As used herein, (A) the " _Expense Cap_ " shall mean $1,000,000 and (B) "
_Expenses_ " shall mean all reasonable, itemized, and documented out-of-pocket
fees and expenses (including loan commitment fees, due diligence expenses, and
all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, consultants, financial
advisors and investment bankers, incurred by Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as
applicable, or on its behalf in connection with or related to the
authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this
Agreement and the Financing and all other matters related to the Merger.

(e) In circumstances in which Expenses are payable, such payment shall be
made to the party entitled thereto not later than five (5) Business Days after
delivery to the liable party of an itemization setting forth all Expenses
(which itemization may be supplemented and updated from time to time by such
party until the 60th day after such party delivers such notice of demand for
payment). Any payments required hereunder shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent or the
Company, as the case may be.

(f) The parties acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in this
_Section 7.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter
into this Agreement. If a party fails to promptly pay any amount due by
it pursuant to this _Section 7.2_, interest shall accrue on such amount from
the date such payment was required to be paid pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement until the date of payment at the rate of 8% per annum. If, in
order to obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit that results
in judgment for such party for such amount, the defaulting party shall pay the
other party its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such suit. Each of the parties
hereto further acknowledges that neither the payment of the amounts by the
Company nor the payment of the amounts by Parent specified in this _Section
7.2_ is a penalty in the circumstances in which such fees are payable and
which do not involve fraud or Willful Breach.

 

(g) Except in the event of fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement by Parent
in which the Company seeks, is awarded and is entitled to receive damages or
specific performance of this Agreement pursuant to, and subject to the
limitations contained in, _Section 8.5 _(in which case the Company shall not
be entitled to receive payment of the Parent Termination Fee), the Companys
receipt of the Parent Termination Fee and payment of Expenses as provided in
_Section 7.2(c)_ and the Companys right to specific performance of this
Agreement by the parties hereto pursuant to, and subject to the limitations
contained in, _Section 8.5 _shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the
Company and its Subsidiaries against Parent, Merger Sub and any of their
respective former, current, or future direct or indirect shareholders
or equityholders, managers, members, directors, officers, employees,
Affiliates, Representatives or agents (collectively, the _"_ _Parent Related
Parties_ _"_ ) and against the Financing Source Parties for any loss,
cost, damage or expense suffered with respect to this Agreement, the
transactions

 



62  contemplated hereby, the Debt Commitment Letter, the Financing or the
performance of services thereunder, the termination of this Agreement, the
failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated
or any breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub, and upon payment of
such amount, none of the Parent Related Parties shall have any further
liability or obligation to the Company (other than pursuant to
the Confidentiality Agreements) relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any claims or actions
under applicable Law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure.

 

(h) Except in the event of fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement by the
Company in which Parent seeks, is awarded and is entitled receive damages or
specific performance as provided for in _Section 8.5_ (in which case Parent
shall not be entitled to receive payment of the Company Termination Fee),
receipt by Parent or its designee of the Company Termination Fee and payment
of Expenses as provided in _Section 7.2(b)_ and Parents right to specific
performance prior to termination (but not after termination) of this Agreement
provided for in _Section 8.5 _shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Parent Related Parties against the Company, its Subsidiaries and any of their
respective former, current, or future direct or indirect shareholders,
directors, officers, employees, managers, members,
Affiliates, Representatives or agents (collectively, the " _Company Related
Parties_ ") for any loss, cost, damage or expense suffered with respect to
this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby, the termination of this
Agreement or the failure of the Merger to be consummated, and upon payment of
such amounts, none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any claims or actions under
applicable Law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company (and any of
its stockholders, partners, members, Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, Representatives or agents) hereby waives any rights or claims
against any Financing Source Party in connection with this Agreement or the
Financing Commitments, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise.

Section 7.3 _Frustration of Closing Conditions._ Neither the Company nor
Parent may rely, either as a basis for not consummating the Merger,
terminating this Agreement and abandoning the Merger or preventing the other
party from exercising its rights to terminate this Agreement under _Section
7.1_, on the failure of any condition set forth in _Section 6.1_, _Section
6.2_ or _Section 6.3_, as the case may be, to be satisfied if such failure
was caused by such partys breach in any material respect of this Agreement or
any covenant set forth herein.

THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER, THE FINANCING OR THE PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES
THEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF
THE STATE OF DELAWARE, REGARDLESS OF THE LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN
UNDER ANY APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE.

Section 8.5  _Specific Enforcement; Venue._

(a) The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor.
It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _ARTICLE 7_ , the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the performance of terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court
referred to in clause (c)(i) below, without proof of actual damages (and each
party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in
connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity; _provided_ , that the Company
shall not be entitled to seek or obtain any specific performance, injunction
or other equitable relief as to Parents obligation to cause the funding of
the Equity Commitment Letter and Debt Commitment Letter if the Parent or the
Company properly exercises the termination right provided in _Section
7.1(a)(v)_ and the Company is paid the Parent Termination Fee as and when
provided therein. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of
specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable
for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide
an adequate remedy for any such breach nor to assert that the obligation of a
party to pay the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as
applicable, pursuant to _Section 7.2_ shall be evidence that the parties have
adequate remedies at law and therefore shall not be entitled to equitable
relief pursuant to this _Section 8.5_. Notwithstanding any provision herein
to the contrary, it is explicitly agreed that the Company shall not be
entitled to seek or obtain any specific performance, injunction, or other
equitable relief under this Agreement in the event that the Parent is entitled
to and validly terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(a)_ and
pays the Parent Termination Fee to the Company pursuant to _Section
7.1(a)(v)_.

 



64 (b) If, pursuant to a claim for specific performance brought against a
party pursuant to this _Section 8.5_, a court of competent jurisdiction as
provided in this _Section 8.5_ has declined to specifically enforce the
obligations of a party or parties hereto to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, and if such party is obligated to but has not paid the
Parent Termination Fee or Company Termination Fee, as applicable, the other
party may pursue monetary damages as permitted by _Section 7.2(c) _(but only
in the circumstances set forth therein).

(c) Each of the parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the
personal jurisdiction of any Delaware state court or any Federal court
located in the State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of this
Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court, and (iii) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this
Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in any court other than any Delaware state court or any Federal
court sitting in the State of Delaware.

(d) Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any
action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind
or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort
or otherwise, against the Financing Source Parties in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
but not limited to any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt Financing or the performance thereof, in any
forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New
York, or, if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the
Federal courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York sitting in the borough of Manhattan (and appellate courts thereof).

Section 8.6 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_ _._ EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING THAT MAY BE
BASED UPON, ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE NEGOTIATION,

66 Section 8.8 ___Assignment; Binding Effect._ __Neither this Agreement nor any
of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned or
transferred by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or
otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties, except
that Merger Sub may assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all of its
rights, interest and obligations under this agreement to Parent or to any
direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment
shall relieve Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder, and any purported
assignment or transfer without such consent shall be null and void. Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure
to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

Section 8.9 _Severability._ If any provision of this Agreement is held by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced under any Law, all other provisions of this Agreement remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic and legal substance of
the transactions contemplated hereby are not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party hereto. If any court of competent jurisdiction
determines that any provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith in an attempt
to agree to another provision (instead of the provision held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable) that is valid, legal and enforceable and carries out
the parties intentions to the greatest lawful extent under this Agreement.

Section 8.10 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries._ This Agreement
(including the exhibits and letters hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior or
contemporaneous agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between
the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof and, except as set forth in (x) _Section 5.8 _and (y) the proviso
hereto, is not intended to and shall not confer upon any person other than the
parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder; provided that provisions of
_Section 7.1(a)(v)_, _Section 7.2(g)_, _Section 8.4_, _Section 8.5(d)_ and
_Section 8.6 _shall survive the consummation of the Merger and expressly are
intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the Financing Source
Parties. The parties further agree that the Exclusivity Agreement dated
December 16, 2011 by and among the Company, Macquarie Infrastructure Partners
II U.S., L.P. and Macquarie Infrastructure Partners II International, L.P. is
terminated upon the date hereof.

Section 8.11 _Amendments; Waivers._ Subject to _Section 6.1_, at any time
prior to the Effective Time, any provision of this Agreement may be amended or
waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed,
in the case of an amendment, by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, or in the
case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective
(and, in the case of the Company, as approved by the Board); provided,
however, that  _Section 7.1(a)(v)_, _Section 7.2(g)_, _Section 8.4_,
_Section 8.5(d)_ and _Section 8.6_ may not be amended without the prior
written consent of the Financing Source Parties; and; provided
further, however, that after receipt of Company Stockholder Approval, if any
such amendment or waiver shall by applicable Law or in accordance with the
rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Stock Market require further approval of
the stockholders of the Company, the effectiveness of such amendment or
waiver shall be subject to the approval of the stockholders of the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company or Parent in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall
any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
of any other right hereunder.
