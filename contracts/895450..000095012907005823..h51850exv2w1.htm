EXECUTION COPY 

   

 _SHARE PURCHASE AGREEMENT_  

   

 THIS SHARE PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into as of October 31, 2007, by and among Willbros USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Buyer_ "), Willbros Group, Inc., a Republic of Panama corporation (" _WGI_ ", but WGI is a party hereto only for the purposes of _Sections 1.01(a)(ii)_, _1.02(b)(vi)_ , _5.08_ ,  _7.07_ , _7.08_ and _7.09_ below), Integrated Service Company LLC, an Oklahoma limited liability company (the " _Company_ "), the Persons listed on the _Shareholders Schedule_ attached hereto (the " _Shareholders Schedule_ ") (collectively referred to herein as the " _Shareholders_ " and individually as a " _Shareholder_ "), and the Shareholders Representative (as defined herein), solely in his capacity as the Shareholders Representative. Unless otherwise provided, capitalized terms used herein are defined in _Article 10_ below. 

  

 The Shareholders own all of the issued and outstanding shares of limited liability company membership interest of the Company, as described in the Company Operating Agreement (as defined below), which, as of the date hereof, consist of 908,500 shares of membership interest, as set forth on the _Shareholders Schedule_ (the " _Shares_ "). 

  

 Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Buyer desires to acquire from the Shareholders, and the Shareholders desire to sell to the Buyer, the Shares. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE 1 
  _PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES_  

   

     1.01  |   | _Purchase and Sale of the Shares_.  
---|---|--- 
   

   

(a) On the terms, and subject to the conditions, set forth in this Agreement,
the Shareholders agree to sell, assign, transfer and deliver to the Buyer on
the Closing Date, and the Buyer agrees to purchase from the Shareholders on
the Closing Date, the Shares, free and clear of all Liens. The aggregate
consideration to be delivered at the Closing by the Buyer to the Shareholders
for the Shares shall be $225,000,000 (the " _Purchase Price_ "), consisting
of (i) an amount of cash equal to $202,500,000, _minus_ (1) the amount of the
Aggregate Stock Rights Payments to be paid pursuant to _Section 1.02(b)(iii)_
below, _minus_ (2) the amount of the Financial Advisory Fees and Transaction
Expenses to be paid pursuant to _Section 1.02(b)(iv)_ below, and  _minus_
(3) the aggregate amount of the Shareholder Loans (that shall be
deemed satisfied in full by the obligors on such loans at Closing, by virtue
of this deduction from the Purchase Price) (the " _Cash Price_ "); and (ii)
637,475 shares of WGI Common Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a part of
the Cash Price equal to the Escrow Amount shall be deposited with the Escrow
Agent pursuant to _Section 1.02(b)(v)_ below, and the Cash Price will be
subject to adjustment as set forth in _Sections 1.01(b), (c) and
(d)_ below. 

   ##### 

  

   

(b)  _Closing Date Adjustment._  

   

(i) At the Closing, the Cash Price will be adjusted dollar-for-dollar as set
forth in this _Section 1.01(b)_. Not less than ten (10) business days prior
to the Closing Date, the Company will, in accordance with GAAP, using the
process identified in the Working Capital Computation exhibit attached hereto
as _Exhibit A_ , estimate the Companys Working Capital as of the close of
business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, consistent with
the Companys historical practices, and deliver to the Buyer a certificate,
signed by the chief financial officer of the Company, setting forth the
calculation thereof. The amount of Working Capital as estimated pursuant to
this _Section 1.01(b)(i)_ is referred to herein as " _Estimated Working
Capital_." The Actual Working Capital and the Estimated Working Capital shall
treat the Shareholder Loans as having been repaid and shall credit the
aggregate amount of the Shareholder Loans as a current asset, without
duplication. In the event the Buyer objects to the calculation of Estimated
Working Capital, the Shareholders Representative and the Buyer, and
their respective representatives, shall resolve such objection prior to
Closing in a mutually agreeable manner. 

   

(ii) At the Closing: (A) if Estimated Working Capital is less than Target
Working Capital, then the Cash Price will be decreased by the amount of such
deficiency; and (B) if Estimated Working Capital is greater than Target
Working Capital, then the Cash Price will be increased by the amount of such
excess. 

  

     (c)  |   | _Post-Closing Determination_.  
---|---|--- 
   

   

(i) Within eighty (80) days after the Closing Date, the Buyer will conduct a
review of Working Capital as of the close of business on the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date and will prepare and deliver to the Shareholders
Representative a computation of the amount of Working Capital as of the close
of business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the " _Draft
Working Capital Statement_ "), and will deliver to the Shareholders
Representative a certificate, signed by a senior officer of the Company,
setting forth the calculation thereof. The Buyer will, upon request of the
Shareholders Representative, make available to the Shareholders
Representative and his auditors, all books, records and work papers used in
preparing the Draft Working Capital Statement. 

   

(ii) If the Shareholders Representative disagrees with the Buyers
computation of Working Capital reflected on the Draft Working Capital
Statement, the Shareholders Representative may, within thirty (30) days
after receipt of the Draft Working Capital Statement, deliver a notice (an "
_Objection Notice_ ") to the Buyer setting forth the Shareholders
Representatives disagreements in reasonable detail with respect to the
calculation of the Working Capital. If the Shareholders Representative fails
to deliver an Objection Notice by the end of such thirty (30) day period, the
Shareholders Representative shall be deemed to have accepted the Buyers
calculation of Working Capital. If an Objection Notice is delivered,
the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Shareholders Representative, on the
other hand, will use reasonable efforts to resolve any disagreements as to
the computation of Working Capital, but if they do not obtain a final
resolution within fifteen (15) 

   ##### 

  

    

days after the Buyer has received the Objection Notice, either the Buyer or
the Shareholders Representative may refer the disagreements to the
accounting firm of BKD, LLP (the " _Firm_ "), to resolve any remaining
disagreements. The Buyer and the Shareholders Representative will direct the
Firm to render a determination within thirty (30) days of its retention, and
the Buyer, the Shareholders Representative and their respective employees
and agents will cooperate with the Firm during its engagement. The Firm will
consider only those items and amounts in the Draft Working Capital Statement
set forth in the Objection Notice, which the Buyer and the Shareholders
Representative are unable to resolve. The Buyer, on the one hand, and the
Shareholders Representative, on the other hand, shall each submit a binder
to the Firm promptly (and in any event within fifteen (15) days after
the Firms engagement), which binder shall contain their respective
computations of Working Capital and information, arguments and support for
their respective positions. The Firm shall review such binders and base its
determination solely on them in accordance with GAAP and in accordance with
the definition of Working Capital set forth herein. In resolving any disputed
item, the Firm may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest
value for such item claimed by the Buyer or the Shareholders Representative,
or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by the Buyer or the
Shareholders Representative. The determination by the Firm will be
conclusive and binding upon the Buyer, the Company and the Shareholders. The
amount of Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to this  _Section
1.01(c)(ii)_ is referred to herein as " _Actual Working Capital_." 

   

(iii) The cost of the determination of the disputed items by the Firm shall be
borne one-half (1/2) by the Shareholders on the one hand (which amount shall
be paid from the Escrow Amount), and one-half (1/2) by the Buyer on the other
hand. 

   

(d) _Post-Closing Adjustment_. If Actual Working Capital is greater than
Estimated Working Capital, the Buyer shall, within ten (10) business days
after the determination thereof, pay to the Shareholders Representative, for
distribution to the Shareholders in accordance with their respective
Allocable Portions thereof, an amount equal to Actual Working Capital minus
Estimated Working Capital. If Actual Working Capital is less than Estimated
Working Capital, the Shareholders shall, in accordance with their
respective Allocable Portions, within five (5) business days after the
determination thereof, pay to the Buyer an amount equal to Estimated Working
Capital minus Actual Working Capital. Such payments will be made by wire
transfer or delivery of other immediately available funds;  _provided_ ,
that, if it is determined that the Shareholders are required to pay
any amount to the Buyer pursuant to this _Section 1.01(d)_, either the
Shareholders Representative or the Buyer may direct the Escrow Agent to pay
such amounts from the Escrow Amount in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

     1.02  |   | _The Closing_.  
---|---|--- 
   

   

(a) The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "
_Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Hall, Estill, Hardwick,
Gable, Golden and Nelson, P.C., 320 South Boston Avenue, Suite 400, Tulsa,
Oklahoma 74103 at 10:00 A.M. on November 16, 2007, or such later date as all
of the conditions to Closing have been satisfied, subject to the terms of
_Article 8_, or at such other location, as may be mutually agreeable to
the Buyer and the Shareholders Representative. The date and time of the
Closing are herein referred to as the " _Closing Date_." 

   

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the
parties hereto shall consummate the following " _Closing Transactions_ " on
the Closing Date: 

   

(i) the Shareholders shall deliver to the Buyer the certificates representing
the Shares, in the amounts set forth on the Shareholders Schedule, duly
endorsed for transfer or accompanied by duly executed assignments; 

   

(ii) the Buyer shall deliver the Cash Price (as adjusted in accordance with 
_Section 1.01(b)_ above), less the Escrow Amount, to the Shareholders, in
the amounts set forth on the Shareholders Schedule, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account designated by the Shareholders
Representative; 

   

(iii) the Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, on behalf of the Company,
at Closing, all amounts necessary to satisfy the Aggregate Stock Rights
Payments to be identified on the Stock Rights Statement, to each Stock Rights
Participant, upon the receipt of a release in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit B_ from each such participant, including the Net Stock Rights
Payments (which payments shall be made by check), and the Stock Rights
Withholding Amount with respect to each participant, that the Buyer shall
withhold and remit to the proper taxing authorities; 

   

(iv) the Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, on behalf of the Company, the
amount of the Financial Advisory Fees and Transaction Expenses by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, as directed by the Shareholders
Representative at or prior to the Closing; 

   

(v) the Buyer shall deposit a portion of the Cash Price with the Bank of

that neither the Buyer nor the Shareholders Representative shall be entitled
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 8.01(f)_ if such

breach of this Agreement has prevented the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, or if the only condition remaining to be

claims, actions, costs of investigation, causes of action, proceedings,

the Company set forth in _Article 4_ hereof and as restated in any

indemnification with respect to any Loss, unless and until the amount of any
single incident or group of related incidents of Loss suffered by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties exceeds $10,000 (the " _Threshold_ "), and then only to
the extent the aggregate amount of all Losses exceeding the Threshold exceeds
$1,000,000 (the " _Deductible Amount_ ") in the aggregate; and (2) the
aggregate amount of all payments to which the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall
be entitled to receive in satisfaction of claims for indemnification
pursuant to this _Section 9.02(a)_ shall in no event exceed $20,000,000 (the
" _Cap_ ");  _provided_ , however, that neither the Deductible Amount nor the
Cap nor the time limitation set forth in _Section 9.02(d)_ below shall apply
with respect to any Transactional Expenses, to the extent not paid in
accordance with _Section 1.02(b)(iv)_ hereof, to any claim for income taxes
pursuant to _Section 9.3(b) hereof_, to any claim in the nature of fraud, or
to any claim under the last sentence of _Section 4.05(c)_ hereof. 

   ##### 

  

   

(b) _Individual Shareholders  Indemnity. _Subject to the provisions of
_Sections 9.02(d)-(j)_ , _9.03_ and _9.04_ hereof, each Shareholder shall
indemnify and defend the Buyer Indemnified Parties and hold them harmless
against any Loss which the Buyer Indemnified Parties suffer, sustain or
become subject to as a result of the breach by such Shareholder of his, her
or its individual representations and warranties contained in  _Article 3_
hereof and as restated in any certificate delivered by such Shareholder
at the Closing, without regard to the Deductible Amount; _provided_ , however
the maximum amount which the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
receive in satisfaction of claims for indemnification pursuant to this
_Section 9.02(b)_ from any individual Shareholder shall in no event exceed
the aggregate amount of such Shareholders Allocable Portion of the Purchase
Price. 

   

(c) _Buyer Indemnity._ Subject to the provisions of _Sections 9.02(d)-(j)_,
_9.03_  and _9.04_ hereof and the next sentence, the Buyer shall indemnify
and defend the Shareholders and their respective representatives and agents
(collectively, the " _Shareholder Indemnified Parties_ ") and hold them
harmless against any Loss which the Shareholder Indemnified Parties suffer,
sustain or become subject to (i) as a result of any breach by the Buyer of
its covenants, representations and warranties set forth herein and
as restated in any certificates delivered by the Buyer at the Closing, or
(ii) as a result of any legal action brought by a shareholder of WGI or by
any governmental authority as a result of the transaction contemplated by
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary: (1) the
Shareholder Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to seek indemnification
with respect to any Loss under _Section 9.02(c)(i)_ above unless and until
the aggregate amount of all Losses suffered by the Shareholder Indemnified
Parties as a result of such breach(es) exceeds the Deductible Amount, and
then the Shareholder Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to
indemnification for any such aggregate amount in excess of the Deductible
Amount; and (2) the aggregate amount of all payments to which the
Shareholder Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to receive in satisfaction
of claims for indemnification pursuant to this _Section 9.02(c)_ shall in no
event exceed the Cap;  _provided_ , however, that neither the Deductible
Amount nor the Cap nor the time limitation set forth in _Section 9.02(d)_
below, shall apply with respect to  _Section 9.02(c)(ii)_ above, or to any
claim for income taxes pursuant to _Section 9.3(b) below_. 

   

(d) _Claim Deadline._ No Person shall be liable for any claim for
indemnification under  _Section 9.02 (a)_, _(b)_ or _(c)_ above unless
written notice specifying in reasonable detail the nature of the claim for
indemnification is delivered by the Person seeking indemnification to the
Person from whom indemnification is sought within eighteen (18) months after
the Closing Date. 

   

(e) _Third Party Claims._ Promptly after the assertion by any third party of
any claim (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") against any Person entitled to
indemnification under this  _Section 9.02_ (the " _Indemnitee_ ") that
results or may result in the incurrence by such Indemnitee of any Loss for
which such Indemnitee would be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
Agreement, such Indemnitee shall promptly (and, in any event, within five (5)
business days after receiving notice of such Third Party Claim) notify in
writing the parties from whom such indemnification could be sought (the "
_Indemnitor_ ");  _provided_ , however, if the Indemnitee does not so notify
the Indemnitor within said five (5) day period, then the 

   ##### 

  

    

Indemnitor shall, if and only if such delay materially prejudices the
Indemnitor with respect to the defense of such Third Party Claim, be relieved
of liability hereunder in respect of such Third Party Claim to the extent of
the damage caused by such delay. The Indemnitor may, at its option, assume
and conduct the defense of the Indemnitee against such Third Party Claim
(including without limitation the employment of counsel and the payment of
expenses) unless such Third Party Claim (i) seeks an injunction or other
equitable remedies in respect of the Indemnitee or its business; (ii) may
have an adverse effect on the business or financial condition of the
Indemnitee after the Closing Date (including without limitation an adverse
effect on the Tax liabilities, earnings or ongoing business relationships of
the Indemnitee) or (iii) may result in liabilities which, if taken with other
then existing Losses under this _Article 9_, would not be fully indemnified
hereunder. In each such case as described in clauses _(i)-(iii)_ above, the
Indemnitor and Indemnitee will jointly control the defense of such Third
Party Claim and cooperate in the defense of such Third Party Claim. No
Indemnitor, in the defense of any Third Party Claim, shall, except with the
consent of the Indemnitee, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into
any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof, the
giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnitee of a release of all
liability with respect to such Third Party Claim. Any Indemnitee shall have
the right to employ separate counsel in any such Third Party Claim and to
participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
shall not be an expense of the Indemnitor unless (i) the Indemnitor
shall have failed, within a reasonable time after having been notified by the
Indemnitee of the existence of such Third Party Claim as provided in the
preceding sentence, to assume and conduct the defense of such Third Party
Claim, (ii) the employment of such counsel has been specifically authorized
by the Indemnitor, or (iii) such Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded
that there may be defenses available to it which are contrary to, or
inconsistent with, those available to the Indemnitor, in any of which events
such fees and expenses of not more than one additional counsel for the
indemnified parties shall be borne by the Indemnitor. In the event that the
Indemnitor does not accept, or is not permitted to accept or assume, the
defense of any matter for which it is entitled to assume such defense
as provided above, the Indemnitee shall have the full right to defend against
any such Third Party Claim and the Indemnitee shall be entitled to settle or
agree to pay in full such claim or demand in its sole discretion. 

   

(f) _Insurance / Tax Benefit._ The amount of any Loss subject to
indemnification hereunder or of any claim therefor shall be calculated net of
(i) any Tax Benefit (as defined below) actually realized by the Buyer, the
Company, its Subsidiaries, any of their Affiliates or any of their respective
members, on account of such Loss, (ii) any insurance proceeds from a policy
or policies purchased and paid for by the Company prior to the Closing Date,
(iii) any insurance proceeds from a policy or policies purchased and paid for
by the Company, its Subsidiaries or the Buyer after the Closing Date, reduced
by any increases in applicable insurance policy premiums (whether prospective
or retroactive) occasioned by such Loss, and (iv) any other recoveries (net
of direct collection expenses) received by the Buyer, the Company or its
Subsidiaries on account of such Loss (including, but not limited to,
amounts received from any third party for indemnification or contribution).
If the Buyer, the Company, its Subsidiaries, any of their Affiliates or any
of their respective members receive a Tax Benefit after an indemnification
payment is made, the Buyer shall promptly pay to the Shareholders the amount
of such Tax Benefit 

   ##### 

  

    

at such time or times as and to the extent that such Tax Benefit is recovered
or actually realized. For purposes hereof, " _Tax Benefit_ " shall mean any
refund of Taxes paid or reduction in the amount of Taxes which otherwise
would have been paid. The Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall seek
full recovery under all insurance policies covering any Loss, to the same
extent as they would if such Loss were not subject to
indemnification hereunder. Each party hereby waives, to the extent permitted
under its applicable insurance policies, any subrogation rights that its
insurer may have with respect to any identifiable Losses. 

   

(g) _Purchase Price Adjustment._ All indemnification payments made hereunder
shall be treated by all parties hereto as adjustments to the Purchase
Price. 

   

(h) _No Duplicate Recovery._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this  _Section 9.02_, there shall be no recovery for any Loss
by the Buyer under this  _Section 9.02_, and the Loss shall not be included
in meeting the Deductible Amount hereunder, to the extent any reserve or
accrual associated with such item has been included in the calculation of the
Working Capital under _Section 1.01_ hereof. 

   

(i) _Cooperation._ The Buyer agrees that in the event of any breach giving
rise to an indemnification obligation under _Section 9.02(a)_ hereof, the
Buyer shall take and cause its Affiliates (including without limitation the
Company and its Subsidiaries) to take, or cooperate with the Shareholders
Representative, if so requested by the Shareholders Representative, all
commercially reasonable measures to mitigate the consequences of the related
breach (including without limitation taking steps to prevent any contingent
liability from becoming an actual liability). 

   

(j) _Subrogation._ Upon payment in full of any Losses pursuant to this
_Section 9.02_ or the payment of any judgment or settlement with respect to
a Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall be subrogated to the extent of such
payment to the rights of the Indemnitee against any Person with respect to
the subject matter of such Loss or Third Party Claim. The Indemnitee shall
assign or otherwise cooperate with the Indemnitor, at the cost and expense of
the Indemnitor, to pursue any claims against, or otherwise recover amounts
from, any Person liable or responsible for any Losses for which
indemnification has been received pursuant to this Agreement. 

   

(k) _Escrow Amount_. The Escrow Amount shall be available to compensate the
Buyer for any Working Capital deficiency and to compensate the Buyer
Indemnified Parties for any Losses as to which the Shareholders have an
indemnification obligation under this _Article 9_. To the extent the Escrow
Amount has not been fully distributed to satisfy Buyer claims on the date
that is six (6) months after the Closing Date, the Buyer and the
Shareholders Representative shall deliver joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent to disburse to the Shareholders Representative from the Escrow
Amount one third (1/3) of the then balance of the Escrow Amount, less the
amount of any then outstanding Buyer claims (including without limitation
claims described in _Section 9.02(m)(ii)_ below). To the extent the
Escrow Amount has not been fully distributed to satisfy Buyer claims on the
date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, the Buyer and the
Shareholders Representative shall deliver joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent to disburse 

   ##### 

  

    

from the Escrow Amount to the Shareholders Representative one half (1/2) of
the then balance of the Escrow Amount, less the amount of any then
outstanding Buyer claims (including without limitation claims described in
_Section 9.02(m)(ii)_ below). To the extent the Escrow Amount has not been
fully distributed to satisfy Buyer claims on the date that is eighteen (18)
months after the Closing Date, the Buyer and the Shareholders Representative
shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to disburse the
remaining balance of the Escrow Amount to the Shareholders Representative,
less the amount of any then outstanding Buyer claims (including without
limitation claims described in _Section 9.02(m)(ii)_ below); _provided_ ,
that an amount sufficient to resolve any pending Buyer claims shall be
retained in the Escrow Amount, and, upon final disposition of all
such claims, the Buyer and the Shareholders Representative shall provide
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to disburse (i) to the Buyer,
the amount of any allowed claims, and (ii) to the Shareholders
Representative, the balance of the Escrow Amount. Each disbursement from the
Escrow Amount to the Shareholders Representative shall include all interest
accrued on the entire balance of the Escrow Amount through the close of
business on the second business day preceding the date of such disbursement.
All income on the Escrow Amount shall be treated as earned by the
Shareholders and shall be so reported for all Tax purposes. 

   

(l) _Escrow Fees_. The Escrow Amount shall be invested, maintained and
disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement
and this Agreement. Fifty percent (50%) of the fees and expenses of the
Escrow Agent with respect to the Escrow Agreement shall be paid by the Buyer
and fifty percent (50%) of such fees and expenses shall be paid out of the
Escrow Amount. 

   

(m) _Priority_. Any indemnification to which a Buyer Indemnified Party is
entitled under this  _Article 9_ may be satisfied in whole or in part by
payment to such Buyer Indemnified Party from the Escrow Amount in accordance
with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, or recovered directly from the
Shareholders; provided that: (i) to the extent funds are held in the Escrow
Amount, Losses recoverable by a Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to
_Section 9.02(a)_ above shall first be recovered from the Escrow Amount, and
(ii) a Buyer Indemnified Party may recover from the Escrow Amount Losses
arising from a claim pursuant to  _Section 9.02(b)_ above only if the Buyer
Indemnified Party has first asserted a claim to recover such Losses directly
against the Shareholder that breached such representation or warranty, and
such Shareholder has not fully compensated the Buyer Indemnified Party for
such Losses within thirty (30) days following the date on which the claim is
asserted against such Shareholder. To the extent Losses arising from a claim
pursuant to _Section 9.02(b)_ above are recovered from the Escrow Amount,
the Shareholder that breached the representation or warranty resulting in
such Losses shall replenish the Escrow Amount with an amount equal to the
amount recovered from the Escrow Amount by the Buyer Indemnified Parties in
respect of such breach, within five (5) business days following the date of
any related release from the Escrow Amount. 

  

9.03 _Certain Tax Matters_. The following provisions shall govern the
allocation of responsibility as between the Buyer and the Company on the one
hand, and the Shareholders on the other hand, for certain tax matters
following the Closing: 

   #####

several, and not a joint and several basis, based upon such Shareholders

attributable to any periods ended on or prior to the Closing Date.
The Shareholders shall not have any liability for, and the Buyer shall

federal, state or local income taxes on income of the Company attributable to
periods commencing after the Closing Date. The other terms of this Agreement

limitations applicable to the Company for such income taxes, but shall not be
limited in amount. 

   

(c) For any tax periods ending on or before the Closing Date, the Shareholders
shall, at the Companys sole expense, prepare or cause to be prepared by the
Companys existing tax professional, Grant Thornton, LLP, all federal and
state income Tax Returns for the Company which are required to be filed after
the Closing Date. Subject to the requirements of applicable law, each such
Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practices of
the Company. Each such Tax Return shall be submitted to the Buyer at
least fifteen (15) business days prior to the due date (including any
extension thereof) for filing such Tax Return. Any disputes regarding such
Tax Returns that cannot be resolved between the parties shall be resolved by
the Firm on the terms and conditions specified in _Section 1.01(c)(ii)_
above; _provided_ , that the assignment of the Firm shall be appropriately
modified to contemplate the nature of the dispute under this
_Section 9.03(c)_. The Shareholders shall cause to be filed timely such Tax
Returns, as so modified. 

   

(d) The Buyer, the Company and the Shareholders, shall cooperate fully, as and
to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this _Section 9.03_ and any audit,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision of
records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit,
litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. 

   

(e) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such
Taxes and fees (including without limitation any penalties and interest)
incurred in connection with this Agreement, shall be paid by the Buyer when
due, and the Buyer will file or cause the Company to file all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to all such
transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other Taxes and
fees, and, if required by applicable law, the Shareholders Representative,
on behalf of the Shareholders, will join in the execution of any such Tax
Returns, any documents or certificates establishing an exemption from any
such Taxes.

representations or warranties or any breach or failure in performance of any
covenants or agreements made by the Company or the Shareholders in this

make a claim for any amounts in respect of lost profits or punitive damages,
except to the extent such damages are recovered by a third party from the
Buyer or the Buyer Indemnified Parties, and, in particular, no " _multiple of
profits_ " or " _multiple of cash flow_ " or similar valuation methodology
shall be used in calculating the amount of any Losses.

seek contribution or other recovery from any officer, director, or employee
(present or former) of the Company or its Subsidiaries, in his or her
capacity as an officer, director or employee but not in his or her capacity
as a holder of Shares, that any of them may now or in the future have under
any Environmental Law. The Buyer, the Company, its Subsidiaries and their
respective successors and permitted assigns hereby release all officers,
directors and employees (present or former) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, in his or her capacity as an officer, director or employee but
not in his or her capacity as a holder of Shares, from any and all
such claims, demands and causes of action that any of them may now or in the

that the Buyer shall have no claim against the Shareholders or any other
Person with respect thereto, except as specifically set forth herein.
Accordingly, the Company makes no representations or warranties whatsoever
