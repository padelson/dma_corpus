support the calculations set forth in the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement,
all of which shall be prepared and determined in accordance with this
Agreement (including, to the extent applicable, the calculations set forth on

purpose of preparing the balance sheet and determining the Closing Net Working
Capital, the Closing Cash, the Closing Funded Indebtedness, the Transaction
Expenses, and the related adjustments contemplated by this Section 2.4(a) is
to measure the amount of the Closing Net Working Capital, the Closing Cash,
the Closing Funded Indebtedness, and the Transaction Expenses, and such
processes are not intended to permit the introduction of judgments, accounting
methods, policies, principles, practices, procedures, classifications or
estimation methodologies for the purpose of preparing the balance sheet or
determining the Closing Net Working Capital, the Closing Cash, the Closing
Funded Indebtedness, and the Transaction Expenses that are inconsistent with
the Accounting Principles. Following the delivery of the Purchase Price
Adjustment Statement, Buyer shall provide the Sellers and their
Representatives with reasonable access to the Books and Records and all
relevant personnel and properties of the Companies, all to the extent
reasonably necessary to verify the accuracy of such amounts. (b) If the Sellers disagree with the calculation of any of the items set forth

writing of such disagreement (an "Objection Dispute") within forty-five (45)
days after receipt of the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement by the Sellers.
Any Objection Dispute shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of any
disagreement so asserted. If the Sellers fail to deliver written notice of an
Objection Dispute to Buyer within forty-five (45) days, or such longer period
if extended, after delivery of the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement to the
Sellers, the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement shall be deemed final and
binding on the Parties for purposes of this Agreement, including the
calculation of the Purchase Price. For the avoidance of doubt, an Objection
Dispute may be submitted by the Sellers on the basis that the Buyer has not
provided any materials reasonably requested by the Sellers prior to the
expiration of such forty-five (45) day period.

(c) If the Sellers deliver a notice of an Objection Dispute pursuant to
Section 2.4(b), Buyer and the Sellers shall negotiate in good faith to resolve
any Objection Dispute and any resolution agreed to in writing by Buyer and the
Sellers shall be final and binding upon the parties and the Purchase Price
Adjustment Statement shall be adjusted in accordance with such resolution. If
Buyer and the Sellers are unable to resolve all Objection Disputes within
twenty (20) days of delivery of written notice of such Objection Disputes by
the Sellers to Buyer, then the disputed matters shall, at the request of
either the Sellers or Buyer, be referred for final determination to Alvarez and
Marsal (the "Accounting Firm") within fifteen (15) days thereafter. If such
firm is unable to serve, Buyer and the Sellers shall jointly select a neutral
Accounting Firm from an accounting firm of national standing. If Buyer and the
Sellers are unable to agree upon an Accounting Firm within such time period,
then the Accounting Firm shall be a neutral accounting firm of international
standing designated by the American Arbitration Association. The Accounting
Firm shall only consider those items and amounts set forth on the Purchase
Price Adjustment Statement as to which Buyer and the Sellers have disagreed,
within the applicable time periods and on the terms specified in Section
2.4(b) and this Section 2.4(c), and must resolve all unresolved Objection
Disputes in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement. The
Accounting Firm shall deliver to Buyer and the Sellers, as promptly as
practicable and in any event within sixty (60) days after its appointment, a
written report setting forth the resolution of any unresolved Objection
Disputes determined in accordance with the terms herein. In resolving any
disputed item, the Accounting Firm shall be bound by the principles set forth
in this Section 2.4 and shall not assign a value to any item greater than the
greatest value for such item claimed by either Buyer or the Sellers or less
than the smallest value for such item claimed by either Buyer or the Sellers.
Such report shall be final and binding upon all of the Parties for purposes of
this Agreement, and the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement shall be adjusted
in accordance with such report. Upon the agreement of Buyer and the Sellers in
accordance with the first sentence of this Section 2.4(c) or the decision of
the Accounting Firm, or if the Sellers fail to deliver written notice of
disagreement to Buyer within the forty-five (45) day period provided in
Section 2.4(b), the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, as adjusted (if
applicable) pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, shall be deemed to be the
final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement for purposes of this Section 2.4
(the "Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement") and shall be deemed to be
final and binding on the Parties for purposes of this Agreement. The fees,
expenses and costs of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by Buyer and the
Sellers, respectively, in the proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of
the disputed items submitted

 to the Accounting Firm by such Party that are unsuccessfully disputed by such
Party (as finally determined by the Accounting Firm) bears to the aggregate
dollar amount of disputed items submitted by Buyer and the Sellers.

The Closing Net Working Capital and the Net Working Capital Surplus or Net
Working Capital Deficiency based thereon, the Closing Cash, the Closing Funded
Indebtedness, and the Transaction Expenses, each as shown on the Final
Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, shall be referred to as the "Final
Closing Net Working Capital," the "Final Net Working Capital Surplus," the
"Final Net Working Capital Deficiency," the "Final Closing Cash," the "Final
Closing Funded Indebtedness," and the "Final Transaction Expenses,"
respectively. For purposes of this Agreement the "Final Adjustment Amount,"
which may be positive or negative, means the Indebtedness Adjustment Amount
plus the Cash Adjustment Amount plus the Transaction Expense Adjustment Amount
plus the Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount. The "Indebtedness Adjustment
Amount", which may be positive or negative, means the Estimated Closing Funded
Indebtedness less the Final Closing Funded Indebtedness. The "Cash Adjustment
Amount", which may be positive or negative, means the Final Closing Cash less
the Estimated Closing Cash. The "Transaction Expense Adjustment Amount", which
may be positive or negative, means the Estimated Transaction Expenses less the
Final Transaction Expenses. The "Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount", which
may be positive or negative, means the Final Net Working Capital Surplus or
Final Net Working Capital Deficiency, as the case may be, less the Estimated
Net Working Capital Surplus or Estimated Net Working Capital Deficiency, as
the case may be.

(d) If the Final Adjustment Amount is a positive number, the Sellers shall be
entitled to receive from Buyer an amount in cash equal to the Final Adjustment
Amount. If the Final Adjustment Amount is a negative number, Buyer shall be
entitled to receive from the Sellers, on a joint and several basis, an amount
in cash equal to the absolute value of the Final Adjustment Amount.

(e) If the Sellers are entitled to receive payment pursuant to Section 2.4(d),
then Buyer shall, not more than five (5) Business Days after determination of
the Final Adjustment Amount, make payment of the Final Adjustment Amount by
wire transfer in immediately available funds (or other alternative delivery
arrangement mutually agreed by the Sellers and Buyer) to, or as directed by,
the Sellers.

(f) If Buyer is entitled to receive payment pursuant to Section 2.4(d), then
the Sellers shall, not more than five (5) Business Days after determination of
the Final Adjustment Amount, make payment of an amount in cash equal to the
absolute value of the Final Adjustment Amount by wire transfer in immediately
available funds (or other alternative delivery arrangement mutually agreed by
the Sellers and Buyer) to, or as directed by, Buyer.

transactions contemplated by this Agreement will, either alone or in
combination with any other event, (i) except as set forth on Section 4.17(g)

the Company Subsidiaries under any Plan, except as expressly provided in this
Agreement, (ii) result in any new or increased contribution required to be
made to any Plan, (iii) give rise to the payment of any amounts or benefits
that, individually or in combination with any other amount or benefit owed

US Buyer and UK Buyer hereby represent and warrant to the Sellers as follows:

5.1 Organization and Power.

Each of US Buyer and UK Buyer is a corporation duly formed, validly existing
and in good standing under the Laws of Delaware and has full power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents to
which it is a party, to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder and
to consummate the Contemplated Transactions.

5.2 Authorization and Enforceability.

The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents to
which Buyer is a party and the performance by Buyer of the Contemplated
Transactions have been duly authorized by Buyer, and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of Buyer (including, without limitation, any
stockholder vote or approval) are necessary to authorize the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents to
which Buyer is a party or the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions.
This Agreement is, and each of the Ancillary Documents to be executed and
delivered at the Closing by Buyer will be at the Closing, duly authorized,
executed and delivered by Buyer, and constitute, or as of the Closing Date will constitute, valid and legally binding agreements of Buyer,
enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization and other Laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles.

5.3 No Violation.

The execution and delivery by Buyer of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Documents to which Buyer is a party, consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions and compliance with the terms of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Documents to which Buyer is a party will not (a) conflict with or violate any
provision of the Organizational Documents of Buyer, or (b) assuming that all
consents, approvals and authorizations contemplated by Section 5.4 have been
obtained and all filings described therein have been made, conflict with or
violate in any material respect any Law applicable to Buyer or by which
Buyer's properties are bound. Neither Buyer nor its Affiliates are party to
any Contract that would materially impair or delay Buyer's ability to
consummate the Contemplated Transactions.

5.4 Governmental Authorizations and Consents.

No Governmental Consents are required to be obtained or made by Buyer in
connection with the execution, delivery and performance, validity and
enforceability of this Agreement or any Ancillary Documents to which it is, or
is to be, a party, or the consummation by Buyer of the Contemplated
Transactions, except for (a) such filings as may be required under the HSR Act
and (b) those Governmental Consents listed in Section 4.5 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

5.5 Litigation.

There is no Litigation pending or, to the Knowledge of Buyer, threatened
against or involving Buyer which questions the validity of this Agreement or
any of the Ancillary Documents to which it is a party or seeks to prohibit,
enjoin or otherwise challenge Buyer's ability to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions.



5.6 Financing; Solvency.

(a) Buyer has, as of the date hereof, and will continuously have available to
it at all times prior to the Closing (either in the form of cash on hand
and/or available and usable capacity under its existing credit facilities) and
at the Closing will have, in the form of cash, sufficient funds to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the payment of all
amounts payable pursuant to ARTICLE II. Buyer expressly acknowledges and
agrees that Buyer's ability to obtain financing is not a condition to its
obligations under this Agreement.

(b) No transfer of property is being made and no obligation is being incurred
in connection with the Contemplated Transactions by Buyer with the actual
intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of the
Companies. Assuming that the representations and warranties of the Sellers
contained in this Agreement are true and correct in all material respects and
each Company is solvent immediately prior to the Closing, and subject to the
satisfaction of the conditions to Buyer's obligation to complete the Closing
set forth in Section 7.3, immediately after giving effect to the Contemplated
Transactions, Buyer and the Companies on a consolidated basis (i) will be
solvent (in that both the fair value of their assets will not be less than the
sum of their debts and that the present fair saleable value of their assets
will not be less than the amount required to pay their probable liabilities on
their debts as they become absolute and matured); (ii) will have adequate
capital and liquidity with which to engage in their business; and (iii) will
not have incurred and do not plan to incur debts beyond their ability to pay
as they become absolute and matured and will own property which has a fair
saleable value greater than the amounts required to pay their respective debts
(including a reasonable estimate of the amount of all contingent liabilities).

5.7 Investment Purpose.

Buyer is acquiring the Company Equity Interests solely for the purpose of
investment and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection with,
any distribution thereof other than in compliance with all applicable Laws,
including United States federal securities Laws. Buyer agrees that no Company
Equity Interests of either Company may be sold, transferred, offered for sale,
pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of without registration under the
Securities Act and any applicable state securities Laws, except pursuant to an
exemption from such registration under the Securities Act and such Laws. Buyer
is able to bear the economic risk of holding its investment in Company Equity
Interests for an indefinite period (including total loss of its investment),
and has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and business matters
so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risk of its investment.

5.8 No Brokers.

Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates has employed or incurred any liability
to any broker, finder or agent for any brokerage fees, finder's fees,
commissions or other amounts with respect to this Agreement, the Ancillary
Documents or the Contemplated Transactions.

5.9 No Inducement or Reliance; Independent Assessment.

(a) Buyer has not been induced by and has not relied upon any representations,
warranties or statements, whether express or implied, made by the Sellers, the
Companies or any of their respective Affiliates, officers, managers,
directors, employees, agents or Representatives (collectively, the "Company
Parties"), except for the representations and warranties of the Sellers
expressly set forth in Article III and Article IV, whether or not any such
representations, warranties or statements were made in writing or orally.
Buyer represents and warrants that Buyer has not relied or is not relying upon
any representation or warranty, express or implied, oral or written, including
any implied warranty of merchantability or of fitness for a particular
purpose, as to the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the
Companies or the Contemplated Transactions except for the representations and
warranties of the Sellers expressly set forth in Article III and Article IV,

or data room information provided to Buyer or its Representatives, or any
other document or information in any form provided to Buyer or its
Representatives in connection with the Contemplated Transactions. Buyer acknowledges that it has inspected
and conducted, to its satisfaction, its own independent investigation of the
Companies and, in entering into this Agreement, Buyer has relied on the
results of its own independent investigation and analysis.

(b) Except as expressly set forth in Article III and Article IV, Buyer
acknowledges that none of the Company Parties makes, will make or has made any
representation or warranty, express or implied, including as to the prospects
of the Companies or their business or profitability for Buyer, or with respect

Companies.

its Representatives or Affiliates to) contact and communicate with the
employees, customers, providers, service providers and suppliers of the
Companies and Company Subsidiaries without the prior consultation with and
written approval of the Sellers; provided, however, that the foregoing
restriction shall not prohibit any contacts by Buyer or Buyer's
Representatives or Affiliates with the customers, providers, service providers
and suppliers of the Companies or the Company Subsidiaries in the ordinary
course of business unrelated to the Contemplated Transactions.

6.3 Efforts. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
Buyer, the Companies and the Sellers shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or
cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing,
all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in
the most expeditious manner practicable, the Contemplated Transactions,
including (a) the obtaining of all Governmental Consents and the making of all
filings, registrations, or declarations, specified in Section 4.5 and Section
5.4 and the taking of all necessary steps to obtain such Governmental Consents
and to make such registrations, (b) the obtaining of all necessary consents,
approvals or waivers from third parties, and (c) the execution and delivery of
any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement; provided,
that such efforts shall not require agreeing to any obligations or
accommodations (financial or otherwise) binding on the Sellers or the
Companies in the event the Closing does not occur; and provided, further, that
the Antitrust Filings shall be subject to Section 6.4 hereof. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, Buyer agrees not to (i) enter into or
consummate any agreements or arrangements for an acquisition (via share
purchase, merger, consolidation, purchase of assets or otherwise) or joint
venture or enter into any other agreements or arrangements reasonably likely
to adversely impact the timing or ability of Buyer to pay the Purchase Price
and consummate the Contemplated Transactions, or (ii) take or agree to take
any action that could reasonably be expected to result in any of the
conditions set forth in Article VII not being satisfied or to impair, prevent
or delay the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions. Nothing in this
Agreement shall require any Party to pay any consideration (except filing and
application fees) to any other Person from whom any such Governmental Consents
or other third party consents, approvals or waivers are requested.

6.4 Regulatory Filings.

(a) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing Section 6.3, each of
Buyer and the Sellers undertakes and agrees to make or cause to be made an
appropriate filing of a notification and report form pursuant to the HSR Act
(the "HSR Filing") and any other filings pursuant to any other applicable
Antitrust Law listed in Section 6.4 of the Company Disclosure Schedule with
respect to the Contemplated Transactions (together with the HSR Filing, the
"Antitrust Filings") as promptly as practicable (provided that any HSR Filings
will be made within ten (10) Business Days from the execution of this
Agreement). Any filing fees associated with the HSR Filing or any other
Antitrust Filings shall be paid by Buyer. Upon the Sellers' request, the
Parties shall request early termination of any applicable waiting period under
the HSR Act. Each of Buyer and the Companies shall (i) subject to applicable
Law and provided that materials may be redacted as necessary to comply with
contractual arrangements and as necessary to address reasonable privilege or
confidentiality concerns, furnish to outside antitrust counsel for the other
Party as promptly as reasonably practicable all information required for any
Antitrust Filing to be made by the other Party pursuant to any applicable Law
in connection with the Contemplated Transactions, (ii) respond as promptly as
practicable to any inquiries received from any Governmental Authority in
connection with such Antitrust Filings or with respect to the Contemplated
Transactions, and (iii) respond as promptly as practicable to any request for
additional information or documentary material issued pursuant to the HSR Act
or any formal or informal request pursuant to any other applicable Antitrust
Law from any Governmental Authority. In furtherance and not in limitation of
the foregoing, each of Buyer, Sellers and the Companies shall use its reasonable best efforts
to (A) resolve, avoid, or eliminate any impediment or objection, if any, under
any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with
respect to the Contemplated Transactions, or (B) avoid the entry of, effect
the dissolution of, and have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned, any
decree, Order or judgment that would prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, so to enable the parties hereto
to close the Contemplated Transactions expeditiously (but in no event after
the Termination Date). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Buyer and its Affiliates shall have no obligation to, and Sellers,
the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates
shall not, take any action that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to result in a Burdensome Condition.

(b) Each Party shall (i) promptly notify outside antitrust counsel for the
other Party of any material communication to that Party from any Governmental
Authority in respect of any Antitrust Filing, investigation, inquiry or other
proceeding relating to the Contemplated Transactions and, subject to
applicable Law and provided that written materials may be redacted as
necessary to comply with contractual arrangements and as necessary to address
reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns, discuss with and permit the
other Party's outside antitrust counsel to review in advance, and consider in
good faith the other Party's reasonable comments in connection with any
proposed written communication to any of the foregoing; (ii) not participate
or agree to participate in any substantive meeting, telephone call, or
discussion with any Governmental Authority in respect of any Antitrust Filing,
investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions unless it consults with the other Party in advance and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives outside antitrust
counsel for the other Party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat;
(iii) subject to applicable Law and provided that written materials may be
redacted as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements and as necessary
to address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns, furnish outside
antitrust counsel for the other Party promptly with copies of all
correspondence, filings, and communications (and memoranda setting forth the
substance thereof) between such Party and its Affiliates and its
Representatives on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of
its staffs on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
Contemplated Transactions; and (iv) act in good faith and reasonably cooperate
with the other Party and its outside antitrust counsel in connection with any
Antitrust Filings concerning this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions
and in connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry of any
Governmental Authority under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law with
respect to any such Antitrust Filing or the Contemplated Transactions.

6.5 Employee Matters.

(a) For a period of at least 12 months following the Closing Date, Buyer
shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, provide each employee of either
Company or any Company Subsidiary who is employed by such Company or Company
Subsidiary immediately prior to the Closing Date (a "Company Employee") with
base salary or base wages and employee benefits (including, without
limitation, retirement, health and welfare and fringe benefits) that are
substantially similar in the aggregate to the salary or wages and benefits
provided by the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Closing.

 For a period of at least 6 months following the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or
shall cause its Affiliates to, provide each Company Employee with severance
benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the severance
benefits the Company Employee was eligible to receive pursuant to the
severance plans, practices and policies applicable to the Company Employee as
of immediately prior to the Closing.

(b) For purposes of participation of a Company Employee in a benefit plan of
Buyer or its Subsidiaries (a "Buyer Benefit Plan"), each Company Employee
shall be credited with all years of service for which such Company Employee
was credited before the Closing Date under any comparable Plans, except to the
extent such credit would result in a duplication of benefits and except for
benefits under a defined benefit plan. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing: (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all Buyer
Benefit Plans to the extent that coverage under such Buyer Benefit Plans
replaces coverage under comparable Plans in which such Company Employee
participated; (ii) for purposes of each Buyer Benefit Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Buyer
shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such Buyer Benefit Plan to be waived for such Company Employee
and his or her covered dependents; and (iii) as soon as practicable after the
Closing, the account balances of all Company Employees and former employees of
either Company or any Company Subsidiary in the ESCO Employee Savings
Investment Plan, including the outstanding balance of any loans, shall be
transferred to a Buyer Benefit Plan that is qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code in a trustee to trustee transfer, the expenses of which (including
any reasonable expenses incurred by ETH or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliate in connection with such transfer) shall be paid by Buyer.

(c) Nothing in this Section 6.5 shall (i) confer upon any employee or other
service provider a right to continue in the employ or service of the
Companies, the Company Subsidiaries or Buyer, (ii) be deemed or construed to
be an amendment or other modification of any Plan or Buyer Benefit Plan, or
(iii) create any third-party rights in any current or former service provider
or employee of the Companies, the Company Subsidiaries or Buyer or any of
their respective Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

6.6 Preservation of Books and Records.

For a period of seven (7) years from the Closing Date or such longer time as
may be required by Law:

(a) Buyer shall not and shall cause its Affiliates not to dispose of or
destroy any of the books and records (including Tax Returns) of the Companies
or the Company Subsidiaries relating to periods prior to the Closing (the
"Books and Records") without first offering to turn over possession thereof to
the Sellers by written notice to the Sellers at least sixty (60) days prior to
the proposed date of such disposition or destruction.

(b) Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, (i) provide the Sellers
and their agents with electronic access to any portions of the Books and
Records that are available in electronic format, and (ii) allow the Sellers
and their agents reasonable access to all other Books and Records on reasonable notice and at reasonable times at Buyer's
principal place of business or at any location where any Books and Records are
stored, and permit the Sellers and their agents, at their own expense, to make
copies of any Books and Records. Books and Records may be sought under this
Section 6.6 to the extent reasonably required for financial, regulatory, third
party litigation and Tax reporting obligations.

6.7 Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation

(a) During the Restricted Period, ETH and its direct and indirect Subsidiaries
(collectively, the "Restricted Parties") shall not, directly or indirectly,
except with Buyer's prior written consent, (i) engage in or assist others in
engaging in the business of the Companies or the Company Subsidiaries,
including the Business; (ii) own, manage, operate, control, or participate in
the ownership, management, operation or control of any business that, directly
or indirectly, competes with the Business; or (iii) solicit any customer of
the Companies or the Company Subsidiaries to purchase any goods or services
sold by the Companies or the Company Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date from
any Person other than Buyer, the Companies or the Company Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in the first sentence of this
Section 6.7(a) shall be construed as precluding any Restricted Party from
owning, directly or indirectly, less than 5% of the outstanding equity
securities of a publicly-held corporation engaged, directly or indirectly, in
the business of the Companies or the Company Subsidiaries.

(b) During the Restricted Period, the Restricted Parties shall not, except
with Buyer's prior written consent, directly or indirectly, hire or solicit
any director, officer or employee of the Companies or the Company Subsidiaries
or encourage any such director, officer or employee to leave such employment;
provided, however, that general solicitations not directed specifically to any
such directors, officers or employees shall not be a breach hereof; provided,
further, that nothing in this Section 6.7(b) shall prevent any Restricted
Party from hiring or soliciting any director, officer or employee that was
terminated by the Companies or the Company Subsidiaries more than twelve (12)
months prior to such hiring or solicitation.

(c) The Restricted Parties shall not make, or cause to be made, to any Person
any disparaging statement about the Business, the Companies, the Company
Subsidiaries, Buyer or any of Buyer's Affiliates or Representatives (including
with respect to the products, services, employees or directors of any such
Person) that would or would reasonably be expected to adversely impact the
goodwill, reputation or business relationships thereof in any material
respect; provided, that this Section 6.7(c) shall not prohibit the making of
truthful statements required by Law, governmental testimony or filings, or
administrative, arbitral or similar legal proceedings (including depositions
in connection with such proceedings), or in connection with the enforcement
(or defense) of any rights or pursuit of any remedies relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

(d) Each Seller hereby acknowledges that, except for the Sellers' willingness
to comply with the terms of this Section 6.7 (and to cause the compliance with
such terms by the other Restricted Parties), Buyer would not have entered into
this Agreement and that a violation of this Section 6.7 will cause Buyer
irreparable harm which would not be adequately compensated for by money damages. Each Seller therefore agrees
that, in the event of any actual or threatened violation of this Section 6.7,
Buyer shall be entitled to a temporary restraining order and to preliminary
and final injunctive relief against the applicable Seller or other Restricted
Party to prevent any violations of this Section 6.7 (without the necessity of
posting a bond) and to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees and any other
costs and expenses incurred in the enforcement of this Section 6.7; provided,
that it is acknowledged and agreed that the rights and remedies provided under
this Section 6.7(d) are cumulative and in addition to any other rights and
remedies that Buyer may have hereunder or at law or in equity. It is the
intent and understanding of each party that if, in any action before any court
or agency legally empowered to enforce this Section 6.7, any term,
restriction, covenant or promise in this Section 6.7 is found to be
unreasonable and for that reason unenforceable, then such term, restriction,
covenant or promise shall be deemed modified to the extent necessary to make
it enforceable by such court or agency.

6.8 Public Announcements.

The initial press release regarding this Agreement and the Contemplated
Transactions shall be made at such time and in such form as Buyer and the
Sellers agree. None of the Buyer, the Sellers or the Companies (nor any of
their respective Affiliates) will issue or make any prior or subsequent press
release or public statement with respect to this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions without the prior consent of the other Parties, except as may be
required by Law or stock exchange listing requirements; provided, however,
that at any time after the initial press release regarding this Agreement is
issued, the Sellers and their Affiliates may issue or make any subsequent
press release or public statement with respect to this Agreement as long as
such press release or public statement is not materially inconsistent with the
initial press release.

6.9 Certain Tax Matters.

(a) The Sellers shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file, or cause to
be filed, all Income Tax Returns of the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries
for all Pre-Closing Periods that are required to be filed after the Closing
Date. Such Tax Returns that relate solely to the Companies and the Company
Subsidiaries shall be prepared, and each item thereon treated, in a manner
consistent with past practices employed with respect to the Companies and the
Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, unless otherwise required by applicable
Laws. Sellers shall submit all such Income Tax Returns that relate solely to
the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries to the Buyer for its review and
comments at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing such
Income Tax Returns, and Buyer and the Sellers agree to consult and resolve in
good faith any issues arising as a result of the review of such Income Tax
Returns. The Sellers shall pay all Taxes owed with respect to such Tax Returns
except to the extent such Taxes are reflected on the Closing Net Working
Capital or Closing Funded Indebtedness; provided, however, that to the extent
the amount of a given Tax reflected on the Closing Net Working Capital or
Closing Funded Indebtedness exceeds such Tax calculated pursuant to this
Section 6.9(a), Buyer shall pay to Sellers the amount of such excess within
fifteen (15) days after the date on which such Income Tax is paid. Buyer shall
cooperate with the Sellers in filing and causing to be filed all such Income
Tax Returns. (b) Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file, or cause to be
filed, (X) all Tax Returns of the Companies and Company Subsidiaries for any
Pre-Closing Period that are due after the Closing Date other than Income Tax
Returns and (Y) all Tax Returns for any Straddle Period of the Companies and
the Company Subsidiaries that are due after the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns
shall be prepared, and each item thereon treated, in a manner consistent with
past practices employed with respect to the Companies. Buyer shall submit all
Straddle Period Income Tax Returns to the Sellers for their review and
comments at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing such
Income Tax Returns, and Buyer and the Sellers agree to consult and resolve in
good faith any issues arising as a result of the review of such Income Tax
Returns. The Sellers shall pay to Buyer within fifteen (15) days after the
date on which Taxes are paid with respect to a Straddle Period or Pre-Closing
Period an amount equal to the portion of such Taxes that relates to the Pre-
Closing Period, except to the extent such Taxes are reflected on the Closing
Net Working Capital or Closing Funded Indebtedness, or were paid by or on
behalf of such Company prior to Closing; provided, however, that to the extent
the amount of a given Tax reflected on the Closing Net Working Capital or
Closing Funded Indebtedness exceeds such Tax calculated pursuant to this
Section 6.9(b), Buyer shall pay to Sellers the amount of such excess within
fifteen (15) days after the date on which Tax is paid with respect to a
Straddle Period or a Pre-Closing Period. For purposes of this Section 6.9(b)
the portion of such Tax that relates to the Pre-Closing Period shall (i) in
the case of any Income Taxes or Taxes based upon or related to employment,
sales and use, value added and other non-periodic Taxes be deemed equal to the
amount that would be payable if the relevant Tax period ended on the Closing
Date and (ii) in the case of any periodic Taxes and Taxes other than Taxes in
(i) be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the
Tax period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of days in the entire Tax period. All determinations necessary to give
effect to the foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with
prior practices of the Companies. For the avoidance of doubt, all Transaction
Tax Deductions shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period ending
on the Closing Date.

(c) All United States federal Transaction Tax Deductions shall be reported on
Income Tax Returns solely as Income Tax deductions of the applicable Seller
for a Pre-Closing Period or portion of any Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date and shall not be treated or reported as an Income Tax deduction
for a Tax Period beginning after the Closing Date (or portion of the Straddle
Period beginning after the Closing Date).

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall be permitted
to make an election pursuant to Section 338(g) of the Code (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign Income Tax law) in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the acquisition of the Plastique
Shares.

(e) The Parties agree that the Purchase Price shall be allocated among the
Sellers such that $45,000,000 is allocated to EHC for the Plastique Shares
(the "Plastique Purchase Price") and the remaining portion of the Purchase
Price is allocated to ETH for the Thermoform LLC Interests (the "Thermoform
Purchase Price"). (f) Within ninety (90) days following the determination of the Final
Adjustment Amount, Buyer shall provide ETH with a proposed allocation of the
Thermoform Purchase Price and liabilities to which the assets of Thermoform
are subject on the Closing Date (and all other items required under the Code)
among the assets of Thermoform and the covenants contained in Section 6.7(a),
in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder (and any similar provision of state, local, or non-U.S. Law, as
appropriate). ETH will have thirty (30) days after delivery of such proposed
purchase price allocation in which to notify Buyer in writing (such notice, a
"Purchase Price Allocation Dispute Notice") of any disagreement with such
proposed purchase price allocation (and setting forth in reasonable detail the
basis for such disagreement). If Buyer disagrees with the Purchase Price
Allocation Dispute Notice, Buyer and ETH shall work together in good faith to
resolve the disagreement. If ETH does not deliver a Purchase Price Allocation
Dispute Notice to Buyer during such thirty (30) day period, or if Buyer and
ETH resolve all disagreements with respect to the Purchase Price Allocation
Dispute Notice, then Buyer, ETH, and Thermoform shall report, act and file all
Tax Returns, including IRS Form 8594, consistent with the allocation finally
determined pursuant to this Section 6.9(f), and take no position inconsistent
therewith upon examination of any such Tax Return, in any examination, audit,
or other proceeding with respect to such Tax Returns (unless otherwise
required by Law). If Buyer and ETH cannot agree (within sixty (60) days after
timely delivery of the Purchase Price Allocation Dispute Notice) to resolve
any disagreement therein, the allocation shall not be binding on the parties.

6.10 Exclusivity.

During the period from the date hereof to the earlier of the date of
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article IX or the Closing Date,
Sellers and the Companies shall not, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates (including the Company Subsidiaries) and Representatives not to,
directly or indirectly, (a) solicit or initiate any Competing Transaction or
any inquiries, offers or proposals that constitute or could reasonably be
expected to lead to a Competing Transaction, or (b) enter into, continue or
otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish
to any Person any information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any
way with, or execute or enter into any Contract with respect to, any Competing
Transaction. Upon execution and delivery of this Agreement, Sellers and the
Companies shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates (including the
Company Subsidiaries) and Representatives to, immediately cease and terminate
all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than Buyer and
its Affiliates and Representatives) or activities (including, without
limitation, promptly terminating access to any electronic datarooms or similar
document sharing services used or potentially used in connection with any
activities prohibited in the aforementioned sentence with respect to any
Person (other than Buyer and its Affiliates and Representatives)) conducted on
or before the date hereof with respect to any Competing Transaction unless and
until this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article IX.

6.11 Polish Financial Statement Filings.

To the extent required prior to the Closing by applicable Law, the Sellers and
the Companies shall cause Plastique sp. z o.o. to file with the applicable
registry court its annual financial statements with respect to the 2017, 2018
and 2019 fiscal years and shall deliver evidence reasonably satisfactory to Buyer that such filings have been made to
such registry court and revealed in the register of companies for Plastique
sp. z o.o.

ARTICLE VIII

Survival; Exclusive Remedies

8.1 No Survival.

(a) The Parties, intending to modify any applicable statute of limitations,
agree that (i) representations and warranties in this Agreement and in any
certificate delivered pursuant hereto, including the certificates delivered
pursuant to ARTICLE VII, shall terminate effective as of the Closing and shall
not survive the Closing for any purpose, and thereafter there shall be no
liability on the part of, nor shall any claim be made by, any Party or any of
their respective Affiliates in respect thereof, including any breach thereof
and (ii) after the Closing, there shall be no liability on the part of, nor
shall any claim be made by, any Party or any of their respective Affiliates in
respect of any covenant or agreement to be performed prior to the Closing, in
each case, other than, and solely, in the case of Fraud. All covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement that by their terms contemplate
performance thereof following the Closing or otherwise expressly by their
terms survive the Closing will survive the Closing ("Post-Closing Covenants")
in accordance with their terms.

(b) Any claims under this Agreement with respect to a breach of a Post-Closing
Covenant must be asserted by a written notice on or before the date that is
thirty (30) days following the expiration of the applicable survival period
for such covenant or agreement, and if such a notice is given, the survival
period for such Post-Closing Covenant shall continue solely as to the specific
matters subject to the claim asserted until it is fully resolved as provided
herein.

(c) Buyer shall ensure that the Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy
includes an express waiver, in a form satisfactory to the Sellers, of any
rights of subrogation against either Seller (the "Subrogation Waiver"), except
in the case of fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, and shall deliver
evidence of the Subrogation Waiver to the Sellers prior to Closing.

8.2 Exclusive Remedy; Materiality Qualifiers.

(a) Except for the Parties' rights pursuant to Section 10.15 and except as
expressly contemplated in Section 2.4, or in the case of Fraud, Buyer, the
Sellers and the Companies acknowledge and agree that, after the Closing, none
of Buyer, the Sellers or the Companies shall have any remedy with respect to
claims arising under or as a result of this Agreement or any certificate or
other document delivered pursuant hereto or otherwise relating to the
Companies (other than claims arising out of the failure of any Party to
perform any Post-Closing Covenants). (b) Without any qualification to the provisions of the foregoing Section
8.2(a), if any representation or warranty contained in ARTICLE III or ARTICLE
IV of this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement
is qualified by materiality, "Company Material Adverse Effect" or a derivative
thereof, such qualification shall be ignored and deemed not included in such
representation or warranty for purposes of (i) determining whether there has
been a breach of or inaccuracy in such representation or warranty or
certificate and (ii) calculating the amount of damages or losses with respect
to such breach or inaccuracy.

ARTICLE IX

Termination

9.1 Termination Prior to Closing. This Agreement may be terminated prior to
the Closing as follows:

(a) By the mutual written consent of the Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer,
on the other hand;

(b) By Buyer at any time prior to the Closing, if (i) the Sellers or the
Companies are in breach of the representations, warranties or covenants made
by the Sellers or the Companies, respectively, in this Agreement, (ii) such
breach is not cured or capable of being cured by the earlier of the day prior
to the Termination Date and thirty (30) days following written notice of such
breach from Buyer (to the extent such breach is curable) and (iii) such
breach, if not cured, would render the conditions set forth in Section 7.3
incapable of being satisfied; provided, however, that Buyer shall not be
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(b) if Buyer
has breached this Agreement and such breach has resulted in the failure of a
condition in Sections 7.1 or 7.2 to be satisfied;

(c) By the Sellers at any time prior to the Closing, if (i) Buyer is in breach
of the representations, warranties or covenants made by it in this Agreement,
(ii) such breach is not cured or capable of being cured by the earlier of the
day prior to the Termination Date and thirty (30) days following written
notice of such breach from the Sellers (to the extent such breach is curable)
and (iii) such breach, if not cured, would render the conditions set forth in
Section 7.2 incapable of being satisfied; provided, however, that the Sellers
shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
9.1(c) if the Sellers or the Companies have breached this Agreement and such
breach has resulted in the failure of a condition in Sections 7.1 or 7.3 to be
satisfied;

(d) By the Sellers, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, if the
Closing shall not have occurred by February 28, 2020 (the "Termination Date");
provided, however, that (i) the Sellers shall not be entitled to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(d) if the Sellers or the Companies
have breached this Agreement and such breach has resulted in the failure of a
condition in Sections 7.1 or 7.3 to be satisfied and (ii) Buyer shall not be
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(d) if Buyer
has breached this Agreement and such breach has resulted in the failure of a
condition in Sections 7.1 or 7.2 to be satisfied; or

(e) By the Sellers, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, if (i) the
Contemplated Transactions shall violate any Order that shall have become final
and nonappealable or (ii) there shall be a Law which makes the Contemplated
Transactions illegal or otherwise prohibited; provided, however, that the
Party seeking termination pursuant to this Section 9.1(e) is not then in
material breach of this Agreement.

9.2 Effect of Termination.

In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1,
written notice thereof shall be given by the terminating party to the other
parties and all rights, obligations and remedies of the parties under this
Agreement will terminate, except that the rights, obligations and remedies of
the parties in this Section 9.2, Article X and in the Confidentiality
Agreement will survive; provided, that no such termination shall relieve a
defaulting or breaching party from any liability or damages arising out of its
breach of any provision of this Agreement prior to such termination.

 10.4 Governing Law.

All matters relating to the interpretation, construction, validity and
enforcement of this Agreement, including all claims (whether in contract or
tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (including any claim or cause of action based upon,
arising out of, or related to any representation or warranty made in or in
connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the domestic
Laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict
of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of Laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Delaware.

10.5 Entire Agreement.

This Agreement, together with the exhibits hereto, the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Ancillary Documents and the Confidentiality Agreement,
constitute the entire agreement of the parties relating to the subject matter
hereof and supersede all prior contracts or agreements, whether oral or
written. To avoid doubt, the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect until the Closing and shall survive any termination of this
Agreement.

10.6 Severability.

Should any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to any
Person or circumstance be held invalid or unenforceable to any extent: (a)
such provision shall be ineffective to the extent, and only to the extent, of
such unenforceability or prohibition and shall be enforced to the greatest
extent permitted by Law, (b) such unenforceability or prohibition in any
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision as
applied (i) to other Persons or circumstances or (ii) in any other
jurisdiction, and (c) such unenforceability or prohibition shall not affect or
invalidate any other provision of this Agreement.

10.7 Amendment.

This Agreement may be amended at any time, but subject to the limitations of
applicable Law, only by an instrument signed by Buyer and the Sellers. Any
provision hereof may be waived only by an instrument signed by each Party
benefited by such provision.



10.8 Effect of Waiver or Consent.

No waiver or consent, express or implied, by any Party to or of any breach or
default by any Party in the performance by such party of its obligations
hereunder shall be deemed or construed to be a consent or waiver to or of any
other breach or default in the performance by such party of the same or any
other obligations of such Party hereunder. No single or partial exercise of
any right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce
any right or power, shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right or power. Failure on the part of a Party to
complain of any act of any Party or to declare any Party in default,
irrespective of how long such failure continues, shall not constitute a waiver by such Party of its rights hereunder until the applicable statute of
limitation period has run.

10.9 Parties in Interest; Limitation on Rights of Others.

The terms of this Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit
of, the Parties and their respective legal Representatives, successors and
permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied,
shall be construed to give any Person (other than the Parties and their
respective legal Representatives, successors and permitted assigns and as
expressly provided herein) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under
or in respect of this Agreement or any covenants, conditions or provisions
contained herein, as a third party beneficiary or otherwise, except that (i)
the Persons released pursuant to Section 10.16 shall have the right to enforce
their respective rights under Section 10.16, and (ii) BCLP and its partners
and employees are third-party beneficiaries of Section 10.19 and shall have
the right to enforce their respective rights thereunder.

10.10 Assignability.

No assignment of this Agreement or of any rights or obligations hereunder may
be made by any Party, directly or indirectly (by operation of Law or
otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto and
any attempted assignment without the required consents shall be void;
provided, however, that Buyer may assign this Agreement and any or all rights
or obligations hereunder to any Affiliate of Buyer (provided that no such
assignment shall relieve Buyer of its obligations under this Agreement).

10.11 Disclosure Schedules.

For the purposes of this Agreement, any information and/or matter disclosed in
the Company Disclosure Schedule with respect to any section of this Agreement
shall be deemed to have been disclosed with respect to any other section to
the extent the applicability thereto is reasonably apparent on its face. No
reference to or disclosure of any item or other matter in the Company
Disclosure Schedule shall be construed as an admission or indication that such
item or other matter is material (nor shall it establish a standard of
materiality for any purpose whatsoever) or that such item or other matter is
required to be referred to or disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule.
The information set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule is disclosed
solely for the purposes of this Agreement, and no information set forth
therein shall be deemed to be an admission by any Party hereto to any third
party of any matter whatsoever, including any violation of Law or breach of
any Contract. The Company Disclosure Schedule and the information and
disclosures contained therein are intended only to qualify and limit the
representations, warranties and covenants of the Companies contained in this
Agreement. Nothing in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to
broaden the scope of any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement or create any covenant. Matters reflected in the Company Disclosure
Schedule are not necessarily limited to matters required by the Agreement to
be reflected in the Company Disclosure Schedule. Such additional matters are
set forth for informational purposes and do not necessarily include other
matters of a similar nature.



10.12 Jurisdiction; Court Proceedings; Waiver of Jury Trial. Any Litigation involving any Party to this Agreement arising out of or in any
way relating to this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in any state or
federal court located in the State of Delaware (together with the appellate
courts thereof, the "Chosen Courts") and each of the parties hereby submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts for the purpose of any such
Litigation. Each Party irrevocably and unconditionally agrees not to assert
(a) any objection which it may ever have to the laying of venue of any such
Litigation in any Chosen Court, (b) any claim that any such Litigation brought
in any Chosen Court has been brought in an inconvenient forum and (c) any
claim that any Chosen Court does not have jurisdiction with respect to such
Litigation. To the extent that service of process by mail is permitted by
applicable Law, each Party irrevocably consents to the service of process in
any such proceeding in such courts by the mailing of such process by
registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, at its address for notices
provided for herein. Each Party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any
right to a trial by jury and agrees that any of them may file a copy of this
paragraph with any court as written evidence of the knowing, voluntary and
bargained-for agreement among the parties irrevocably to waive its right to
trial by jury in any Litigation.

10.13 No Other Duties.

The only duties and obligations of the Parties under this Agreement are as
specifically set forth in this Agreement, and no other duties or obligations
shall be implied in fact, law or equity, or under any principle of fiduciary
obligation.

10.14 Reliance on Counsel and Other Advisors.

Each Party has consulted such legal, financial, technical or other expert as
it deems necessary or desirable before entering into this Agreement. Each
Party represents and warrants that it has read, knows, understands and agrees
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

10.15 Specific Performance.

The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, the Parties agree
that, in addition to any other remedies, each Party shall be entitled to
enforce the terms of this Agreement (including Buyer's obligation to
consummate the Closing) by a decree of specific performance without the
necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy. Each Party
hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond or other
security in connection with such remedy. Each Party further agrees that the
only permitted objection that it may raise in response to any action for
equitable relief is that it contests the existence of a breach or threatened
breach of this Agreement. To the extent Buyer or the Sellers brings any
Litigation, claim, complaint or other proceeding, in each case, before any
Governmental Authority to enforce specifically the performance of the terms
and provisions of this Agreement prior to the Closing, the Termination Date
shall automatically be extended by (i) the amount of time during which such
Litigation, claim, complaint or other proceeding is pending, plus twenty (20)
Business Days, or (ii) such other time period established by the court presiding over such Litigation,
claim, complaint or other proceeding.

10.16 Release.

(a) Effective as of the Closing, each Seller, on behalf of itself and each of
its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, and each of its and their current and former
officers, managers, directors, employees, partners, members, advisors,
successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably and unconditionally releases and
forever discharges Buyer, the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries, each
current and former manager, officer and director of each Company and Company
Subsidiary and each of their respective Affiliates, and their respective
former, current and future equityholders, controlling persons, directors,
officers, employees, agents, Representatives, Affiliates, members, managers,
general or limited partners, or assignees (or any former, current or future
equityholder, controlling person, director, officer, employee, agent,
Representative, Affiliate, member, manager, general or limited partner, or
assignee of any of the foregoing) from any and all actions, causes of action,
suits, proceedings, executions, judgments, duties, debts, dues, accounts,
bonds, contracts and covenants (whether express or implied), obligations,
liabilities, claims and demands whatsoever whether in law or in equity,
arising out of, or relating to, or accruing from any act or omission, error,
negligence, strict liability, breach of contract, tort violations of Law,
matter or cause whatsoever, from the beginning of time to the Closing;
provided, however, that such release shall not cover any claims arising under
this Agreement or any Ancillary Document or involving Fraud.

(b) From and after the Closing, Buyer, on behalf of itself, the Companies and
the Company Subsidiaries, and each of its and their Affiliates and
Representatives, agrees to release and forever discharge Seller and its
Affiliates and Representatives from and against any claims by Buyer or any of
its Affiliates, including the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries, seeking
to hold any officer, director, partner, manager, or controlling stockholder
liable in connection with, or breach of any fiduciary duty relating to, any
pre-Closing actions or failures to act (including negligence or gross
negligence) by Seller or any of its Affiliates or Representatives in
connection with the Companies or the Company Subsidiaries prior to the
Closing.

10.17 Counterparts.

This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts (including
counterparts transmitted via facsimile or in .pdf, DocuSign or similar format)
with the same effect as if all signatory parties had signed the same document.
All counterparts shall be construed together and shall constitute one and the
same instrument.

10.18 Further Assurance.

If at any time after the Closing any further action is necessary or desirable
to fully effect the Contemplated Transactions, the Parties shall take such
further action (including the execution and delivery of such further
instruments and documents) as any other Party reasonably may request.

10.19 Legal Representation. (a) Each of the parties to this Agreement acknowledges and agrees that Bryan
Cave Leighton Paisner LLP ("BCLP") may have acted as counsel for the Companies
and the Sellers and/or their respective Affiliates in connection with this
Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions (the "Disposition Engagement").

(b) Each of the parties to this Agreement acknowledges and agrees that all
confidential communications between the Companies and the Sellers and/or their
respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and BCLP, on the other hand, in the
course of the Disposition Engagement, and any attendant attorney-client
privilege, attorney work product protection, and expectation of client
confidentiality applicable thereto, shall be deemed to belong solely to the
Sellers and their Affiliates (other than the Companies), and not the
Companies, and shall not pass to or be claimed, held, or used by Buyer or the
Companies upon or after the Closing. Accordingly, Buyer shall not have access
to any such communications, or to the files of BCLP relating to the
Disposition Engagement, whether or not the Closing occurs. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (i) to the extent
that files of BCLP in respect of the Disposition Engagement constitute
property of the client, only the Sellers and their Affiliates shall hold such
property rights, and (ii) BCLP shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or
disclose any such attorney-client communications or files to the Companies or
Buyer by reason of any attorney-client relationship between BCLP and the
Companies or otherwise. Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates,
irrevocably waives any right it may have to discover or obtain information or
documentation relating to the Disposition Engagement, to the extent that such
information or documentation was subject to an expectation of confidentiality
owed by BCLP to the Sellers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that
a dispute arises between Buyer, the Companies or any of their Affiliates, on
the one hand, and a third party other than Sellers or any of their Affiliates,
on the other hand, the attorney-client privilege, work product protection or
other similar privilege or protection may be asserted by the Companies and/or
their respective Affiliates to prevent the disclosure of any such
communications or advice to such third party. If and to the extent that, at
any time subsequent to Closing, Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall have the
right to assert or waive any attorney-client privilege with respect to any
communication between the Companies and their Affiliates and any Person
representing them that occurred at any time prior to the Closing, Buyer, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates shall be entitled to waive such privilege
only with the prior written consent of the Sellers (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(c) Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that BCLP may have acted as
counsel for Sellers, the Companies and/or their respective Affiliates in
certain matters prior to the Disposition Engagement and that the Sellers
reasonably anticipate that BCLP will continue to represent them or their
respective Affiliates (other than Companies) in future matters. Accordingly,
Buyer on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, and the Companies, expressly
consents to BCLP's representation of the Sellers and/or their Affiliates in
connection with any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating
to this Agreement, any Ancillary Document or the Contemplated Transactions and
waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom.

(d) Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, and each Company further
covenants and agrees that each shall not assert any claim, and that it hereby
waives any claim, against BCLP in respect of legal services provided to the Companies by BCLP in
connection with the Disposition Engagement.

(e) Upon and after the Closing, the Companies shall cease to have any
attorney-client relationship with BCLP, unless and to the extent BCLP is
specifically engaged in writing by either Company to represent such Company
after the Closing and such engagement either (i) involves no conflict of
interest with respect to the Sellers and/or their Affiliates or (ii) the
Sellers and/or their Affiliates, as applicable, consent in writing at the time
to such engagement. Any such representation by BCLP after the Closing shall
not affect the foregoing provisions hereof.

(f) Buyer and the Companies consent to the arrangements in this Section 10.19
and agree to take, and to cause their Affiliates to take, all steps necessary
to implement the intent of this Section 10.19 and not to take or cause their
Affiliates to take positions contrary to the intent of this Section 10.19.
Buyer and the Companies further agree that BCLP and its partners and employees
are third-party beneficiaries of this Section 10.19.
