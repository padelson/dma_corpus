 **ARTICLE 2 
 THE ARRANGEMENT**

  



  

 **2.01** ** ****The Arrangement**

  



  

At the Effective Time the following shall occur and shall be deemed to occur
as described in this Section 2.01 and as further described in the Plan of
Arrangement, and in accordance with the terms of the Plan of Arrangement:

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding any vesting or exercise provisions to which a Company
Option might otherwise be subject (whether by contract, the conditions of a
grant, applicable law or the terms of the Company Option Plan): (i) each
Company Option issued and outstanding at the Effective Time, will, without
any further action by or on behalf of the Company Optionholder, be deemed to
be fully vested and transferred by the Company Optionholder to the Company
(free and clear of all liens, claims and Encumbrances) and cancelled, and the
Company shall, and shall be deemed to, issue to each such Company
Optionholder a number of Company Common Shares (rounded down to the nearest
whole number of shares) equal to the product of: (A) the Company Option
Exchange Number in respect of such Company Option _multiplied by_ (B) the
number of Company Common Shares such Company Option would otherwise entitle
the Company Optionholder to acquire, less any amounts withheld pursuant to
Section 3.11 or the Plan of Arrangement; (ii) no amount shall be added to the
stated capital account maintained in respect of the Company Common Shares in
connection with such issuance of Company Common Shares; and (iii) with
respect to each Company Option, the Company Optionholder thereof will cease
to be the holder of such Company Option, will cease to have any rights as a
holder in respect of such Company Option or under the Company Option Plan,
such Company Optionholders name will be removed from the register of Company
Options, and all option agreements, grants and similar instruments relating
thereto will be cancelled.

  



  

(b) Each Company Security held by a Dissenting Securityholder shall be deemed
to be transferred to Purchaser by the holder thereof, without any further act
or formality on its part, free and clear of all liens, claims and
Encumbrances and Purchaser shall thereupon be obliged to pay the amount
therefor determined and payable in accordance with Section 3.14(a) hereof,
and the name of such holder shall be removed from the register of the Company
as a holder of Company Securities and Purchaser shall be recorded as the
registered holder of the Company Securities so transferred and shall be the
legal owner of such Company Common Securities.

  



  

(c) Each issued and outstanding Company Security held by a Company
Securityholder (other than Company Securities held by Purchaser, and for
greater certainty including the Company Common Shares deemed to be issued in
Section 2.01(a) and excluding the Company Securities deemed to be transferred
to the Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.01(b)) shall be transferred to
Purchaser and in

  



        
   

  



  

consideration for the acquisition of each Company Security the Purchaser
shall: (i) issue Purchaser Shares on the basis of 0.052 of a fully paid and
non-assessable Purchaser Share for each Company Security; and (ii) pay cash
in the amount of $0.90; subject to Sections 3.10 and 3.16 hereof (the "
_Arrangement Consideration_ "). Following completion of this step, Purchaser
will be the holder of all of the issued and outstanding Company Securities
and the central securities register of the Company will be revised
accordingly.

  



  

(d) Each Company Security held by the Purchaser, including the Company
Securities acquired pursuant to Sections 2.01(b) and (c) hereof, shall be
transferred to Subco in consideration of the issue by Subco to the Purchaser
of one common share of Subco for each Company Security so transferred.

  



  

(e) The Company will file an election with the CRA to cease to be a public
corporation for the purposes of the Tax Act.

  



  

(f) The Company and Subco shall amalgamate to form one corporate entity ("
_Amalco_ ") with the same effect as if they had amalgamated under Section 269
of the BCBCA such that:

  



  

(i) the Purchaser shall receive on the amalgamation one Amalco common share
in exchange for each Subco common share previously held and all of the issued
and outstanding the Company Common Shares and Company Preferred Shares will
be cancelled without any repayment of capital in respect thereof;

  



  

(ii) the stated capital of the common shares of Amalco will be an amount
equal to the paid up capital, as that term is defined in the Tax Act,
attributable to the common shares of Subco immediately prior to the
amalgamation;

  



  

(iii) Amalco will own and hold all of the property of the Company and Subco
and, without limiting the provisions hereof, all rights of creditors or
others will be unimpaired by such amalgamation, and all liabilities and
obligations of the Company and Subco, whether arising by contract or
otherwise, may be enforced against Amalco to the same extent as if such
liabilities and obligations had been incurred or contracted by it;

  



  

(iv) Amalco will be liable for all of the liabilities and obligations of the
Company and Subco;

  



  

(v) all rights, contracts, permits and interests of the Company and Subco
will be rights, contracts, permits and interests of Amalco as if the Company
and Subco continued and, for greater certainty, the amalgamation will not
constitute a transfer or assignment of the rights or obligations of either of
the Company or Subco under any such rights, contracts, permits and interests;

  



        
   

  



  

(vi) any existing cause of action, claim or liability to prosecution will be
unaffected;

  



  

(vii) any civil, criminal or administrative action or proceeding pending by
or against either Subco or the Company will be continued by or against
Amalco; and

  



  

(viii) a conviction against, or ruling, order or judgment in favour of or
against either Subco or the Company may be enforced by or against Amalco.

  



  

 **2.02** ** ****Effect on Company Plans**

  



  

Immediately after the transfer for cancelation to the Company of all of the
outstanding Company Options pursuant to Section 2.01, the Company Option Plan
shall be deemed to have terminated and shall be of no further force or
effect.

  



  

 **2.03** ** ****Closing of the Company s Transfer Books**

  



  

(a) Upon the transfer of the Company Options pursuant to Section 2.01: (i)
the former Company Optionholders shall cease to be the holders of such
Company Options and shall be deemed to be removed from the register of
holders of Company Options; and (ii) such Company Options shall be deemed to
have been surrendered for cancelation.

  



  

(b) Upon the transfer of the Company Common Shares and Company Preferred
Shares, holders of Company Share Certificates shall cease to have any rights
as shareholders of the Company, and the central securities registrars of the
Company shall be closed with respect to all Company Common Shares and Company
Preferred Shares immediately prior to Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, a Company Share Certificate is presented to the Company or
Purchaser, such Company Share Certificate shall be cancelled and shall be
exchanged as provided in Section 3.10.

otherwise in connection with the consummation of the Arrangement and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be

therein not misleading in light of the circumstances in which they are made,
or that otherwise requires an amendment or supplement to the Circular or such
application or consent. In any such event, Purchaser and the Company will co-
operate in the preparation of a supplement or amendment to the Circular or
such other document, as required and as the case may be, and, if required,
will cause the same to be distributed to Company Securityholders and filed
with the relevant securities regulatory authorities.

  



  

 **3.07** ** ****Compliance of Circular**

  



  

The Company will ensure that the Circular complies with all Applicable Laws
including Securities Laws and, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, that the Circular does not contain any untrue statement of a

the foregoing: (i) the Company will ensure that the Circular provides
Company Securityholders entitled to vote with information in sufficient

qualify in any manner adverse to Purchaser such recommendation, except as
expressly permitted by Section 9.01; and (iv) in the event that a third party
has announced or made public an Acquisition Proposal, which the Company Board
of Directors determines is not a Superior Proposal, the Company shall
reaffirm to all Company Securityholders its recommendation that they vote in
favour of the Arrangement Resolution.

  



  

(b) The Company agrees that Purchaser may at any time, directly or through a
soliciting dealer, actively solicit proxies in favour of the Arrangement
Resolution.

  



  

(c) The Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to advise Purchaser,

with, in all material respects, all Applicable Laws, (including without
limitation Securities Laws and the articles of the Company) in relation to
the Company Meeting and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
shall use all reasonable efforts to benefit from the accelerated timing
contemplated by Securities Laws.

postpone or cancel the Company Meeting (or propose to do so), except:

  



  

(i) if quorum is not present at the Company Meeting;

  



  

(ii) if required by Applicable Laws; or

  



  

(iii) if otherwise agreed to in writing with Purchaser.

  



  

 **3.10** ** ****Exchange Procedures**

  



  

(a) Prior to the delivery of the Circular, the Parties shall appoint the
Depositary for the purpose of exchanging the Aggregate Arrangement
Consideration to be delivered in accordance with the Plan of Arrangement.
 Concurrently with the mailing of the Circular, Purchaser shall send,
or shall cause the Depositary to send, to each applicable Company
Securityholder a Letter of Transmittal and

  



        
   

  



  

instructions (in a form reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and the Company)
for use in such exchange.

  



  

(b) Upon delivery to the Depository of a duly completed and validly executed
Letter of Transmittal, together with a Company Share Certificate in the case
of Company Securityholders that held Company Share Certificates immediately
prior to the Effective Time: (i) the Company Securityholder (other than
Dissenting Securityholders) shall be entitled to receive in exchange for each
Company Common Share or Company Preferred Share formerly held by such
Company Securityholder an amount in cash and a certificate of a Purchaser
Share registered in such holders name, representing the Arrangement
Consideration that such Company Securityholder has the right to receive
therefor in accordance with the Plan of Arrangement; and (ii) any Company
Share Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Promptly after
receipt of a properly submitted Letter of Transmittal, the Depositary shall
cause the Arrangement Consideration to be sent to the Company Securityholder
at the mailing address designated by such holder in the Letter of
Transmittal. Until so surrendered, each outstanding Company Share Certificate
will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all purposes, to
evidence only the right to receive upon such surrender the Arrangement
Consideration for each of such shares pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement.

  



  

(c) Neither Purchaser nor the Company shall be liable to any holder or former
Company Securityholder for the Arrangement Consideration attributable to
Company Securities or for any other cash amounts, delivered to any public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law.

  



  

(d) To the extent that a Company Securityholder shall not have complied with
the provisions of this Section 3.10 and the Plan of Arrangement on or before
the sixth anniversary of the Effective Date, any Company Share Certificate
held by such Company Securityholder shall cease to represent a claim by, or
interest of any kind or nature, against or in the Company, Amalco or
Purchaser and the Arrangement Consideration that such Company Securityholder
was otherwise entitled to receive shall be automatically cancelled and the
cash portion thereof shall be returned to Purchaser.

  



  

 **3.11** ** ****Withholding Rights**

  



  

Each of Purchaser, the Depositary and the Company shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable to any
Company Securityholder or former Company Securityholder or other Person
pursuant to this Agreement, including payment pursuant to a Dissent Right,
such amounts as required to be deducted and withheld with respect to such
payment under the Tax Act, the Code, or any provision of provincial, state,
local, or foreign tax law in each case as amended or succeeded and subject to
the provisions of any applicable income tax treaty between Canada and the
country where the holder is resident. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld and duly remitted to the relevant

  



        
   

  



  

tax authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes as
having been paid to the recipient of the payment in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

  



  

 **3.12** ** ****Information and Notifications**

  



  

(a) Except for proxies and other non-substantive communications, the Company
shall furnish promptly to Purchaser a copy of each notice, report, schedule

Change, or any fact, circumstance, change, event, occurrence or effect that

Governmental Authority or third Person making or commencing a Proceeding, or
a material complaint, or investigation (or communications indicating that the
same may be contemplated); (iii) any breach by the Company of any covenant
or agreement contained in this Agreement; and (iv) any event
occurring subsequent to the date hereof that would render any representation
or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement, if made on or as of
the date of such event or the Effective Date, to be untrue or inaccurate in
any material respect.

  



  

(c) Purchaser shall promptly notify the Company of: (i) any Material Adverse
Change, or any fact, circumstance, change, event, occurrence or effect that
could reasonably be expected to become a Material Adverse Change, in respect
of the business or in the conduct of the business of Purchaser; (ii) any
Governmental Authority or third Person making commencing a Proceeding, or a
material complaint, or investigation (or communications indicating that the

 COMPANY COVENANTS REGARDING NON-SOLICITATION**

  



  

 **ARTICLE 9**

  



  

 **9.01** ** ****Non-Solicitation**

  



  

(a) The Company agrees with Purchaser that, except as expressly contemplated
by this Agreement, until this Agreement is terminated the Company will not,
directly or indirectly, through any of its Representatives: (i) solicit,
initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage (including by way of furnishing
confidential information, facilitating or permitting any visit to any
facilities or properties of the Company or entering into any agreement), the
initiation of any inquiries, proposals or offers relating to or constituting
or may reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal from any
Person; (ii) enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations or
other activities or provide any information with respect to, or otherwise
cooperate in any way with, any effort or attempt by any Person (other than

Directors or any committee thereof of the Arrangement; (iv) approve, endorse,

endorse, recommend or remain neutral with respect to, any Acquisition
Proposal (it being understood that publicly taking no position or a neutral

three Business Days shall not be considered to be a violation of this Section
9.01(a)); (v) accept or enter into, or propose publicly to accept or enter
into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, understanding,
undertaking, arrangement or Contract in respect of or relating to an
Acquisition Proposal; or (vi) make any public announcement or take any other
action inconsistent with, or that could reasonably be likely to be regarded
as detracting from, the recommendation of the Company Board of Directors to
approve the transactions contemplated herein.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding Section 9.01(a) and any other provision of this
Agreement, the Company Board of Directors shall be permitted to: (i)
participate in any discussions or negotiations with, or furnish information
to, any Person in response

  



        
   

  



  

to an Acquisition Proposal by such Person if and only to the extent that the
Company has received an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
from such Person and such Acquisition Proposal would be reasonably likely to
result in or lead to, if completed in accordance with its terms, a Superior
Proposal; (ii) the Company shall have complied with all other requirements of
this Article 9 in all respects; and (iii) the Company Board of Directors,
after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
determines in good faith that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under all applicable Laws.

  



  

(c) The Company will, and will cause the its Representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any existing solicitations, discussions,
negotiations or activities with any Person (other than Purchaser) with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal or any proposal that may reasonably be
expected to constitute an Acquisition Proposal. Purchaser acknowledges that
standstill covenants or provisions contained in various confidentiality
agreements entered into by the Company with other parties relating to a
potential Acquisition Proposal may terminate in accordance with the terms
thereof (without any further action on the part of any party thereto,
including the Company) upon the Company entering into this Agreement. Only
to the extent such standstill covenants or provisions will so terminate
pursuant to their terms without any further action on the part of the
Company, the Company agrees not to release, and to cause its Subsidiaries not
to release, any third party from any standstill or confidentiality agreement
(or any term or condition of any such agreement) that the Company entered
into prior to the date hereof with any Person that was considering any
Acquisition Proposal or to amend or waive any provision of any such
agreement.

  



  

(d) The Company will discontinue access by any third party (other than
Purchaser or its Representatives) to any data room (virtual or otherwise) and
promptly request the return or deletion from retrieval systems and data bases
or destruction of all information provided to any third party which, at any
time since January 1, 2009, has entered into a confidentiality agreement with
the Company relating to a potential Acquisition Proposal to the extent that
such information has not previously been returned or destroyed, and will use
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such requests are honoured in
accordance with the terms of such agreement.

  



  

(e) The Company will ensure that its officers, directors, affiliates and its
and their investment bankers and financial or other advisors are aware of the
provisions of this Article 9 and the Company will be responsible for any
breach of this Article 9 by any of its officers, directors, investment
bankers or financial or other advisors.

  



  

 **9.02** ** ****Notification of Acquisition Proposal**

  



  

(a) The Company will promptly (and in any event within 24 hours after receipt
of such inquiry, proposal, offer or request) notify Purchaser, at first
orally and then in writing, of an inquiry, proposal or offer received by the
Company or any

  



        
   

  



  

Representative after the date of this Agreement relating to or constituting
an Acquisition Proposal or that could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not relating to any Acquisition Proposal or
inquiry that may have been received prior to the date hereof), including the
renewal of any Acquisition Proposal made prior to the date hereof, or any
amendments to the foregoing, or any written request for material non-public
information relating to the Company or for access to the properties, books or
records of the Company by any Person. Such written notice will include a copy
of any written Acquisition Proposal (and any amendment thereof) which has
been received by the Company, or if no written Acquisition Proposal has been
received, a description of the material terms and conditions of any inquiry,
proposal, offer or request and the identity of the Person making such
inquiry, proposal, offer or request. The Company will also provide such
further details of the inquiry, proposal, offer or request (and any amendment
thereof) as Purchaser may reasonably request. The Company will keep Purchaser
informed of any change to the material terms of any such inquiry, proposal,
offer or request and provide to Purchaser at the option of the Company,
either copies of all correspondence and other written material sent or
provided to the Company by any Person in connection with such inquiry,
proposal or request or sent or provided by the Company to any Person in
connection with such inquiry, proposal or request or a description of the
material terms of such correspondence or material promptly after receipt or
delivery thereof.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding Section 9.01(a), if, prior to the approval of the
Arrangement Resolution by the Company Securityholders at the Company Meeting,
the Company receives an inquiry, proposal or offer relating to or
constituting an Acquisition Proposal or a request for material non-public
information from a Person who has made or is proposing to make an unsolicited
bona fide Acquisition Proposal where the Company is not in breach of Section
9.02 and the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith after
consultation with the Companys financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that such proposal would be reasonably likely to result in or lead to a
Superior Proposal, then, and only in such case, the Company may, subject to
the execution by such Person of a confidentiality agreement having
substantially the same terms as the Confidentiality Agreement and, taken as a
whole, being no less favourable to the Company than the Confidentiality
Agreement (including, for certainty, a standstill provision (if any)
substantially identical to that set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement):
provide such Person with, or access to, non-public information regarding the
Company, provided that: (i) notwithstanding the foregoing, the
confidentiality agreement with such Person will not restrict such Person from
making the Acquisition Proposal, or announcing the intention to make
the Acquisition Proposal without the approval of the Company, and will not
restrict the Company from disclosing such agreement and providing a copy
thereof to Purchaser as set out below (and for this purpose the Company may
agree with the other party to amend any confidentiality agreement that was
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement to provide for the
foregoing); and (ii) the Company will send a copy of any such confidentiality
agreement to Purchaser promptly

  



        
   

  



  

following its execution and will promptly advise Purchaser regarding all non-
public information provided to such other Person or to which such other
Person has been provided access and will promptly provide Purchaser with, or
access to, all such information provided to such other Person and not
previously provided to Purchaser and provide Purchaser with access to all
further non-public information regarding the Company provided to such other
Person not previously provided to Purchaser.

  



  

(c) If the Company receives a written Acquisition Proposal that the Company
Board of Directors in good faith determines constitutes a Superior Proposal,
or any amendment or modification to any such Superior Proposal, in each case
the Company will provide a copy of the Superior Proposal or such amendment
or modification promptly to Purchaser and in any event within 24 hours after
such receipt.

  



  

 **9.03** ** ****Right to Match**

  



  

(a) The Company covenants that it will not accept, approve or recommend or
enter into any agreement, understanding, arrangement or Contract in respect
of, or proceed with or recommend, a Superior Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement permitted by Section 9.02(b), the execution of
which will not be subject to the conditions of this Section 9.03) unless: (i)
the Company has complied with its obligations under this Article 9; (ii) the
Company has provided Purchaser with a copy of the Superior Proposal together
with a written notice from the Company Board of Directors regarding the value
and financial terms that the Company Board of Directors has in consultation
with its financial advisors determined the value should be ascribed to any
non-cash consideration offered under the Superior Proposal; and (iii) a
period (the " _Response Period_ ) of five Business Days will have elapsed
from the later of: (A) the date on which Purchaser received written notice
from the Company advising that the Company Board of Directors has determined,
subject only to compliance with this Section 9.03(a), to enter into an
agreement, understanding, arrangement or Contract in respect of, or to
proceed with, or recommend, such Superior Proposal; and (B) the date
Purchaser receives a copy of the Superior Proposal and if the Purchaser
delivers to the Company, prior to the expiry of the Response Period, a
proposal to amend the terms of this Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement as
contemplated in Section 9.03(c), and the Company Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, taking into account the proposal by
Purchaser to amend this Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement, that the
Acquisition Proposal remains a Superior Proposal; and (iv) the Company
concurrently terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.01(c) and the
Company has previously or concurrently paid to Purchaser the fee payable
under Section 11.03, the Company acknowledging and agreeing that payment of

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall limit in any way the obligation
of the Company to convene and hold the Company Meeting in accordance with
Article 3 of this Agreement unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with Article 11.

  



  

(c) During the Response Period (or such longer period as the Company may
agree), Purchaser will have the right, but not the obligation, to propose in
writing to amend the terms of this Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement. The
Company and the Company Board of Directors will review and negotiate in good
faith any such proposal received by the Company from Purchaser during the
Response Period to determine (after receipt of advice from its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel) whether the Acquisition Proposal in
respect of which Purchaser is proposing to amend this Agreement and Plan of
Arrangement would be a Superior Proposal when assessed against this Agreement
and Plan of Arrangement as it is proposed to be amended.

  



  

(d) If the Company Board of Directors does not determine that the Acquisition
Proposal remains a Superior Proposal when compared to the proposed amendment
to this Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement, the Company and Purchaser will
promptly execute and deliver an amending agreement amending this Agreement
and the Plan of Arrangement, or an amended Agreement, incorporating or
reflecting the terms of the amendment to the terms of this Agreement and Plan
of Arrangement as proposed by Purchaser and the Company will publicly
announce that the Company Board of Directors has reaffirmed its
recommendation of the Arrangement by news release, the form of which shall be
provided to Purchaser for its review and comment prior to publication.

  



  

(e) Each successive modification or amendment to any Acquisition Proposal
that results in any change in, or modification of, the consideration to be
received under, or any other material change in the terms and conditions of,
such Acquisition Proposal will constitute a new Acquisition Proposal for the
purposes of this Section 9.03 and Purchaser will be afforded a new Response
Period in respect of each such Acquisition Proposal.

or 10.02(b); and subject to compliance with Section 11.06, if the Company
is not in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement, by the
Company on written notice to Purchaser, if Purchaser has breached any of

(h) by Purchaser if the Major Shareholder votes in favour of, tenders the

termination to the other party setting forth a brief description of the basis
on which such party is terminating this Agreement.

  



  

 **11.02** ** ****Effect of Termination**

  



  

If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 11.01, this Agreement
shall become void and of no effect without liability of any party (or any

If at any time after the execution of this Agreement:

  



  

(a) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.01(c);

  



  

(b) in the event:

  



  

(i) a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal has been made by any Person (the
" _Acquisition Proposal Offeror_ ") other than Purchaser after the date
hereof and prior to the termination of this Agreement;

  



  

(ii) either the Company or Purchaser terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Sections 11.01(b)(i) or 11.01(b)(ii); and

  



  

(iii) within 365 days after the date of such termination:

  



  

(A) an Acquisition Proposal is consummated; or

$20 million (exclusive of any withholding required by Applicable Laws
relating to Taxes which is concurrently remitted by the Company to the
relevant Government Authority and receipted) by wire transfer in immediately
available funds to an account designated by Purchaser. Such payment will be

Days following receipt by the Company of written notice of termination by
Purchaser; and (C) in the case of the occurrence of the events specified in
Section 11.03(b), prior to the earlier of the consummation of the transaction
referred to therein or prior to the entering into of the Contract. The
Company will not be obligated to make more than one payment pursuant to this
Section 11.03.

  



  

 **11.04** ** ****Reimbursement of Expenses**

  



  

(a) If this Agreement is terminated by Purchaser pursuant to Section
11.01(b)(i) because of the failure of the Company to satisfy any of the
following conditions 10.02(a), (b), (c), (f), (j) or (k) and no amount is
payable to the Purchaser pursuant to Section 11.03, then within two Business
Days following receipt by the Company of the certificate of a senior officer
of Purchaser hereafter referred to, the Company will pay to Purchaser by wire
transfer in immediately available funds to an account designated by Purchaser
an amount equal to Purchasers actual out of pocket costs and expenses,
including filing fees and reasonable fees and expenses of its counsel,
accountants, financial advisors and other experts and advisors, incidental to
the preparation, negotiation and execution of this Agreement and related
documentation, up to a maximum of $4 million, as payment in respect of such
costs and expenses (the amount of such costs and expenses to be certified by
a senior officer of Purchaser in writing in reasonable detail). The Company
will not be obligated to make payment pursuant to this Section 11.04 if it
has paid or is required to pay the fee referred to in Section 11.03, and
any fees paid by the Company under this Section 11.04 will be credited
against any fee payable in Sections 11.03 or 11.04(b)to the extent that it
subsequently becomes payable by the Company.

  



  

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
11.01(b)(i) because of the failure of the Purchaser to satisfy any of the
following conditions 10.03(a), (b), (e), (f), (i) or (j), then within two
Business Days following receipt by Purchaser of the certificate of a senior
officer of the Company hereafter referred to, the Purchaser will pay to the
Company by wire transfer in immediately available funds to an account
designated by the Company an amount equal to the Companys actual out of
pocket costs and expenses, including filing fees and reasonable fees and
expenses of its counsel, accountants, financial advisors and other experts
and advisors, incidental to the preparation, negotiation and execution of
this Agreement and related documentation, up to a maximum of $4 million as
payment in respect of such costs and expenses (the amount of such costs and
expenses to be certified by a senior officer of the Company in writing in
reasonable detail). Any fees paid by the Company under this Section 11.04(b)
will be credited against any fee payable in Section 11.04(a) to the extent
that it subsequently becomes payable by Purchaser.

  



        
   

  



  

 **11.05** ** ****Effect of Payments**

  



  

Each of the parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in Sections
11.03 and 11.04 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement and that, without those agreements, the parties would not enter
into this Agreement. Each party acknowledges that all of the payment amounts
set out in Sections 11.03 and 11.04 are payments of liquidated damages which
are a genuine pre-estimate of the damages which the party entitled to such
damages will suffer or incur as a result of the event giving rise to such
payment and the resultant termination of this Agreement and are not
penalties. Each party irrevocably waives any right that it may have to raise
as a defence that any such liquidated damages are excessive or punitive. For
greater certainty, the parties agree that the payment of an amount
pursuant to Sections 11.03 and 11.04, is the sole monetary remedy of the
party receiving such payment. Nothing contained herein will preclude a party
from seeking injunctive relief to restrain any breach or threatened breach of
the covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement or otherwise to
obtain specific performance of any such acts, covenants or agreements.

  



  

 **11.06** ** ****Notice of Unfilled Conditions**

  



  

If either the Company, on the one hand, or Purchaser, on the other hand,
determines at any time prior to the Effective Time that it intends to refuse
to complete the transactions contemplated hereby because of any unfulfilled
or unperformed condition contained in this Agreement, such party will so
notify the other party forthwith upon making such determination in order that
the other party will have the right and opportunity to take such steps, at
its own expense, as may be necessary for the purpose of fulfilling or
performing such condition within a reasonable period of time, but in no event
later than the Effective Date.  For greater certainty, in the event that such
matter is cured within the time period referred to herein, the Agreement may
not be terminated as a result thereof.

effect and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by
virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other communication). The

a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority to be
invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as

not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a
determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated

 **2.2** ** ****Binding Effect**

  



  

This Plan of Arrangement and the Arrangement will become effective at the

without any further act or formality required on the part of any Person,
except as expressly provided herein.

  



  

 **2.3** ** ****Closing**

  



  

At the Effective Time, the following shall occur and shall be deemed to occur
sequentially in the following order without any further act or formality:

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding any vesting or exercise provisions to which a Company
Option might otherwise be subject (whether by contract, the conditions of a
grant, applicable law or the terms of the Company Option Plan): (i) each
Company Option issued and outstanding at the Effective Time will, without any
further action by or on behalf of the Company Optionholder, be deemed to be
fully vested and transferred by the Company Optionholder to the Company (free
and clear of all liens, claims and Encumbrances) and cancelled, and the
Company shall, and shall be deemed to, issue to each such Company
Optionholder a number of Company Common Shares (rounded down to the nearest
whole number) equal to the product of: (A) the Company Option Exchange Number
in respect of such Company Option _multiplied by_ (B) the number of Company
Common Shares such Company Option would otherwise entitle the Company
Optionholder to acquire, less any amounts withheld pursuant to Section 4.3 or
the Arrangement Agreement; (ii) no amount shall be added to the stated
capital account maintained in respect of the Company Common Shares in
connection with such issuance of Company Common Shares; and (iii) with
respect to each Company Option, the Company Optionholder thereof will cease
to be the holder of such Company Option, will cease to have any rights as a
holder in respect of such Company Option or under the Company Option Plan,
such Company Optionholders name will be removed from the register of Company
Options, and all option agreements, grants and similar instruments relating
thereto will be cancelled. Immediately after the transfer for cancelation to
the Company of all of the outstanding Company Options pursuant to this
Section 2.3(a) the Company

  



        
   

  



  

Option Plan shall be deemed to have terminated and be of no further force or
effect.

  



  

(b) Each Company Security held by a Dissenting Securityholder shall be deemed
to be transferred to Purchaser by the holder thereof, without any further act
or formality on its part, free and clear of all liens, claims and
Encumbrances and Purchaser shall thereupon be obliged to pay the amount
therefor determined and payable in accordance with Section 3.1(a) hereof, and
the name of such holder shall be removed from the register of the Company as
a holder of Company Securities and Purchaser shall be recorded as the
registered holder of the Company Securities so transferred and shall be the
legal owner of such Company Securities.

  



  

(c) Each issued and outstanding Company Security held by a Company
Securityholder (other than Company Securities held by Purchaser, and for
greater certainty including the Company Common Shares deemed to be issued in
Section 2.3(a) and excluding the Company Securities deemed to be transferred
to Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.3(b)) shall be transferred to Purchaser
and, in consideration therefor, Purchaser shall deliver the Arrangement
Consideration subject to the terms of the Arrangement Agreement and this Plan
of Arrangement.

  



  

(d) Each Company Security held by the Purchaser, including the Company
Securities acquired pursuant to Sections 2.3(b) and (c) hereof, shall be
transferred to Subco in consideration of the issue by Subco to the Purchaser
of one common share of Subco for each Company Security so transferred.

  



  

(e) The Company will file an election with the CRA to cease to be a public
corporation for the purposes of the Tax Act.

  



  

(f) The Company and Subco shall amalgamate to form one corporate entity ("
_Amalco_ ") with the same effect as if they had amalgamated under Section 269
of the BCBCA such that:

  



  

(i) Purchaser shall receive on the amalgamation one Amalco common share in
exchange for each Subco common share previously held and all of the issued
and outstanding the Company Common Shares and Company Preferred Shares will
be cancelled without any repayment of capital in respect thereof;

  



  

(ii) the stated capital of the common shares of Amalco will be an amount
equal to the paid up capital, as that term is defined in the Tax Act,
attributable to the common shares of Subco immediately prior to the
amalgamation;

  



  

(iii) Amalco will own and hold all of the property of the Company and Subco
and, without limiting the provisions hereof, all rights of creditors or
others will be unimpaired by such amalgamation, and all liabilities and
obligations of the Company and Subco, whether arising by contract or

  



        
   

  



  

otherwise, may be enforced against Amalco to the same extent as if such
liabilities and obligations had been incurred or contracted by it;

  



  

(iv) Amalco will be liable for all of the liabilities and obligations of the
Company and Subco;

  



  

(v) all rights, contracts, permits and interests of the Company and Subco
will be rights, contracts, permits and interests of Amalco as if the Company
and Subco continued and, for greater certainty, the amalgamation will not
constitute a transfer or assignment of the rights or obligations of either of
the Company or Subco under any such rights, contracts, permits and interests;

  



  

(vi) any existing cause of action, claim or liability to prosecution will be
unaffected;

  



  

(vii) any civil, criminal or administrative action or proceeding pending by
or against either Subco or the Company will be continued by or against
Amalco; and

 **2.4** ** ****Tax Elections**

  



  

(a) An Eligible Holder whose Company Common Shares or Company Preferred
Shares are exchanged for Purchaser Shares and cash pursuant to the
Arrangement shall be entitled to make a joint income tax election, pursuant
to Section 85 of the Tax Act (and any analogous provision of provincial
income tax law) (a " _Section 85 Election_") with respect to the exchange by
providing two signed copies of the necessary joint election forms to an
appointed representative, as directed by Purchaser, within 90 days after the
Effective Date, duly completed with the details of the number of Company
Common Shares or Company Preferred Shares transferred and the applicable
agreed amounts for the purposes of such joint elections. Purchaser shall,
within 90 days after receiving the completed joint election forms from an
Eligible Holder, and subject to such joint election forms being correct and
complete and in compliance with requirements imposed under the Tax Act (or
applicable provincial income tax law), sign and return them to the Eligible
Holder for filing with the CRA (or the applicable provincial tax authority).
Neither the Company, Purchaser nor any successor corporation shall be
responsible for the proper completion of any joint election form nor, except
for the obligation to sign and return duly completed joint election forms
which are received within 90 days of the Effective Date, for any taxes,
interest or penalties resulting from the failure of an Eligible Holder to
properly complete or file such joint election forms in the form and manner
and within the time prescribed by the Tax Act (or any applicable provincial
legislation). In its sole discretion, Purchaser or any successor corporation
may choose to sign and return a joint

  



        
   

  



  

election form received by it more than 90 days following the Effective Date,
but will have no obligation to do so.

  



  

(b) Upon receipt of a Letter of Transmittal in which an Eligible Holder has
indicated that the Eligible Holder intends to make a Section 85 Election,
Purchaser will promptly deliver a tax instruction letter (and a tax
instruction letter for the equivalent Quebec election, if applicable),
together with the relevant tax election forms (including the Quebec tax
election forms, if applicable) to the Eligible Holder.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 3 
 RIGHTS OF DISSENT**

  



  

 **3.1** ** ****Rights of Dissent**

  



  

(a) Company Securityholders may exercise dissent rights (" _Dissent Rights_
") in connection with the Arrangement pursuant to and in the manner set forth
in Section 238 of the BCBCA as modified by the Interim Order and
this Section 3.1; provided that, notwithstanding Subsection 242(2) of
the BCBCA, the written objection to the Arrangement Resolution referred to
in Subsection 240 of the BCBCA must be received by the Company not later
than 5:00 p.m. (Vancouver time) on the Business Day immediately preceding
the date of the Company Meeting (as it may be adjourned or postponed from
time to time). Dissenting Securityholders who duly exercise their Dissent
Rights shall be deemed to have transferred the Company Securities held by
them and in respect of which Dissent Rights have been validly exercised to
Purchaser free and clear of all Encumbrances, as provided in Section 2.3(b),
and if they:

  



  

(i) ultimately are entitled to be paid fair value for such Company
Securities, to be paid the fair value of such Company Securities, and will
not be entitled to any other payment or consideration, including any payment
that would be payable under the Arrangement had such holders not exercised
their Dissent Rights in respect of such Company Securities; or

  



  

(ii) ultimately are not entitled, for any reason, to be paid fair value for
such Company Securities, shall be deemed to have participated in the
Arrangement on the same basis as a non-dissenting holder of Company
Securities.

  



  

 **3.2** ** ****Recognition of Dissenting Securityholders**

  



  

(a) In no circumstances shall Purchaser and the Company or any other Person
be required to recognize a Person exercising Dissent Rights unless such
Person is the holder of those Company Securities in respect of which such
rights are sought to be exercised.

  



  

(b) For greater certainty, in no case shall Purchaser and the Company or any
other Person be required to recognize Dissenting Securityholders as holders
of

  



        
   

  



  

Company Securities in respect of which Dissent Rights have been validly
exercised after the completion of Section 2.3(b), and the names of such
Dissenting Securityholders shall be removed from the registers of holders of
Company Securities, as applicable, in respect of which Dissent Rights have
been validly exercised at the same time as the event described in Section
2.3(b) occurs. In addition to any other restrictions under the BCBCA, none of
the following shall be entitled to exercise Dissent Rights, holders of: (i)
Company Warrants; (ii) Goldcorp Warrants; and (iii) Company Securities who
vote or have instructed a proxyholder to vote such Company Securities in
favour of the Arrangement Resolution.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 4 
 CERTIFICATES AND PAYMENTS**

  



  

 **4.1** ** ****Payment of Consideration**

  



  

(a) Prior to the delivery of the Circular, the Parties shall appoint the
Depositary for the purpose of exchanging the Aggregate Arrangement
Consideration to be delivered in accordance with the Plan of Arrangement and
shall deposit, for the benefit of Company Securityholders, the Arrangement
Consideration with the Depositary in the aggregate amount equal to the
payments in respect thereof required by the Plan of Arrangement. The
cash portion of the Arrangement Consideration so deposited with the
Depositary shall be held in an interest-bearing account, and any interest
earned on such funds shall be for the account of Purchaser.  Concurrently
with the mailing of the Circular Purchaser shall send, or shall cause the
Depositary to send, a Letter of Transmittal and instructions (in a form
reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and the Company) to each
Company Securityholder.

  



  

(b) Upon delivery to the Depository of a duly completed and validly executed
Letter of Transmittal, together with a Company Share Certificate in the case
of Company Securityholders that held Company Share Certificates immediately
prior to the Effective Time: (i) the Company Securityholder (other than
Dissenting Securityholders) shall be entitled to receive in exchange for each
Company Common Share or Company Preferred Share formerly held by such
Company Securityholder an amount in cash and a certificate of a Purchaser
Share registered in such holders name, representing the Arrangement
Consideration that such Company Securityholder has the right to receive
therefor in accordance with the Plan of Arrangement; and (ii) any Company
Share Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.  Promptly
after receipt of a properly submitted Letter of Transmittal the Depositary
shall cause the Arrangement Consideration to be sent to the
Company Securityholder at the mailing address designated by such holder in
the Letter of Transmittal. Until so surrendered, each outstanding Company
Share Certificate will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all
purposes, to evidence only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Arrangement Consideration for each of such shares pursuant to the Plan of
Arrangement.

  



        
   

  



  

(c) Neither Purchaser nor the Company shall be liable to any holder or former
Company Securityholder for the Arrangement Consideration attributable to
Company Securities or for any other cash amounts, delivered to any public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law.

  



  

(d) To the extent that a Company Securityholder shall not have complied with
the provisions of this Section 4.1 and this Plan of Arrangement on or before
the sixth anniversary of the Effective Date, any Company Share Certificate
held by such Company Securityholder shall cease to represent a claim by, or
interest of any kind or nature, against or in the Company or Purchaser and
the Arrangement Consideration that such Company Securityholder was otherwise
entitled to receive shall be automatically cancelled and the cash portion
thereof shall be returned to Purchaser.

  



  

(e) Any payment made by way of cheque by the Depositary pursuant to the Plan
of Arrangement that has not been deposited or has been returned to the
Depositary or that otherwise remains unclaimed, in each case, on or before
the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, and any right or claim to
payment hereunder that remains outstanding on the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time shall cease to represent a right or claim of any kind or
nature and the right of the holder to receive the Arrangement Consideration
pursuant to this Plan of Arrangement shall terminate and be deemed to be
surrendered and forfeited to Purchaser for no consideration.

  



  

(f) No holder of Company Securities shall be entitled to receive any
consideration with respect to such Company Securities other than any
consideration to which such holder is entitled to receive in accordance with
Section 2.3 and this Section 4.1 and, for greater certainty, no such holder
with be entitled to receive any interest, dividends, premium or other payment
in connection therewith, other than any declared but unpaid dividends.

  



  

 **4.2** ** ****Lost Certificates**

  



  

In the event any Company Share Certificate which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented one or more outstanding Company Securities that
were transferred pursuant to Section 2.3(c) shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Company Share Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Depositary will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company
Share Certificate, the Arrangement Consideration deliverable in accordance
with such Company Securityholders Letter of Transmittal. When authorizing
such payment in exchange for any lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the
Person to whom such Arrangement Consideration is to be delivered shall as a
condition precedent to the delivery of such cash, give a bond satisfactory to
Purchaser and the Depositary (acting reasonably) in such sum as Purchaser may
direct, or otherwise indemnify Purchaser and the Company in a manner
satisfactory to Purchaser and the Company, acting reasonably, against any
claim that may be made against Purchaser and the Company with respect to the
certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  



        
   

  



  

 **4.3** ** ****Withholding Rights**

  



  

Purchaser and the Company or the Depositary shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amount payable to any Person under the Plan of Arrangement
(including, without limitation, any amounts payable pursuant to Section 4.1),
such amounts as Purchaser and the Company or the Depositary determines,
acting reasonably, are required or permitted to be deducted and withheld with
respect to such payment under the Tax Act, the Code or any provision of any
other Applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes hereof as having been paid
to the Person in respect of which such withholding was made, provided that
such amounts are actually remitted to the appropriate taxing authority.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 5 
 AMENDMENTS**

  



  

 **5.1** ** ****Amendments to Plan of Arrangement**

  



  

(a) The Company may amend, modify and/or supplement this Plan of Arrangement
