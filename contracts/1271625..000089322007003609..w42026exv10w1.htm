and description of all policies of fire, liability, product liability, workers compensation, health

Assets and the Real Property (each a &#147;<B><I>Policy</I></B>&#148; and collectively, the &#147;<B><I>Policies</I></B>&#148;), true and correct
copies of which have heretofore been delivered to the Buyer. <U>Schedule&nbsp;5.26</U> includes,
without limitation, the carrier, the description of coverage, the limits of coverage, retention or
deductible amounts, amount of annual premiums, date of expiration and the date through which
premiums have been paid with respect to each such Policy, and any pending claims in excess of
$50,000. All such Policies are valid, outstanding and enforceable policies and provide insurance
coverage for the Real Property, the Purchased Assets and operations of the Selling Entity.
<U>Schedule&nbsp;5.26</U> indicates each Policy as to which (a)&nbsp;the coverage limit has been reached or
(b)&nbsp;the total incurred losses to date equal 75% or more of the coverage limit. No notice of
cancellation, termination or refusal to renew has been received with respect to any such Policy,
and no Seller has knowledge of any act or omission of the Selling Entity which could reasonably be
expected to result in cancellation of any such Policy prior to its scheduled expiration date. The
Selling Entity has not been refused any insurance with respect to any aspect of the operations of
the Businesses nor has its coverage been limited by any insurance carrier to which it has applied
for insurance or with which it has carried insurance during the last three years. The Selling
Entity has duly and timely made all claims it has been entitled to make under each Policy of
insurance, except for claims that have otherwise been resolved or as to which the Selling Entity is
making good faith commercially reasonable efforts to resolve. Since January&nbsp;1, 2005, all products
liability and general liability Policies maintained by or for the benefit of the Selling Entity
have been &#147;occurrence&#148; Policies and not &#147;claims made&#148; Policies. There is no claim by the Selling
Entity pending under any such Policies as to which coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed
by the underwriters of such Policies, and no Seller knows of any basis for denial of any claim
under any such Policy. No Seller has received any written notice from or on behalf of any
insurance carrier issuing any such Policy that insurance rates therefor will hereafter be
substantially increased (except to the extent that insurance rates may be increased for all
similarly situated risks) or that there will hereafter be a cancellation or an increase in a
deductible (or an increase in premiums in order to maintain an existing deductible) or nonrenewal
of any such Policy. Such Policies are sufficient in all material respects for compliance by the
Selling Entity with all Requirements of Law and with the requirements of all material Contracts to
which the Selling Entity is a party.

<DIV align="center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 18pt"><U><B>Form of Legal Opinion by Sellers&#146; Counsel</B></U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have acted as special counsel for CCS Financial Services Inc., a Florida corporation (the
&#147;<U>Selling Entity</U>&#148;), in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of, and sale
of assets under, the Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of October &#95;&#95;&#95;, 2007 (the &#147;Purchase
Agreement&#148;), by and among the Selling Entity, Allen Eager, The Allen Eager Revocable Trust, Paul P.
Hauser, Barry E. Hershman and The Barry E. Hershman Revocable Trust (collectively, the &#147;<U>Selling
Shareholders</U>&#148;), and Check Mart of Florida, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the &#147;<U>Buyer</U>&#148;).
We have not acted as counsel to the Selling Shareholders and as a condition to the closing of the
transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, Buyer will receive a legal opinion in a form
reasonably acceptable to Buyer from a law firm reasonably acceptable to Buyer opining on the
capacity of the Selling Shareholders that are trusts to execute, deliver and perform all of their
obligations under the Purchase Agreement and each of the Ancillary Agreements (as hereinafter
defined). Accordingly we render no opinion with respect to such matters. This opinion is being
rendered pursuant to Section&nbsp;11.1(n) of the Purchase Agreement. Capitalized terms not defined in
this letter have the meanings ascribed to them in the Purchase Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the capacity described above, we have considered such matters of fact and law, including
the examination of the original or copies, identified to our satisfaction, of (i)&nbsp;each of the
Transaction Documents; (ii)&nbsp;the organizational documents of the Selling Entity including it&#146;s
certificate of incorporation or similar document and bylaws (the &#147;<U>Governing Documents</U>&#148;);
(iii)&nbsp;certificates executed by certain officers of the Selling Entity pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement or otherwise; (iv)&nbsp;representations of the Sellers given pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement; and (v)&nbsp;certificates of good standing relating to the Selling Entity. In addition, we
have examined such other documents of or relating to the Sellers related to matters of law as we
have deemed necessary in connection with this opinion.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our examination, we have assumed with your permission and without independent verification
of any kind, the genuineness of all signatures and the authenticity of all documents submitted to
us as originals, the conformity to original documents of documents submitted to us as copies and
the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. We have further assumed (i)&nbsp;the due
authorization, execution and delivery of each of such documents by, or on behalf of, all parties
thereto (other than the Selling Entity), (ii)&nbsp;the legal capacity of all persons signing documents
in their individual capacity and the legal capacity of the Selling Shareholders that are trusts to
sign the Asset Purchase Agreement and Ancillary Agreements. Whenever in this opinion we refer to
matters of which &#147;we have knowledge,&#148; &#147;we know&#148; or &#147;to our knowledge,&#148; such reference means facts
within the actual knowledge of attorneys in this firm who have devoted substantial time to matters
on behalf of the Selling Entity and no opinion is implied by, or to be inferred beyond, the matters
expressly so stated..

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to all questions of fact material to the opinions expressed herein, unless we have actual
knowledge to the contrary, we have assumed, without independent investigation, the accuracy of the
factual matters addressed by, and accordingly have relied conclusively upon, certificates or
comparable documents of various public officials and a certificate of the officers and shareholders
of the Selling Entity delivered to us, a copy of which will be attached to this

upon the correctness and completeness of all representations, warranties and other matters
contained in the Purchase Agreement, and the schedules, documents, agreements and certificates to
be delivered pursuant to the Purchase Agreement except to the extent we have actual knowledge to
the contrary, and upon the compliance with the covenants contained in the Purchase Agreement and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, and subject to the qualifications,

Escrow Agreement and the Supplemental Escrow Agreement (such agreements, other than the Purchase
Agreement, hereinafter collectively referred to as the &#147;Ancillary Agreements&#148;) each constitute
legal, valid and binding obligations of the Sellers, enforceable against the Sellers in accordance
with their respective terms, except as may be limited by (i)&nbsp;bankruptcy, insolvency or other
similar laws affecting creditors&#146; rights generally, and (ii)&nbsp;equitable principles of general
applicability and public policy.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;The Selling Entity has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties, to carry on the Businesses as it is now being conducted, and to execute and
deliver the Purchase Agreement and each of the Ancillary Agreements and to perform its obligations
thereunder. The execution and delivery by the Selling Entity of the Purchase Agreement and each of
the Ancillary Agreements and the performance by the Selling Entity of its obligations thereunder
have been duly authorized by the Board of Directors and Selling
Shareholders, and no other corporate proceeding on the part of the Selling Entity is necessary
therefor.

Selling Entity of the Purchase Agreement and each of the Ancillary Agreements did not, and the
performance by the Selling Entity of its obligations thereunder will not, (a)&nbsp;violate any provision
of the currently existing Articles of Incorporation or bylaws of the Selling Entity, (b)&nbsp;to our
knowledge, violate any currently existing judgment, order, writ, injunction or decree applicable to
the Selling Entity, of any court, governmental or administrative agency or other body, (c)&nbsp;violate
