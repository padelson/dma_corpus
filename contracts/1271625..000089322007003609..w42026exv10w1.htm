 1.3 _Certain Transitional Matters_. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any Bill of Sale, or any Assignment and Assumption Agreement, to the extent that the sale or delegation by the Sellers, or the purchase or assumption by the Buyer, of any of the Purchased Assets or any of the Assumed Liabilities requires any Consent or Regulatory Approval, this Agreement, the applicable Bill of Sale and the applicable Assignment and Assumption Agreement shall constitute the Sellers agreement to sell and delegate, and the Buyers agreement to purchase and assume, such Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities as promptly as practicable following the obtainment of any necessary Consent or Regulatory Approval; _provided_ , that from and after the Closing Date until the date on which such Consent or Regulatory Approval is obtained, the Sellers shall make available to the Buyer the economic and practical benefits of such Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities for no additional consideration. If and to the extent that the Sellers are making available to the Buyer the economic and practical benefits of such Purchased Assets, the risk of loss for such Purchased Assets shall rest with the Buyer. Nothing contained in this _Section 1.3_ is intended to impair, reduce or otherwise modify any representation, warranty and covenant contained in this Agreement, including those relating to any of the Purchased Assets or to any of the Assumed Liabilities. 

  

 (b) In the event that Sellers have failed to obtain Estoppel and Consent Certificates in a form reasonably acceptable to Buyer for any one or more Branches (each, a " _Restricted Branch_ "), and in the event that (i) all other conditions set forth in Article 9 hereof have been satisfied or waived by Buyer and (ii) Estoppel and Consent Certificates have been obtained for at least ninety percent (90%) of all Branches (which must include the Branches listed on _Schedule 1.3)_, then the failure to obtain the Estoppel and Consent Certificates for the Restricted Branches shall not by itself constitute a failure of Buyers or Sellers closing conditions set forth in Articles 9 or 10 hereunder; provided, however, that (x) Buyer and the Selling Entity shall at the Closing enter into a License Agreement in substantially the form attached to _Exhibit F_ hereto with respect to the Restricted Branches (the " _License Agreement_ "), and (y) a portion of the Cash Consideration equal to $500,000 for each Restricted Branch (the " _Branch Holdback_ ") shall be paid to the Escrow Agent to be held and disbursed upon the terms set forth in a Supplemental Escrow Agreement in substantially the form attached as _Exhibit G_ hereto (the " _Supplemental Escrow Agreement_ "). 

  

 (i) Subject to the terms of the Supplemental Escrow Agreement, on or before the date that is one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing (the " _Determination Date_ "), if the Buyer receives an Estoppel and Consent Certificate for any 

   ##### 

  

 

Restricted Branch, the Branch Holdback for such Restricted Branch (together
with any earnings on such amount) shall be paid by the Escrow Agent to the
Selling Entity within three (3) business days of Buyers receipt of such
Estoppel and Consent Certificate, and the Selling Entity shall thereafter
deliver any assignment document reasonably requested by Buyer to evidence the
assignment to Buyer of the Unexpired Lease for such Restricted Branch. If on
the Determination Date there are any Restricted Branches for which Buyer has
not received an Estoppel and Consent Certificate (such Branches being
referred to as " _Remaining Branches_ "), Buyer will deliver to the Selling
Entity, within three (3) business days after Determination Date, a written
notice that states for each Remaining Branch whether Buyer desires to
continue to own and operate the Remaining Branch or to terminate its
ownership and operation of such Remaining Branch (a " _Determination Notice_
"). 

   

 (ii) With respect to any Remaining Branch that Buyer has determined to continue to own and operate (an " _Assumed Branch_ "), the Branch Holdback for such Remaining Branch (together with any earnings on such amount) shall be delivered by the Escrow Agent to the Selling Entity simultaneous with the delivery of the Determination Notice. Subject to the first two sentences of _Section 1.3(a)_ , Buyer shall be deemed to have assumed all executory obligations arising on and after the Closing Date under the Unexpired Lease for any Assumed Branch, and such obligations shall be deemed to be Assumed Liabilities for purposes of this Agreement, and the risk of failure to obtain the Estoppel and Consent Certificate shall be borne by Buyer, with Buyer receiving credit for any payments made under the License Agreement. With respect to any Remaining Branch that Buyer has determined not continue owning and operating (a " _Terminated Branch_ "), the Branch Holdback (together with any earnings on such amount) for such Remaining Branch shall be delivered to Buyer. Additionally, _Section 4.4(b)_ of this Agreement shall apply to the operation of any Assumed Branch by Buyer from and after the Closing Date. 

  

 (iii) With respect to any Terminated Branch, Buyer shall be deemed not to assume the Unexpired Lease with respect thereto (regardless of whether an Estoppel and Consent Certificate is thereafter received) and all obligations under and liabilities related to such Unexpired Lease, whether they arise before or after the Closing, shall be deemed an Excluded Liability for purposes of this Agreement, and the Buyers only obligation with respect to the Terminated Branch shall be Buyers obligations to the Selling Entity under the License Agreement. Additionally, within fifteen (15) calendar days after the delivery of the Determination Notice indicating that a Remaining Branch shall be deemed a Terminated Branch, Buyer shall (i) cease operations at the Terminated Branch, (ii) remove any and all improvements from the Terminated Branch made by Buyer after the Closing Date at Buyers sole cost and expense, (iii) deliver all keys for the Terminated Branches to the Selling Entity, and (iv) execute such documents as may be reasonably requested by the Selling Entity to evidence and/or confirm the termination of the right by Buyer to occupy the premises of the Terminated Branch. Only with respect to up to four (4) Terminated Branches, in the event that on or before the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date, if Buyer opens for business any branch location that is located within a radius of three (3) miles of the Terminated Branch and engages in the same or substantially same business as the Terminated Branch at such location (a " _Replacement Branch_ "), then the Buyer shall, within three (3) business days of the date on which the Replacement Branch opens for business to the general public, pay to Selling Entity an amount equal to the Branch Holdback for such Terminated Branch less the actual costs and direct 

   ##### 

  

 

expenses incurred by Buyer in developing, constructing, building out, and
opening such Replacement Branch, excluding any allocation of corporate
overhead or management fees (or similar expenses) payable to any Affiliate of
Buyer. Sellers acknowledge that the provisions of  _Section 2.6(b)_ of this
Agreement shall restrict Sellers from operating a Competing Business at any
Terminated Branch or from selling any assets relating to the Terminated Branch
to any other person or entity owning or operating a Competing Business. 

   

 2\. _Consideration and Payment; Allocation_. 

   

 2.1 _Payment of Purchase Price for Purchased Assets_. The purchase price to be paid to the Sellers by the Buyer for the Purchased Assets will be the sum of (a) One Hundred One Million Dollars ($101,000,000.00) (the " _Cash Amount_ "), _plus_ or _minus_ (b) the amount, if any, by which Cash on Hand is greater or less than, respectively, One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,500,000.00) (the " _Cash Target_ "), _plus_ (c) the amount of any security deposits relating to the Purchased Assets, including those made in connection with real estate leases, utilities and any other purchased or leased equipment and identified on _Schedule 2.1_ (collectively, the " _Deposits_ ") (such sum of the Cash Payment, the Cash Target and the Deposits collectively referred to herein as the " _Cash Consideration_ "). In addition to the Cash Consideration, the Buyer will assume, from and after the Closing, the Assumed Liabilities as more particularly set forth in _Section 4.1_. 

  

 2.2 _Payment of Consideration_. 

  

 2.2.1 At the Closing, the Buyer shall pay the Cash Consideration reduced by the Escrow Amount as set forth in _Section 13.8_ to the Sellers in cash by federal or other wire transfer to the accounts previously designated by the Sellers jointly in writing. 

  

 2.2.2 The Buyer shall at Closing pay the Escrow Amount to the Escrow Agent, to be administered in accordance with _Section 13.8_ and the Escrow Agreement. 

  

 2.2.3 If the amount of Cash on Hand is not capable of being verified as of the opening of business on the Closing Date, such amount will be estimated for purposes of calculating the Cash Consideration, subject to verification within forty-eight (48) hours following the Closing Date, such verification to be agreed by the Parties in good faith. If the actual amount of Cash on Hand, as verified, is less than the amount estimated for purposes of the Closing (a " _Cash Deficiency_ "), the Sellers will immediately wire the amount of the Cash Deficiency to the Buyers designated account, and if the amount of the Cash on Hand is greater than the amount estimated for purposes of the Closing (a " _Cash Surplus_ "), the Buyer will immediately wire the amount of such Cash Surplus to an account designated by the Selling Entity. 

  

 2.3 _Apportionment_. Notwithstanding _Section 2.1_, to the extent that the Sellers made any payment(s) on account of rents, real estate taxes, personal property taxes, water, utilities and other operating expenses of any of the Businesses that are attributable, in whole or in part, to the period on or after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall, within ten (10) business days after receipt of the Sellers statement therefor by the Buyer, pay to the Selling Entity an amount equal to the payment(s) made on account of such items which are attributable 

   ##### 

  

 

to the period of time on or after the Closing Date (collectively, the "
_Buyer s Apportionment_"). To the extent that the Buyer shall make any
payment(s) on account of any rents, real estate taxes, personal property
taxes, water, utilities and other operating expenses of any of the Businesses
that are attributable, in whole or in part, to a period which includes a
period of time prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers shall, within ten (10)
business days after receipt of the Buyers statement therefor by the Selling
Entity, pay to the Buyer an amount equal to the payment(s) made on account of
such items which are attributable to the period of time prior to the Closing
Date. If the Sellers fail to make such payment within the required ten (10)
business days as required herein, the Buyer may claim such unpaid amount
against the Escrow Amount. 

   

 2.4 _Satisfaction of Buyer s Obligations_. Upon the Buyers payment of the Cash Consideration and the Buyers Apportionment, the Buyer shall be deemed to have satisfied their obligations to make payments pursuant to this Agreement other than (a) the obligation of the Buyer to indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section 13.3_ and (b) the Buyers assumption of the Assumed Liabilities pursuant to _Section 4.1_. 

  

 2.5 _Tax Allocation_. The Cash Consideration shall be allocated among the Purchased Assets as provided on _Schedule 2.5_, which shall be prepared by the Selling Entity and delivered to Buyer no later than fourteen (14) days after the Effective Date. The allocation set forth on _Schedule 2.5_ shall be reasonably acceptable to Buyer. The allocation of the Cash Consideration among the Purchased Assets provided on _Schedule 2.5_ is intended to comply with Section 1060 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the rules and regulations thereunder, all as amended (the " _Code_ "). In furtherance thereof, the Selling Entity will also no later than fourteen (14) days after the Effective Date complete and provide to Buyer a true and complete copy of, United States Internal Revenue Service Form 8594, in a manner consistent with _Schedule 2.5_. The Buyer, the Sellers and their Affiliates shall report, act and file Tax Returns (including, but not limited to, Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) in all respects and for all purposes consistent with the allocations set forth on _Schedule 2.5_ and such Form 8594\. The Sellers and the Buyer shall not (unless compelled by any governmental or regulatory authority or required by applicable Requirement of Law) take any position (whether in an audit, any Tax Return or otherwise) which is inconsistent with the allocations set forth on _Schedule 2.5_ and such Form 8594.

 (k) All common area maintenance and other adjustments under the Assumed Leases for the period prior to the Closing Date.

 4.3 _Certain Employee Matters_. 

  

 (a) The Buyer reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to make offers of employment to the employees of the Sellers who provide services for and on behalf of the Sellers Businesses at each Branch, all of which employees are listed on _Schedule 4.3_ (collectively, the " _Employees_ ") as of and conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing. The Buyer and the Sellers hereby acknowledge that any such offers of employment to the Employees shall be made on an at-will basis at substantially the same rate of compensation (exclusive of benefits) as is set forth on  _Schedule 4.3_. _Schedule 4.3_ accurately sets forth, by Branch with 

   ##### 

  

 

respect to each Employee of the Sellers at such Branch (including any Employee
who is on a leave of absence or on temporary layoff status subject to
recall): (a) the name of such Employee and the date as of which such Employee
was originally hired by the Sellers; (b) such Employees title and
compensation structure (i.e., whether such employee receives compensation as a
salaried or hourly employee); (c) such Employees annualized compensation if
salaried or hourly rate if any hourly employee as of the date of this
Agreement, including base salary or hourly rate, vacation and/or paid time
off, accrual amounts as of September 1, 2007, and any other compensation
forms; and (d) any governmental authorization or Permit that is held by such
Employee and that is used in connection with the Businesses. Additionally,
_Schedule 4.3_ includes a description of the Selling Entitys bonus program
for its employees. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall create any
contract of employment or a promise of continued employment with the Buyer for
any specified period, and no third party beneficiary rights are provided to
any Employee pursuant to this Agreement. Accordingly, the Buyer and the
Sellers acknowledge that all offers of employment made by the Buyer and the
actual employment of any Employee shall, at all times, be subject to
the Buyers right, in its sole discretion, to establish and modify, from time
to time, the terms and conditions of the Employees employment and to
terminate such employment at any time. Except as the Buyer may otherwise
expressly agree in writing, any Employee hired by the Buyer (a "
_Hired Employee_ ") shall be treated as a new, at-will employee of the
Buyer. 

   

 (b) Hired Employees shall be employed by the Buyer solely in accordance with the Buyers hiring and other employment policies and procedures, which may differ from the Selling Entitys employment policies and procedures. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer shall have sole and absolute responsibility for any financial or other commitments that the Buyer may have to any of the Hired Employees, including any and all claims or obligations arising under any and all employment policies and procedures of the Buyer, under any employee benefit plan of the Buyer, or under any local, state, or federal law, rule, or regulation regarding termination of employment for any employment loss which occurs on or after the hiring of any Hired Employee by the Buyer. The Buyer shall be liable to each Hired Employee for all wages, severance benefits, unpaid vacation pay, unpaid sick and holiday pay, and other obligations of any kind whatsoever arising on and after the hiring of such Hired Employee by the Buyer. The Buyer is responsible for resolving any conflicts, errors or discrepancies with regard to a Hired Employee involving the Buyers employee policies and procedures with respect to the period of time on and after a Hired Employee is hired by the Buyer. 

  

 (c) Buyer shall extend service credit to each employee of Selling Entity with respect to the Business conducted at the Branches who is hired by Buyer on the Closing Date (each, a " _Hired Employee_ ") for the full period of time each such Hired Employee worked for Selling Entity before the Closing Date. Nevertheless, although Buyer will base paid vacation time due each Hired Employee upon the period of time the Hired Employee has worked both for the Selling Entity before the Closing Date and for Buyer on and after the Closing Date, each Hired Employee must work for Buyer for six (6) full months before the Hired Employee is eligible for any paid vacation (in accordance with Buyers normal vacation policy). 

  

 (d) Hired Employees shall be employed by Buyer solely in accordance with Buyers hiring and other employment policies and procedures, which may differ 

   ##### 

  

 

from Sellers employment policies and procedures. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer shall have sole and absolute responsibility for any
financial or other commitments that Buyer may have to any of the Hired
Employees, including any and all claims or obligations arising under any and
all employment policies and procedures of Buyer, under any employee benefit
plan of Buyer, or under any local, state, or federal law, rule, or regulation
regarding termination of employment for any employment loss which occurs on
or after the hiring of any Hired Employee by Buyer. Buyer shall be liable to
each Hired Employee for all wages, severance benefits, unpaid vacation pay,
unpaid sick and holiday pay, and other obligations of any kind whatsoever
that accrue with respect to periods after the hiring of such Hired Employee
by Buyer, and Selling Entity will pay to Hired Employees, as promptly after
the Closing as practicable, all wages, severance benefits, unpaid vacation
pay, unpaid sick and holiday pay, and other obligations of any kind
whatsoever that accrue with respect to periods before the hiring of such
Hired Employee by Buyer . Buyer is responsible for resolving any conflicts,
errors or discrepancies with regard to a Hired Employee involving Buyers
employee policies and procedures with respect to the period of time on and
after a Hired Employee is hired by Buyer. 

   

 (e) The Sellers and the Buyer each acknowledge and agree that no covered plant closing or mass layoff (as such terms are defined in the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. § 2101 _et. seq._ ) will occur with respect to the Branches up to and including the Closing Date, that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not result in a covered plant closing or mass layoff, and that the Buyer does not intend to implement any such covered plant closing or mass layoff with respect to the Branches after the Closing. 

  

 (f) The Sellers agree that they shall continue to perform, at the Sellers expense, any post-termination obligations to the terminated Employees and their eligible dependents, including, without limitation, continuation of health insurance coverage under any applicable group health plan(s) pursuant to COBRA and the administration of any COBRA benefits or provision of notices related thereto for COBRA-qualified beneficiaries who had a COBRA qualifying event before the Closing Date and those who elect COBRA benefits following their termination in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 4.4 _Operation of Businesses after Closing_. Buyer agrees that Buyer shall be solely responsible for, and Sellers shall have no responsibility for, the following liabilities relating to the Businesses as conducted by Buyer on and after the Closing Date, except to the extent that such liabilities constitute Retained Liabilities: (a) all United States federal, state and local income tax liabilities based on the income of Buyer as a result of the Buyers operation of the Businesses, Purchased Assets, and /or the Branches on and after the Closing Date; (b) all liabilities arising out of Buyers conduct of the Businesses on and after the Closing Date, including, without limitation, all trade payables first arising or accruing on and after the Closing Date, but excluding Retained Liabilities and any Liabilities attributable to the Excluded Assets; (c) liabilities and obligations under the Assumed Liabilities first arising or accruing on and after the Closing Date; and (d) all obligations for salary and benefits due to employees of Buyer, including, without limitation, any Hired Employees, first arising or accruing on and after the Closing Date for services provided on and after the Closing Date.

authority, subject to no interest or participation in, or agreement with any
other person or entity to sell or otherwise transfer such

   ##### 

  

 

Requirements of Law relating to the payment and withholding of Taxes
(including withholding Taxes pursuant to Sections 1441 and 1442 of the
Code). All monies that the Selling Entity is required by applicable

authority.

filing or appointment. 

   

 5.22 _Additional Employee Matters_. The information contained in _Section 4.3_ is true and complete in all material respects. Each Employees employment by the Sellers is "at-will." The Sellers have no obligation to pay any Employee any severance or similar payments. No Seller is a party to or bound by any collective bargaining agreement and no collective bargaining agreement covering the Sellers employees is currently being negotiated. To the Sellers Knowledge, there are no threatened or contemplated attempts to organize for collective bargaining purposes any of the Sellers employees. There is no, and since January 1, 2002, there has been no, work stoppage, strike, slowdown, picketing or other labor disturbance or controversy by or with respect to the Sellers employees or former employees. In addition, except as set forth on _Schedule 5.22_, no dispute with or claim against the Sellers relating to any labor or employment matter including employment practices, discrimination, terms and conditions of employment, or wages and hours is outstanding or, to the Sellers 

   #####

 (b) The only Benefit Plan sponsored or maintained by the Sellers that is subject to ERISA is CCS Financial Services, Inc. 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan. A true and complete copy of such Benefit Plan has been provided to the Buyer. Neither the Sellers nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever sponsored, maintained, contributed to or had any obligation to contribute to any Benefit Plan subject to Section 412 of the Code, or Title IV of ERISA, or intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code. No Employee is employed outside the United States, and no Benefit Plan is subject to the laws of any foreign jurisdiction. 

  

 (c) Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.23(c)(1)_, there are no current or former employees of the Selling Entity who are on leave of absence under either of the Uniformed Services Employment or Reemployment Rights Act or the Family Medical Leave Act. _Schedule 5.23(c)(2)_ reflects: (i) each individual who has elected or has a right to elect continuation coverage under any Employee Benefit Plan pursuant to COBRA (29 U.S.C. §§1161 to 1169), as amended; and (ii) the date and type of each such individuals qualifying event (as defined in 29 U.S.C. §1163). 

  

 (d) Excluding (i) death benefits or retirement benefits under any Employee Benefit Plan that is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and (ii) benefits, the full cost of which is borne by the current or former employee (or his beneficiary), no Employee Benefit Plan provides benefits, including death or medical benefits (whether or not insured), with respect to current or former employees after retirement or other termination of service. 

  

 5.24 _Accuracy and Completeness of Information_. All written information furnished to the Buyer by the Sellers that is set forth in this Agreement or in any schedule to this Agreement (" _Written Information_ ") is, and if furnished after the date of this 

   ##### 

  

 

Agreement, will be, true and correct in all material respects and does not,
and if furnished after the date of this Agreement, shall not, contain any
untrue statement of material fact or fail to state any material
fact necessary to make such Written Information, in the context and under the
circumstances in which it is made, not misleading. 

   

 5.25 _FIRTPA_. No Seller is a "foreign person," "foreign corporation" or "foreign partnership" within the meaning of Section 1445 of the Code and the regulations thereunder. 

  

 5.26 _Insurance_. Set forth in _Schedule 5.26_ is a complete and accurate list and description of all policies of fire, liability, product liability, workers compensation, health and other forms of insurance presently in effect with respect to the Businesses, the Purchased Assets and the Real Property (each a " _Policy_ " and collectively, the " _Policies_ "), true and correct copies of which have heretofore been delivered to the Buyer. _Schedule 5.26_ includes, without limitation, the carrier, the description of coverage, the limits of coverage, retention or deductible amounts, amount of annual premiums, date of expiration and the date through which premiums have been paid with respect to each such Policy, and any pending claims in excess of $50,000. All such Policies are valid, outstanding and enforceable policies and provide insurance coverage for the Real Property, the Purchased Assets and operations of the Selling Entity.  _Schedule 5.26_ indicates each Policy as to which (a) the coverage limit has been reached or (b) the total incurred losses to date equal 75% or more of the coverage limit. No notice of cancellation, termination or refusal to renew has been received with respect to any such Policy, and no Seller has knowledge of any act or omission of the Selling Entity which could reasonably be expected to result in cancellation of any such Policy prior to its scheduled expiration date. The Selling Entity has not been refused any insurance with respect to any aspect of the operations of the Businesses nor has its coverage been limited by any insurance carrier to which it has applied for insurance or with which it has carried insurance during the last three years. The Selling Entity has duly and timely made all claims it has been entitled to make under each Policy of insurance, except for claims that have otherwise been resolved or as to which the Selling Entity is making good faith commercially reasonable efforts to resolve. Since January 1, 2005, all products liability and general liability Policies maintained by or for the benefit of the Selling Entity have been "occurrence" Policies and not "claims made" Policies. There is no claim by the Selling Entity pending under any such Policies as to which coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed by the underwriters of such Policies, and no Seller knows of any basis for denial of any claim under any such Policy. No Seller has received any written notice from or on behalf of any insurance carrier issuing any such Policy that insurance rates therefor will hereafter be substantially increased (except to the extent that insurance rates may be increased for all similarly situated risks) or that there will hereafter be a cancellation or an increase in a deductible (or an increase in premiums in order to maintain an existing deductible) or nonrenewal of any such Policy. Such Policies are sufficient in all material respects for compliance by the Selling Entity with all Requirements of Law and with the requirements of all material Contracts to which the Selling Entity is a party.

 13.4 _Limitations_. The Sellers obligation to make indemnification payments to the Buyer Indemnified Parties, on the one hand, and the Buyers obligation to make indemnification payments to the Seller Indemnified Parties, on the other hand, shall not arise until the aggregate amount of all Indemnifiable Losses claimed by the Buyer Indemnified Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, exceeds Three Hundred Thousand $300,000 (the " _Threshold Amount_ "). Once the aggregate amount of Indemnifiable Losses claimed by the Buyer Indemnified Parties under _Section 13.2_, on the one hand, or by the Seller Indemnified Parties under  _Section 13.3_, on the other hand, exceeds the Threshold Amount, the Buyer Indemnified Parties and the Seller Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, shall then be entitled to recover all such Indemnifiable Losses, including those Indemnifiable Losses that were used to reach the Threshold Amount. Additionally, the total aggregate liability for the Sellers under  _Section 13.2(a)_ shall not exceed Thirty Three Million One Hundred Sixty Six Thousand Six Hundred Sixty Six Dollars ($33,166,666) (the " _Seller Cap_ "), and the total aggregate liability for the Buyer under _Section 13.3(a)_ shall not exceed the Seller Cap (the " _Buyer Cap_ "). The foregoing Threshold Amount, Seller Cap and Buyer Cap limitations shall not apply to, and the determination of whether such Threshold Amount, Seller Cap or Buyer Cap has been reached shall not include, any Indemnifiable Losses incurred by any Buyer Indemnified Party with respect to any of the Excepted Matters or any representation or warranty made by any Party in this Agreement or in any certificate, document or instrument delivered by such Party at the Closing with respect thereto made with actual fraud. 

  

 13.5 _Indemnification Procedures_. 

  

 13.5.1 _Notice of Claim_. Any Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party making a claim for indemnification pursuant this _Article 13_ (each an " _Indemnified Party_ ") must give the Party against whom indemnification is sought (each, an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") written notice of such claim (an " _Indemnification Claim Notice_ ") promptly after the Indemnified Party receives any written notice of any Legal Proceeding against or involving the Indemnified Party or otherwise discovers an Indemnifiable Loss giving rise to such claim for indemnification. In the case of all Buyer Indemnified Parties, the Indemnification Claim Notice shall be delivered to the Selling Entity, with a copy to Sellers counsel at the address set forth on the signature pages hereto. Such notice must contain a description of the Indemnifiable Loss and the nature and amount of such Indemnifiable Loss (to the extent that the nature and amount of such Indemnifiable Loss is known at such time). Notwithstanding anything herein or otherwise to the contrary, the failure of any Indemnified Party to provide an Indemnification Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party in connection with any claim for any Loss will not affect such Indemnified Partys rights to indemnification under this _Article 13_ except and to the extent that such failure is prejudicial to the rights or obligations of the of the Indemnifying Party hereunder, including the mitigation of damages therefor. If the Indemnifying Party objects to indemnification of any Indemnified Party with respect to any claim for any such Indemnifiable Loss, the Indemnifying Party must, within fifteen (15) days of receiving an Indemnification Claim Notice, deliver to each Indemnified Party, a written notice to such effect in reasonable detail (an " _Indemnification Claim Dispute Notice_ "), and the Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Party then shall, within the thirty (30)-day period commencing on the date of receipt by the Indemnifying Party of such Indemnification Claim Dispute Notice, attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective Parties with respect to each claim to which the Indemnifying Party has objected in the Indemnification Claim Dispute Notice. If the 

   ##### 

  

 

Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party succeed in reaching agreement on
their respective rights with respect to any such claims, then the Parties
shall promptly prepare and execute a memorandum setting forth such agreement.
If no such agreement is reached, each of the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party shall be free to pursue their own interests at their own
costs, subject to the determination of each Parties right to indemnification
hereunder;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in such instance any such
Indemnification Claim shall not be subject to _Sections 13.5.3_ or 13.8 of
this Agreement until such time as such Indemnification Claim is finally
resolved and mutually agreed upon by the Indemnified Party and
the Indemnifying Party. 

   

 13.5.2 _Control of Defense; Conditions_. The obligations of an Indemnifying Party under this _Article 13_ with respect to Indemnifiable Losses arising from claims of any third party shall be governed by and contingent upon the following additional terms and conditions: 

  

 (a) At its option an Indemnifying Party (or if the Indemnifying Party is the Sellers, the Selling Entity) shall be entitled to assume control of the defense of any claim and may appoint as lead counsel of such defense any legal counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party, which legal counsel shall be subject to the reasonable approval of the Indemnified Party. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding _Section 13.5.2(a)_ above, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to (i) monitor the defense of such claim, (ii) receive copies of all pleadings, notices and communications with respect to any claim to the extent that receipt of such documents by the Indemnified Party does not affect any privilege relating to the Indemnifying Parties, (iii) participate at its own expense in settlement negotiations with respect to such claim, and (iv) employ counsel of its choice for such purposes; _provided_ , _however_ , that so long as the Indemnifying Party is diligently pursuing the defense of such claim, the costs and expenses of such counsel shall be solely the responsibility of the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense and employ counsel (following written notice from the Indemnified Party), or after assuming the defense and employing counsel, fails to diligently defend such claim (following written notice from the Indemnified Party identifying such concern and a reasonable opportunity to cure), the Indemnified Party shall have the right to assume the defense of the claim and the fees and expenses of the Indemnified Partys counsel shall thereafter be part of the Indemnifiable Losses to be paid by the Indemnifying Party. 

  

 (c) The Indemnified Party shall not negotiate or consent to the entry of any judgment or negotiate or enter into any settlement with respect to any third party claim (including any settlement that would undermine the Indemnifying Partys defense of such matter or any related matter) without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be unreasonably, withheld, conditioned, or delayed), and the Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to any third party claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed) unless such judgment or settlement solely involves a monetary payment to be paid by the Indemnifying Party and contains an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party. 

   ##### 

  

  

 13.5.3 _Manner of Payment; Offset_. Any Buyer Indemnifiable Losses may be offset by the Buyer against any amounts payable by the Buyer under this Agreement or paid from the Escrow Account as provided in _Section 13.8_ and the Escrow Agreement. If any Indemnifiable Losses exceed the amounts available for offset or payable from the Escrow Account, then the amount of such excess to satisfy such indemnification obligations must be (and shall be) paid: (x) in the case of payments to the Buyer Indemnified Parties, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designed in writing by the Buyer within 15 days after the final determination thereof, and (y) in the case of payments to the Seller Indemnified Parties, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the Selling Entity within 15 days after the determination thereof. 

  

 13.6 _Reassignment of Deferred Presentment Agreements_. If the Sellers are required to make any indemnification payment to any Buyer Indemnified Party for any breach of any of the representations and warranties contained in any of _Sections 5.16(b)-5.16(n)_, inclusive, and the amount of any such indemnification payment actually paid to the Buyer Indemnified Party equals or exceeds the aggregate amount then due under the Deferred Presentment Agreement(s) with respect to which such indemnification payment is made, then the Buyer will reassign such Deferred Presentment Agreement(s), without recourse, to the Seller from whom the Buyer purchased such Deferred Presentment Agreement(s). 

  

 13.7 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. No insurance company or any other third party, except for the Buyer Indemnified Parties and the Seller Indemnified Parties, shall be a beneficiary of the Sellers or Buyers indemnification obligations under this Agreement and in no way shall any obligations of any insurance company or other third party be reduced or mitigated as a result of this Agreement. 

  

 13.8 _Escrow_. 

  

 (a) The Sellers and the Buyer agree that an amount equal to Six Million Dollars ($6,000,000.00) (the " _Escrow Amount_ ") shall be deducted from the Cash Consideration and placed in an escrow account (the " _Escrow Account_ "), to be administered by U.S. Bank (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The Buyer shall have the right to seek indemnification from the Sellers to be paid out of the Escrow Account for any Indemnifiable Losses upon the terms set forth in the Escrow Agreement. 

  

 (b) The Escrow Agent shall pay to the Buyer or the Sellers such amounts as are required by the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. Subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement and this _Section 13.8_, (i) on the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date, the Escrow Agent shall distribute to the Selling Entity an amount equal to Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000), _minus_ any amounts that are the subject of pending but unresolved Indemnification Claim Notices (the " _Pending Claim Amount_ "); and (ii) on the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date, the Escrow Agent shall distribute to the Selling Entity the remaining balance of the Escrow Amount, _minus_ the then-current Pending Claim Amount;  _provided_ , that upon final resolution of any Pending Claim Amount, the Escrow Amount shall be used to satisfy the claim(s) according to such final resolution, and the balance of the Pending Claim Amount, if any, after satisfaction of such claim(s), shall be paid to the Selling Entity.

 WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Escrow is to be administered in accordance with this Escrow Agreement; and

 _Schedule B_ 

   

Escrow Administration  

  

 I. _Purpose of Escrow_. The Escrow Amount will secure the general indemnification obligations of Sellers as set forth in Section 13 of the Purchase Agreement (the "Indemnification Obligations"). All interest earned on funds held in the Escrow Account will be for the benefit of the Selling Entity, provided that such interest will be held in the Escrow Account and will be available to satisfy any claims of Buyer until the date of final release of the Escrow Amount. Buyer and Selling Entity shall each pay one-half of the fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent. 

  

 II. _Release of Escrow Amount_. 

  

 (a) Upon delivery, at any time on or before the date which is two years following the Closing Date (the "Indemnification Escrow Period"), to the Escrow Agent and the Selling Entity, of a certificate signed by any officer of Buyer (an "Officers Certificate") (i) stating that a claim for indemnification by Selling Entity under Section 13.2 of the Purchase Agreement (an "Indemnification Escrow Claim") exists, and (ii) specifying in reasonable detail the amount of and basis for such Indemnification Escrow Claim, Escrow Agent shall, no later than the date that is fifteen (15) Business Days after Escrow Agents receipt of such Officers Certificate and subject to the provisions of this _Schedule B_ and provided such Indemnification Escrow Claim otherwise complies with the procedural requirements of Section 13 of the Purchase Agreement, cause to be disbursed to Buyer such portion of the Escrow Amount as is claimed by Buyer to satisfy the Indemnification Escrow Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, within ten (10) Business Days after delivery of any Officers Certificate (the "Notification Period"), the Selling Entity notifies Escrow Agent and Buyer in writing that the Selling Entity disputes any Indemnification Escrow Claim made by Buyer, the Escrow Agent shall retain the amount claimed by Buyer in the Escrow Account and Selling Entity and Buyer shall consult and negotiate in good faith with each other for up to thirty (30) days regarding their rights with respect to such Indemnification Escrow Claim. If Selling Entity and Buyer agree that a portion of the Escrow Amount shall be disbursed to Buyer on account of the Indemnification Escrow Claim set forth in such Officers Certificate, Buyer and the Selling Entity shall execute and deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute such agreed-upon amount to Buyer. If the Escrow Agent does not receive joint written instructions from Buyer and the Selling Entity within such thirty (30) day period, then no portion of the Escrow Amount will be distributed to Buyer with respect to an Indemnification Escrow Claim until (i) such time as Selling Entity and Buyer sign and deliver to Escrow Agent joint written instructions instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse all or a portion of the remaining Escrow Amount, or (ii) a final judgment on the matter is entered by a court of competent jurisdiction (after all appeals have been finally determined or the time for appeal has expired without an appeal having been made), in which case Escrow Agent shall retain or disburse the Indemnification Escrow Amount in accordance with such judgment. 

  

 (b) On the next Business Day immediately following the first anniversary of the Closing Date, the Escrow Agent shall deliver by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the Selling Entity Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) less all amounts (each, a "Disputed 

   ##### 

  

    

Amount" and, collectively, "Disputed Amounts") related to disputed,
unsatisfied or unresolved Indemnification Escrow Claims ("Disputed Claims")
on or before the first anniversary of the Closing Date. The Escrow Agent
shall only release a Disputed Amount in accordance with the Escrow
Agents receipt of (i) a court judgment or order which sets forth the
disposition of the Disputed Claims, or (ii) a joint written memorandum
prepared and signed by Buyer and Selling Entity in accordance with Section
(II)(a) above. For the avoidance of doubt, if no Officers Certificate is
delivered to the Escrow Agent in accordance with Section (II)(a) prior to the
first anniversary of the Closing Date, the Escrow Agent shall release the
entire $3 million (less any applicable deducted fees and expenses) to the
Selling Entity on the next Business Day immediately following the
first anniversary of the Closing Date. 

  

 (c) On the next Business Day immediately following the last day of the Indemnification Escrow Period, the Escrow Agent shall deliver by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the Selling Entity the Escrow Amount then on hand less all Disputed Amounts on or before the last day of the Indemnification Escrow Period. The Escrow Agent shall only release a Disputed Amount in accordance with the Escrow Agents receipt of (i) a court judgment or order which sets forth the disposition of the Disputed Claims, or (ii) a joint written memorandum prepared and signed by Buyer and Selling Entity in accordance with Section (II)(a) above. For the avoidance of doubt, if no Officers Certificate is delivered to the Escrow Agent in accordance with Section (II)(a) prior to the end of the Indemnification Escrow Period, the Escrow Agent shall release the entire remainder of the Escrow Amount and accumulated Escrow Earnings (less any applicable deducted fees and expenses) to the Selling Entity on the next Business Day immediately following the end of the Indemnification Escrow Period.

 _Form of Legal Opinion by Sellers  Counsel_ 

   

 We have acted as special counsel for CCS Financial Services Inc., a Florida corporation (the " _Selling Entity_ "), in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of, and sale of assets under, the Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of October ___, 2007 (the "Purchase Agreement"), by and among the Selling Entity, Allen Eager, The Allen Eager Revocable Trust, Paul P. Hauser, Barry E. Hershman and The Barry E. Hershman Revocable Trust (collectively, the " _Selling Shareholders_ "), and Check Mart of Florida, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Buyer_ "). We have not acted as counsel to the Selling Shareholders and as a condition to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, Buyer will receive a legal opinion in a form reasonably acceptable to Buyer from a law firm reasonably acceptable to Buyer opining on the capacity of the Selling Shareholders that are trusts to execute, deliver and perform all of their obligations under the Purchase Agreement and each of the Ancillary Agreements (as hereinafter defined). Accordingly we render no opinion with respect to such matters. This opinion is being rendered pursuant to Section 11.1(n) of the Purchase Agreement. Capitalized terms not defined in this letter have the meanings ascribed to them in the Purchase Agreement. 

  

 In the capacity described above, we have considered such matters of fact and law, including the examination of the original or copies, identified to our satisfaction, of (i) each of the Transaction Documents; (ii) the organizational documents of the Selling Entity including its certificate of incorporation or similar document and bylaws (the " _Governing Documents_ "); (iii) certificates executed by certain officers of the Selling Entity pursuant to the Purchase Agreement or otherwise; (iv) representations of the Sellers given pursuant to the Purchase Agreement; and (v) certificates of good standing relating to the Selling Entity. In addition, we have examined such other documents of or relating to the Sellers related to matters of law as we have deemed necessary in connection with this opinion. 

  

 In our examination, we have assumed with your permission and without independent verification of any kind, the genuineness of all signatures and the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of documents submitted to us as copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. We have further assumed (i) the due authorization, execution and delivery of each of such documents by, or on behalf of, all parties thereto (other than the Selling Entity), (ii) the legal capacity of all persons signing documents in their individual capacity and the legal capacity of the Selling Shareholders that are trusts to sign the Asset Purchase Agreement and Ancillary Agreements. Whenever in this opinion we refer to matters of which "we have knowledge," "we know" or "to our knowledge," such reference means facts within the actual knowledge of attorneys in this firm who have devoted substantial time to matters on behalf of the Selling Entity and no opinion is implied by, or to be inferred beyond, the matters expressly so stated.. 

  

 As to all questions of fact material to the opinions expressed herein, unless we have actual knowledge to the contrary, we have assumed, without independent investigation, the accuracy of the factual matters addressed by, and accordingly have relied conclusively upon, certificates or comparable documents of various public officials and a certificate of the officers and shareholders of the Selling Entity delivered to us, a copy of which will be attached to this 

   ##### 

  

    

opinion at the Closing (the " _Officer Certificate_ "). We have also assumed
and relied upon the correctness and completeness of all representations,
warranties and other matters contained in the Purchase Agreement, and the
schedules, documents, agreements and certificates to be delivered pursuant to
the Purchase Agreement except to the extent we have actual knowledge to the
contrary, and upon the compliance with the covenants contained in the Purchase
Agreement and such other documents, agreements and certificates. 

  

 We are lawyers admitted to practice in the State of Florida. We have not made an independent review of the laws of any state or jurisdiction other than the State of Florida and the United States of America. In rendering the opinions set forth herein, we express no opinions as to the effect of any laws other than the laws of the State of Florida and the federal laws of the United States of America. 

  

 Based on the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, and subject to the qualifications, limitations and exceptions stated herein, we are of the opinion that: 

  

 1. The Selling Entity is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and its status is active under the laws of the State of Florida. 

  

 2. The Purchase Agreement, the Bill of Sale, the Assignment and Assumption Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Supplemental Escrow Agreement (such agreements, other than the Purchase Agreement, hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Ancillary Agreements") each constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Sellers, enforceable against the Sellers in accordance with their respective terms, except as may be limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar laws affecting creditors rights generally, and (ii) equitable principles of general applicability and public policy.
