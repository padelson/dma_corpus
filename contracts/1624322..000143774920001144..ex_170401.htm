nearest whole cent) determined by multiplying (i) the Average Quoted Price by
(ii) the fraction of a share of BFST Common Stock which such holder would
otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.06, rounded to the
nearest one hundredth of a share.

  



  

   

  



  

Section 2.07 _Anti-Dilutive Adjustment_. If the number of shares of BFST
Common Stock or PBI Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective
Time shall be increased or decreased, or changed into or exchanged for a
different number of kind of shares or securities, in any such case as a result
of a stock split, reverse stock split, stock combination, stock dividend,
reclassification, or similar transaction, or there shall be any extraordinary
dividend or distribution with respect to such stock (aside from the AAA
Distribution), and the record date therefor shall be prior to the Effective
Time, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Merger
Consideration to give holders of PBI Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

  



  

Section 2.08 _Treatment of Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective
Time, each restricted stock unit award in respect of shares of PBI Common
Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " **PBI
RSU Award** ") shall be cancelled and converted automatically (without any
further action on part of the holder thereto) into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in respect of each share of PBI Common Stock underlying
such PBI RSU Award. Prior to the Effective Time, PBI shall take all necessary
action for the cancellation and conversion of the PBI RSU Awards under this
Section 2.08.

  



  

Section 2.09 _Dissenting Shares_. Holders of shares of PBI Common Stock
shall have such rights to dissent from the Merger and obtain payment of the
fair value of their shares as are afforded to such Person by Part 13 of the
LBCA. Each share of PBI Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time, the holder of which has properly perfected such
holder's rights of appraisal by following the exact procedure required by
under the LBCA, is referred to herein as a " **Dissenting Share**."
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each Dissenting
Share owned by each holder thereof who properly perfects such holder's
appraisal rights in connection with the Merger by following the exact
procedures required by the LBCA will be entitled to receive payment of the
fair value, as contemplated in the LBCA, paid in cash for such holder's shares
of PBI Common Stock in accordance with and to the extent required under the
applicable provisions of the LBCA in lieu of the Merger Consideration
described in Section 2.06; _provided, however_ , if any holder of any
Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose his appraisal rights
under the applicable provisions of the LBCA, each such Dissenting Share shall
cease to be a Dissenting Share and shall be deemed to have been converted into
and to have become exchangeable for, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration for each of such holder's Dissenting Shares without any interest
thereon in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.06. PBI will give BFST
(i) prompt written notice of any communications received from any shareholder
of PBI related to the exercise of, or indicating an intent to exercise
appraisal rights, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for fair value under the LBCA. PBI shall
not, except with the prior written consent of BFST, voluntarily make any
payment with respect to, or settle, or offer or agree to settle, any such
demand for payment. Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to
the Exchange Agent pursuant to this _Article II_ to pay for shares of PBI
Common Stock for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned
to BFST upon demand.

  



  

   

  



  

Section 2.10 _Rights as Shareholders; Stock Transfers_. At the Effective
Time, all shares of PBI Common Stock, when converted in accordance with
Section 2.06, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and, other than any then
unpaid dividend or distributions on PBI Common Stock having a record date
before the Effective Time, each Certificate evidencing such shares shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive for each such shares of PBI
Common Stock the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of BFST Common Stock as provided under Section 2.06. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of PBI will be closed, and there will be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of PBI of the shares of PBI Common Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

Section 2.11 _Exchange Procedures_.

  



  

A. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, BFST shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of the Certificates, evidence
of shares in book entry representing the number of shares of BFST Common Stock
sufficient to deliver the Merger Consideration (together with, to the extent
then determinable, any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 2.06D, and if applicable, cash in an aggregate amount sufficient to
make the appropriate payment to holders of Dissenting Shares) (collectively,
the " **Exchange Fund** "). As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
BFST will instruct the Exchange Agent, at the cost of BFST, to mail to each
record holder of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented one or more outstanding shares of PBI Common Stock (the "
**Certificate** ") a letter of transmittal that will (i) specify that delivery
will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificate(s) will pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificate(s) to the Exchange Agent, (ii) include
instructions for use in surrendering the Certificate(s) in exchange for the
Merger Consideration described in Section 2.06, and (iii) include such other
reasonable provisions as BFST may specify and which are consistent with the
terms of this Agreement. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to
the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent or BFST, the holder of such Certificate will be entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares
described in Section 2.06, with the portion of the Merger Consideration
consisting of shares of PBI Common Stock to be issued in book entry form. The
Exchange Agent will cancel or cause to be cancelled the Certificates
surrendered in accordance with this Section 2.11 and will deliver or cause to
be delivered the cancelled Certificates to BFST. The Exchange Agent and BFST,
as the case may be, shall not be obligated to deliver the Merger Consideration
to a holder to which such holder would otherwise be entitled as a result of
the Merger until such holder surrenders the Certificates representing the
shares of PBI Common Stock for exchange as provided in this _Article II_ , or
an appropriate affidavit of loss and indemnity agreement and/or a bond in such
amount as may be reasonably required in each case by BFST or the Exchange
Agent. All costs for services of Exchange Agent, as contemplated herein, shall
be paid by BFST.

  



  

B. BFST or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to
any holder such amounts as BFST is required to deduct and withhold under Legal
Requirements. Any amounts so deducted and withheld shall be remitted to the
appropriate Governmental Authority and upon such remittance shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by BFST or the
Exchange Agent, as applicable.

  



  

   

  



  

C. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of PBI for six (6) months after the Exchange Agent mails the
transmittal materials to such shareholders will be returned to the Surviving
Corporation upon demand, and holders of Certificate(s) who have not complied
with the exchange procedures described in this Section 2.11 will look only to
the Surviving Corporation, and not the Exchange Agent, for the payment of
their Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of BFST
Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor as described in
Section 2.06, and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is
entitled in respect of each share of PBI Common Stock such holder held
immediately prior to the Effective Time, as determined pursuant to this
Agreement, in each case without any interest thereon. If outstanding
Certificates for shares of PBI Common Stock are not surrendered or the payment
for them is not claimed prior to the date on which such shares of BFST Common
Stock or cash would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority, the unclaimed items shall, to the extent permitted by
the law of abandoned property and any other Legal Requirements, become the
property of BFST (and to the extent not in its possession shall be delivered
to it), free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled to such property. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
none of BFST, PBI, or any Exchange Agent will be liable to any former holder
of PBI Common Stock with respect to any amount delivered in good faith to a
public official in accordance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar laws. BFST and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon
the stock transfer books of PBI to establish the identity of those Persons
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration specified in this Agreement,
which books shall be conclusive with respect thereto. In the event of a
dispute with respect to ownership of any shares of PBI Common Stock
represented by any Certificate, BFST and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled
to tender to the custody of any court of competent jurisdiction any Merger
Consideration represented by such Certificate and file legal proceedings
interpleading all parties to such dispute, and will thereafter be relieved
with respect to any claims thereto.

  



  

Section 2.12 _Rights of Certificate Holders after the Effective Time_.

  



  

A. All shares of BFST Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger
shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and if ever a
dividend or other distribution is declared by BFST in respect of the BFST
Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time,
that declaration shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of
all shares of BFST Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No
dividends or other distributions in respect of the BFST Common Stock shall be
paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until such Certificate is
surrendered for exchange in accordance with this _Article II_. Subject to
Legal Requirements, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall
be issued and/or paid to the holder of the Certificates representing whole
shares of BFST Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i)
at the time of such surrender, the dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such
whole shares of BFST Common Stock and not paid and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to
such whole shares of BFST Common Stock with a record date after the Effective
Time but with a payment date subsequent to surrender.

  



  

   

  



  

B. In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate representing
PBI Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer records of PBI,
the proper amount of cash and/or shares of BFST Common Stock shall be paid or
issued in exchange therefor to a person other than the person in whose name
the Certificate so surrendered is registered if the Certificate formerly
representing such PBI Common Stock shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be
in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment or issuance
shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the
payment or issuance to a person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of BFST that the Tax has been
paid or is not applicable.

  



  

Section 2.13 _Tax Consequences_. The parties intend the Merger to
constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code
(and any comparable provision of state law), and the parties hereby adopt this
Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Section
1.368-2(g) of the Treasury Regulations.

  



  

Section 2.14 _Modification of Structure_. Notwithstanding any provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, BFST may elect, subject to the filing of
all necessary applications and the receipt of all required regulatory
approvals, to modify the structure of the transactions contemplated hereby so
long as (i) there are no material adverse federal income tax consequences to
the shareholders of PBI as a result of such modification, (ii) the
consideration to be paid to holders of PBI Common Stock under this Agreement
is not thereby changed in kind or reduced in amount solely because of such
modification and (iii) such modification will not be likely to materially
delay or jeopardize receipt of any required regulatory approvals. In the event
of such election, the parties agree to execute an appropriate amendment to
this Agreement in order to reflect such election.

Section 4.04 _BFST Financial Statements_.

  



  

A. BFST has furnished or made available to PBI true and complete copies of
its (i) Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, as
filed with the SEC, which contains BFST's audited consolidated balance sheets
as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the related statements of income,
comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for the years ended
December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (the " **BFST Annual Financial Statements**
") and (ii) Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for each of the quarters ended
March 31, 2019, June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2019, as filed with the SEC,
which contain BFST's unaudited consolidated balance sheets and related
statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash
flows as of and for the quarters and interim periods ended March 31, 2019,

Statements** " **).**

  



  

B. The BFST Annual Financial Statements and BFST Interim Financial
Statements have been prepared from the books and records of BFST and its
Subsidiaries and fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position, results of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows
of BFST at the dates and for the periods indicated in conformity with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated, except that
the BFST Interim Financial Statements (i) omit the footnote disclosure
required by GAAP and (ii) are subject to normal year-end audit adjustments
required by GAAP. The consolidated balance sheets as of future dates and the
related statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and
cash flows of BFST for the periods then ended, which may be filed by BFST with
the SEC subsequent to the date hereof, will be prepared from the books and
records of BFST and its Subsidiaries and will fairly present, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position, results of operations,
shareholders' equity and cash flows of BFST at the dates and for the periods
indicated in conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the
periods indicated, except that unaudited financial statements may (i) omit the

of BFST or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom). BFST (x) has implemented and maintains disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the
Exchange Act) designed to ensure that material information relating to BFST,
including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and
the chief financial officer of BFST by others within those entities as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and to
make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (y) has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation prior to the date hereof, to BFST's outside auditors and the audit
committee of the BFST Board (i) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act)
that are reasonably likely to adversely affect BFST's ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information, and (ii) to the Knowledge
of BFST, any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in BFST's internal controls over
financial reporting. To the Knowledge of BFST, there is no reason to believe
that BFST's outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief
financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations
required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

  



  

Section 4.05 _Compliance with Laws and Regulatory Filings_.

defalcation involving BFST, any BFST Subsidiary or any of their respective
officers, directors or Affiliates during the last two years.

  



  

B. Except as set forth in Section 4.05B of the Schedules, there is no
unresolved violation, criticism or exception by any Governmental Authority
with respect to any report relating to any examinations of BFST or any BFST
Subsidiary.

  



  

   

  



  

C. None of BFST or its Subsidiaries, or to the Knowledge of BFST, any
director, officer, employee, agent or other Person acting on behalf of BFST or

obligation of the obligor named in the contract evidencing such Loan subject

similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditor's
rights or by general equity principles.

more days delinquent in payment of principal or interest, or to BFST's
Knowledge, in default of any other material provision thereof, (ii) each Loan
that has been classified as "substandard", "doubtful", "loss" or "special

Governmental Entities and GAAP. Neither BFST nor BFST Bank has been notified

are inadequate or that the practices and policies of BFST in establishing its
reserves for the year ended December 31, 2019 and the nine (9) months ended

arrangement with (or otherwise obligated to) any Person which obligates BFST
or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase from any such Person any Loan or
other asset of BFST or any of its Subsidiaries, unless there is a material
breach of a representation or covenant by BFST or any of its Subsidiaries, and
none of the agreements pursuant to which BFST or any of its Subsidiaries has
sold Loans or pools of Loans or participations in Loans or pools of Loans
contains any obligation to repurchase such Loans or interests therein solely
on account of a payment default by the obligor on any such Loan.

  



  

Section 4.15 _Loan Portfolio and Reserve for Loan Losses_.

  



  

A. Except as would not reasonably be expected, either individually or in
the aggregate, to be material to BFST and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,

and currently exist in compliance in all material respects with all applicable
requirements of federal and state law and regulations promulgated thereunder,
(ii) are adequately documented, (iii) each note evidencing a Loan or credit
agreement or security instrument related to a Loan constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of the obligor thereunder, enforceable in accordance with
the terms thereof, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency or other laws affecting creditors' rights, and all
actions necessary to protect any related security interest have been duly
taken and (iv) are owned by BFST or its Subsidiaries free and clear of any
Liens other than a blanket lien on qualifying loans provided to the Federal
Home Loan Bank of Dallas.

practices in the banking industry the collectability of the Loan portfolio of
BFST or any of its Subsidiaries (including Loans that will be outstanding if
it advances funds it is obligated to advance). Other than participation loans
purchased by BFST or any Subsidiary from third parties that are described in
Section 4.15B of the Schedules, no Loans of BFST or any of its Subsidiaries
are presently serviced by third parties and there is no obligation which could
result in any such Loan becoming subject to third party servicing.

  



  

C. The allowance for loan losses shown on BFST Financial Statements as of
December 31, 2018 and of each quarter ended thereafter was calculated in
accordance with GAAP in all material respects as applied to banking
institutions, and in the reasonable opinion of management, adequate in all
respects to provide for all reasonably anticipated losses, net of recoveries
relating to loans previously charged off, on Loans outstanding (including
accrued interest receivable) of BFST or any of its Subsidiaries and other
extensions of credit (including letters of credit or commitments to make loans
or extend credit); _provided, however_ , that no representation or warranty is
made as to the sufficiency of collateral securing or the collectability of
such Loans.

shareholder approvals, to perform its obligations under this Agreement. PBI
has taken all requisite corporate action necessary to authorize the execution,
delivery and (provided the required regulatory and shareholder approvals are
obtained) performance of this Agreement and the other agreements and documents
contemplated by this Agreement to which it is a party. The PBI Board has
determined that the Merger, on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, is in the best interests of PBI and its shareholders and has
directed that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby be
submitted to PBI's shareholders for approval at a meeting of such shareholders
and has adopted a resolution to the foregoing effect. Except for the approval
of this Agreement by a vote in accordance with the LBCA and PBI's Constituent
Documents at the PBI Meeting (the " **Requisite PBI Vote** ") and the adoption

shareholder, no other corporate proceedings on the part of PBI are necessary
to approve this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
PBI. Assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by BFST, this
Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of PBI,
enforceable against PBI in accordance with its terms and conditions, except as
enforceability may be limited by the Bankruptcy Exception.

  



  

B. Subject to the receipt of any regulatory consents and approvals set
forth in Section 5.09 and the expiration of related waiting periods, and
neither the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, constitutes
or will constitute (i) a breach or violation of any provision of the
Constituent Documents of PBI or any PBI Subsidiary; (ii) a violation of any
Legal Requirement applicable to PBI, a PBI Subsidiary or any of their
respective properties or assets or require the consent or approval of any
Governmental Authority; or (iii) a breach or violation of, a conflict with,
the loss of any benefit under, a default (or an event which, with notice or
the lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default) under, an event of

performance required by or rights or obligations under, or an event resulting

PBI Subsidiary under or require the consent or approval of any Person (other
than any Governmental Authority) under, any loan or credit agreement, note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, lease or other agreement, instrument, permit,

business activities may be bound or affected. PBI has made available to BFST a
complete and correct copy of its charter and bylaws or equivalent
organizational documents, each as amended to date, of PBI and each of its
Subsidiaries, the minute books of PBI and each of its Subsidiaries, and the

list of all immovable property owned or leased by PBI or its Subsidiaries,

and leases for, or other documentation evidencing ownership of or a leasehold
interest in, PBI Real Property, title insurance policies for PBI Real Property
that is owned by PBI or its Subsidiaries, and all mortgages, deeds of trust

maintenance thereof, violates in any manner any restrictive covenants or
encroaches on any property owned by others, nor does any building or structure
of third parties encroach upon any PBI Real Property, except for those
violations and encroachments which in the aggregate could not reasonably be
expected to cause a Material Adverse Change on PBI. No condemnation, eminent
domain or other Proceeding is pending or, to PBI's Knowledge, threatened,
which could reasonably be expected to preclude or materially impair the use of
any PBI Real Property in the manner in which it is currently being used.

  



  

D. Except as set forth in Section 5.10A of the Schedules, PBI or one of
its Subsidiaries has good and indefeasible title to, or a valid and
enforceable leasehold interest in, all PBI Real Property, and such interest is
free and clear of all liens, including Tax liens, charges, imperfections of
title or other encumbrances, except (i) statutory liens for amounts not yet
delinquent or which are being contested in good faith through proper
proceedings and for which adequate reserves have been provided in the PBI
Financial Statements and (ii) easements, covenants, restrictions and other
matters of record which do not, individually or in the aggregate, materially
adversely affect the use and enjoyment of the relevant immovable property.

  



  

   

  



  

E. All buildings and other facilities used in the business of PBI and its
Subsidiaries are in adequate condition (ordinary wear and tear excepted) and
are free from defects which could reasonably be expected to materially
interfere with the current or future use of such facilities consistent with
past practices.

  



  

Section 5.11 _Personal Property_. Except as set forth in Section 5.11 of
the Schedules, each of PBI and its Subsidiaries has good title to, or a valid
leasehold interest in, all movable property, whether corporeal or incorporeal,
used in the conduct of its business (the " **PBI Personal Property** "), free
and clear of all liens, charges, imperfections of title or other encumbrances
and except (i) statutory liens for amounts not yet delinquent or which are
being contested in good faith through proper proceedings and for which
adequate reserves have been provided in the PBI Financial Statements and (ii)
such other liens, charges imperfections of title and encumbrances as do not
individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect the use and
enjoyment of the relevant PBI Personal Property. Subject to ordinary wear and
tear, the PBI Personal Property, taken as a whole, is in good operating
condition and repair and is adequate for the uses to which it is being put.

  



  

Section 5.12 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since December 31,
2018, PBI has conducted its business only in the ordinary course and has not,

by PBI or any Subsidiary and any affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary
group of which either PBI or any Subsidiary is or was a member (whether or not

currently the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any
Tax Return. No claim has ever been raised in writing by an authority in a
jurisdiction where PBI or any Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns that PBI or
any Subsidiary is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. There

Subsidiary is contesting in good faith through appropriate proceedings, if
any, and for which adequate reserves have been established on the most recent

the appropriate Governmental Authority all Taxes required to have been
collected or withheld in connection with amounts paid or owing to any
employee, independent contractor, creditor, shareholder, or other third party.

  



  

C. There is no action, suit, proceeding, audit, assessment, dispute or
claim concerning any Tax liability of PBI or any Subsidiary either (i) claimed
or raised by any authority in writing or (ii) as to which PBI or any
Subsidiary has Knowledge based upon contact with any agent of such authority.
Section 5.14C of the Schedules lists all federal, state, local, and foreign
income Tax Returns filed with respect to PBI or any Subsidiary for any taxable
period that is still open under the applicable statute of limitations,
indicates those Tax Returns that have been audited, and indicates those Tax

BFST correct and complete copies of all federal income Tax Returns,
examination reports, and statements of deficiencies assessed against or agreed
to by PBI and its Subsidiaries with respect to all taxable periods that are
still open under the applicable statute of limitations.

  



  

   

  



  

D. Neither PBI nor any of its Subsidiaries has waived any statute of
limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with
respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency.

Neither PBI nor any of its Subsidiaries has participated in a reportable or
listed transaction as defined under Sections 6011 and 6111 of the Code and

Tax allocation or sharing agreement, (ii) has been a member of an Affiliated
Group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return (other than the

for the Taxes of any Person (other than PBI and its Subsidiaries) under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state,
local, or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by contract, or
otherwise.

  



  

F. Neither PBI nor any of its Subsidiaries has been required to disclose
on its federal income Tax Returns any position that could give rise to a
substantial understatement of federal income tax within the meaning of Section
6662 of the Code.

  



  

G. Neither PBI, any of its Subsidiaries nor BFST will be required to
include any item of income in, nor will PBI, any of its Subsidiaries or BFST
be required to exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income for any
taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or after the Closing Date as a
result of any: (i) change in method of accounting for a taxable period ending
on or prior to the Closing Date under Section 481 of the Code (or any
corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax law);
(ii) "closing agreement" as described in Section 7121 of the Code (or any
corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax law)
executed on or prior to the Closing Date; (iii) intercompany transaction or
excess loss account described in the Treasury Regulations under Section 1502
of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law); (iv) installment sale or open transaction disposition made
on or prior to the Closing Date; or (v) prepaid amount received on or prior to
the Closing Date.

  



  

H. Neither PBI nor any of its Subsidiaries has constituted either a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning
of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock under Section
355 of the Code (i) in the two years prior to the date of this Agreement or
(ii) in a distribution which could otherwise constitute part of a "plan" or
"series of related transactions" (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the
Code) in conjunction with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

   

  



  

I. The unpaid Taxes of PBI and its Subsidiaries (i) did not, as of
December 31, 2018, exceed the current liability accruals for Tax liability
(excluding any reserves for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing
differences between book and Tax income) set forth in PBI Financial Statements
and (ii) do not exceed such current liability accruals for Taxes (excluding
reserves any for deferred Taxes) as adjusted for the passage of time through
the Closing Date in accordance with the past custom and practice of PBI and
its Subsidiaries in filing its Tax Returns.

  



  

J. PBI made an election to be treated as an S corporation under Subchapter
S of the Code effective June 30, 2000 (the " **S Election Date** ") and PBI
has continued to qualify as an S corporation since such election for all
periods up to and including the Closing Date. Effective as of the S Election
Date, Pedestal Bank made a valid election to be taxed as a qualified
subchapter S subsidiary (within the meaning of Section 1361(b)(3)(B) of the
Code) for federal income tax purposes and such election has at all times since
the S Election Date remained validly in effect and will remain validly in
effect for all periods up to the Closing Date. Neither PBI nor Pedestal Bank
has, in the past 5 years (i) acquired assets from another corporation in a
transaction in which PBI or Pedestal Bank's tax basis for the acquired assets
was determined, in whole or in part, by reference to the Tax basis of the
acquired assets (or any other property) in the hands of the transferor or (ii)
acquired the stock of any corporation that is a qualified subchapter S
subsidiary. PBI and Pedestal Bank are not currently and will not at any time
before the Closing Date be liable for any Tax under Section 1374 of the Code.

  



  

K. To PBI's Knowledge, for any tax year of PBI beginning on or after the S
Election Date, each PBI shareholder's treatment of Subchapter S items with
respect to PBI is consistent with the manner in which PBI has filed its Tax
Returns, and no audit by the IRS of any PBI shareholder has occurred.

  



  

L. Since the S Election Date, PBI has not been required to include in
income any material adjustment pursuant to Code §481 by reason of a voluntary
change in accounting method initiated by PBI, and the IRS has not initiated or
proposed any such material adjustment or change in accounting method
(including any method for determining reserves for bad debts maintained by
PBI). No dividend or other distribution declared or paid by PBI since the S
Election Date has exceeded the portion of PBI's "accumulated adjustments
account" (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1368-2) properly
allocated to such distribution in accordance with that regulation, and no
dividend or distribution declared or paid by PBI before the Effective Time
will exceed the portion of PBI's accumulated adjustments account properly
allocated to such distribution in accordance with that regulation.

  



  

M. PBI has not been subject to any disallowance of interest expense under
Section 291(a)(3) of the Code (or any similar provision of state, local, or
foreign Tax law) since the S Election Date.

  



  

Section 5.15 _Insurance_. A true, correct and complete list of all
fidelity bonds and insurance policies (including any bank owned life insurance
(" **BOLI** ")) owned or held by or on behalf of either PBI or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than credit-life policies), including the insurer, policy
numbers, amount of coverage, deductions, type of insurance, effective and
termination dates and any material pending claims thereunder is set forth in
Section 5.15 of the Schedules. All policies of general liability, theft, life,
fire, workers' compensation, health, directors and officers, business
interruption and other forms of insurance owned or held by PBI or any

compliance with all Legal Requirements and all agreements to which PBI or such
Subsidiary is a party; (iii) are usual and customary as to amount and scope
for the business conducted by PBI and its Subsidiaries in respect of amounts,
types and risks insured; (iv) are valid, outstanding and enforceable policies
(except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium,
reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and
the availability of equitable remedies); and (v) will remain in full force and
effect through the Effective Time, subject to normal renewal policies and
procedures, including the payment of premiums. The value of any BOLI is and
has been fairly and accurately reflected in the most recent balance sheet
included in the PBI Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP. All BOLI is
owned solely by Pedestal Bank, no other Person has any ownership claims with
respect to such BOLI or proceeds of insurance derived therefrom and there is
no split dollar or similar benefit under such BOLI. No insurer under any such
policy or bond has canceled or indicated to PBI or any of its Subsidiaries an
intention to cancel or not to renew any such policy or bond effective at any
time prior to the Effective Time or generally disclaimed liability thereunder.
Neither PBI nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default under any such policy or
bond, and all material claims thereunder have been filed. Neither PBI nor any
of its Subsidiaries has been denied or had revoked or rescinded any policy of
insurance since December 31, 2013.

has not been any Material Adverse Change with respect to PBI, nor has any
event or condition occurred that has resulted in, or, to the Knowledge of PBI,
has a reasonable possibility of resulting in the foreseeable future in a
Material Adverse Change.

  



  

Section 5.17 _Proprietary Rights_.

  



  

A. Section 5.17A of the Schedules contains a true, correct and complete
list of all registered trademarks, registered service marks, trademark and
service mark applications, trade names and registered copyrights (the " **PBI
Intellectual Property** ") presently owned or held by PBI or any Subsidiary or
used in a material manner by them in the conduct of their business under
license pursuant to a material contract. PBI and its Subsidiaries own or have
the right to use and continue to use the PBI Intellectual Property in the
operation of their business. Neither PBI nor any Subsidiary is, to PBI's
Knowledge, infringing or violating any patent, copyright, trademark, service
mark, label filing or trade name owned or otherwise held by any other party,
nor has PBI or any Subsidiary used any confidential information or any trade
secrets owned or otherwise held by any other party, without holding a valid
license for such use.

  



  

B. Neither PBI nor any Subsidiary is engaging, nor has any been charged
with engaging, in any kind of unfair or unlawful competition. Neither the
execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or the related documents
nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby will
in any way impair the right of PBI or any Subsidiary or the Surviving
Corporation to use, sell, license or dispose of, or to bring any action for
the infringement of, the PBI Intellectual Property.

and Pedestal Bank (a) of record, except those held in bearer form, and (b)
beneficially, free and clear of all mortgages, liens, pledges and
encumbrances. Section 5.18 of the Schedules also discloses any Person in which
the ownership interest of PBI, whether held directly or indirectly, equals 5%
or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities of the issuer thereof.
To PBI's Knowledge, there are no voting trusts or other agreements or
understandings with respect to the voting of any of such securities.

or Pedestal Bank.

  



  

B. Section 5.19B of the Schedules contains the "watch list" of loans of
Pedestal Bank as of March 31, 2019, June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2019. To
the Knowledge of PBI, there is no other Loan, loan agreement, note or

PBI's or Pedestal Bank's ordinary course of business and safe and sound
banking principles.

its Subsidiaries that as of September 30, 2019 was classified as OREO and the

arrangement with (or otherwise obligated to) any Person which obligates PBI or
any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase from any such Person any Loan or other
asset of PBI or any of its Subsidiaries, unless there is a material breach of
a representation or covenant by PBI or any of its Subsidiaries, and none of
the agreements pursuant to which PBI or any of its Subsidiaries has sold Loans
or pools of Loans or participations in Loans or pools of Loans contains any
obligation to repurchase such Loans or interests therein solely on account of
a payment default by the obligor on any such Loan.

  



  

   

  



  

Section 5.20 _Loan Portfolio and Reserve for Loan Losses_.

  



  

A. All Loans of PBI or any of its Subsidiaries, were solicited, originated
and currently exist in compliance in all material respects with all applicable
requirements of federal and state law and regulations promulgated thereunder.
The Loans are adequately documented, and each note evidencing a Loan or credit
agreement or security instrument related to a Loan constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of the obligor thereunder, enforceable in accordance with
the terms thereof, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency or other laws affecting creditors' rights, and all
actions necessary to protect any related security interest have been duly
taken. Neither PBI nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any oral
modifications or amendments or additional agreements related to the Loans that
are not reflected in its records. All Loans are owned by PBI or its
Subsidiaries free and clear of any Liens other than a blanket lien on
qualifying loans provided to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas. Except as
set forth in Section 5.20A of the Schedules, there is no valid claim or
defense to the enforcement of any Loan and none has been asserted, and PBI has
no Knowledge of any acts or omissions that would give rise to any claim or
right of rescission, set off, counterclaim or defense.

PBI or any of its Subsidiaries (including Loans that will be outstanding if it
advances funds it is obligated to advance). Other than participation loans
purchased by PBI or any Subsidiary from third parties that are described in
Section 5.20B of the Schedules, no Loans of PBI or any of its Subsidiaries are
presently serviced by third parties and there is no obligation which could
result in any such Loan becoming subject to third party servicing.

  



  

C. The allowance for loan losses shown on PBI Financial Statements as of
December 31, 2018 was, and the allowance for loan losses to be shown on any
financial statements of PBI or Pedestal Bank, or Consolidated Reports of
Condition and Income of Pedestal Bank, as of any date subsequent to the
execution of this Agreement will be, calculated in accordance with GAAP in all
material respects as applied to banking institutions and all applicable rules
and regulations, and in the reasonable opinion of management, adequate in all
respects to provide for all possible losses, net of recoveries relating to
loans previously charged off, on Loans outstanding (including accrued interest
receivable) of PBI or any of its Subsidiaries and other extensions of credit
(including letters of credit or commitments to make loans or extend credit);
_provided, however_ , that no representation or warranty is made as to the
sufficiency of collateral securing or the collectability of such Loans.

organizational efforts or other pending actions by, Representatives of its
respective employees. PBI and its Subsidiaries have complied with all Legal
Requirements relating to the employment of labor with respect to their
respective employees, and any independent contractors it has hired, including
any provisions thereof relating to wages, hours, workplace discrimination,
collective bargaining and the payment of workman's compensation insurance and

Subsidiary that PBI or any Subsidiary is liable for any arrearages of wages,
workman's compensation insurance premiums or any taxes or penalties for
failure to comply with any of the foregoing. To PBI's Knowledge, no officer of
PBI or any of its Subsidiaries is in material violation of any employment
contract, confidentiality, non-competition agreement, or any other restrictive
covenant. Except as set forth in Section 5.21 of the Schedules, to the
Knowledge of PBI, no key executive officer or manager of PBI or Pedestal Bank

relating to it that would materially impede or delay receipt of any Requisite
Regulatory Approvals, the Merger, or the other transactions contemplated by

the parties will not be able to obtain all Requisite Regulatory Approvals or
why any Burdensome Condition would be imposed.

Multiemployer Plan. Neither PBI nor any ERISA Affiliate has, at any time
contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan, and
neither PBI, nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any withdrawal liability
under Part I of Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA and there are no circumstances
known to PBI under which either PBI or any ERISA Affiliate could incur any

E. Except as set forth in Section 5.28E of the Schedules, the consummation

parachute payments, non-competition payments, unemployment compensation or any
other payment from PBI or any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) accelerate the time
of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due any such
employee. There is no contract, agreement, plan or other arrangement covering
any service provider or former service provider of PBI or any of its
Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, could give rise to the

deductible pursuant to the terms of Section 162(m) or Section 280G of the
Code. Neither PBI nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation to gross-up,

§409A, and no amounts under any such plan, agreement or arrangement is or has
been subject to the interest or additional Tax set forth under Code
§409A(a)(1)(B). No PBI Employee Plan that would be a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan subject to Code §409A but for the effective date provisions
that are applicable to §409A, has been "materially modified" within the

A. Each of BFST and PBI shall call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its shareholders (the " **BFST Meeting** " and the " **PBI
Meeting** ," respectively) as soon as reasonably practicable after the S-4
Registration Statement is declared effective for the purpose of obtaining the
Requisite BFST Vote and the Requisite PBI Vote required in connection with
this Agreement and the Merger and, if so desired and mutually agreed, upon
other matters of the type customarily brought before an annual or special
meeting of shareholders to approve a merger agreement or the issuance of
shares contemplated thereby (as applicable). The Boards of Directors of each
of BFST and PBI shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from
the shareholders of BFST and PBI, as the case may be, the Requisite BFST Vote,
in the case of BFST, and the Requisite PBI Vote, in the case of PBI, including
by communicating to its respective shareholders its recommendation (and
including such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus) that
they approve the BFST Stock Issuance and/or this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (as applicable). BFST or PBI shall adjourn or
postpone the BFST Meeting or the PBI Meeting, as the case may be, if, as of
the time for which such meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient
shares of BFST Common Stock or the PBI Common Stock, as the case may be,
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of such meeting, or if on the date of such meeting BFST
or PBI as applicable, has not received proxies representing a sufficient
number of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite BFST Vote or the Requisite
PBI Vote. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, each of the BFST
Meeting and PBI Meeting shall be convened, the BFST Stock Issuance and this
Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of BFST, and this Agreement
shall be submitted to the shareholders of PBI, at the BFST Meeting and PBI
Meeting, respectively, for the purpose of voting on the approval of such
proposals and the other matters contemplated hereby, and nothing contained
herein shall be deemed to relieve either BFST or PBI of such obligation. BFST
and PBI shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate to hold
the BFST Meeting and PBI Meeting on the same day and at the same time as soon
as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, and to set the
same record date for each such meeting.

  



  

   

  



  

B. Except to the extent provided otherwise in Section 7.10, the PBI Board
shall at all times prior to and during the PBI Meeting recommend approval of
this Agreement by the shareholders of PBI and the transactions contemplated
hereby (including the Merger) and any other matters required to be approved by
PBI's shareholders for consummation of the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby (the "PBI Recommendation"). In the event that there is
present at the PBI Meeting, in person or by proxy, sufficient favorable voting
power to secure the Requisite PBI Vote, PBI will not adjourn or postpone the
PBI Meeting unless PBI is advised by counsel that failure to do so would
result in a breach of the fiduciary duties of the PBI Board. PBI shall keep
BFST updated with respect to the proxy solicitation results in connection with
the PBI Meeting as reasonably requested by BFST.

  



  

C. The BFST Board shall at all times prior to and during the BFST Meeting
recommend approval of the BFST Stock Issuance and this Agreement by the
shareholders of BFST and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the
Merger) and any other matters required to be approved by BFST's shareholders
for consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. In
the event that there is present at the BFST Meeting, in person or by proxy,
sufficient favorable voting power to secure the Requisite BFST Vote, BFST will
not adjourn or postpone the BFST Meeting. BFST shall keep PBI updated with
respect to the proxy solicitation results in connection with the BFST Meeting

Section 7.06 _Consents and Approvals_.

  



  

A. BFST will use commercially reasonable efforts, and PBI will reasonably
cooperate with BFST at the BFST's request, to obtain all consents, approvals,
authorizations, waivers or similar affirmations described in Section 4.07 of
the Schedules.

  



  

B. PBI will use commercially reasonable efforts, and BFST will reasonably
cooperate with PBI at PBI's request, to obtain all consents, approvals,
authorizations, waivers or similar affirmations described in Section 5.09 of
the Schedules.

  



  

   

  



  

Section 7.07 _Public Disclosure_. No Party will issue any press release
or other public disclosure of the existence, terms, conditions or status of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without
first consulting with the other Party, nor will any Party issue any such
communication or make such public statement without the consent of the other
Party, which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, a Party may, without the prior consent of the other Party (but
after prior consultation, to the extent practicable under the circumstances),
issue such communication or make such public statement as may be required by
any Legal Requirement or the rules and regulations of any national stock
exchanges. It is understood that BFST shall assume primary responsibility for
the preparation of joint press releases and investor presentation relating to
this Agreement, the Merger, and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

Section 7.08 _Access; Information_.

  



  

A. Except as prohibited by any Legal Requirement, for the purpose of
verifying the representations and warranties of the other and preparing for
the Merger and the other matters contemplated by this Agreement, upon
reasonable notice from the other Party, each Party will (and will cause each
of its Subsidiaries to): (i) afford the other Party and its employees,
officers and authorized Representatives (including legal counsel, accountants
and consultants) full access to its properties, books and records (and those
of its Subsidiaries) during normal business hours so that such other Party may
have the opportunity to make such reasonable investigation as it will desire
to make of the affairs of such Party and its Subsidiaries, and (ii) furnish
such other Party with such additional financial and operating data and other
information as to its business and properties as such other Party may, from
time to time, reasonably request. Neither Party nor any of its Subsidiaries
will be required to afford access to or disclose information that would
jeopardize attorney-client privilege (after giving due consideration to the
existence of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement between
the parties), contravene any binding arrangement with any third party or
violate any Legal Requirement. The parties will make appropriate substitute
arrangements in circumstances where the previous sentence applies.

  



  

B. No access or investigation by a Party of the business and affairs of
the other Party under this Section 7.08 or otherwise will affect or be deemed
to modify or waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of such
other Party in this Agreement or any Schedule delivered in accordance with
this Agreement, the conditions to the Party's obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or any remedies available to the
Party under this Agreement.

  



  

C. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7.08, neither
Party shall be required to copy the other Party on any documents that disclose
confidential discussions of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, that contain competitively sensitive business or other proprietary
information filed under a claim of confidentiality (including any confidential
supervisory information) or any other matter that the board of such Party has
been advised by counsel that such distribution to the other Party may violate
a confidentiality obligation or fiduciary duty or any Legal Requirement, or
may result in a waiver of its attorney-client privilege. In the event any of
the restrictions in this Section 7.08C shall apply, such Party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to provide appropriate consents, waivers,
decrees, and approvals necessary to satisfy any confidentiality issues
relating to documents prepared or held by third parties (including work
papers), the parties will make appropriate alternate disclosure arrangements,
including adopting additional specific procedures to protect the
confidentiality of sensitive material and to ensure compliance with Legal
Requirement.

  



  

   

  



  

Section 7.09 _Confidentiality_. Prior to the execution of this Agreement
and prior to the consummation of the Merger, subject to Legal Requirements,
each of BFST and PBI, and their respective Subsidiaries, affiliates, officers,
directors, agents, employees, consultants, and advisors have provided, and
will continue to provide one another with information which may be deemed by
the party providing the information to be non-public, proprietary and/or
confidential, including, but not limited to, trade secrets of the disclosing
party. Each Party agrees that it will, and will cause its Representatives to,
hold any information obtained pursuant to this Section 7.09 in accordance with
the terms of that certain letter agreement, dated as of October 17, 2019 by
and between BFST and PBI.

  



  

Section 7.10 _No Solicitation by PBI; Superior Proposals_.

  



  

A. Except as permitted by Section 7.10B, PBI shall not, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries and Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
initiate, solicit, induce, or knowingly encourage, or take any action to
facilitate the making of, any inquiry, offer or proposal which constitutes, or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (ii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition
Proposal or furnish, or otherwise afford access, to any Person (other than
BFST) any information or data with respect to PBI or any of its Subsidiaries
or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal; (iii) release any Person
from, waive any provisions of, or fail to enforce any confidentiality
agreement or standstill agreement to which PBI is a party; or (iv) enter into
any agreement, confidentiality agreement, agreement in principle or letter of
intent with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or approve or resolve to
approve any Acquisition Proposal or any agreement, agreement in principle, or
letter of intent relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Any violation of the
foregoing restrictions by any of the PBI Representatives, whether or not such
PBI Representative is so authorized and whether or not such PBI Representative
is purporting to act on behalf of PBI or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a
breach of this Agreement by PBI. PBI and its Subsidiaries shall, and shall
cause each of the PBI Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any and all existing discussions, negotiations, and communications
with any Persons with respect to any existing or potential Acquisition
Proposal.

  



  

For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean, other than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any offer, proposal or
inquiry relating to, or any third party indication of interest in, (i) any
acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of 20% or more of the
consolidated assets of PBI and its Subsidiaries or 20% or more of any class of
equity or voting securities of PBI or its Subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute 20% or more of the consolidated
assets of PBI, (ii) any tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or
exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in such third party
beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of
PBI or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate,
constitute 20% or more of the consolidated assets of PBI, or (iii) any merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, reorganization,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction
involving PBI or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute 20% or more of the consolidated assets of PBI.

  



  

   

  



  

For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" shall mean a bona fide,
written Acquisition Proposal that the PBI Board concludes in good faith to be
more favorable to its shareholders than the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, (i) after receiving the advice of its financial advisors,
(ii) after taking into account the likelihood of and timing for consummation
of such transaction on the terms set forth therein and (iii) after taking into
account all legal (with the advice of outside counsel), financial (including
the financing terms of any such proposal), regulatory and other aspects of
such proposal (including any expense reimbursement provisions and conditions
to closing) and any other relevant factors permitted under applicable Legal
Requirements; _provided_ , that for purposes of the definition of "Superior
Proposal," the references to "20%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal
shall be deemed to be references to "50%."

  



  

B. Notwithstanding Section 7.10A or any other provision of this Agreement,
prior to receipt of the Requisite PBI Vote, PBI may take any of the actions
described in Section 7.10A if, but only if, (i) PBI has received a bona fide,
written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of Section
7.10A; (ii) the PBI Board reasonably determines in good faith, after
consultation with and having considered the advice of its outside financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, that (A) such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) the
failure to take such actions more likely than not would cause it to violate
its fiduciary duties to PBI's shareholders under Legal Requirements; (iii) PBI
has provided BFST with at least three Business Days' prior notice of such
determination; and (iv) prior to furnishing or affording access to any
information or data with respect to PBI or any of its Subsidiaries or
otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal, PBI receives from such Person a
confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to PBI than those
contained in the confidentiality agreement with BFST. PBI shall promptly
provide to BFST any non-public information regarding PBI or its Subsidiaries
provided to any other Person which was not previously provided to BFST, such
additional information to be provided no later than the date of provision of
such information to such other party.

  



  

C. PBI shall promptly (and in any event within one Business Day) notify
BFST in writing if any proposals or offers are received by, any information is
requested from, or any negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated
or continued with, PBI or the PBI Representatives, in each case in connection
with or related to any Acquisition Proposal, and such notice shall indicate
the name of the Person initiating such discussions or negotiations or making
such proposal, offer, or information request and the material terms and
conditions of any proposals or offers (and, in the case of written materials
relating to such proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or
discussion, providing copies of such materials (including e-mails or other
electronic communications)). PBI agrees that it shall keep BFST informed, on a
reasonably current basis, of the status and terms of any such proposal, offer,
information request, negotiations, or discussions (including any amendments or
modifications to such proposal, offer, or request).

  



  

   

  



  

D. Except as provided in Section 7.10E, neither the PBI Board nor the
board of directors of any Subsidiary of PBI nor any committee of the PBI Board
or its Subsidiaries shall (i) fail to make or withdraw (or modify or qualify
in any manner adverse to BFST or publicly propose to withdraw, modify, or
qualify in any manner adverse to BFST) the PBI Recommendation, or the
determination of the advisability to its shareholders of the approval of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, (ii)
adopt, approve, or publicly recommend, endorse or otherwise declare advisable
any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) fail to include the PBI Recommendation in
whole or in part in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any filing or
amendment or supplement relating thereto, (iv) fail to recommend against any
then-pending tender or exchange offer that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal
within five Business Days after it is announced, (v) fail to reaffirm the PBI
Recommendation within three Business Days following a request by BFST, or make
any statement, filing or release, in connection with the PBI Meeting or
otherwise, inconsistent with the PBI Recommendation, or (vi) resolve to do any
of the foregoing. Each such action set forth in this Section 7.10D shall be
referred to herein as an " **Adverse Recommendation Action**."

  



  

E. Notwithstanding Section 7.10D or any other provision in this Agreement
to the contrary, prior to the receipt of the Requisite PBI Vote, the PBI Board
may withdraw, qualify, amend or modify the PBI Recommendation (a "PBI
Subsequent Determination") or cause or permit PBI to terminate this Agreement
to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal in
accordance with the terms of Section 9.01G after the fifth Business Day
following BFST's receipt of a notice (the "Notice of Superior Proposal") from
PBI advising BFST that the PBI Board has decided (in good faith after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor) that a bona
fide, written Acquisition Proposal that it received (that did not result from
a breach of Section 7.10A) constitutes a Superior Proposal if, but only if,
(i) the PBI Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with and
having considered the advice of outside legal counsel and its financial
advisor, that the failure to take such actions more likely than not would
cause it to violate its fiduciary duties to PBI's shareholders under Legal
Requirements, (ii) during the five Business Day period after receipt of the
Notice of Superior Proposal by BFST (the "Notice Period"), the PBI Board shall
have cooperated and negotiated in good faith with BFST to make such
adjustments, modifications or amendments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a
Superior Proposal; _provided_ _ _,__ _however_ , that BFST shall not have any
obligation to propose any adjustments, modifications or amendments to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and (iii) at the end of the Notice
Period, after taking into account any such adjusted, modified, or amended
terms as may have been proposed by BFST since its receipt of such Notice of
Superior Proposal, the PBI Board has again in good faith made the
determination (A) in clause (i) of this Section 7.10E and (B) that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal. In the event of any
material revisions to the Superior Proposal, PBI shall be required to deliver
a new Notice of Superior Proposal to BFST and again comply with the
requirements of this Section 7.10E, except that the Notice Period shall be
reduced to three Business Days.

  



  

F. If the PBI Board shall have made a PBI Subsequent Determination with
respect to a Superior Proposal, then the PBI Board may recommend approval of
such Superior Proposal by the shareholders of PBI and may submit this
Agreement to PBI's shareholders without recommendation, in which event the PBI
Board shall communicate the basis for its recommendation of such Superior
Proposal and the basis for its lack of a recommendation with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to PBI's shareholders in
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or an appropriate amendment or supplement
thereto.

  



  

   

  



  

Section 7.11 _Disclosure Schedules_. At least five (5) days prior to the
Closing, each Party will deliver to the other Party updated Schedules
reflecting any material changes to the Schedules between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing Date.

  



  

Section 7.12 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

  



  

A. BFST will promptly notify PBI in writing if it becomes aware of any
fact or condition that makes or shows to be untrue any representation or
warranty made by BFST in, or any information disclosed on the Schedules
provided to PBI by BFST under, this Agreement; reasonably would be expected to
cause or constitute a breach of, of failure to comply with, any of the
covenants or agreements of BFST contained in this Agreement; or reasonably
would be expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to the
failure to occur of any closing condition under this Agreement. No information
received by PBI under this Section 7.12A will affect or be deemed to modify or
waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of BFST in this
Agreement, any Schedules delivered in accordance with this Agreement, any
condition to PBI's obligation to consummate the Merger or any remedies
available to PBI under this Agreement; _provided_ , that any failure to give
notice in accordance with the foregoing shall not be deemed to constitute a
violation of this Section 7.12A or the failure of any condition set forth in
Section 8.01 or Section 8.03 to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach
of this Agreement by BFST failing to give such notice, in each case unless the
underlying breach would independently result in a failure of the conditions
set forth in Section 8.01 or Section 8.03 to be satisfied.

  



  

B. PBI will promptly notify BFST in writing if it becomes aware of any
fact or condition that makes or shows to be untrue any representation or
warranty made by PBI in, or any information disclosed on the Schedules
provided to BFST by PBI under, this Agreement; reasonably would be expected to
cause or constitute a breach of, or failure to comply with, any of the
covenants or agreements of PBI contained in this Agreement; or reasonably
would be expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to the
failure to occur of any closing condition under this Agreement. No information
received by BFST under this Section 7.12B will affect or be deemed to modify
or waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of PBI in this
Agreement, any Schedules delivered in accordance with this Agreement, any
condition to BFST's obligation to consummate the Merger or any remedies
available to BFST under this Agreement; _provided_ , that any failure to give
notice in accordance with the foregoing shall not be deemed to constitute a
violation of this Section 7.12B or the failure of any condition set forth in
Section 8.01 or Section 8.02 to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach
of this Agreement by PBI failing to give such notice, in each case unless the
underlying breach would independently result in a failure of the conditions
set forth in Section 8.01 or Section 8.02 to be satisfied.

  



  

Section 7.13 _Employee Matters_.

  



  

   

  



  

A. To the extent requested by BFST, PBI or its appropriate Subsidiary will
execute and deliver such instruments and take such other actions as BFST may
reasonably require to cause the freeze, amendment or termination of any PBI
Employee Plan terms satisfactory to BFST and in accordance with all Legal
Requirements, to be effective as of the day immediately prior to the Effective
Date or at any time thereafter in the sole discretion of BFST. BFST agrees
that the employees of PBI and its Subsidiaries who continue their employment
after the Closing Date (the " **PBI Employees** ") will be entitled, subject
to Section 7.13B, to either (i) continue participation in any continuing PBI
Plans or (ii) participate as newly hired employees in the employee benefit
plans and programs maintained for employees of BFST and b1Bank, in accordance
with the respective terms of such plans and programs, and BFST will take all
actions reasonably necessary or appropriate to facilitate coverage of the PBI
Employees in such plans and programs from and after the Closing Date. To the
extent that BFST desires to maintain the effectiveness of any PBI Employee
Plan, PBI or its appropriate Subsidiary will execute and deliver such
instruments and take such other actions as BFST may reasonably require in
furtherance of the transfer of such PBI Employee Plan to BFST on terms
satisfactory to BFST and in accordance with all Legal Requirements.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the Closing Date, each PBI Employee will
be entitled to credit for past service with Pedestal Bank for the purpose of
satisfying any eligibility or vesting periods under b1Bank's 401(k) retirement
plan to the extent permissible under the terms of such plan. The parties will
cooperate to take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the plan
to plan transfer.

  



  

B. Each PBI Employee will be entitled to credit for prior service with PBI
for all purposes under the employee welfare benefit plans and other employee
benefit plans and programs (excluding vesting requirements under any stock
incentive plan and severance for PBI Employees who are terminated within six
months following the Effective Time, which severance is addressed in this
Section 7.13B) sponsored by BFST or b1Bank to the extent permitted by such
BFST Employee Plan and any Legal Requirements. To the extent permitted by such
BFST Employee Plan and any Legal Requirements, any eligibility waiting period
and pre-existing condition exclusion applicable to such BFST Employee Plan
will be waived with respect to each PBI Employee and his or her eligible
dependents. To the extent permitted by Legal Requirement and the applicable
BFST Employee Plan, BFST will credit each PBI Employee and his or her eligible
dependents for the year during which coverage under BFST's group health plan
begins, with any deductibles, co-pays or out-of-pocket payments already
incurred by such PBI Employee during such year under PBI's group health plan.
Each PBI Employee shall retain the vacation accrual earned under PBI's
vacation policy as of the Effective Time so that such PBI Employee shall
receive under b1Bank's vacation policy a vacation benefit no less than what
such PBI Employee had earned under PBI's vacation policy as of the Effective
Time; _provided, however_ , that any future accrual of benefits shall be in
accordance with BFST's vacation policy. From and following the Closing Date,
such PBI Employee will begin to accrue vacation, sick and personal time under
BFST's policies, with such PBI Employee being given credit for prior service
with PBI or Pedestal Bank for purposes of PBI's policies governing vacation,
sick and personal time. For purposes of determining a PBI Employee's benefits
for the calendar year in which the Merger occurs under BFST's vacation
program, any vacation taken by a PBI Employee immediately preceding the
Closing Date for the calendar year in which the Merger occurs will be deducted
from the total BFST vacation benefit available to such PBI Employee for such
calendar year.

  



  

   

  



  

C. Any current PBI Employee who is not a party to an employment, change in
control or severance agreement or other separation agreement that provides a
benefit on termination of employment, whose employment is terminated
involuntarily (other than for cause, death, disability or normal retirement)
within one (1) year following the Effective Time, will receive a lump sum
severance payment from b1Bank (which payment BFST will cause to be made) in an
amount equal to one weeks' compensation at such employees' base rate of
compensation, multiplied by the number of whole years of service by such
employee with PBI as of the Effective Time (with a minimum of four (4) weeks'
base salary and subject to a maximum of up to 26 weeks' base salary), subject
to the execution of a release of claims against BFST and its Affiliates. For
purposes of this Section 7.13, "cause" means any termination of employment due
to the occurrence of one of more of the following events: (i) the employee's
willful refusal to comply in any material respect with the lawful employment
policies of BFST and its Subsidiaries, (ii) the employee's commission of an
act of fraud, embezzlement or theft against BFST or any of its Subsidiaries,
(iii) the conviction or plea of _nolo contendere_ to any crime involving moral
turpitude or a felony, or (iv) the failure to substantially perform the duties
and responsibilities of his or her position with b1Bank.

  



  

Section 7.14 _Employee Stock Ownership Plan_. PBI shall take all such
necessary actions to terminate the Pedestal Bancshares, Inc. Employee Stock
Ownership Plan (the " **ESOP** ") effective as of the Effective Date (the "
**ESOP Termination Date** "). The accounts of all participants and
beneficiaries in the ESOP shall become fully vested upon termination of such
plan. The Merger Consideration received with respect to the unallocated common
stock held by the ESOP shall first be used to repay the outstanding ESOP loan,
and the Merger Consideration remaining in the ESOP suspense account after
repayment of the outstanding ESOP loan shall be allocated in accordance with
the terms of the ESOP. To the extent requested by BFST, PBI shall file or
cause to be filed all necessary documents with the IRS for a determination
letter for termination of the ESOP in connection with the ESOP Termination
Date. As soon as practicable following the receipt of a favorable
determination letter from the IRS regarding the qualified status of the ESOP
upon its termination, the account balances in the ESOP shall either be
disbursed to participants and beneficiaries or transferred to an eligible tax
qualified retirement plan (including, to the extent permitted by such plan,
the BFST 401(k) plan) or individual retirement account as a participant or
beneficiary may direct. PBI shall adopt the necessary amendment(s) and board
resolution(s) to effect the provisions of this Section 7.14.

  



  

Section 7.15 _Retention Bonus Pool_. BFST, in consultation with PBI,
shall establish a retention bonus pool, in the amount to be determined in the
sole discretion of BFST, in order to encourage certain PBI's employees to
remain with BFST, thereby assisting BFST with continuity planning following
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

Section 7.16 _Bank Merger Transaction_. The parties will cooperate to
take all actions (including making all such filings) necessary and appropriate
to effectuate the Bank Merger, to be effective immediately or as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time.

  



  

Section 7.17 _Termination of Data Processing Contracts_. BFST intends to
convert some or all of PBI's information and data onto BFST's information
technology systems (the " **Data Conversion** " **).** PBI agrees to cooperate
with BFST in preparing for the Data Conversion and to facilitate the
integration of PBI with the business BFST following consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and shall meet on a regular basis to discuss
and plan for the conversion of the Data Conversion, which planning shall
include, but not be limited to, (a) providing BFST reasonable access to data,
information systems, and personnel having expertise with PBI's and Pedestal
Bank's information and data systems, (b) discussion of third-party service
provider arrangements of PBI and each of its Subsidiaries; (c) non-renewal or
changeover, after the Effective Time, of personal property leases and software
licenses used by PBI and each of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
systems operations; (d) retention of outside consultants and additional
employees to assist with the conversion; (e) outsourcing, as appropriate after
the Effective Time, of proprietary or self-provided system services, and (f)
any other actions necessary and appropriate to facilitate the conversion, as
soon as practicable following the Effective Time. Until the Effective Time,
PBI shall advise BFST of all anticipated renewals or extensions of existing
data processing service agreements, data processing software license
agreements, data processing hardware lease agreements, and other material
technology-related licensing, maintenance or servicing agreements with
independent vendors **(** " **Technology-Related Contracts** ") involving PBI
or Pedestal Bank. PBI will cooperate with BFST and take all necessary actions
to ensure that all Technology-Related Contracts will, if the Merger occurs, be
terminated on such date(s) as may be requested by BFST.

  



  

   

  



  

Section 7.18 _Conforming Accounting Adjustments_. If requested by BFST,
PBI will and will cause Pedestal Bank to, consistent with GAAP, immediately
prior to Closing, make such accounting entries as BFST may reasonably request
to conform the accounting records of PBI and Pedestal Bank to the accounting
policies and practices of BFST and b1Bank, respectively. No such adjustment
will by itself constitute or be deemed to be a breach, violation or failure to
satisfy any representation, warranty, covenant, condition or other provision
or constitute grounds for termination of this Agreement or be an
acknowledgment by PBI or Pedestal Bank of any adverse circumstances for
purposes of determining whether the conditions to BFST's obligations under
this Agreement have been satisfied or that such adjustment has any bearing on
the Merger Consideration. No adjustment required by BFST will require any
prior filing with any Governmental Authority or violate any Legal Requirement
applicable to PBI or Pedestal Bank.

  



  

Section 7.19 _Financial Statements_. The consolidated balance sheets as
of future dates and the related statements of income, changes in stockholders'
equity and cash flows of any Party for the periods then ended, that may be
provided by such Party to the other Party subsequent to the date hereof, will
be prepared from the books and records of such Party and its Subsidiaries and
will fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position, results of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows of such
Party at the dates and for the periods indicated in conformity with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated, except that
unaudited financial statements may (i) omit the footnote disclosure required
by GAAP and (ii) be subject to normal year-end audit adjustments required by
GAAP. The Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income filed by the Subsidiary
of a Party subsequent to the date hereof will fairly present the financial
position of such Subsidiary and the results of its operations at the dates and
for the periods indicated in compliance with all Legal Requirements.

  



  

Section 7.20 _Indemnification_.

  



  

A. To the extent not prohibited by any Legal Requirements, BFST agrees
that all rights to indemnification and all limitations of liability existing
in favor of any director or officer of PBI or Pedestal Bank, determined as of
the Effective Time (each, an " **Indemnified Party** "), as provided in PBI's
or Pedestal Bank's Constituent Documents (including, without limitation, the
right to the advancement of expenses, if so provided), in each case as of the
date of this Agreement, with respect to matters occurring on or prior to the
Effective Time will survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect,
without any amendment thereto.

  



  

   

  



  

B. The rights to indemnification granted by this Section 7.20 are subject
to the following limitation: amounts otherwise required to be paid by BFST to
any Indemnified Party under this Section 7.20 will be reduced by any amounts
that such Indemnified Party recovers from any third party.

  



  

C. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
7.20A, upon learning of any Proceeding described above, must promptly notify
BFST, but the failure to so notify will not affect the obligations of BFST
under Section 7.20A, except to the extent that BFST is actually prejudiced as
a consequence of such failure to so notify. With respect to any such
Proceeding, (i) BFST will have the right to assume the defense thereof and
BFST will not be liable to an Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of
other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by an Indemnified
Party in connection with the defense thereof, except that if BFST elects not
to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Party is of the opinion
that there are issues that raise conflicts of interest between BFST and the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party may retain counsel reasonably
satisfactory to BFST (which may not exceed one firm in any jurisdiction), and
BFST will be subject to the obligations with respect to legal fees and
expenses as provided in PBI's or Pedestal Bank's Constituent Documents; (ii)
the Indemnified Party will cooperate in the defense of any such matter; (iii)
BFST will not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written
consent; and (iv) BFST will have no obligation hereunder if indemnification of
an Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated by this Agreement is
prohibited by any Legal Requirement.

  



  

D. For a period of four years following the Effective Time, BFST will
maintain director's and officer's liability insurance (herein, "DandO
Insurance") that serves to reimburse the present and former officers and
directors of PBI or its Subsidiaries (determined as of the Effective Time)
with respect to claims against such directors and officers arising from facts
or events occurring before the Effective Time (including the transactions
contemplated hereby), which insurance will contain at least the same coverage
and amounts, and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous to the
Indemnified Party, as that coverage currently provided by PBI; _provided_ __
that, if BFST is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this
Section 7.20D, BFST will provide as much comparable insurance as is reasonably
available (subject to the limitations described below in this Section 7.20D);
and _provided_ _ ____further_ _,_ that officers and directors of PBI or its
Subsidiaries may be required to make application and provide customary
representations and warranties to the carrier of the DandO Insurance for the
purpose of obtaining such insurance. In no event shall BFST be required to
expend for such tail insurance a premium amount in excess of an amount equal
to 250% of the annual premiums paid by PBI for DandO Insurance in effect as of
the date of this Agreement (the "Maximum DandO Tail Premium"). If the cost of
such tail insurance exceeds the Maximum DandO Tail Premium, BFST shall obtain
tail insurance coverage or a separate tail insurance policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum DandO Tail Premium.

contract or otherwise.

Common Stock to be issued to the shareholders of PBI pursuant to this
Agreement will, when issued, not be subject to any restrictions on transfer
arising under the Securities Act, except for BFST Common Stock issued to any
shareholder of PBI who may be deemed to be an "affiliate" (under the Exchange

Section 7.27 _Transaction Expense_. PBI shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the aggregate amount of all PBI Expenses (as
previously provided to BFST and referenced in Section 5.34) to not materially
exceed the total expenses disclosed in such estimate. PBI shall promptly
notify BFST if or when it determines that it expects to exceed its total
budget for PBI Expenses. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 7.27, PBI shall not incur any investment banking, brokerage, finders,
or other similar financial advisory fees in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement other than those expressly disclosed to BFST.
To the extent permitted by applicable law and regulation, the PBI Expenses and

BFST consolidated group which includes the Closing Date. Furthermore, PBI
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to permit all PBI Expenses,
including all change of control and similar payments, to be paid on or after
the Closing Date; provided, however, that if certain PBI expenses (such as
legal, accounting, printing, filing and fairness opinion expenses, but
excluding change of control and similar payments) are required to be paid as
such expenses become due PBI shall be permitted to pay such PBI expenses as
they become due.

  



  

   

  



  

Section 7.28 _AAA Distribution_. PBI may make a one-time distribution
(the " **AAA Distribution** ") prior to the Effective Time equal to the

Section 7.29 _Tax Matters._

  



  

A. _Tax Returns_. BFST shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be
prepared and timely filed, all income Tax Returns of PBI and its Subsidiaries
for any Taxable Period (or portion thereof) ending before the Closing Date
(the " **Pre-Closing Tax Period** "), which are to be filed after the Closing
Date. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the prior
practices of PBI, unless otherwise required by Legal Requirements, and shall
be subject to the prior written consent of the PBI Shareholder Representative,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  



  

B. _Payment of Taxes_. PBI shareholders shall be responsible for and
shall timely pay, or cause to be timely paid, any Taxes attributable to the
PBI shareholders for the Pre-Closing Tax Period.

  



  

C. _Cooperation_. The parties will provide each other with such
cooperation and information as they may reasonably request of each other in
preparing or filing any Tax Return, in determining a liability or right of
refund, or in conducting any audit or other proceeding, in respect of Taxes
attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period. BFST agrees to retain all books
and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to PBI and its Subsidiaries
relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until
expiration of the statute of limitations (and any extensions thereof) of the
respective taxable periods.

  



  

D. _Tax Contest_. BFST shall promptly provide written notice to the PBI
Shareholder Representative of an audit, administrative or judicial proceeding
or examination of a Pre-Closing Tax Period that could reasonably give rise to
a Tax liability for PBI shareholders (a " **Tax Claim** "). BFST shall
determine in consultation with the PBI Shareholder Representative whether to
contest such Tax Claim but in no event shall BFST be required to begin or
continue a contest of the Tax Claim if, in the reasonable opinion of BFST,
such contest would result in the possibility of the imposition of a Lien on
the assets of BFST or otherwise result in significant adverse consequences to
BFST. If BFST contests a Tax Claim, BFST shall (i) permit the PBI Shareholder
Representative to participate in such contest, at the expense of PBI
shareholders, (ii) keep the PBI Shareholder Representative reasonably informed
of all proceedings, communications and correspondence and (iii) make available
all relevant documents in connection therewith. BFST shall not enter into any
settlement or compromise of a Tax Claim without the prior written consent of
the PBI Shareholder Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.

  



  

   

  



  

E. _Tax Treatment_. The parties intend that the Merger shall qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, and that this Agreement
constitutes a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.368-2(g). Except as expressly contemplated or permitted
by this Agreement, from and after the date of this Agreement, each of BFST and
PBI shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code, and will not take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take
any action or cause any action to fail to be taken which action or failure to
act is intended or is reasonably likely to prevent the Merger from qualifying
as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 TERMINATION**

  



  

Section 9.01 _Right of Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated,
and the Merger may be abandoned, at any time before the Effective Time, as
follows, and in no other manner:

  



  

A. By the mutual written agreement of PBI and BFST, if the board of
directors of each so determines by a vote of a majority of the members of its
entire Board.

  



  

B. By either BFST or PBI, if the Effective Time has not occurred by the
close of business on July 31, 2020, unless one or more of the Requisite
Regulatory Approvals have not been received, in which case the Effective Time
has not occurred on or before October 31, 2020, or such later date as may be
mutually agreeable to the parties; _provided, however_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.01B will not be available to any
Party whose failure to comply with its obligations under, or breach of any
representation or warranty set forth in, this Agreement has materially
contributed to the failure of the Effective Time to occur on or before such
date.

  



  

C. By either BFST or PBI (i) if the Requisite PBI Vote shall not have been
obtained at the PBI Meeting duly convened therefor or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof, or (ii) if the Requisite BFST Vote shall not have been
obtained at the BFST Meeting duly convened therefor or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof; _provided_ , that no Party may terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 9.01C if such Party has breached in any material
respect any of its obligations under this Agreement, in each case in a manner
that caused the failure to obtain the Requisite PBI Vote at the PBI Meeting,
or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, or the Requisite BFST Vote at
the BFST Meeting, or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, as
applicable.

  



  

D. By either BFST or PBI, if any Requisite Regulatory Approval is denied
by a final, nonappealable action of any Governmental Authority, an application
therefor shall have been permanently withdrawn at the request of a
Governmental Authority, or any Governmental Authority shall have issued a
final nonappealable law or order permanently enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the Merger or the Bank
Merger, unless the failure to obtain a Requisite Regulatory Approval shall be
due to the failure of the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform
or observe the covenants and agreements of such Party set forth herein.

  



  

   

  



  

E. By either BFST or PBI (provided that the Party terminating this
Agreement is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement), if there shall have
been a material breach of any of the covenants or agreements or any of the
representations or warranties (or any such representation or warranty shall
cease to be true) set forth in this Agreement on the part of PBI, in the case
of a termination by BFST, or BFST, in the case of a termination by PBI, which
breach or failure to be true, either individually or in the aggregate with all
other breaches by such Party (or failures of such representations or
warranties to be true), would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the
Closing Date, the failure of a condition set forth in Section 8.02, in the
case of a termination by BFST, or Section 8.03, in the case of a termination
by PBI, and which is not cured within 30 days following written notice to PBI,
in the case of a termination by BFST, or to BFST, in the case of a termination
by PBI, or by its nature or timing cannot be cured during such period.

  



  

F. In addition to and not in limitation of BFST's termination rights under
this Section 9.01, by BFST if (i) there shall have been a material breach of
Section 7.05 or Section 7.10 by PBI, or (ii) the PBI Board takes an Adverse
Recommendation Action.

  



  

G. By PBI, at any time before obtaining the Requisite PBI Vote, if the PBI
Board authorizes PBI, in compliance with the terms of this Agreement, to enter
into a binding definitive agreement in respect of a Superior Proposal with a
third party, _provided_ , that PBI shall have paid any amounts due pursuant to
Section 9.04 in accordance with the terms, and at the times, specified
therein.

  



  

Section 9.02 _Notice of Termination_. The power of termination provided
for by Section 9.01 may be exercised only by a notice given in writing, as
provided in Section 10.06.

  



  

Section 9.03 _Effect of Termination_. Except as provided in Section 9.04,
if this Agreement is terminated, neither Party will have any further liability
or obligation under this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that termination
will not relieve a Party from any liability for any breach of any covenant,
agreement, representation or warranty of this Agreement (a) giving rise to
such termination and (b) resulting from fraud or any willful and material
breach; and _provided further_ , that Section 7.09, this Section 9.03 and
_Article X_ (other than Section 10.09) will survive any termination of this
Agreement.

  



  

Section 9.04 _Termination Fee_. To compensate BFST for entering into this
Agreement, taking actions to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereunder and incurring the costs and expenses related thereto and other
losses and expenses, including foregoing the pursuit of other opportunities by
BFST, PBI and BFST agree as follows:

  



  

A. If this Agreement is terminated by PBI under the provisions of Section
9.01G, then PBI shall pay to BFST the sum of $8,000,000 (the " **Termination
Fee** ") prior to and as of a condition of such termination in accordance with
Section 9.01G **;**

  



  

B. If this Agreement is terminated by BFST under the provisions of Section
9.01F, then PBI shall pay to BFST the Termination Fee in immediately available
funds within two Business Days after notification of such termination has been
provided to PBI;

  



  

   

  



  

C. If, after the date of this Agreement and prior to the termination of
this Agreement, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known to PBI or
has been made directly to its shareholders generally or any Person shall have
publicly announced (and not withdrawn) an Acquisition Proposal with respect to
PBI and (A) thereafter this Agreement is terminated (x) by either BFST or PBI
pursuant to Section 9.01C(i) because the Requisite PBI Vote shall not have
been obtained, (y) by either BFST or PBI pursuant to Section 9.01B without the
Requisite PBI Vote having been obtained, or (z) by BFST pursuant to Section
9.01E, and (B) prior to the date that is twelve months after the date of such
termination, PBI enters into any agreement or consummates a transaction with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same Acquisition
Proposal as that referred to above), then PBI shall, on the earlier of the
date it enters into such agreement and the date of consummation of such
transaction, pay BFST the Termination Fee, _provided_ _ _,__ that for purposes
of this Section 9.04C, all references in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal to "20%" shall instead refer to "50%".

  



  

D. PBI and BFST each agree that the agreements contained in this Section
9.04 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, BFST would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if PBI fails to promptly pay any amounts due under this Section
9.04, PBI shall pay interest on such amounts from the date payment of such
amounts were due to the date of actual payment at the rate of interest equal
to the sum of (i) the rate of interest published from time to time in The Wall
Street Journal, Eastern Edition (or any successor publication thereto),
designated therein as the prime rate on the date such payment was due, plus
(ii) 200 basis points, together with the costs and expenses of BFST (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses) in connection with such suit.

  



  

E. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
but without limiting the right of any Party to recover liabilities or damages
arising out of the other Party's fraud or willful and material breach of any
provision of this Agreement, the parties agree that if PBI pays or causes to
be paid to BFST the Termination Fee and/or the BFST Expenses in accordance
with this Section 9.04, PBI (or any successor in interest of PBI) will not
have any further obligations or liabilities to BFST with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 MISCELLANEOUS**

  



  

Section 10.01 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. Except for

Agreement will not survive the Effective Time.

  



  

Section 10.02 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the Merger will be borne and paid by the Party incurring the expense.

  



  

Section 10.03 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (and all related
documents referenced in this Agreement, including the Schedules and Exhibits)
constitutes the full understanding of the parties, a complete allocation of
risks between them and a complete and exclusive statement of the terms and
conditions of their agreement relating to the Merger, and supersedes all prior
agreements, undertakings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or
written, of the parties. There are no warranties, representations, covenants,

Section 10.07 _Governing Law; Waiver of Right to Jury Trial_. THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF EACH PARTY SUBJECT TO THIS
AGREEMENT WILL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH,

ANY PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE MERGER, AND

foregoing waiver, (B) each Party understands and has considered the
implications of this waiver, (C) each Party makes this waiver voluntarily, and
(D) each Party has been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other

CLAIM ARISING OUT OF RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS

JURISDICTION LOCATED IN THE STATE OF LOUISIANA.

  



  

Section 10.08 _Multiple Counterparts_. This Agreement may be signed in
multiple counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, and all
counterparts together will be deemed to be one and the same Agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other Party. A telecopy, facsimile or
electronic scan in "PDF" format of a signed counterpart of this Agreement will
be sufficient to bind the Party or parties whose signature(s) appear thereon.

  



  

   

  



  

Section 10.09 _Specific Performance_. Each Party acknowledges that the
other Party would be irreparably damaged and would not have an adequate remedy
at law for money damages in the event that any of the covenants contained in
this Agreement was not performed in accordance with its terms or otherwise was
materially breached. Therefore, each Party agrees that, without the necessity
of proving actual damages or posting bond or other security, the other Party
will be entitled to temporary or permanent injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of such performance and to specific enforcement of such
covenants in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled, at law
or in equity.

  



  

Section 10.10 _Attorneys ' Fees and Costs_. In the event of a dispute
between the parties to this Agreement related to or arising out of any
material breach or alleged material breach of this Agreement that gives rise
to a Proceeding, the prevailing Party in such Proceeding will be entitled to
reimbursement from the non-prevailing Party for all losses, damages, costs,
liabilities or expenses reasonably incurred by the prevailing Party in
furtherance of or defense of the Proceeding, including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys' fees, whether incurred in preparation for or in the
conduct of the Proceeding (including, without limitation, a Proceeding to
determine the entitlement and amount to any award of attorneys' fees).

  



  

Section 10.11 _Binding Effect; Assignment_. No Party to this Agreement
will assign this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations, in whole or in
part, without the prior written consent of the other Party. Subject to the
foregoing, this Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit
of the respective legal representatives, successors and permitted assigns of
the parties.

  



  

Section 10.12 _Third Parties_. Nothing in this Agreement, whether express
or implied, is intended to confer any rights or remedies under or by reason of
this Agreement on any persons other than the parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, except that the Indemnified Parties are the
stipulated beneficiaries of, and will be entitled to enforce their respective
rights under, Section 7.20. Nothing in this Agreement will act to relieve or
discharge the obligation or liability of any third party to any Party to this
Agreement, nor will any provision give any third party any right of
subrogation or action over or against any Party to this Agreement (including
any Person or employees who might be affected by Section 7.13).

  



  

Section 10.13 _Amendment; Waiver; Extension_. Except as prohibited by any
Legal Requirement, BFST and PBI may amend this Agreement, extend the time for
the performance of any obligations or other acts of any other Party to this
Agreement, waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement or any Schedules provided in accordance with this
Agreement, or waive compliance with any agreements or conditions contained in
this Agreement by an instrument signed in writing by or on behalf of each
Party, _provided_ that after approval of the BFST Stock Issuance or this
Agreement by the respective shareholders of BFST or PBI (as applicable), there
may not be, without further approval of such shareholders, any amendment,
extension or waiver of this Agreement that requires further approval under any
Legal Requirement. No Party to this Agreement will by any act (other than a
written instrument) be deemed to have waived any right or remedy hereunder or
to have acquiesced in any breach of any of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. No failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, any right,
power or privilege hereunder by any Party will operate as a waiver. No waiver
of any provision, or any portion of any provision, of this Agreement will
constitute a waiver of any other part of the provision or any other provision
of this Agreement, nor will it operate as a waiver, or estoppels with respect
to, any subsequent or other failure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party
may unilaterally waive a right that is solely applicable to it.

  



  

   

  



  

Section 10.14 _Disclosure Schedules; Supplements to the Disclosure
Schedules_.

  



  

A. The Schedules, as well as all other schedules and all exhibits to this
Agreement, shall be deemed part of this Agreement and included in any
reference to this Agreement. Information in the Schedules qualifies the
representations and warranties in the Section to which the particular Schedule
relates (or makes cross-reference), as well as representations and warranties
in other Sections of this Agreement, but only to the extent that the specific
item on any such Schedule is reasonably apparent on its face as being
applicable to such other Section(s). The inclusion of an item in a Schedule as
an exception to a representation or warranty will not be deemed an admission
by the disclosing party that the item represents an exception or a material
fact, event or circumstance.

  



  

B. Each Party may from time to time prior to the Closing supplement the
Schedules delivered by such Party with respect to any matter that (i) arises
and becomes known by the disclosing Party after the date of this Agreement and
that would have been required or permitted to be set forth or described on the
Schedules had such matter existed as of the date of this Agreement, and (ii)
does not arise from a breach of this Agreement. No such supplemental
disclosure will be deemed to have cured any breach of a representation or
warranty made in this Agreement unless the other Party waives the breach in
the manner set forth in this Agreement.

 **EXHIBIT B**

  



  

 **FORM OF VOTING AGREEMENT**

  



  

This Voting Agreement (this " **Voting Agreement** "), dated as of January 22,
2020, is executed by and among Business First Bancshares, Inc. (" **BFST** "),
a Louisiana corporation, Pedestal Bancshares, Inc. (" **PBI** "), a Louisiana
corporation, and the persons who are signatories hereto (each a "
**Shareholder** " and collectively the " **Shareholders** ").

  



  

RECITALS:

  



  

WHEREAS, contemporaneously with the execution of this Voting Agreement, BFST
and PBI are entering into that certain Agreement and Plan of Reorganization,
dated January 22, 2020 (as such agreement may be amended or supplemented from
time to time, the " **Reorganization Agreement** "), pursuant to which PBI
will merge with and into BFST, with BFST as the surviving entity (the "
**Merger** "), which will be followed immediately by the merger of Pedestal
Bank, a Louisiana state bank and wholly-owned subsidiary of PBI (" **Pedestal
Bank** ") with and into b1Bank, a Louisiana state bank and wholly-owned
subsidiary of BFST (" **b1Bank** "), with b1Bank as the surviving entity;

  



  

WHEREAS, Louisiana law requires that the Reorganization Agreement and the
Merger be approved by the Shareholders of PBI and BFST;

  



  

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to BFST's willingness to enter into the
Reorganization Agreement, the Reorganization Agreement requires that this
Voting Agreement be executed by the undersigned Shareholders,
contemporaneously with the execution of the Reorganization Agreement, such
that, subject to the terms hereof, each such Shareholder will vote his or her
shares of PBI stock in favor of approval of the Reorganization Agreement and
the transactions contemplated thereby;

  



  

WHEREAS, BFST and PBI are relying on this Voting Agreement in incurring
expenses in their continuing review of PBI's and Pedestal Bank's business, in
preparing the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus for the shareholders of PBI, in
proceeding with the filing of applications for regulatory approvals and in
undertaking other actions necessary for the consummation of the Merger; and

  



  

WHEREAS, any capitalized term not defined herein shall have the meaning set
forth in the Reorganization Agreement.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the substantial expenses that BFST and PBI
will incur in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Reorganization Agreement and to induce BFST to execute the Reorganization
Agreement and to proceed to incur such expenses, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereby, severally and not jointly or _in solido_ ,
agree as follows:

  



  

   

  



  

1. _Ownership of Shares_. Each of the Shareholders hereby severally and not jointly represents and warrants to BFST and PBI that such Shareholder "beneficially owns" (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) and is entitled to vote (or direct the voting of), directly or indirectly, the number of shares of PBI Common Stock indicated on the signature page of this Voting Agreement (such shares, together with any additional shares of PBI Common Stock subsequently acquired by Shareholder during the term of this Voting Agreement, including through the exercise of any stock option or other equity award, warrant or similar instrument, being referred to collectively as the " **Shares** "). While this Voting Agreement is in effect, each Shareholder shall not, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of BFST, (a) sell, transfer, pledge, assign or otherwise dispose of or encumber (or enter into any contract, commitment or other arrangement or understanding with respect to the foregoing) prior to the record date for the meeting of PBI shareholders at which the Reorganization Agreement will be voted upon (the " **PBI Meeting** ") any or all of his or her Shares, except for transfers by operation of law, by will, pursuant to the laws of descent and distribution or as a result of a court order or proceeding, or (b) deposit any of his or her Shares into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement or arrangement with respect to any of his or her Shares or grant any proxy with respect thereto, other than to other members of the PBI Board for the purpose of voting to approve the Reorganization Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby or as provided herein. Any transfer or other disposition in violation of the terms of this Section 1 shall be null and void and of no effect.

  



  

2. _Voting for Reorganization Agreement_. Each Shareholder hereby agrees during the term of this Voting Agreement to vote his or her Shares (a) in favor of the approval and adoption of the Reorganization Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby (including any amendments or modifications of the terms thereof approved by the PBI Board and adopted in accordance with the terms thereof) at the PBI Meeting or at any adjournment thereof, or in any other circumstances in which such Shareholder is entitled to vote, consent or give any other approval, (b) in favor of any proposal to adjourn or postpone such meeting, if necessary, to solicit additional proxies to approve and adopt the Reorganization Agreement, and (c) against any action or agreement that would result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of PBI contained the Reorganization Agreement or of Shareholder contained in this Voting Agreement. Shareholder further agrees not to vote or execute any written consent to rescind or amend in any manner adverse to BFST any prior vote or written consent, as a shareholder of PBI, to approve or adopt the Reorganization Agreement unless this Voting Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms.

  



  

3. _Acquisition Proposals_. Each Shareholder, solely in his/her capacity as a shareholder and without limiting in any way his/her ability to exercise his/her duties as a director or an officer of PBI or otherwise take any action permitted by the Reorganization Agreement (a) shall not invite or seek any Acquisition Proposal, support (or suggest that anyone else should support) any Acquisition Proposal that may be made, or ask the PBI Board to consider, support or seek any Acquisition Proposal, or otherwise take any action designed to make any Acquisition Proposal more likely; and (b) meet or otherwise communicate with any Person that has made or is considering making an Acquisition Proposal or any representative of such Person after becoming aware that the Person has made or is considering making an Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

4. _Reliance of Parties_. BFST and PBI each represent to each Shareholder that it is relying on this Voting Agreement in incurring expenses in continuing to review PBI's business, in preparing the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, in proceeding with the filing of applications for regulatory approvals, and in undertaking other actions necessary for the consummation of the Merger. Each Shareholder and PBI acknowledges that the performance of this Voting Agreement is intended to benefit BFST.

  



  

   

  



  

5. _Term_. This Voting Agreement shall continue in effect until the earlier to occur of (a) the termination of the Reorganization Agreement in accordance with its terms or (b) the consummation of the Merger.

  



  

6. _Director and Officer Duties_. Nothing in this Voting Agreement shall be deemed to restrict any Shareholder from taking any action in his or her capacity as a director or officer of PBI that such Shareholder shall believe is necessary to fulfill such Shareholder's duties and obligations as a director or officer (if applicable).

  



  

7. _Authority and Enforceability_. Each Shareholder has the legal capacity, power and authority to enter into and perform all of the Shareholder's obligations under this Voting Agreement. This Voting Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Shareholder and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Shareholder, enforceable against the Shareholder in accordance with its terms except as the enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or other laws affecting creditors rights or by applicable equitable principles. If the Shareholder is married and the Shareholder's Shares constitute community property, this Voting Agreement has been, to the extent necessary, duly authorized, executed and delivered by, and, if so executed, constitutes a valid and binding agreement of, the Shareholder's spouse, enforceable against such person in accordance with its terms subject to the foregoing exception. The execution and delivery of this Voting Agreement by Shareholder does not, and the performance by Shareholder of his, her, or its obligations hereunder will not, violate or conflict with in any material respect, or constitute a material default under, any agreement, instrument, contract, or other obligation or any order, arbitration award, judgment, or decree to which Shareholder is a party or by which Shareholder is bound, or to Shareholder's knowledge any Legal Requirement to which Shareholder is subject or, in the event that Shareholder is a corporation, partnership, trust, or other entity, any charter, bylaw, or other organizational document of Shareholder. Shareholder is the beneficial owner of and has good title to all of the Shares, and the Shares are owned free and clear of any Liens. Shareholder has the right to vote, or direct the voting of, the Shares, and none of the Shares is subject to any voting trust or other agreement, arrangement or restriction with respect to the voting of the Shares, except as contemplated by this Voting Agreement. Shareholder does not beneficially own any shares of capital stock of PBI other than the Shares or any other securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for such capital stock.

  



  

8. _Waiver of Appraisal Rights; Further Assurances_. Each Shareholder hereby (a) confirms his/her knowledge of the availability of the appraisal rights of shareholders under the Louisiana Business Corporation Act (" **LBCA** ") with respect to the Merger and (b) confirms receipt of a copy of the provisions of the LBCA related to the appraisal rights of shareholders. Each Shareholder hereby waives and agrees not to assert, and shall use his/her reasonable efforts to cause any affiliates who hold of record any of the Shareholder's Shares to waive and not to assert, any appraisal rights with respect to the Merger that the Shareholder or such affiliate may now or hereafter have with respect to any Shares (or any other shares of capital stock of PBI that the Shareholder shall hold of record at the time that the Shareholder may be entitled to assert appraisal rights with respect to the Merger) whether pursuant to the LBCA or otherwise. Shareholder further agrees not to commence or participate in, and to take all actions necessary to opt out of any class in any class action with respect to, any claim, derivative or otherwise, against BFST, b1Bank, PBI, Pedestal Bank, or any of their respective successors relating to the negotiation, execution, or delivery of this Agreement or the Reorganization Agreement or the consummation of the Merger.

  



  

   

  



  

9. _Amendment_. This Voting Agreement may not be modified, amended, altered or supplemented with respect to a particular Shareholder except upon the execution and delivery of a written agreement executed by BFST, PBI and such Shareholder.

  



  

10. _Counterparts_. This Voting Agreement may be executed simultaneously in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. An electronic scan in "PDF" format of a signed counterpart of this Voting Agreement delivered by electronic mail or otherwise will be sufficient to bind the party or parties whose signature(s) appear thereon.

  



  

11. _Entire Agreement_. This Voting Agreement, together with the Reorganization Agreement and the other agreements contemplated thereby, embody the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect to the subject matter contained herein. This Voting Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings among the parties with respect to such subject matter contained herein.

  



  

12. _Notices_. All notices, requests, demands and other communications required or permitted hereby shall be in writing and shall be delivered to the addresses of the parties hereto set forth below their signature on the signature pages hereof (or to such other address as any party may have furnished to the others in writing in accordance herewith) either personally, by nationally recognized overnight courier service or sent by mail or by electronic mail, and all such communications are deemed delivered (a) in the case of personal delivery or electronic mail, when received; (b) in the case of mail, upon the earlier of actual receipt or five (5) Business Days after deposit in the United States Postal Service, first class certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested; and (c) in the case of an overnight courier service, one (1) Business Day after delivery to such courier service with instructions for overnight delivery. " **Business Day** " means any day that is not a Saturday, a Sunday or other day on which banks are required or authorized by law to be closed in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

  



  

13. _Equitable Relief_. Each Shareholder recognizes and acknowledges that a breach by such Shareholder of any covenants or agreements contained in this Voting Agreement will cause BFST to sustain damages for which it would not have an adequate remedy at law for money damages, and therefore the parties hereto agree that, in the event of any such breach, BFST shall be entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance of such covenants and agreements and injunctive and other equitable relief in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled, at law or in equity. No Shareholder shall be responsible or liable for a breach of this Agreement by any other Shareholder(s).

  



  

14. _Governing Law; Venue_. This Voting Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Louisiana, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law.

merge with and into BFST, with BFST as the surviving entity (the " **Merger**
"), which will be followed immediately by the merger of Pedestal Bank, a
Louisiana state bank and wholly-owned subsidiary of PBI (" **Pedestal Bank**
"), with and into B1Bank, a Louisiana state bank and wholly-owned subsidiary
of BFST (" **b1Bank** "), with b1Bank as the surviving entity;

  



  

WHEREAS, Director is a shareholder of PBI and will, as a result of his or her
equity ownership in PBI, receive pecuniary and other benefits as a result of
the Merger;

  



  

WHEREAS, as a director and shareholder of PBI, Director has had access to
certain Confidential Information (as defined below) regarding PBI and each
Subsidiary of PBI, including, without limitation, Pedestal Bank, information
concerning PBI's business and the relationships between PBI and its
Subsidiaries, vendors, and customers, and PBI's status and relationship with
peer institutions that compete with PBI, as well as the trade secrets,
customer goodwill and proprietary information of PBI and its business, which
trade secrets, customer goodwill and proprietary information constitute a
substantial asset to be acquired by BFST; and

  



  

WHEREAS, Director recognizes that BFST's willingness to enter into the
Reorganization Agreement is dependent on Director entering into this Agreement
and, therefore, this Agreement is incident thereto.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and other good and valuable
consideration, including the premises and mutual covenants contained herein
and in the Reorganization Agreement, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, intending to be legally bound hereby, BFST and Director
undertake, promise, covenant and agree with each other as follows:

  



  

1. _Director Support_. Director agrees to use his or her reasonable best efforts to refrain from harming the goodwill of PBI and its Subsidiaries, BFST and its Subsidiaries, and their respective customer, client and vendor relationships, and from making any derogatory or disparaging remarks regarding Director's employment by or separation from PBI and its Subsidiaries, or regarding the financial condition, services, management, business practices, directors, officers, employees or agents of any such institution at any time. Director also agrees to use his or her reasonable best efforts to maintain and continue the personal relationships and the business relationships of Director's affiliated business entities, if any, with Pedestal Bank (and its successor), and to consider Pedestal Bank (and its successor) when obtaining banking products or services for his or her personal needs and the needs of Director's affiliated business entities, if any and as applicable.

  



  

   

  



  

2. _Non-Disclosure Obligations_. Except as required by law, rule or regulation or pursuant to a judicial or other governmental order, Director agrees that he or she will not knowingly make any unauthorized disclosure, directly or indirectly, of any Confidential Information of BFST, PBI or their Subsidiaries to third parties, or make any use thereof, directly or indirectly. Director also agrees that he or she shall deliver promptly to PBI or BFST at any time at its reasonable request, without retaining any copies, all documents and other material in Director's possession at that time relating, directly or indirectly, to any Confidential Information or other information of PBI or Confidential Information or other information regarding third parties, acquired in such person's position as a director, officer or shareholder of PBI.

  



  

For purposes of this Agreement, " **Confidential Information** " means and
includes BFST's, b1Bank's, PBI's and PBI's Subsidiaries' confidential and/or
proprietary information and/or trade secrets, including those of their
respective Subsidiaries, that have been and/or will be developed or used and
that cannot be obtained readily by third parties from outside sources.
Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to, the: information
regarding past, current and prospective customers and investors and business
affiliates, employees, contractors (including any information that qualifies
as "nonpublic personal information" under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999
or its state law equivalents), and the industry not generally known to the
public; strategies, methods, books, records, and documents; technical
information concerning products, equipment, services, and processes;
procurement procedures, pricing, and pricing techniques, including contact
names, services provided, pricing, type and amount of services used; financial
data; pricing strategies and price curves; positions; plans or strategies for
expansion or acquisitions; capitalization plans and capital raising strategies
and all information related thereto, including, but not limited to, any
private offering of securities and any proposed offering of securities prior
to becoming public; budgets; research; financial and sales data; trading
methodologies and terms; communications information; evaluations, opinions and
interpretations of information and data; marketing and merchandising
techniques; electronic databases; models and the output from same;
specifications; computer programs; contracts; bids or proposals; technologies
and methods; training methods and processes; organizational structure;
personnel information, including compensation and bonuses; payments or rates
paid to consultants or other service providers; other such confidential or
proprietary information; and notes, analysis, compilations, studies,
summaries, and other material prepared by or for BFST, b1Bank, PBI, any
Subsidiary of PBI or any of their respective subsidiaries containing or based,
in whole or in part, on any information included in any of the foregoing. The
term "Confidential Information" does not include any information that (a) at
the time of disclosure or thereafter is generally available to and known to
the public, other than by a breach of this Agreement by the disclosing party,
(b) was available to the disclosing party, prior to disclosure by BFST,
b1Bank, PBI or any Subsidiary of PBI, on a non-confidential basis from a
source other than the non-disclosing party and is not known by Director, after
reasonable investigation, to be subject to any fiduciary, contractual or legal
obligations of confidentiality; (c) was independently acquired or developed by
Director without violating any obligations of this Agreement; or (d) is
disclosed with the consent of BFST or PBI, as applicable. Director
acknowledges that BFST's, b1Bank's, PBI's and Pedestal Bank's respective
businesses are highly competitive, that the Confidential Information related
to PBI constitutes a valuable, special and unique asset to be acquired by BFST
in the Merger and the Confidential Information related to BFST and b1Bank
disclosed to Director, if any, constitutes a valuable, special and unique
asset currently owned by BFST, and, therefore, all of such Confidential
Information will, following the Effective Time of the Merger, constitute a
valuable, special, and unique asset, and that protection of such Confidential
Information against unauthorized disclosure and use is of critical importance
to BFST.

  



  

   

  



  

In the event that Director is requested or required (by deposition,
interrogatories, requests for information or documents in legal proceedings,
subpoenas, civil investigative demand or similar process), in connection with
any proceeding, to disclose any Confidential Information, Director will give
BFST prompt written notice of such request or requirement so that BFST, at its
sole cost and expense, may seek an appropriate protective order or other
remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, and
Director will cooperate reasonably with BFST, at the sole cost and expense of
BFST, to obtain such protective order or other remedy. In the event that such
protective order or other remedy is not obtained or BFST waives compliance
with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, Director will furnish only
that portion of the Confidential Information which is legally required to be
disclosed and, upon BFST's request and at its sole cost and expense, use his
or her reasonable commercial efforts to obtain assurances that confidential
treatment no less favorable to BFST than that set forth in this Agreement will
be accorded to such information.

  



  

3. _Director Covenants_.

  



  

(a) Other than in any capacity for or on behalf of BFST or any Subsidiary
of BFST, and except as set forth on _Schedule_ _1_ hereto, Director agrees
that, prior to the Termination Date (as defined below), Director will not,
directly or indirectly, individually or as an executive, partner, officer,
director or shareholder or in any other capacity whatsoever:

  



  

 _ **(i)**_ compete or engage, anywhere in the geographic area comprised
of Acadia, Allen, Assumption, Avoyelles, Beauregard, Calcasieu, Cameron,
Evangeline, Iberia, Iberville, Jefferson, Jefferson Davis, Lafayette,
Lafourche, Natchitoches, Pointe Coupee, Rapides, Sabine, St. James, St. John
the Baptist, St. Charles, St. Landry, St. Martin, St. Mary, Terrebonne,
Vermilion and Vernon parishes (collectively, the "Market Area") in a business
similar to that of BFST, b1Bank, PBI or Pedestal Bank as of the date hereof or
the Effective Time of the Merger;

  



  

 _ **(ii)**_ take any action to invest in, own, manage, operate, control,
participate in, be employed or engaged by or be connected in any manner
(directly or indirectly), including, without limitation, as an officer,
director, employee, agent or consultant, with any Person engaging in a
business the same as or similar to that of PBI or Pedestal Bank anywhere
within the Market Area; _provided, however_ , Director is permitted hereunder
to, directly or indirectly, own any investments owned as of the date of this
Agreement (and all such investments in financial institutions conducting
business in the Market Area are set forth on _Schedule_ _2_ hereto) and may
subsequently acquire up to one percent (1%) of the issued and outstanding
securities of any publicly traded financial institution conducting business in
the Market Area;

  



  

   

  



  

 _ **(iii)**_ (A) call on, service or solicit competing banking business
from any Person who is a customer or prospective customer (if known by
Director to be actively sought by Pedestal Bank as of the Effective Time) of
PBI or any Subsidiary of PBI as of the date of this Agreement or as of the
Closing Date, or (B) interfere with or damage (or attempt to interfere with or
damage) any relationship between PBI or any Subsidiary of PBI or any of their
respective affiliates and any such customer; or

  



  

 _ **(iv) **_ call on, solicit or induce any person who is, or within the
twelve (12) months preceding the Closing Date was, an employee of PBI or any
Subsidiary of PBI to terminate employment from PBI (or its successor) or any
Subsidiary of PBI (or its successor), and will not assist any other Person in
such activities.

  



  

Director may not avoid the purpose and intent of this Section 3(a) by engaging
in conduct within the Market Area from a remote location through means such as
telecommunications, written correspondence, computer generated or assisted
communications, communications with third parties in the Market Area, or other
similar methods.

  



  

(b) If any court of competent jurisdiction should determine that the terms
of this Section 3 are too broad in terms of time, geographic area, lines of
commerce or otherwise, that court is to modify and revise any such terms so
that they comply with applicable law.

  



  

(c) Director acknowledges and agrees that (i) this Agreement is entered
into in connection with the sale to BFST of the goodwill of the business of
PBI and Pedestal Bank, (ii) Director is receiving substantial, valuable
consideration for this Agreement, including, without limitation, access to new
Confidential Information relating to the current and prospective businesses,
strategies and customers of PBI and Pedestal Bank, which will become BFST's
businesses after the Effective Time of the Merger, and in a greater quantity
and/or expanded nature than that already provided to Director, and access to,
or knowledge of, new Confidential Information of third parties, such as actual
and potential customers, suppliers, partners, joint venturers, investors,
financing sources, etc., of PBI and Pedestal Bank prior to the Effective Time
of the Merger, and that such consideration constitutes fair and adequate
consideration for the execution of the restrictive covenants set forth above,
(iii) the restrictions imposed upon Director by this Agreement are essential
and necessary to ensure BFST acquires the goodwill of PBI and Pedestal Bank
and to protect such goodwill and the Confidential Information relating to PBI
and the PBI Subsidiaries, and (iv) all the restrictions (including
particularly the time and geographical limitations) set forth in this
Agreement are fair and reasonable in light of the time that Director has been
engaged in the business of PBI and Pedestal Bank and Director's relationship
with the customers of PBI and Pedestal Bank. Director further acknowledges
that the restrictions contained herein are not burdensome to Director in light
of the consideration paid therefor and the other opportunities that remain
open to Director. Moreover, Director acknowledges that he has and will have
other means available to him for the pursuit of his livelihood after the
Effective Time of the Merger.

  



  

   

  



  

4. _Termination_. This restrictions and obligations set forth in Section 3 will terminate on the earlier of (a) the date the Reorganization Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms or (b) the date that is twenty-four (24) months after the Closing Date (as applicable, the " **Termination Date** ").

  



  

5. _Injunctive Relief and Additional Remedies_. Director acknowledges that the injury that would be suffered by BFST or PBI as a result of a breach of the provisions of this Agreement (including any provision of Section 3) would be irreparable and that an award of monetary damages to BFST or PBI, as the case may be, for such a breach would be an inadequate remedy. Consequently, each of BFST and PBI will have the right, in addition to any other rights it may have, to seek specific performance, to obtain injunctive relief to restrain any proposed or actual breach or threatened breach or otherwise to specifically enforce any provision of this Agreement without the obligation to post bond or other security in seeking such relief. Such equitable remedies are in addition to the right to obtain compensatory and punitive damages, and attorney's fees, and, notwithstanding BFST's or PBI's, as the case may be, right to so seek damages, Director waives any defense that an adequate remedy for BFST or PBI, as the case may be, exists under law. If Director, on the one hand, or BFST or PBI, on the other hand, must bring suit to enforce this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its attorneys' fees and costs related thereto.

  



  

6. _Extension of Restrictive Covenant Period._ In the event that PBI, Pedestal Bank, BFST or b1Bank shall file a lawsuit in any court of competent jurisdiction alleging a breach of Section 3 of this Agreement by the Director, then, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any time period set forth in this Agreement, including the time periods set forth in Section 3, will be extended one month for each month the Director was determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, or otherwise, to be in breach of this Agreement, so that PBI, Pedestal Bank, BFST or b1Bank is provided the benefit of the full non-competition period.

  



  

7. _Waiver; Amendment and Modification_. The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are cumulative and not alternative. Neither the failure nor any delay by either party in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right power, or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power, or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power, or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a) no claim or right or right arising out of this Agreement can be discharged by one party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless in writing signed by the other party, (b) no waiver that may be given by a party will be applicable except in the specific instance for which it is given, and (c) no notice to or demand on one party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such party or of the right of the party giving such notice or demand to take further action without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement. This Agreement may be modified or amended at any time, by mutual agreement of BFST and Director. Any waiver, modification or amendment of this Agreement shall be in writing.

  



  

   

  



  

8. _Multiple Counterparts_. For the convenience of the parties hereto, this Agreement may be signed in multiple counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all counterparts hereof so signed by the parties hereto, whether or not such counterpart shall bear the execution of each of the parties hereto, shall be deemed to be, and is to be construed as, one and the same Agreement. A facsimile or electronic scan in "PDF" format transmission of a signed counterpart of this Agreement shall be sufficient to bind the party or parties whose signature(s) appear thereon.

  



  

9. _Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial_. THIS AGREEMENT IS TO BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF LOUISIANA, WITHOUT REGARD FOR THE PROVISIONS THEREOF REGARDING CHOICE OF LAW (WHETHER OF THE STATE OF LOUISIANA OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION). EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

  



  

10. _Binding Effect; Assignment_. All of the terms, covenants, representations, warranties and conditions of this Agreement are binding upon, and inure to the benefit of and are enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors, representatives and permitted assigns. Nothing expressed or referred to herein is intended or is to be construed to give any person other than the parties hereto any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement, it being the intent of the parties that this Agreement, and the terms hereof are for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and not for the benefit of any other person. No party to this Agreement will assign this Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any assignment made or attempted in violation of this Section is void and of no effect.

  



  

11. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under present or future laws, then (a) this Agreement is to be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision were not a part hereof; (b) the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will not be affected by such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by its severance from this Agreement; and (c) there will be added automatically as a part of this Agreement a provision mutually agreed to which is similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible and still be legal, valid and enforceable.

  



  

12. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the other agreements, documents, schedules and instruments signed and delivered by the parties to each other at the Closing are the full understanding of the parties, a complete allocation of risks between them and a complete and exclusive statement of the terms and conditions of their agreement relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all prior agreements, whether written or oral, that may exist between the parties with respect thereto. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, no conditions, usage of trade, course of dealing or performance, understanding or agreement purporting to modify, vary, explain or supplement the terms or conditions of this Agreement is binding unless hereafter made in writing and signed by the party to be bound, and no modification will be effected by the acknowledgment or acceptance of documents containing terms or conditions at variance with or in addition to those set forth in this Agreement.

WHEREAS, it is a covenant of PBI pursuant the Reorganization Agreement that
