Article II. 
 THE MERGER

  



  

2.1 _  _ _The Merger._ Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, the Company will be
merged with and into Merger Sub in accordance with the provisions of the
Maryland General Corporation Law (the "MGCL") and the Delaware Limited
Liability Company Act (the "Delaware LLC Act"). As a result of the Merger, the
separate existence of the Company shall cease and Merger Sub shall continue
its existence under the Laws of the State of Delaware as the surviving
limited liability company (in such capacity, Merger Sub is sometimes referred
to herein as the "Surviving Company"). Immediately following the Merger,
Parent shall contribute the Surviving Company to Sutherland Partners, L.P., a
Delaware limited partnership (the "Operating Partnership"), in exchange for
partnership interests in the Operating Partnership.

  



  

2.2 _  _ _Closing._

  



  

(a)  The closing of the Merger (the "Closing"), shall take place
at 9:00 a.m., New York, New York time, on a date that is two Business Days
following the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law)
waiver in accordance with this Agreement of all of the conditions set forth
in _Article VII_ (other than any such conditions which by their nature cannot
be satisfied until the Closing Date, which shall be required to be so
satisfied or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waived in accordance
with this Agreement on the Closing Date) by means of a virtual closing through
the electronic exchange of signatures. For purposes of this Agreement
"Closing Date" shall mean the date on which the Closing occurs.

  



  

(b)  As soon as practicable on the Closing Date after the
Closing, the parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "Delaware Secretary of
State") a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") and filing with
the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland (the  "Maryland
Department") articles of merger (the "Articles of Merger," together with the
Certificate of Merger, the "Merger Filings") in connection with the Merger,
each in such form as is required by, and executed in accordance with, the
Delaware LLC Act and MGCL, respectively, and the parties shall make all other
filings or recordings required under the Delaware LLC Act and MGCL in
connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at the time
specified in the Merger Filings (not to exceed 30 days after the later of the
filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State or
the filing of the Articles of Merger with the Maryland Department), and
following the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary
of State and the filing of Articles of Merger with the Maryland Department
(such date and time the Merger becomes effective, the "Effective Time").

  



  

2.3 _  _ _Effect of the Merger._ At the Effective Time, the
Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable
provisions of the MGCL, including Section 3-114 thereof, and the Delaware LLC
Act. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto,
at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of each of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Company, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions,
disabilities and duties of each of the Company and Merger Sub shall become
the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of
the Surviving Company.

  



  

2.4 _  _ _Organizational Documents_. At the Effective Time, the
Organizational Documents of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Company,
until thereafter amended, subject to _Section 6.10(b)_, in accordance with
their respective terms and applicable Law.

  



  

   

5

 



    



  

2.5 _  _ _Managers and Officers of the Surviving Company._ From
and after the Effective Time, the managers and officers of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the managers and officers of
the Surviving Company, and such managers and officers shall serve until their
successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their
death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Organizational Documents
of the Surviving Company.

  



  

2.6 _  _ _Directors of Parent._ Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall take all necessary corporate action so that upon and immediately
after the Effective Time, the size of the Parent Board is increased by one
member, and Dominique Mielle (the "Company Director Designee") is appointed
to the Parent Board; _provided_ that the Company Director Designee has
provided a satisfactorily completed directors' questionnaires to Parent prior
to such appointment. In the event that the Company Director Designee is
unable or unwilling to serve on the Parent Board prior to the Effective Time,
then a substitute who is a current independent director of the Company shall
be designated by the Company on the earlier to occur of (a) five Business
Days after the date that the Company Director Designee is determined to be
unable to serve or informs the Company that she is unwilling to serve and (b)
the fifth Business Day prior to the Closing Date, which substitute member
shall be deemed to be a Company Director Designee for purposes of this
Agreement. Any such substitute Company Director Designee shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Parent Board. The Company Director Designee must (i)
satisfy the director qualification standards set forth in the Corporate
Governance Guidelines of Parent, (ii) meet the qualifications of an
"independent director" under the rules of the NYSE and (iii) provide to
Parent the information required by Article II, Section 11 of the Company's
Amended and Restated Bylaws regarding such Company Director Designee, and
shall be elected or appointed to the Parent Board to fill the vacancies on the
Parent Board created by such increase to serve until the first annual meeting
of stockholders following the Closing or until their successors are elected
and qualified. The provisions of this _Section 2.6_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Company Director Designee. The
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company under this _Section 2.6_
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
the rights of the Company Director Designee unless (x) such termination or
modification is required by applicable Law or (y) the Company Director
Designee has consented in writing to such termination or modification (it
being expressly agreed that the Company Director Designee shall be a third-
party beneficiary of this _Section 2.6_ ).

  



  

2.7 _  _ _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, (a) the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and (b) this Agreement be,
and hereby is adopted as, a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Section
354 and 361 of the Code. Unless otherwise required by a final determination
within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or a similar determination
under applicable state or local law), the parties to this Agreement shall
file all U.S. federal, state and local Tax Returns in a manner consistent with
the intended tax treatment of the Merger described in this _Section 2.7_ ,
and no party shall take a position inconsistent with such treatment.

Article III.

  

 EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE COMPANY AND 
 MERGER SUB; EXCHANGE

  



  

3.1 _  _ _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock._ At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, or any holder of any securities of Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company:

  



  

(a)   _Membership Interests of Merger Sub_. All of the
membership interests of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding as membership interests of the
Surviving Company.

  



  

(b)   _Capital Stock of the Company_.

  



  

(i)  Subject to the other provisions of this _Article III_ , each
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company ("Company
Common Stock"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(excluding any Cancelled Shares, as defined below), shall be converted into
the right to receive from Parent (A) that number of validly issued, fully-
paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange
Ratio (the "Per Share Stock Consideration") and (B) the Per Share Cash
Consideration (together with the Per Share Stock Consideration, the "Per Share
Common Merger Consideration").

  



  

(ii)  All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted

the Merger Consideration and the Phantom Share Consideration (as applicable)
and cash in lieu of fractional shares. Any interest or other income
resulting from investment of the cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall
become part of the Exchange Fund.

  



  

(b)   _Exchange Procedures._

  



  

(i)  As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but in
no event more than two Business Days after the Closing Date, Parent shall
instruct the Exchange Agent to mail or otherwise deliver to each record
holder, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, of (A) a certificate
or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represents shares
of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock, as applicable (the
"Certificates") or (B) shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred
Stock or Vesting Phantom Shares, as applicable, represented by book-entry

_Section 3.1_ or _3.2(a)_ into the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration or Phantom Share Consideration at the Effective Time, (1) a
letter of transmittal ("Letter of Transmittal"), which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange
Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures
set forth in the Letter of Transmittal, and which shall be in a customary
form and agreed to by Parent and the Company prior to the Closing (it being
understood that the forms of Letter of Transmittal to be mailed to the holders
of Company Common Stock, Vesting Phantom Shares and Company Preferred Stock
may vary in certain respects due to differences in the respective securities)
and (2) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such shares,
for payment of the applicable Merger Consideration or Phantom Share
Consideration set forth in _Section 3.1_ or _3.2(a)_.

  



  

   

10

 



    



   



  

(ii) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares, together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such
other customary documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange
Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor (A) the applicable Merger Consideration or
Phantom Share Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_
(which shares of Parent Common Stock and Parent Preferred Stock included in
such Merger Consideration or Phantom Share Consideration shall be in
uncertificated book-entry form) and (B) a check in the amount equal to the
cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant
to _Section 3.3(h)_ and dividends and other distributions pursuant to
_Section 3.3(g)_. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the applicable Merger
Consideration or Phantom Share Consideration payable in respect of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. If payment of the applicable Merger
Consideration or Phantom Share Consideration is to be made to a Person other
than the record holder of such shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock or Vesting Phantom Shares, as applicable, it shall be a
condition of payment that shares so surrendered shall be properly endorsed
or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required
by reason of the payment of the applicable Merger Consideration or Phantom
Share Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such
shares surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of
the Surviving Company that such Taxes either have been paid or are not
applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section
3.3(b)(ii)_, each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at
any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration or Phantom Share
Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock and
Company Preferred Stock and Vesting Phantom Shares, cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_ and any dividends or other distributions to

Share Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_ and dividends or other distributions with respect
to Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock pursuant to _Section
3.3(g)_, in each case paid upon the surrender of and in exchange for shares
of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock and Vesting Phantom Shares
in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Common Stock, Company
Preferred Stock or Vesting Phantom Shares, as applicable. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to
the Surviving Company for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged
for the applicable Merger Consideration or Phantom Share Consideration
payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred
Stock or Vesting Phantom Shares, as applicable, previously represented by
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (other than Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares evidencing Cancelled Shares), any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to
_Section 3.3(h)_ and any dividends or other distributions with respect to
Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock to which the holders thereof
are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(g)_ , without any interest thereon.

  



  

   

11

 



    



  

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed on the 365th day after the Closing Date shall
be delivered to the Surviving Company upon demand, and any former holder of
Company Common Stock, Company Preferred Stock or Vesting Phantom Shares who
has not theretofore received the applicable Merger Consideration or Phantom
Share Consideration to which they are entitled under this _Article III_ , any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holders
thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_ and any dividends or
other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred
Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section
3.3(g)_, in each case without interest thereon, shall thereafter look only to
the Surviving Company and Parent for payment of their claim for such amounts.

  



  

(e)   _No Liability._ None of the Surviving Company, Parent or
the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-
Entry Share for any Merger Consideration, Phantom Share Consideration or other
amounts properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry
Share has not been surrendered prior to the time that is immediately prior to
the time at which the applicable Merger Consideration or Phantom Share
Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any
such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become
the property of the Surviving Company, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(f)   _Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates._ If any
Certificate (other than a Certificate evidencing Cancelled Shares) shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if reasonably required by the Surviving Company, the posting by such Person of
a bond in such reasonable amount, pursuant to the policies and procedures of
the transfer agent for Parent, as the Surviving Company may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock, as
applicable, formerly represented by such Certificate, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof are
entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_ and any dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock to
which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(g)_ ,.

  



  

(g) _Distributions with Respect to Parent Common Stock or
Parent Preferred Stock._ No dividends or other distributions declared or made
with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock, as
applicable, with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Shares with respect to
the whole shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock, as
applicable, that such holder would be entitled to receive upon surrender
of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder, in
each case until such holder shall surrender such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares in accordance with this _Section 3.3_. Following surrender of any such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, there shall be paid to such holder of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock, as applicable,
issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly after the time
of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such
whole shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock, as applicable,
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a
payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock, as applicable. For
purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of shares of Parent
Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock, as applicable, all whole shares of
Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock, as applicable, to be issued
pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence as if such whole shares of Parent Common Stock
or Parent Preferred Stock, as applicable, were issued and outstanding as of
the Effective Time.

  



  

   

12

 



    



  

(h)   _No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock._ No
certificates or scrip or shares representing fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares and such fractional share interests will not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a stockholder of Parent or a
holder of shares of Parent Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock or
Vesting Phantom Shares exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise
have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
(after taking into account all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by
such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an
amount equal to the product of (i) such fractional part of a share of Parent
Common Stock multiplied by (ii) the average of the volume weighted average
prices of one share of Parent Common Stock for the five consecutive trading
days immediately prior to the Closing Date as reported by Bloomberg, L.P. As
promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if
any, to be paid to holders of shares of Company Common Stock or Vesting
Phantom Shares exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking
into account all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such
holder), the Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent, and Parent shall cause
the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional interests
subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof.

  



  

(i)   _Withholding Taxes._ Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Parent, the Surviving Company and the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from (A) the consideration to
be paid by Parent or the Exchange Agent hereunder, (B) the Company DER
Consideration and (C) any other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement, any amount required to be deducted and withheld with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code or any other provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law. Any such amounts so deducted or withheld
shall be paid over to the relevant Taxing Authority in accordance with
applicable Law by the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Company or Parent, as the
case may be, and such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction or withholding was made.

  



  

(j)   _Dissenters ' Rights. _No dissenters' or appraisal
rights shall be available with respect to the Merger or the other
Transactions.

 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

  



  

Except as set forth in the disclosure letter dated as of the date of this
Agreement and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub to the Company on or
prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Parent Disclosure Letter") and
except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents (including all exhibits and
schedules thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein, but
excluding any forward looking disclosures set forth in any "risk factors"
section, any disclosures in any "forward looking statements" Section and any
other disclosures included therein to the extent they are predictive or
forward looking in nature), Parent and Merger Sub jointly and severally

requisite entity power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties
and to carry on its business as now being conducted, other than where the
failure to be so organized, validly existing, in good standing or to have
such power or authority would not reasonably be expected to have, individually

Adverse Effect"). Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or
licensed to do business and, where relevant, is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the business it is conducting, or the operation,
ownership or leasing of its properties, makes such qualification, licensing
or good standing necessary, other than where the failure to so qualify, be
licensed or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent and
Merger Sub each has heretofore made available to the Company complete and
correct copies of its Organizational Documents.

  



  

   

27

5.3  Authority; No Violations; Approvals.

  



  

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite
organizational power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and
to perform its obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation by Parent and Merger
Sub of the Transactions, including the consummation of the Merger, have been
duly authorized by all necessary organizational action on the part of each of
Parent (subject to obtaining Parent Stockholder Approval) and Merger Sub,
subject, with respect to consummation of the Merger, the filing of the
Certificate of Merger and Articles of Merger with, and acceptance for record
by, the Delaware Secretary of State and Maryland Department, respectively.
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of Parent and
Merger Sub and, assuming the due and valid execution of this Agreement by the
Company, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and
Merger Sub enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its
terms, subject, as to enforceability, to Creditors' Rights. The Parent Board,

Agreement and declared that the Transactions, including the Merger, are
advisable, and (B) executed a written consent pursuant to which it
has authorized, adopted and approved this Agreement and the Transactions,

of any class or series of Parent Capital Stock necessary to approve the
Parent Stock Issuance and Transactions, including the Merger.

  



  

   

29

 



    



  

(b)  The execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and
the consummation of the Transactions will not (with or without notice or
lapse of time, or both) (i) assuming that the Parent Stockholder Approval is
obtained, contravene, conflict with or result in a violation of any provision
of the Organizational Documents of either Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) result in
a violation of, or default under, or acceleration of any material obligation
or the loss of a material benefit under, or result in the creation of any
Liens upon any of the properties or assets of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries under, any provision of any Parent Contract to which Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which Parent or Merger Sub or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or their respective properties or assets are
bound, or (iii) assuming the Consents referred to in _Section 5.4_  are duly

obtained, contravene, conflict with or result in a violation of any Law
applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective

any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Parent in
Parent's published financial statements or any Parent SEC Documents.

likely to adversely affect in any material respect Parent's ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information or (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in Parent's internal controls over financial reporting,
and, in each case, neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates or

Subsidiaries has waived any statute of limitations with respect to the
assessment of material Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect
to any material Tax assessment or deficiency for any open tax year; (iv)

amounts due in respect of periods prior to the Closing Date, in each case,
other than customary provisions of commercial or credit agreements.

  



  

(j)  Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) has been a
member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated U.S. federal income Tax
Return or (ii) has any liability for the Taxes of any Person (other than any

and (ii) neither Parent not any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any material
liability for any other Taxes other than (A) in the ordinary course of
business or consistent with past practice or (B) transfer or similar Taxes
arising in connection with acquisitions or dispositions of property. No

circumstance exists, which presents a material risk that any material amount
of Tax described in the previous sentence will be imposed upon Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries.

Change of Recommendation would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with
its legal duties as directors under applicable Law.

Proposal determined to be a Parent Superior Proposal are made, the time
period set forth in this _clause (B)_ prior to which Parent may effect a
Parent Change of Recommendation or terminate this Agreement shall be extended
for two Business Days after notification of such change to the Company; and

  



  

   

52

 



    



  

(iv)  prior to receipt of the Parent Stockholder Approval, seek
clarification from (but not engage in negotiations with or provide non-public
information to) any Person that has made a Parent Competing Proposal that was
not solicited at any time following the execution of this Agreement solely to
clarify and understand the terms and conditions of such proposal to provide
adequate information for the Parent Board or any committee thereof to make an
informed determination under _Section 6.4(d)(ii)_.

  



  

(e)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Parent Board shall be permitted, at any time prior to the receipt of the
Parent Stockholder Approval, other than in response to a Parent Competing
Proposal (which is addressed in _Section 6.4(d)(iii)_ ), to make a Parent
Change of Recommendation if, prior to taking such action, (i) the Parent Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with its legal duties as directors under applicable Law and (ii) Parent shall
have given notice to the Company that Parent intends to effect a Parent
Change of Recommendation (which notice will reasonably describe the reasons
for such Parent Change of Recommendation), and either (A) the Company shall
not have proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement prior to the earlier to occur of the scheduled time for the Parent
Stockholders Meeting and the third Business Day after the date on which such
notice is given to the Company, or (B) if the Company within the period
described in the foregoing _clause (A)_ shall have proposed revisions to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Parent Board, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, shall have determined in good faith that such
proposed changes do not obviate the need for the Parent Board to effect a
Parent Change of Recommendation and that the failure to make a Parent Change
of Recommendation would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
legal duties as directors under applicable Law.

  



  

6.5  Preparation of Joint Proxy Statement and Registration
Statement.

  



  

(a)  Parent will promptly furnish to the Company such data and
information relating to it, its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) and the
holders of Parent Capital Stock, as the Company may reasonably request for the
purpose of including such data and information in the Joint Proxy Statement
and any amendments or supplements thereto used by the Company to obtain the
Company Stockholder Approval. The Company will promptly furnish to Parent
such data and information relating to it, its Subsidiaries and the holders of
Company Capital Stock, as Parent may reasonably request for the purpose of
including such data and information in the Registration Statement (including
the Joint Proxy Statement) and any amendments or supplements thereto.

  



  

   

53

 



    



  

(b)   Promptly following the date hereof, the Company and Parent
shall cooperate in preparing and shall cause to be filed with the SEC a
mutually acceptable Joint Proxy Statement relating to the matters to be
submitted to the holders of Company Common Stock at the Company Stockholders
Meeting and the holders of Parent Common Stock at the Parent Stockholders
Meeting, and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC the Registration
Statement (of which the Joint Proxy Statement will be a part). The Company and
Parent shall each use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement to comply with the rules
and regulations promulgated by the SEC and to respond promptly to any comments
of the SEC or its staff. Parent and the Company shall each use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become
effective under the Securities Act as soon after such filing as practicable
and Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to keep
the Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate
the Merger. Each of the Company and Parent will advise the other
promptly after it receives any request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint
Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement or comments thereon and
responses thereto or any request by the SEC for additional information. Each
of the Company and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
all documents that it is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection
with the Transactions to comply as to form and substance in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing the Registration
Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or mailing the Joint Proxy
Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any
comments of the SEC with respect thereto, each of the Company and Parent will
(i) provide the other with an opportunity to review and comment on such
document or response (including the proposed final version of such document
or response), (ii) shall include in such document or response all
comments reasonably proposed by the other and (iii) shall not file or mail
such document or respond to the SEC prior to receiving the approval of the
other, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to documents filed by a
party that are incorporated by reference in the Joint Proxy Statement or
Registration Statement, this right of approval shall apply only with respect
to information relating to the other party, its Subsidiaries and its
Affiliates, their business, financial condition or results of operations or
the Transactions; and _provided_ , _further_ that the Company, in connection
with any Company Change of Recommendation, or Parent, in connection with any
Parent Change of Recommendation, may amend or supplement the Joint Proxy
Statement (including by incorporation by reference) and make other filings
with the SEC, to effect such Company Change of Recommendation or Parent
Change of Recommendation, as applicable.

  



  

(c)  Parent and the Company each shall make all necessary filings
with respect to the Merger and the Transactions under the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act and applicable blue sky laws and, in each case, the rules and
regulations thereunder. Each party will advise the other, promptly after it
receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has
become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance
of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent
Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock issuable in connection with the Merger
for offering or sale in any jurisdiction. Each of the Company and Parent will
use commercially reasonable efforts to have any such stop order or suspension
lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated.

  



  

   

54

 



    



  

(d)   If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information
relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates,
officers or directors, should be discovered by Parent or the Company that
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Registration
Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that such documents would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other party and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to
the Company Stockholders and the Parent Stockholders.

  



  

6.6  Stockholders Meetings.

  



  

(a) The Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with
applicable Laws and the Organizational Documents of the Company to duly give

Stockholders proxies in favor of the approval of the Merger and the other

to by the parties, the Company Stockholders Meeting shall not be adjourned or

transfer agent, proxy solicitor or other Representative. Unless this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with _Article VIII_ , the
Company's obligations to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company
Stockholders Meeting in accordance with this _Section 6.6(a)_ shall not be
limited or otherwise affected by the making, commencement, disclosure,
announcement or submission of any Company Superior Proposal or Company
Competing Proposal, or by any Company Change of Recommendation.

  



  

   

55

 



    



   



  

(b)  Parent shall take all action necessary in accordance with
applicable Laws and the Organizational Documents of Parent to duly give
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of
obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval, to be held as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the clearance of the Joint Proxy Statement by
the SEC. Except as permitted by _Section 6.4_ , the Parent, through the
Parent Board, shall recommend to the Parent Stockholders that they vote in
favor of the Parent Common Stock Issuance at the Parent Stockholders Meeting
and the Parent Board shall solicit from Parent Stockholders proxies in favor
of the Parent Common Stock Issuance at the Parent Stockholders Meeting, and
the Joint Proxy Statement shall include a statement to the effect that the
Parent Board has resolved to make the Parent Board Recommendation.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent
(i) shall be required to adjourn or postpone the Parent Stockholders
Meeting (A) to the extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or
amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement is provided to the Parent Stockholders
or (B) if, as of the time for which the Parent Stockholders Meeting is
scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Parent Common Stock represented
(either in person or by proxy) to establish a quorum at such Parent
Stockholders Meeting and (ii) may adjourn or postpone the Parent Stockholders
Meeting if, as of the time for which the Parent Stockholders Meeting
is scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Parent Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to obtain the Parent Stockholder
Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless otherwise agreed to by the
parties, the Parent Stockholders Meeting shall not be adjourned or postponed
to a date that is more than 30 days after the date for which the meeting was
previously scheduled (it being understood that such Parent Stockholders
Meeting shall be adjourned or postponed every time the
circumstances described in the foregoing _clauses (i)(A)_ or _(i)(B)_ exist,
and such Parent Stockholders Meeting may be adjourned or postponed every time
the circumstances described in the foregoing _clause (ii)_ exist); and
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Parent Stockholders Meeting shall not be

Parent Change of Recommendation.

  



  

(c) The parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts
to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Parent Stockholders
Meeting on the same day.

  



  

   

56

 



    



  

6.7  Access to Information.

  



  

(a)   Each party shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
to, afford to the other party and its Representatives, during the period
prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to the terms of _Section 8.1_ , reasonable access, during
normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice, to the officers, any
other employees, and offices of such party and its Subsidiaries and to their
books, records, contracts and documents and shall, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to, furnish reasonably promptly to the other party and its
Representatives such information concerning its and its Subsidiaries'
business, properties, contracts, records and personnel as such other party may
reasonably request, including information about the Company's financing,
hedging activities, portfolio risk and portfolio activities. Each of the
Company and Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to minimize
any disruption to the businesses of the other party that may result from the
requests for access, data and information hereunder. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this  _Section 6.7(a)_ , each party shall not be
required to, or to cause any of its Subsidiaries to, grant access or furnish
information to the other party or any of its Representatives to the extent
that (i) such information is subject to an attorney/client privilege, the
attorney work product doctrine or other legal privilege or (ii) such access or
the furnishing of such information is prohibited by applicable Law or an
existing contract or agreement or a contract or agreement entered into after
the date of this Agreement in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice. Each party agrees that it will not, and will cause its
Representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this
_Section 6.7(a)_ for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the
Transactions.

  



  

(b)  The Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement, dated as of November
8, 2020, between Parent and the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement")
shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and shall apply to
all information furnished thereunder or hereunder. All information provided
to any party or its Representatives pursuant to or in connection with this
Agreement is deemed to be "Evaluation Material" as defined under the
Confidentiality Agreement.

  



  

(c)  Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause the Company Manager and each Affiliate of the Company
Manager to deliver to the Company all contracts and records in the Company
Manager's or any of its Affiliates' possession or control to the extent (with
respect to the contracts) they are contracts to which the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company is a party, and with respect to records, to the
extent they pertain to the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries; 
_provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, such records shall not include
records that are the owned property of the Company Manager and are not owned
property of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

6.8  Reasonable Best Efforts.

  



  

(a)  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each
party will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws to consummate the Merger and the other
Transactions as soon as practicable after the date hereof, including (i)
preparing and filing or otherwise providing, in consultation with the other
party and as promptly as practicable and advisable after the date hereof, all
documentation to effect all necessary applications, notices, petitions,
filings, and other documents and to obtain as promptly as practicable all
waiting period expirations or terminations, consents, clearances, waivers,
licenses, orders, registrations, approvals, permits, and authorizations
necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other
Transactions and (ii) taking all steps as may be necessary, subject to the
limitations in this  _Section 6.8_, to obtain all such waiting period
expirations or terminations, consents, clearances, waivers,
licenses, registrations, permits, authorizations, orders and approvals.

  



  

   

57

 



    



  

(b)  In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each
of the parties shall give any required notices to third parties, and each of
the parties shall use, and cause each of their respective Subsidiaries and
Affiliates to use, its reasonable best efforts to obtain any third party
consents that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Merger.
Each of the parties will furnish to the other such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection with the
preparation of any required filings or submissions with any Governmental
Entity and will cooperate in responding to any inquiry from a
Governmental Entity, including promptly informing the other parties of such
inquiry, consulting in advance before making any presentations or submissions
to a Governmental Entity, and supplying each other with copies of all material
correspondence, filings or communications between either party and any
Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement. To the extent reasonably
practicable, the parties and their Representatives shall have the right to
review in advance and each of the parties will consult the others on, all
the information relating to the other and each of their Affiliates that
appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other Transactions,
except that confidential competitively sensitive business information may be
redacted from such exchanges. To the extent reasonably practicable, none of
the parties shall, nor shall they permit their respective Representatives to,
participate independently in any meeting or engage in any substantive
conversation with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filing,
investigation or other inquiry without giving the other party prior notice of
such meeting or conversation and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
without giving the other parties the opportunity to attend or participate
(whether by telephone or in person) in any such meeting with such Governmental
Entity.

  



  

(c)  In connection with obtaining any approval or consent from
any Person with respect to the Merger, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
of the Company shall pay or commit to pay to any Person whose approval or
consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any
accommodation or commitment or incur any liability or other obligation to such
Person without the prior written consent of Parent. The parties shall
cooperate to obtain such consents.

  



  

6.9 _  _ _Employee Matters_. Nothing in this Agreement shall
constitute an amendment to, or be construed as amending, any Employee Benefit
Plan sponsored, maintained or contributed to by the Company, Parent or any of
their respective Subsidiaries.

  



  

   

58

 



    



  

6.10  Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.

  



  

(a)  Without limiting any other rights that any Indemnified
Person (as defined below) may have pursuant to the Company's Organizational
Documents, any employment agreement or any indemnification agreement in effect
on the date hereof or otherwise (which agreements shall be assumed by Parent
and the Surviving Company), from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, indemnify,
defend and hold harmless each Person who is now, or has been at any time
prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes prior to the Effective
Time, a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is
or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
limited liability company, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (the 
"Indemnified Persons") against and from all losses, claims, damages, costs,
fines, penalties, expenses (including attorneys' and other professionals'
fees and expenses), liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in
settlement of, or incurred in connection with any threatened or actual
Proceeding to which such Indemnified Person is a party or is
otherwise involved (including as a witness) based, in whole or in part, on or
arising, in whole or in part, out of the fact that such Person is or was a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was
serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
limited liability company, joint venture, Employee Benefit Plan, trust or
other enterprise or by reason of anything done or not done by such Person in
any such capacity, whether pertaining to any act or omission occurring or
existing prior to, at or after the Effective Time and whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time ("Indemnified Liabilities"),
including all Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part on, or
arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to, this Agreement or the
Transactions, in each case, to the extent any such Indemnified Person is
entitled to be so indemnified by the Company or its Subsidiaries on the date
hereof. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any such Proceeding is
brought or threatened to be brought against any Indemnified Persons (whether
arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) the Indemnified Persons may
retain the Company's regularly engaged legal counsel or other counsel
satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, and Parent and the Surviving
Company shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the
Indemnified Persons as promptly as statements therefor are received, and (ii)
the Surviving Company shall use its best efforts to assist in the defense of
any such matter. Any Indemnified Person wishing to claim indemnification or
advancement of expenses under this _Section 6.10_ , upon learning of any such
Proceeding, shall notify the Surviving Company ( _provided_ , that the
failure so to notify shall not relieve a party from any obligations that it
may have under this _Section 6.10_ except to the extent such failure
materially prejudices such party's position with respect to such claims).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, Parent
or the Surviving Company, as applicable, (i) shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without their prior written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) and (ii) shall not have
any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Person to the extent that a court
of competent jurisdiction shall determine in a final and non-appealable order
that such indemnification is prohibited by applicable Law, in which case the
Indemnified Person shall promptly refund to Parent or the Surviving
Company the amount of all such expenses theretofore advanced pursuant hereto,
if any.

  



  

(b)  Parent and the Surviving Company shall not amend, repeal or
otherwise modify any provision in the Organizational Documents of the
Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries in any manner that would affect (or
manage the Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries, with the intent to or in a
manner that would affect) adversely the rights thereunder or under the
Organizational Documents of the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries
of any Indemnified Person to indemnification, exculpation and advancement
except to the extent required by applicable Law. Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to, fulfill and honor any
indemnification, expense advancement or exculpation agreements between the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of its directors, officers or
employees existing on the date of this Agreement.

  



  

   

59

 



    



  

(c)  The Company shall put in place, and fully prepay
immediately prior to the Effective Time, "tail" insurance policies with a
claims period of at least six years from the Effective Time from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's current
insurance carrier with respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance
in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the Company's existing
policies with respect to matters, acts or omissions existing or occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(d)  In the event that Parent, the Surviving Company or any
Subsidiary of the Surviving Company, or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Company or such
Subsidiary of the Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.10_. Parent and the Surviving
Company shall not sell, transfer, distribute or otherwise dispose of any of
their assets or the assets of any Subsidiary in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to render Parent or the Surviving Company unable to
satisfy their obligations under this _Section 6.10_. The provisions of this
_Section 6.10_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, the parties and each Person entitled to indemnification or
insurance coverage or expense advancement pursuant to this _Section 6.10_ ,
and his, her or its heirs and representatives. The rights of the Indemnified
Persons under this _Section 6.10_ are in addition to any rights such
Indemnified Persons may have under the Organizational Documents of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable contracts or Law. Parent
and the Surviving Company shall pay all expenses, including attorneys'
fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Person in enforcing the
indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 6.10_.

  



  

6.11 _  _ _Stockholder Litigation._ In the event any Transaction
Litigation is commenced, the parties agree to cooperate and use their
reasonable best efforts to defend against and respond thereto. Each party
shall give the other party a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
defense or settlement of any Transaction Litigation and shall consider in good
faith the other party's advice with respect to such Transaction Litigation;
_provided_ , that the Company shall not agree to settle any Transaction
Litigation without the prior written consent of Parent.

  



  

6.12 _  _ _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with
respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to
be reasonably agreed upon by the parties. From and after the date hereof, so
long as this Agreement is in effect, neither the Company nor Parent, nor any
of their respective controlled Affiliates or Subsidiaries, nor the Parent
Manager, shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other
announcement with respect to the Merger or this Agreement without the prior
consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), unless (a) such party determines, after consultation
with outside counsel, that it is required by applicable Law or the rules of
any stock exchange upon which such party's capital stock is traded to issue
or cause the publication of any press release or other announcement with
respect to the Transactions, including the Merger or this Agreement, in which
event such party shall endeavor, on a basis reasonable under the
circumstances, to provide a meaningful opportunity to the other party to
review and comment upon such press release or other announcement and shall
give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto or (b) in the case of the Company or Parent, it deems it
necessary or appropriate to issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other announcement with respect to the Merger, this
Agreement or the other Transactions in connection with or following a Company
Change of Recommendation or a Parent Change of Recommendation, respectively;
_provided, however_ , each party and their respective controlled Affiliates
may make statements that are not inconsistent with previous press releases,
public disclosures or public statements made by Parent and the Company in
compliance with this _Section 6.12_.

  



  

   

60

 



    



  

6.13 _  _ _Control of Business._ Without limiting in any way any
party's rights or obligations under this Agreement, nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give any party, directly or indirectly, the right to control
or direct the other party and their respective Subsidiaries' operations prior
to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of the parties shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries' respective operations.

  



  

6.14 _  _ _Transfer Taxes._ Parent and the Company shall cooperate
in attempting to minimize the amount of Transfer Taxes. All Transfer Taxes
incurred in connection with the Transactions shall be paid 50% by the Company
and 50% by Parent, whether levied on Parent or any other Person, and the
Company shall cooperate with Merger Sub and Parent in preparing, executing and
filing any Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes.

  



  

6.15 _  _ _Notification._ The Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, (a) of any notice
or other communication received by such party from any Governmental Entity in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger or the other Transactions, or from
any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the Merger or the other Transactions, if the subject matter
of such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent
could be material to the Company, the Surviving Company or Parent, (b) of any
Proceeding commenced or, to any party's knowledge, threatened against, such
party or any of its Affiliates or otherwise relating to, involving or
affecting such party or any of its Affiliates, in each case, in connection
with, arising from or otherwise relating to the Merger or any other
Transaction ("Transaction Litigation"), and (c) upon becoming aware of the
occurrence or impending occurrence of any event or circumstance relating to
it or any of the Subsidiaries of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries of
Parent, respectively, which would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be, or which would reasonably
be expected to prevent or materially delay or impede the consummation of the
Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that in each case, the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this _Section 6.15_ shall not cure any breach of any
representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such matter prior to the
date of this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available
hereunder to any party. The failure to deliver any such notice shall not
affect any of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ or give rise to any
right to terminate under _Article VIII_.

  



  

   

61

 



    



  

6.16 _  _ _Section 16 Matters._ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall take all such steps as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable to cause any dispositions of equity securities of the
Company (including derivative securities) and acquisitions of equity
securities of Parent (including derivative securities) in connection with this
Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to the Company, or will become subject to such reporting
requirements with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the

reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization

(a)  Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall declare a
dividend to its stockholders, the payment date for which shall be the close

funds being legally available therefor. The record date for such dividends
shall be three (3) Business Days before the payment date. The per share
dividend amount payable by the Company pursuant to this _Section 6.19(a)_
shall be an amount equal to (i) the Company's then-most recent quarterly
dividend (on a per share basis), multiplied by the number of days elapsed
since the last dividend record date through and including the day prior to
the Closing Date, and divided by the actual number of days in the calendar
quarter in which such dividend is declared, plus (ii) an additional amount
(the "Company Additional Dividend Amount"), if any, necessary so that the
aggregate dividend payable is equal to the Minimum Distribution Dividend. The
Company and Parent shall cooperate in good faith to determine whether it is
necessary to authorize and declare a Company Additional Dividend Amount and
the amount (if any) of the Company Additional Dividend Amount.

  



  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall declare a
dividend to its stockholders, the payment date for which shall be the close

dividend amount payable by Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.19(b)_ shall be
an amount equal to (i) Parent's then-most recent quarterly dividend (on a per
share basis), multiplied by the number of days elapsed since the last dividend
record date through and including the day prior to the Closing Date, and
divided by the actual number of days in the calendar quarter in which
such dividend is declared, plus (ii) an additional amount (the "Parent
Additional Dividend Amount") equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the
(x) Company Additional Dividend Amount (if any) by (y) the Exchange Ratio

foregoing, to take all action necessary so that the Merger and the other
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize
the effect of such Takeover Law on the Merger and the other Transactions.

  



  

6.21 _  _ _Delisting._ Each of the parties agrees to cooperate with
the other parties in taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary to
delist each of the Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock from the

a manner that the Surviving Company will not be required to file any periodic
reports under the Exchange Act after the Effective Time; _provided_ that such
delisting and termination shall not be effective until after the Effective
Time.

  



  

6.22 _  _ _Obligations of Merger Sub._ Parent shall take all action

Fee:

  



  

(i) The amount payable to the Company in any tax year of the
Company shall not exceed the lesser of (A) the Termination Fee payable to the
Company and (B) the sum of (1) the maximum amount that can be paid to the
Company without causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of
Sections 856(c)(2) and 856(c)(3) of the Code for the relevant tax year,
determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income
described in Sections 856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the Code ("Qualifying
Income") and the Company has income from unknown sources during such year in
an amount equal to 1% of its gross income which is not Qualifying Income (in
addition to any known or anticipated income which is not Qualifying Income),
in each case, as determined by the Company's independent accountants, _plus_
(2) in the event that the Company received either (x) a letter from the
Company's counsel indicating that the Company has received a ruling from the

agreed upon by the Company, Parent and the escrow agent. The payment or
deposit into escrow of the Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 8.3_
shall be made at the time Parent is obligated to pay the Termination Fee. The
escrow agent shall provide that the Termination Fee in escrow or any portion
thereof shall not be released to the Company unless the escrow agent receives
any one or a combination of the following: (A) a letter from the Company's
independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the
escrow agent to the Company without causing the Company to fail to meet the
requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the Code determined as if
the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income and the
Company has income from unknown sources during such year in an amount equal
to 1% of its gross income which is not Qualifying Income (in addition to any
known or anticipated income which is not Qualifying Income), in which case
the escrow agent shall release such amount to the Company, or (B) a letter
from the Company's counsel indicating that (1) the Company has received a
ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by the Company of the
Termination Fee should either constitute Qualifying Income or should be
excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and
856(c)(3) of the Code or (2) the Company's outside counsel has rendered a
legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by the Company of the Termination
Fee should either constitute Qualifying Income or should be excluded from
gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and 856(c)(3) of the
Code, in which case the escrow agent shall release the remainder of the
Termination Fee to the Company. Parent agrees to amend this _Section 8.3(i)_
at the reasonable request of the Company in order to (x) maximize that portion
of the Termination Fee that may be distributed to the Company hereunder
without causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of Sections
856(c)(2) and 856(c)(3) of the Code or (y) assist the Company in obtaining a
favorable ruling from the IRS or legal opinion from its outside counsel, in

and (B) the sum of (1) the maximum amount that can be paid to Parent without
causing Parent to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and
856(c)(3) of the Code for the relevant tax year, determined as if the payment
of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income and Parent has income
from unknown sources during such year in an amount equal to 1% of its
gross income which is not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or
anticipated income which is not Qualifying Income), in each case, as
determined by Parent's independent accountants, plus (2) in the event that
Parent received either (x) a letter from Parent's counsel indicating that
Parent has received a ruling from the IRS as described below or (y) an opinion
from Parent's outside counsel as described below, an amount equal to the
excess of the Termination Fee, less the amount payable under _clause (A)_
above.

  



  

(ii) To secure the Company's obligation to pay the amounts
described in _Section 8.3(j)(i)_ , the Company shall deposit into escrow the
amount in cash equal to the Termination Fee with an escrow agent selected by
the Company on such terms (subject to this _Section 8.3_ ) as shall be
mutually and reasonably agreed upon by the Company, Parent and the escrow
agent. The payment or deposit into escrow of the Termination Fee pursuant to
this _Section 8.3_ shall be made at the time the Company is obligated to pay
the Termination Fee. The escrow agent shall provide that the Termination Fee
in escrow or any portion thereof shall not be released to Parent unless the

from Parent's independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that can
be paid by the escrow agent to Parent without causing Parent to fail to meet
the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the Code determined as
if the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income and Parent

its gross income which is not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or
anticipated income which is not Qualifying Income), in which case the escrow
agent shall release such amount to Parent, or (B) a letter from Parent's
counsel indicating that (1) Parent has received a ruling from the IRS holding
that the receipt by Parent of the Termination Fee would either constitute
Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning
of Sections 856(c)(2) and 856(c)(3) of the Code or (2) Parent's outside
counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by Parent
of the Termination Fee should either constitute Qualifying Income or should
be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and
856(c)(3) of the Code, in which case the escrow agent shall release the
remainder of the Termination Fee to Parent. The Company agrees to amend this 
_Section 8.3(j)_ at the reasonable request of Parent in order to (x) maximize
that portion of the Termination Fee that may be distributed to Parent
hereunder without causing Parent to fail to meet the requirements of Sections
856(c)(2) and 856(c)(3) of the Code or (y) assist Parent in obtaining a
favorable ruling from the IRS or legal opinion from its outside counsel, in
each case, as described in this _Section 8.3(j)(ii)_. Any amount of the
Termination Fee that remains unpaid as of the end of a taxable year shall be
paid as soon as possible during the following taxable year, subject to the
foregoing limitation of this  _Section 8.3(j)_.

of independent counsel. Each party and its counsel cooperated in the drafting
and preparation of this Agreement and the documents referred to herein, and
any and all drafts relating thereto exchanged between the parties shall be
deemed the work product of the parties and may not be construed against any
party by reason of its preparation. Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal
decision that would require interpretation of any ambiguities in this
Agreement against any party that drafted it is of no application and is hereby
expressly waived.

  



  

(b) The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure

or acknowledgment, in and of itself and solely by virtue of the inclusion of
such information in the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure

such items are material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, or Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as the case may

absence of an appropriate section of the Company Disclosure Letter or
Parent Disclosure Letter with respect to such other representations or
warranties or an appropriate cross reference thereto.

(c) The specification of any dollar amount in the representations
and warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in the Company
Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter is not intended and shall not
be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment of the materiality of such

between the parties to determine whether any obligation, item or matter
(whether or not described herein or included in any schedule) is or is not
material for purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

(d) All references in this Agreement to Annexes, Exhibits,
Schedules, Articles, Sections, subsections and other subdivisions refer

the same agreement and shall become effective when two or more counterparts
have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it

Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as

Person who controls the Company. To the fullest extent permitted by

9.11 Remedies; Specific Performance.

  



  

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and
not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon
such party and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude
the exercise of any other remedy.

  



  

(b) The parties agree that irreparable damage, for which monetary
damages would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached by the parties. Prior to the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_ , it is accordingly
agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, or
any other appropriate form of specific performance or equitable relief, to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of competent jurisdiction, in each case in
accordance with this _Section 9.11_ , this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled under the terms of this Agreement at law or
in equity.

  



  

(c) This parties' rights in this _Section 9.11_ are an integral
part of the Transactions and each party accordingly agrees not to raise any
objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance
to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such party under this
Agreement all in accordance with the terms of this _Section 9.11_. Each party
further agrees that no other party or any other Person shall be required to
obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or
as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section 9.11_,
and each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the
obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. If
prior to the End Date, any party hereto brings an action to
enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by
any other party, the End Date shall automatically be extended by such other
time period established by the court presiding over such action.

  



  

9.12 _ _ _Amendment. _ This Agreement may be amended by the parties,
by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors at
any time before or after adoption of this Agreement by the Company
Stockholders or the Parent Stockholders, but, after any such adoption, no
amendment shall be made which by Law would require the further approval by
such stockholders without first obtaining such further approval. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties.

  



  

   

78

 



    



  

9.13 _ _ _Extension; Waiver._ At any time prior to the Effective
Time, either the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, may, to the extent legally allowed and except as otherwise set
forth herein, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or acts of the other party hereunder; (b) waive any inaccuracies
in the representations and warranties of the other party contained herein or
in any document delivered pursuant hereto; and (c) waive compliance with any
of the agreements or conditions of the other party contained herein.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, on the one
hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, in exercising any right
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right
hereunder. No agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid unless set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such party.

sum sufficient for such payment is not set apart, all dividends declared upon
the Series B Preferred Stock and any other class or series of Parity Stock
shall be declared ratably in proportion to the respective amounts of dividends
accumulated, accrued and unpaid on the Series B Preferred Stock and
accumulated, accrued and unpaid on such Parity Stock. Except as set forth
in the preceding sentence, unless dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock
equal to the full amount of accumulated, accrued and unpaid dividends have
been or contemporaneously are declared and paid, or declared and a sum
sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for such payment for all past
dividend periods, no dividends (other than dividends paid in Junior Stock
or options, warrants or rights to subscribe for or purchase such Junior
Stock) shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment with respect to any
class or series of Parity Stock. Unless full cumulative dividends on the
Series B Preferred Stock have been paid or declared and set apart for payment
for all past dividend periods, no dividends (other than dividends paid in
Junior Stock or options, warrants or rights to subscribe for or purchase such
Junior Stock) shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment with respect
to any Junior Stock, nor shall any Junior Stock or Parity Stock be redeemed,
purchased or otherwise acquired (except for purposes of an employee benefit
plan) for any consideration, or any monies be paid to or made available for a
sinking fund for the redemption of any Junior Stock or Parity Stock (except by
conversion or exchange for Junior Stock, or options, warrants or rights to
subscribe for or purchase Junior Stock), nor shall any other cash or
property be paid or distributed to or for the benefit of holders of Junior
Stock or Parity Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation shall
not be prohibited from (i) declaring or paying or setting apart for payment
any dividend or distribution on any Parity Stock or (ii) redeeming,
purchasing or otherwise acquiring any Junior Stock or Parity Stock, in each
case, if such declaration, payment, redemption, purchase or other acquisition
is necessary to maintain the Corporation's qualification as a real estate
investment trust for federal income tax purposes ("REIT").

  



  

  



  



  

1 To be the last dividend payment date before the Effective Time of the Merger
(provided that if such Effective Time occurs after the dividend record date
for a dividend and before the dividend payment date for such dividend, such
date shall be the dividend payment date for such dividend).

  



  

2 To be the first dividend payment date after the Effective Time of the Merger
(provided that if such Effective Time occurs after the dividend record date
for a dividend and before the dividend payment date for such dividend, such
date shall be the scheduled dividend payment date for the next succeeding
dividend).

   



  

   

2

 



    



  

(c)  No dividends on Series B Preferred Stock shall be
authorized by the Board or declared or paid or set apart for payment at such
time as the terms and provisions of any agreement, including any agreement
relating to the Corporation's indebtedness, prohibits such authorization,
declaration, payment or setting apart for payment or provides that such
authorization, declaration, payment or setting apart for payment would
constitute a breach thereof or a default thereunder, or if such authorization,
declaration, payment or setting apart for payment shall be restricted or
prohibited by law.

  



  

(d)  If, for any taxable year, the Corporation elects to
designate as "capital gain dividends" (as defined in Section 857 of the
Internal Revenue Code) any portion of the dividends (as determined for federal
income tax purposes) paid or made available for the year to holders of all
classes of capital stock, then the portion of the capital gains amount that
shall be allocable to the holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall be the
amount that the total dividends (as determined for federal income tax
purposes) paid or made available to the holders of the Series B Preferred
Stock for the year bears to the total dividends (as determined for federal
income tax purposes) paid or made available for the year to holders of all
classes of capital stock.

  



  

(e)  In determining for purposes of Section 2-311 of the
Maryland General Corporation Law or otherwise under the Maryland
General Corporation Law whether a distribution (other than upon voluntary or
involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation), by
dividend, redemption or otherwise, is permitted, amounts that would be needed,
if the Corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to
satisfy the liquidation preference of any series of preferred stock with
preferential rights on dissolution senior to the Series B Preferred Stock (as
discussed in Section 4 below) will not be added to the Corporation's total
liabilities.

  



  

(4)  Liquidation Preference.

  



  

(a) Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution
or winding up of the Corporation, before any payment or distribution shall be
made to or set apart for the holders of any Junior Stock, the holders of
Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive a liquidation
preference of $25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to all accumulated,
accrued and unpaid dividends (whether or not earned or declared) to the date
of final distribution to such holders, but such holders shall not be entitled
to any further payment. If upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
the Corporation, its assets, or proceeds thereof, distributable among the
holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to pay in full the
above described preferential amount and liquidating payments on any other
shares of any class or series of Parity Stock, then such assets, or the
proceeds thereof, shall be distributed among the holders of Series B Preferred
Stock and any such other Parity Stock ratably in the same proportion as the
respective amounts that would be payable on such Series B Preferred Stock and
any such other Parity Stock if all amounts payable thereon were paid in full.

  



  

   

3

 



    



  

(b)  Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, after payment shall have been made in full to the holders of
Series B Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock, any other series or class or
classes of Junior Stock shall be entitled to receive any and all assets
remaining to be paid or distributed, and the holders of the Series B Preferred
Stock shall not be entitled to share therein.

  



  

(c)  Written notice of any such liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation, stating the payment date or dates when, and
the place or places where, the amounts distributable in such circumstances
shall be payable, shall be given by first class mail, postage pre-paid, not
less than 30 or more than 60 days prior to the payment date stated therein, to
each record holder of the Series B Preferred Stock at the respective
addresses of such holders as the same shall appear on the stock transfer
records of the Corporation.

  



  

(d)  None of a consolidation or merger of the Corporation with
or into another entity, a merger of another entity with or into the
Corporation, a statutory stock exchange by the Corporation or a sale, lease or
conveyance of all or substantially all of the Corporation's property or
business shall be considered a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation.

  



  

(e)  The liquidation preference of the outstanding shares of
Series B Preferred Stock will not be added to the liabilities of the
Corporation for the purpose of determining whether under the Maryland General
Corporation Law a distribution may be made to stockholders of the Corporation
whose preferential rights upon dissolution of the Corporation are junior to
those of holders of Series B Preferred Stock.

  



  

 _(5)  Redemption by Holders._ Shares of Series B Preferred
Stock are not redeemable at any time at the option of the holders thereof.

  



  

(6)  Redemption by the Corporation.

  



  

 _(a)  Redemption Right_

  



  

(i)  The Series B Preferred Stock shall not be subject to any
sinking fund or mandatory redemption. In addition, the Series B Preferred
Stock shall be subject to the provisions of Article VII of the Charter
pursuant to which Series B Preferred Stock owned by a stockholder in excess
of the Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit shall automatically be transferred to a
Trust for the exclusive benefit of a Charitable Beneficiary, as provided in
Article VII of the Charter.

  



  

(ii)  The Corporation, at its option, upon giving notice as
provided below, may redeem Series B Preferred Stock, in whole or from time to
time in part, at a cash redemption price equal to 100% of the liquidation
preference plus all accrued and unpaid dividends to the date fixed for
redemption. The redemption date shall be selected by the Corporation and shall
not be less than 30 days nor more than 60 days after the date notice of
redemption is sent. Any date fixed for redemption pursuant to this Section 6
is referred to herein as a "Redemption Date."

  

     



  

   

4

 



    



  

(b)   _Limitations on Redemption_.

  



  

(i)  If fewer than all of the outstanding shares of Series B
Preferred Stock are to be redeemed at the option of the Corporation pursuant
to Section 6(a) above, the number of shares to be redeemed shall be determined
by the Board and the shares to be redeemed will be selected by the Board pro
rata from the holders of record of such shares in proportion to the number of
such shares held by such holders or by lot or by any other equitable manner
as prescribed by the Board. If such redemption is to be by lot and, as a
result of such redemption, any holder of shares of Series B Preferred Stock
would Beneficially Own or Constructively Own, in excess of the Aggregate
Stock Ownership Limit because such holder's shares of Series B Preferred Stock
were not redeemed, or were only redeemed in part, then, except as otherwise
provided in the Charter, the Corporation will redeem the requisite number of
shares of Series B Preferred Stock from such holder such that he will not hold
in excess of the Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit subsequent to such
redemption.

  



  

(ii)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
unless full cumulative dividends on all shares of Series B Preferred Stock
shall have been or contemporaneously are authorized, declared and paid or
authorized, declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart
for payment for all past dividend periods and the then current dividend
period, no shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be redeemed unless all
outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock are simultaneously redeemed;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prevent the purchase or
acquisition of shares of Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to a purchase or
exchange offer made on the same terms to holders of all outstanding shares of
Series B Preferred Stock. In addition, unless full cumulative dividends on
all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock have been or
contemporaneously are authorized, declared and paid or authorized, declared
and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for payment for all
past dividend periods and the then current dividend period, the Corporation
shall not purchase or otherwise acquire directly or indirectly for any
consideration, nor shall any monies be paid to or made available for a sinking
fund for the redemption of, any shares of Series B Preferred Stock or any
other class or series of Junior Stock or Parity Stock (except by conversion
into or exchange for shares of any class or series of Junior Stock).

  



  

(iii)  The foregoing provisions of subsections 6(b)(i) and (ii)
shall not prevent any other action by the Corporation pursuant to the Charter
or otherwise in order to ensure that the Corporation remains qualified as a
REIT for federal income tax purposes.

  



  

   

5

 



    



  

(c)   _Procedures for Redemption_.

  



  

(i) Notice of redemption of the Series B Preferred Stock
shall be mailed to each holder of record of the shares to be redeemed by
first class mail, postage prepaid at such holder's address as the same
appears on the stock records of the Corporation. Any notice which was mailed
as described above shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given on
the date mailed whether or not the holder receives the notice. In addition to
any information required by law or by the applicable rules of the exchange
upon which the Series B Preferred Stock may be listed or admitted to trading,
each notice shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the redemption price;
(iii) the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be redeemed; and
(iv) the place or places where certificates for such shares of Series B
Preferred Stock are to be surrendered for cash. Any such redemption may be
made conditional on such factors as may be determined by the Board and as set
forth in the notice of redemption.

  



  

(ii)  On or after the Redemption Date, each holder of shares of
Series B Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall present and surrender the
certificates representing his shares of Series B Preferred Stock to the
Corporation at the place designated in the notice of redemption and thereupon
the cash redemption price of such shares shall be paid to or on the order of
the person whose name appears on such certificate representing shares of
Series B Preferred Stock as the owner thereof and each surrendered certificate
shall be canceled. If fewer than all the shares represented by any such
certificate representing shares of Series B Preferred Stock are to be
redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed
shares.

  



  

(iii)  If notice of redemption has been mailed in accordance with
Section 6(c)(i) above and if the funds necessary for such redemption have
been set aside by the Corporation in trust for the benefit of the holders of
the Series B Preferred Stock so called for redemption, then from and after
the Redemption Date (unless the Corporation defaults in payment of the
redemption price), all dividends on the shares of Series B Preferred Stock
called for redemption in such notice shall cease to accumulate and all rights
of the holders thereof, except the right to receive the redemption price
thereof (including all accumulated and unpaid dividends up to the Redemption
Date), shall cease and terminate and such shares shall not thereafter be
transferred (except with the consent of the Corporation) on the Corporation's
books, and such shares shall not be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose
whatsoever. At its election, the Corporation, prior to a Redemption Date, may
irrevocably deposit the redemption price (including accumulated and unpaid
dividends) of the Series B Preferred Stock so called for redemption in trust
for the holders thereof with a bank or trust company, in which case the
redemption notice to holders of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be
redeemed shall (i) state the date of such deposit, (ii) specify the office of
such bank or trust company as the place of payment of the redemption price
and (iii) require such holders to surrender the certificates representing such
shares at such place on or about the date fixed in such redemption notice
(which may not be later than the Redemption Date) against payment of the
redemption price (including all accumulated and unpaid dividends to the
Redemption Date). Any interest or other earnings earned on the redemption
price (including accumulated and unpaid dividends) deposited with a bank or
trust company shall be paid to the Corporation. Any monies so deposited which
remain unclaimed by the holders of Series B Preferred Stock at the end of two
years after the Redemption Date shall be returned by such bank or trust
company to the Corporation.

  



  

   

6

 



    



  

(d)   _Status of Redeemed Shares_. Any shares of Series B
Preferred Stock that shall at any time have been redeemed shall, after such
redemption, have the status of authorized but unissued Preferred Stock,
without designation as to class or series until such shares are once more
designated as part of a particular class or series by the Board.

  



  

(7)  Voting Rights.

  



  

(a)  Holders of the Series B Preferred Stock shall not have any
voting rights, except as provided by law and as described below.

  



  

(b)  If and whenever dividends on any shares of Series B
Preferred Stock shall be in arrears for six or more quarterly
periods, whether or not such quarterly periods are consecutive (a "Preferred
Dividend Default"), the holders of such shares of Series B Preferred Stock
(voting together as a single class with all other classes or series of capital
stock ranking on a parity with the Series B Preferred Stock as to the payment
of dividends and the distribution of assets upon any voluntary or involuntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation upon which like
voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable ("Parity Preferred
Stock")) shall be entitled to vote for the election of a total of two
additional directors of the Corporation (the "Preferred Stock Directors") who
shall each be elected for one-year terms. Such election shall be held at a
special meeting called by an officer of the Corporation at the request of the
holders of record of at least 10% of the outstanding shares of Series B
Preferred Stock or the holders of shares of any other class or series
of Parity Preferred Stock so in arrears, unless such request is received less
than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of
stockholders, in which case the vote for such two directors will be held at
the earlier of the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, and at
each subsequent annual meeting until all dividends accumulated on such shares
of Series B Preferred Stock for the past dividend periods and the dividend
for the then current dividend period shall have been fully paid or declared
or authorized and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside for
payment in full. In such cases, the entire Board automatically shall be
increased by two directors. On any matter on which the holders of Series B
Preferred Stock are entitled to vote (as expressly provided herein or as may
be required by law), including any action by written consent, each share of
Series B Preferred Stock shall have one vote per share, except that when
shares of any other series of Preferred Stock shall have the right to vote
with the Series B Preferred Stock as a single class on any matter, then the
Series B Preferred Stock and such other class or series shall have with
respect to such matters one vote per $25.00 of stated liquidation preference.
With respect to each matter on which the holders of Series B Preferred Stock
are entitled to vote, the holder of each share of Series B Preferred
Stock may designate a number of proxies equal to the number of votes to which
the share is entitled, with each such proxy having the right to vote a whole
number of votes on behalf of such holder.

  



  

The procedures in this Section 7(b) for the calling of meetings and the
election of directors will, to the extent permitted by law,
supersede anything inconsistent contained in the Charter or Bylaws of the
Corporation and, without limitation to the foregoing, the Bylaws of the
Corporation will not be applicable to the election of directors by holders of
Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 7. Notwithstanding the
Bylaws of the Corporation, the number of directors constituting the entire
Board will be automatically increased to include the directors to be elected
pursuant to this Section 7(b).

  



  

   

7

 



    



  

(c)  If and when all accumulated dividends and the dividend for
the current dividend period on the Series B Preferred Stock shall have been
paid in full or set aside for payment in full, the holders of shares of Series
B Preferred Stock shall be divested of the voting rights set forth in Section
7(b) herein (subject to revesting in the event of each and every Preferred
Dividend Default) and, if all accumulated dividends and the dividend for the
current dividend period have been paid in full or set aside for payment in
full on all other classes or series of Parity Preferred Stock, the term of
office of each Preferred Stock Director so elected shall terminate and the
number of directors constituting the board of directors shall be reduced
accordingly. So long as a Preferred Dividend Default shall continue, any
vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director may be filled by written
consent of the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if there is
no such remaining director, by vote of holders of a majority of
the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock and any other such series
of Parity Preferred Stock voting as a single class. Any Preferred Stock
Director may be removed at any time with or without cause by the vote of, and
shall not be removed otherwise than by the vote of, the holders of record of
a majority of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock and any other
series of Parity Preferred Stock voting as a single class. The Preferred
Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter
presented to the Board.

  



  

(d)  The affirmative vote or consent of at least 66-2/3% of the
votes entitled to be cast by the holders of the outstanding shares of Series
B Preferred Stock and the holders of all other classes or series of preferred
stock entitled to vote on such matters, voting as a single class, in addition
to any other vote required by the Charter or Maryland law, will be required
to: (i) authorize the creation of, the increase in the authorized amount of,
or the issuance of any shares of any class of Senior Stock or any
security convertible into shares of any class of Senior Stock or (ii) amend,
alter or repeal any provision of, or add any provision to, the Charter,
including the articles supplementary establishing the Series B Preferred
Stock, whether by merger, consolidation or other business combination (in any
such case, an "Event") or otherwise if such action would materially
adversely affect the powers, rights or preferences of the holders of the
Series B Preferred Stock. Neither (i) an amendment of the Charter to
authorize, create, or increase the authorized amount of Junior Stock or any
shares of any class of Parity Stock, including additional Series B Preferred
Stock, nor (ii) an Event, so long as the Series B Preferred Stock remains
outstanding with the terms thereof materially unchanged, taking into account
that upon the occurrence of such Event the Corporation may not be the
surviving entity, shall be deemed to materially adversely affect the voting
powers, rights or preferences of the holders of Series B Preferred Stock. No
such vote of the holders of Series B Preferred Stock as described above shall
be required if provision is made to redeem all Series B Preferred Stock at or
prior to the time such amendment, alteration or repeal is to take effect, or
when the issuance of any such shares or convertible securities is to be made,
as the case may be.

  



  

(e) The foregoing voting provisions shall not apply if, at or
prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote
would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding shares of
Series B Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed or called for redemption
upon proper notice and sufficient funds shall have been deposited in trust to
effect such redemption.

 _(8)  Restrictions on Transfer, Acquisition and Redemption of
Shares._ The Series B Preferred Stock is governed by and issued subject to
all of the limitations, terms and conditions of the Corporation's Charter,
including but not limited to the terms and conditions (including exceptions
and exemptions) of Article VII of the Charter; provided, however, that the
terms and conditions (including exceptions and exemptions) of Article VII of
the Charter shall also be applied to the Series B Preferred Stock
separately and without regard to any other series or class. The foregoing
sentence shall not be construed to limit the applicability of any other term
or provision of the Charter to the Series B Preferred Stock. In addition to
the legend contemplated by Article VII, Section 7.2.9 of the Charter, each
certificate for Series B Preferred Stock shall bear substantially the
following legend:

  



  

"The Corporation will furnish to any stockholder on request and without
charge a full statement of the designations and any preferences, conversion
and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends,
qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption of the stock of each
class which the Corporation is authorized to issue, to the extent they have
been set, and of the authority of the Board of Directors to set the relative
rights and preferences of a subsequent series of a preferred or special class
of stock. Such request may be made to the Secretary of the Corporation or to
its transfer agent."

  



  

 _(9)  Conversion._ The shares of Series B Preferred Stock are
not convertible or exchangeable for any other property or securities of the
Corporation.

  



  

 _(10)  Settlement._ Nothing in this Article Second shall be
interpreted to preclude the settlement of any transaction entered into
through the facilities of the NYSE or other securities exchange or an
automated inter-dealer quotation system.

  



  

THIRD: These Articles Supplementary have been approved by the Board in the
manner and by the vote required by law.

  



  

FOURTH: These Articles Supplementary shall be effective at the time the State
Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland accepts these Articles
Supplementary for record.

READY CAPITAL CORPORATION

  

  



  

ARTICLES SUPPLEMENTARY ESTABLISHING AND FIXING THE

  

RIGHTS AND PREFERENCES OF A SERIES OF SHARES OF

  

PREFERRED STOCK

  



  

READY CAPITAL CORPORATION, a Maryland corporation (hereinafter called the
"Corporation"), hereby certifies to the State Department of Assessments and
Taxation of Maryland that:

  



  

FIRST: Under a power contained in Section 2-208 of the Maryland General
Corporation Law and Article VI of the Corporation's charter (the  "Charter"),
the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the "Board") by resolutions duly
adopted, classified and designated 779,743 shares of the unissued preferred
stock, par value $.0001 per share, of the Corporation ("Preferred Stock"), as
6.25% Series C Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock and has provided for the
issuance of such series. Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined
herein have the meanings set forth in the Charter.

  



  

SECOND: The terms of the Preferred Stock as set by the Board and the pricing
committee thereof, including preferences, conversion or other rights, voting
powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends, qualifications, or terms or
conditions of redemption, are as follows:

  



  

 _(1)  Designation and Number._ A series of Preferred Stock of
the Corporation, designated as "6.25% Series C Cumulative Convertible
Preferred Stock" (the "Series C Preferred Stock"), is hereby established. The
par value of the Series C Preferred Stock is $.0001 per share. The number of
shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be 779,743.

  



  

 _(2)  Rank._ The Series C Preferred Stock shall, with respect
to dividend rights and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
the Corporation, rank (a) senior to all classes or series of Common Stock of
the Corporation and to all equity securities the terms of which specifically
provide that such equity securities rank junior to such Series C Preferred
Stock; (b) on parity with the Parity Stock; and (c) junior to all equity
securities issued by the Corporation the terms of which specifically
provide that such equity securities rank senior to the Series C Preferred
Stock. The term "equity securities" shall not include convertible debt
securities. The term "Parity Stock" means all classes and series of preferred
stock that the Corporation may issue ranking on parity with the Series C
Preferred Stock, including the Series A Preferred Stock, with respect to the
payments of distributions and rights to payment upon liquidation, dissolution
or winding up.

  



  

(3)  Dividends.

  



  

(a) Holders of the then outstanding shares of Series C
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when and as authorized by the
Board of Directors, out of funds legally available for the payment of
dividends, cumulative preferential cash dividends at the rate of 6.25% of the
$25.00 liquidation preference per annum (equivalent to a fixed annual amount
of $1.5625 per share). Such dividends shall be cumulative from [ • ], 20211
and shall be payable quarterly in arrears on or before January 15, April 15,
July 15 and October 15 of each year or, if not a business day, the next
succeeding business day (each, a "Dividend Payment Date"). Any dividend
payable on the Series C Preferred Stock for any partial dividend period shall
be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day
months. Dividends shall be payable to holders of record as they appear in the
stock records of the Corporation at the close of business on the applicable
record date, which shall be the last day of each of March, June, September
and December, as the case may be, immediately preceding the applicable
Dividend Payment Date (each, a "Dividend Record Date").

  



  

  



  

  

1 To be the last dividend payment date that occurs before the Effective Time
of the Merger (provided that if such Effective Time occurs after the dividend
record date for a dividend and before the dividend payment date for such
dividend, such date shall be the dividend payment date for such dividend).

  



  

   



 



    



  

(b)  No dividends on shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be
declared by the Corporation or paid or set apart for payment by the
Corporation at such time as the terms and provisions of any agreement of the
Corporation, including any agreement relating to its indebtedness, prohibit
such declaration, payment or setting apart for payment or provide that such
declaration, payment or setting apart for payment would constitute a breach
thereof or a default thereunder, or if such declaration or payment shall be
restricted or prohibited by law.

  



  

(c)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, dividends on the Series C
Preferred Stock shall accrue whether or not the terms and provisions set
forth in Section 3(b) hereof at any time prohibit the current payment of
dividends, whether or not the Corporation has earnings, whether or not there
are funds legally available for the payment of such dividends and whether or
not such dividends are declared. Accrued but unpaid dividends on the Series C
Preferred Stock shall accumulate as of the Dividend Payment Date on which they
first become payable.

  



  

(d)  Except as provided in Section 3(e) below, unless full
cumulative dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock have been
or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient
for the payment thereof is set apart for payment for all past dividend
periods and the then current dividend period, no dividends (other than
dividends in shares of Common Stock or dividends in shares of any series of
Preferred Stock ranking junior to the Series C Preferred Stock as to dividends
and upon liquidation) shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment nor
shall any other distribution be declared or made upon the Common Stock, or
any Preferred Stock of the Corporation ranking junior to or on a parity with
the Series C Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, nor shall
any shares of Common Stock, or any shares of Preferred Stock of the
Corporation ranking junior to or on a parity with the Series C Preferred
Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation be redeemed, purchased or otherwise
acquired for any consideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available
for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such shares) by the Corporation
(except by conversion into or exchange for other capital stock of the
Corporation ranking junior to the Series C Preferred Stock as to dividends
and upon liquidation and except for transfers made pursuant to the provisions
of Article VII of the Charter).

  



  

(e) When dividends are not paid in full (or a sum sufficient
for such full payment is not so set apart) on the Series C Preferred Stock
and the shares of any other series of Parity Stock, all dividends declared
upon the Series C Preferred Stock and the shares of any other series of
Parity Stock shall be declared pro rata so that the amount of dividends
declared per share of Series C Preferred Stock and the shares of any other
series of Parity Stock shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio
that accrued dividends per share on the Series C Preferred Stock and the
shares of any other series of Parity Stock (which shall not include any
accrual in respect of unpaid dividends for prior dividend periods if such
preferred stock does not have a cumulative dividend) bear to each other. No
interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of
any dividend payment or payments on Series C Preferred Stock which may be in
arrears.

  



  

   

2

 



    



  

(f)  Any dividend payment made on shares of the Series C
Preferred Stock shall first be credited against the earliest accrued but
unpaid dividend due with respect to such shares which remains payable. Holders
of Series C Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any dividend, whether
payable in cash, property or stock in excess of full cumulative dividends on
the Series C Preferred Stock as described above.

  



  

(4)  Liquidation Preference.

  



  

(a)  Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution
or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, the holders of shares of
Series C Preferred Stock then outstanding are entitled to be paid out of the
assets of the Corporation, legally available for distribution to its
stockholders, a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share, plus an amount
equal to any accrued and unpaid dividends (whether or not declared) to the
date of payment, before any distribution of assets is made to holders of
Common Stock or any series of Preferred Stock of the Corporation that ranks
junior to the Series C Preferred Stock as to liquidation rights.

  



  

(b)  In the event that, upon any such voluntary or involuntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the available assets of the
Corporation are insufficient to pay the amount of the liquidating
distributions on all outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock and the
corresponding amounts payable on all shares of other classes or series of
Parity Stock in the distribution of assets, then the holders of shares of
Series C Preferred Stock and stockholders of such classes or series of Parity
Stock shall share ratably in any such distribution of assets in proportion to
the full liquidating distributions to which they would otherwise be
respectively entitled.

  



  

(c)  After payment of the full amount of the liquidating
distributions to which they are entitled, the holders of Series C
Preferred Stock shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets
of the Corporation.

  



  

(d)  Written notice of any such liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation, stating the payment date or dates when, and
the place or places where, the amounts distributable in such circumstances
shall be payable, shall be given by first class mail, postage pre-paid, not
less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the payment date stated therein,
to each record holder of the Series C Preferred Stock at the respective
addresses of such holders as the same shall appear on the stock transfer
records of the Corporation.

  



  

(e) The consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into
any other corporation, trust or entity or of any other corporation with or
into the Corporation, or the sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially
all of the assets or business of the Corporation, shall not be deemed to
constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation.

 _(5)  Redemption._ Shares of Series C Preferred Stock are not
redeemable at any time by the Corporation or at the option of the holders
thereof.

  



  

(6)  Conversion.

  



  

(a)  Conversion Rights.

  



  

(i)  Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of
this Section 6, a holder of any share or shares of Series C Preferred Stock
shall have the right, at its option, to convert all or any portion of such
holder's outstanding Series C Preferred Stock (the "Conversion Right"),
subject to the conditions described below, into (i) an amount in cash equal
to $[____]2 per share of Series C Preferred Stock (the "Conversion Cash") and
(ii) the number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock
initially at a conversion rate of [____________]3 shares of Common Stock per
$25.00 liquidation preference (the "Conversion Rate"), which is equivalent to
an initial Conversion Price of approximately $[______]4 per share of Common
Stock (subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions of Section 7).
Such holder shall surrender to the Corporation such shares of Series C
Preferred Stock to be converted in accordance with the provisions in
paragraph (b) and (c) of this Section 6, as applicable.

  



  

(ii) In connection with the conversion of any shares of Series C
Preferred Stock, no fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued, but
the Corporation shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of any fractional
interest in an amount equal to the fractional interest multiplied by the
Closing Sale Price (as defined below) on a day during which trading in
securities generally occurs on the New York Stock Exchange or, if the Common
Stock is not listed on the New York Stock Exchange, on the principal other
United States national or regional securities exchange on which the Common
Stock is then listed (including the Nasdaq Global Market and the Nasdaq
Capital Market) or, if the Common Stock is not listed on a United States
national or regional securities exchange, on the principal other market on
which the Common Stock is then traded ("Trading Day") immediately prior to
the Conversion Date (as defined below) or the Corporation Conversion Option
Date (as defined below). If more than one share of Series C Preferred Stock
shall be surrendered for conversion by the same holder at the same time, the
number of full shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of those shares
of Series C Preferred Stock shall be computed on the basis of the total
number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock so surrendered. "Closing Sale
Price" means with regard to shares of the Common Stock, on any date, the
closing sale price per share (or if no closing sale price is reported, the
average of the closing bid and ask prices or, if more than one in either case,
the average of the average closing bid and the average closing ask prices) on
such date as reported on the principal United States national or regional
securities exchange on which shares of the Common Stock are traded (including
the Nasdaq Global Market and the Nasdaq Capital Market) or, if shares of the
Common Stock are not listed on a United States national or regional
securities exchange, as reported by the National Quotation Bureau
Incorporated, or in the absence of such a quotation, the Corporation shall
determine the closing sale price, in good faith, on the basis of such
quotations and other information as it considers, in its reasonable judgment,
appropriate.

  



  

  



  

  

2 Amount equal to the product of (i) the final Per Share Cash Consideration
payable in the Merger and (ii) the Conversion Rate applicable to shares of
Anworth Series B Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time of
the Merger.

  



  

3 Amount equal to the product of (i) the final Exchange Ratio in the Merger
and (ii) the Conversion Rate applicable to shares of Anworth Series B
Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger.

  



  

4 Amount equal to the product of (i) the final Exchange Ratio in the Merger
and (ii) the Conversion Price applicable to shares of Anworth Series B
Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger.

  



  

   

4

 



    



  

(iii)  A holder of Series C Preferred Stock is not entitled to any
rights of a holder of shares of Common Stock until that holder has converted
its Series C Preferred Stock, and only to the extent the Series C Preferred
Stock are deemed to have been converted to shares of Common Stock in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.

  



  

(iv)  The Corporation shall, prior to issuance of any shares of
Series C Preferred Stock hereunder, and from time to time as may be
necessary, reserve and keep available, free from preemptive rights, out of its
authorized but unissued Common Stock, for the purpose of effecting the
conversion of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock, such number of its duly
authorized Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect
the conversion of all shares of Series C Preferred Stock then outstanding
into such Common Stock at any time (assuming that, at the time of the
computation of such number of shares of Common Stock, all such shares of
Series C Preferred Stock would be held by a single holder). The Corporation
covenants that all shares of Common Stock which may be issued upon conversion
of Series C Preferred Stock shall upon issue be fully paid and nonassessable
and free from all liens and charges and, except as provided in Section 6(c),
taxes with respect to the issue thereof. The Corporation further covenants
that, if at any time the shares of Common Stock shall be listed on the New
York Stock Exchange or any other national securities exchange (including the
Nasdaq Global Market and the Nasdaq Capital Market) or quoted on an automated
quotation system, the Corporation shall, if permitted by the rules of such
exchange or automated quotation system, list and keep listed or quoted, so
long as the Common Stock shall be so listed or quoted on such exchange or
automated quotation system, all Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the
Series C Preferred Stock. Before the delivery of any securities that the
Corporation shall be obligated to deliver upon conversion of the shares of
Series C Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall comply with all applicable
federal and state laws and regulations.

  



  

(b)  Corporation Conversion Option.

  



  

(i) The Corporation shall have the option to require the
holders of the Series C Preferred Stock to convert all of the
outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock into that amount of Conversion
Cash and that number of shares of Common Stock that are issuable at the
Conversion Rate (as adjusted, the "Corporation Conversion Option"). The
Corporation may exercise the Corporation Conversion Option only if the
Closing Sale Price equals or exceeds 130% of the Conversion Price of the
Series C Preferred Stock for at least 20 Trading Days in a period of 30
consecutive Trading Days (including the last Trading Day of such period),
ending on the Trading Day prior to the Corporation's issuance of a press
release announcing its intent to exercise the Corporation Conversion Option
in accordance with Section 6(b)(ii).

  



  

   

5

 



    



  

(ii)  To exercise the Corporation Conversion Option right set
forth in this Section 6(b), the Corporation must issue a press release for
publication on the Dow Jones and Company, Inc., Business Wire or Bloomberg
Business News (or, if such organizations are not in existence at the time of
issuance of such press release, such other news or press organization as is
reasonably calculated to broadly disseminate the relevant information to the
public) prior to the opening of business on the first Trading Day
following any date on which the conditions set forth in Section 6(b)(i) shall
have been satisfied, announcing the Corporation's intention to exercise the
Corporation Conversion Option. The Corporation shall also give notice by mail
or by publication (with subsequent prompt notice by mail) to the holders of
the Series C Preferred Stock ("Notice") (not more than four Trading Days
after the date of the press release) of the Corporation Conversion Option
announcing the Corporation's intention to exercise the Corporation Conversion
Option. The conversion date (the "Corporation Conversion Option Date")
shall be on the date that is five Trading Days after the date on which the
Corporation issues such press release. In addition to any information
required by applicable law or regulation, the press release and Notice of a
Corporation Conversion Option shall state, as appropriate:

  



  

(1)  the Corporation Conversion Option Date;

  



  

(2)  the amount of Conversion Cash to be payable and the number
of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of each Series C
Preferred Stock;

  



  

(3)  the number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock to be
converted; and

  



  

(4)  that dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock to be
converted shall cease to accrue on the Corporation Conversion Option Date.

  



  

(iii)  Upon exercise of the Corporation Conversion Option and the
surrender of shares of the Series C Preferred Stock by a holder thereof, the
Corporation shall issue and shall deliver or cause to be issued and delivered
to such holder, or to such other person on such holder's written order (a)
certificates representing the number of validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable full shares of Common Stock to which a holder of shares of Series
C Preferred Stock being converted, or a holder's transferee, shall be
entitled plus (b) the Conversion Cash plus (c) any fractional interest in
respect of a share of Common Stock arising upon such conversion shall be
settled as provided in Section 6(a).

  



  

(iv) Each conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the
close of business on the Corporation Conversion Option Date so that
the rights of the holder thereof as to the Series C Preferred Stock being
converted shall cease except for the right to receive the Conversion Cash and
the number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock at the
Conversion Rate (subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions of
Section 7), and the person entitled to receive shares of Common Stock
shall be treated for all purposes as having become the record holder of those
shares of Common Stock at that time.

  



  

   

6

 



    



  

(v)  In lieu of the foregoing procedures, if the shares of
Series C Preferred Stock are held in global form, each holder of
beneficial interest in Series C Preferred Stock must comply with the
procedures of The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") to convert such holder's
beneficial interest in respect of the Series C Preferred Stock evidenced by a
global share of the Series C Preferred Stock.

  



  

(vi)  In case any shares of Series C Preferred Stock are to be
converted pursuant to this Section 6(b), such holder's right to voluntarily
convert its Series C Preferred Stock shall terminate at 5:00 p.m., New York
City time, on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Corporation
Conversion Option Date.

  



  

(c)  Conversion Right Procedures.

  



  

(i)  To exercise the Conversion Right as set forth in Section
6(a), a holder of the Series C Preferred Stock must surrender to the
Corporation at its principal office or at the office of the transfer agent of
the Corporation, as may be designated by the Board of Directors, the
certificate or certificates for the shares of Series C Preferred Stock to be
converted accompanied by a written notice stating that the holder of Series C
Preferred Stock elects to convert all or a specified whole number of those
shares in accordance with this Section 6(c) and specifying the name or names
in which the holder wishes the certificate or certificates for the shares of
Common Stock to be issued ("Conversion Notice"). In case the notice specifies
that the Conversion Cash or shares of Common Stock are to be issued in a name
or names other than that of the holder of Series C Preferred Stock,
the notice shall be accompanied by payment of all transfer taxes payable upon
the payment of the Conversion Cash and the issuance of shares of Common Stock
in that name or names. Other than those transfer taxes payable pursuant to the
preceding sentence, the Corporation shall pay any documentary, stamp or
similar issue or transfer taxes that may be payable in respect of any issuance
or delivery of Conversion Cash or shares of Common Stock upon conversion of
the shares of Series C Preferred Stock.

  



  

(ii) As promptly as practicable after the surrender of the
certificate or certificates for the shares of Series C Preferred Stock
in accordance with Section 6(c)(i), the receipt of the Conversion Notice and
payment of all required transfer taxes, if any, or the demonstration to the
Corporation's satisfaction that those taxes have been paid, the Corporation
shall issue and shall deliver or cause to be issued and delivered to such
holder, or to such other person on such holder's written order, (a) the
Conversion Cash and certificates representing the number of validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable full shares of Common Stock to which the holder
of the Series C Preferred Stock being converted, or the holder's transferee,
shall be entitled, (b) if less than the full number of Series C Preferred
Stock evidenced by the surrendered certificate or certificates is being
converted, a new certificate or certificates, of like tenor, for the
number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock evidenced by the surrendered
certificate or certificates, less the number of shares being converted, and
(c) any fractional interest in respect of a share of Common Stock arising upon
such conversion shall be settled as provided in Section 6(a)(ii).

  



  

   

7

 



    



  

(iii)  Each conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the
close of business on the date of giving the notice and of surrendering the
certificate or certificates representing the shares of the Series C Preferred
Stock to be converted (the "Conversion Date") so that the rights of the
holder thereof as to the Series C Preferred Stock being converted shall cease
except for the right to receive the Conversion Cash and the number of fully
paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Rate
(subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions of Section 7), and,
if applicable, the person entitled to receive shares of Common Stock shall be
treated for all purposes as having become the record holder of those shares of
Common Stock at that time.

  



  

(iv)  In lieu of the foregoing procedures, if the shares of Series
C Preferred Stock are held in global form, each holder of beneficial interest
in Series C Preferred Stock must comply with the procedures of DTC to convert
such holder's beneficial interest in respect of the Series C Preferred Stock
evidenced by a global share of the Series C Preferred Stock.

  



  

(v)  If a holder of Series C Preferred Stock has exercised its
right to require the Corporation to repurchase shares of Series C Preferred
Stock in accordance with Section 13 hereof, such holder's Conversion Rights
with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock so subject to repurchase shall
expire at 5:00PM, New York City time, on the Trading Day immediately preceding
the repurchase date, unless the Corporation defaults on the payment of the
purchase price. If a holder of Series C Preferred Stock has submitted any
such share for repurchase, such share may be converted only if such holder
submits a notice of withdrawal or complies with applicable DTC procedures.

  



  

(d)  Payment of Dividends.

  



  

(i)  Optional Conversion.

  



  

(A)  If a holder of shares of Series C Preferred Stock exercises
its Conversion Right, upon delivery of the Series C Preferred Stock for
conversion, those shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall cease to cumulate
dividends as of the end of the day immediately preceding the Conversion Date
and the holder shall not receive any cash payment representing accrued and
unpaid dividends of the Series C Preferred Stock, except in those limited
circumstances discussed in this Section 6(d). Except as provided herein,
the Corporation shall make no payment for accrued and unpaid dividends,
whether or not in arrears, on Series C Preferred Stock converted at a
holder's election pursuant to a Conversion Right, or for dividends on shares
of Common Stock issued upon such conversion.

  



  

(B)  If the Corporation receives a Conversion Notice before the
close of business on a Dividend Record Date, the holder shall not be entitled
to receive any portion of the dividend payable on such converted Series C
Preferred Stock on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date.

  



  

   

8

 



    



  

(C)   If the Corporation receives a Conversion Notice after the
Dividend Record Date but prior to the corresponding Dividend Payment Date,
the holder on the Dividend Record Date shall receive on that Dividend Payment
Date accrued dividends on those Series C Preferred Stock, notwithstanding the
conversion of those Series C Preferred Stock prior to that Dividend Payment
Date, because that holder shall have been the holder of record on the
corresponding Divided Record Date. However, at the time that such
holder surrenders the Series C Preferred Stock for conversion, the holder
shall pay to the Corporation an amount equal to the dividend that has accrued
and that shall be paid on the related Dividend Payment Date.

  



  

(D)  A holder of shares of Series C Preferred Stock on a Dividend
Record Date who exercises its Conversion Right and converts such Series C
Preferred Stock into Conversion Cash and Common Stock on or after the
corresponding Dividend Payment Date shall be entitled to receive the dividend
payable on such Series C Preferred Stock on such Dividend Payment Date, and
the converting holder need not include payment of the amount of such dividend
upon surrender for conversion of Series C Preferred Stock.

  



  

(ii)  Corporation Conversion Option.

  



  

(A)  If the Corporation exercises the Corporation Conversion
Option, whether the Corporation Conversion Option Date is prior to, on or
after the Dividend Record Date for the current period, all unpaid dividend
which are in arrears as of the Corporation Conversion Option Date shall be
payable to the holder of the Series C Preferred Stock.

  



  

(B)  If the Corporation exercises the Corporation Conversion
Option and the Corporation Conversion Option Date is a date that is prior to
the close of business on any Dividend Record Date, the holder shall not be
entitled to receive any portion of the dividend payable for such period on
such converted shares on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date.

  



  

(C)  If the Corporation exercises the Corporation Conversion
Option and the Corporation Conversion Option Date is a date that is on, or
after the close of business on, any Dividend Record Date and prior to the
close of business on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date, all dividends,
including accrued and unpaid dividends, whether or not in arrears, with
respect to the Series C Preferred Stock called for conversion on such date,
shall be payable on such Dividend Payment Date to the record holder of such
shares on such record date.

  



  

(7)  Adjustment of Conversion Rate.

  



  

(a) If the Corporation shall, while any shares of Series C
Preferred Stock are outstanding, issue Common Stock as a dividend
or distributions to all or substantially all of the holders of Common Stock
(other than pursuant to the Corporation's existing dividend reinvestment and
share purchase plan or any future dividend reinvestment and share purchase
plan the Corporation adopts which is not materially adverse to the holders of
shares of Series C Preferred Stock and in any case which is without
duplication subject to an adjustment under Section 7(e)), then the Conversion
Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the Record Date
(as defined below) fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to
receive such dividend or other distribution shall be adjusted by multiplying
such Conversion Rate by a fraction:

  



  

   

9

 



    



  

(i)  the numerator of which shall be the sum of (x) the total
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on such
Record Date and (y) the total number of shares of Common Stock constituting
such dividend or other distribution; and

  



  

(ii)  the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on such Record Date.

  



  

An adjustment made pursuant to this Section 7(a) shall become effective
immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the
Record Date fixed for such determination. If any dividend or distribution of
the type described in this Section 7(a) is declared but not so paid or made,
the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to the Conversion Rate which would
then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
"Record Date" means, with respect to any dividend, distribution or
other transaction or event in which the holders of Common Stock have the
right to receive any cash, securities or other property or in which the
Common Stock (or other applicable security) is exchanged for or converted into
any combination of cash, securities or other property, the date fixed for
determination of stockholders entitled to receive such cash, securities or
other property (whether such date is fixed by the Board of Directors or by
statute, contract or otherwise).

  



  

(b)  If the Corporation shall, at any time or from time to time
while any shares of Series C Preferred Stock are outstanding, subdivide,
combine reclassify, or split its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a
greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate in
effect immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the
day upon which such subdivision, combination, reclassification or split
becomes effective shall be adjusted by multiplying such Conversion Rate by a
fraction:

  



  

(i)  the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the opening of business on the
day following the day such subdivision, combination, reclassification or split
becomes effective; and

  



  

(ii)  the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the opening of business on the
day that such subdivision, combination, reclassification or split becomes
effective.

  



  

An adjustment made pursuant to this Section 7(b) shall become effective
immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the
day upon which such subdivision, reclassification, split or combination
becomes effective.

  



  

(c) If the Corporation shall, at any time or from time to time
while any shares of Series C Preferred Stock are outstanding, issue rights or
warrants for a period expiring within 60 days to all or substantially all
holders of its outstanding Common Stock entitling them to subscribe for or
purchase Common Stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for Common Stock), at a price per share of Common Stock (or
having a conversion, exchange or exercise price per share of Common Stock)
less than the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day
immediately preceding the date of the announcement by public notice of such
issuance or distribution (treating the conversion, exchange or exercise price
per share of Common Stock of the securities convertible, exchangeable or
exercisable into Common Stock as equal to (x) the sum of (i) the price for a
unit of the security convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for
Common Stock and (ii) any additional consideration initially payable upon the
conversion of or exchange or exercise for such security into Common Stock
divided by (y) the number of shares of Common Stock initially underlying such
convertible, exchangeable or exercisable security), then the Conversion Rate
shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening
of business on the date after such date of announcement by a fraction:

  



  

   

10

 



    



  

(i)  the numerator of which shall be the sum of (x) the number
of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date of
announcement, and (y) the total number of additional shares of Common Stock
issuable pursuant to such rights, warrants, options, other securities, or
convertible securities; and

  



  

(ii)  the denominator of which shall be the sum of (x) the number
of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the close of business on the date of
announcement, and (y) the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the
aggregate exercise price or conversion price payable to exercise or convert
such rights, warrants, options, other securities or convertible securities
divided by the average of the daily Closing Sale Prices per share of Common
Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Days immediately prior to such date
(subject to any adjustment as required pursuant to Section 7(g)) ("Current
Market Price") immediately preceding the date of announcement of the issuance
of such rights, warrants, options, other securities or convertible securities.

  



  

An adjustment made pursuant to this Section 7(c) shall become effective
immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the
Record Date for such issuance. If the shares of Common Stock are not
delivered pursuant to such rights, warrants, options, other securities, or
convertible securities upon the expiration or termination of such rights,
warrants, options, other securities, or convertible securities, the
Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate which would then be
in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights,
warrants, options, other securities, or convertible securities have been made
on the basis of the delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock
actually issued (or the number of shares of Common Stock actually issued upon
conversion, exchange, or exercise of such other securities). In determining
whether any rights, warrants options, other securities, or convertible
securities entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common
Stock at less than such Closing Sale Price, and in determining the aggregate
offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into
account any consideration received for such rights, warrants options, other
securities, or convertible securities, the value of such consideration if
other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors.

  



  

(d) (i) If the Corporation shall, at any time or from time to
time while any shares of Series C Preferred Stock are outstanding,
by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all or substantially all of the
holders of its outstanding shares of Common Stock (including any such
distribution made in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the
Corporation is the continuing corporation and the shares of Common Stock are
not changed or exchanged), shares of its capital stock, evidences of
the Corporation's indebtedness, or other assets or property, including
securities, (including capital stock of any subsidiary of the Corporation)
but excluding (i) dividends or distributions of Common Stock referred to in
Section 7(a), (ii) any rights or warrants referred to in Section 7(c), (iii)
dividends and distributions paid exclusively in cash referred to in Section
7(e) and (iv) dividends and distributions of stock, securities or other
property or assets (including cash) in connection with the reclassification,
change, merger, consolidation, combination, sale or conveyance to which
Section 7 applies (such capital stock, evidence of its indebtedness, other
assets or property or securities being distributed hereinafter in this
Section 7(d) called the "Distributed Assets"), then, in each such case, the
Conversion Rate shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Rate in
effect immediately prior to the close of business on the Record Date with
respect to such distribution by a fraction:

  



  

   

11

 



    



  

(A)  the numerator of which shall be the Current Market Price; and

  



  

(B)  the denominator of which shall be (x) such Current Market
Price, less (y) the Fair Market Value (as defined below) on such date of the
portion of the Distributed Assets so distributed with respect to each share of
Common Stock outstanding on the Record Date for such distribution. "Fair
Market Value" means the amount which a willing buyer would pay a willing
seller in an arm's length transaction (as determined by the Board of
Directors, whose determination shall be made in good faith and, absent
manifest error, shall be final and binding on holders of the Series C
Preferred Stock).

  



  

An adjustment made pursuant to Section 7(d)(i) shall become effective
immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the
Record Date for such distribution. If such dividend or distribution is not so
paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the
Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution
had not been declared.

  



  

(ii)  If the Board of Directors determines the Fair Market Value
of any distribution for purposes of this Section 7(d) by reference to the
actual or when issued trading market for any Distributed Assets comprising all
or part of such distribution, it must in doing so consider the prices in such
market over the same period (the "Reference Period") used in computing the
Current Market Price pursuant to this Section 7(d) to the extent possible,
unless the Board of Directors determines in good faith that determining the
Fair Market Value during the Reference Period would not be in the best
interest of the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock.

  



  

(iii) If any such distribution consists of shares of capital stock
of, or similar equity interests in, one or more of the Corporation's
subsidiaries (a "Spin Off"), the Fair Market Value of the securities to be
distributed shall equal the average of the Closing Sale Prices of such
securities for the 10 consecutive Trading Days commencing on and including
the first Trading Day of those securities after the effectiveness of the Spin
Off, and the Current Market Price shall be measured for the same period. If,
however, an underwritten initial public offering of the securities in the Spin
Off occurs simultaneously with the Spin Off, Fair Market Value of the
securities distributed in the Spin Off shall mean the initial public offering
price of such securities and the Current Market Price shall mean the Closing
Sale Price for the Common Stock on the same Trading Day.

  



  

   

12

 



    



  

(iv)  Rights or warrants distributed by the Corporation to all or
substantially all holders of the outstanding shares of Common Stock entitling
them to subscribe for or purchase equity securities of the Corporation (either
initially or under certain circumstances), which rights or warrants, until
the occurrence of a specified event or events ("Trigger Event"), (x) are
deemed to be transferred with such shares of Common Stock, (y) are not
exercisable and (z) are also issued in respect of future issuances of shares
of Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of
this Section 7(d) (and no adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this
Section 7(d) shall be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger
Event. If such right or warrant is subject to subsequent events, upon the
occurrence of which such right or warrant shall become exercisable to
purchase different Distributed Assets, or entitle the holder to purchase a
different number or amount of the foregoing Distributed Assets or to purchase
any of the foregoing Distributed Assets at a different purchase price, then
the occurrence of each such event shall be deemed to be the date of issuance
and Record Date with respect to a new right or warrant (and a termination or
expiration of the existing right or warrant without exercise by the holder
thereof). In addition, in the event of any distribution (or
deemed distribution) of rights or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other
event (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect thereto,
that resulted in an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 7(d):

  



  

(A)  in the case of any such rights or warrants which shall all
have been repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion
Rate shall be readjusted upon such final repurchase to give effect to such
distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash
distribution, equal to the per share repurchase price received by a holder of
shares Common Stock with respect to such rights or warrants (assuming such
holder had retained such rights or warrants), made to all or
substantially all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such repurchase;
and

  



  

(B)  in the case of such rights or warrants which shall have
expired or been terminated without exercise, the Conversion Rate shall be
readjusted as if such rights and warrants had never been issued.

  



  

(v)  For purposes of this Section 7(d) and Section 7(a), Section
7(b) and Section 7(c), any dividend or distribution to which this Section
7(d) is applicable that also includes (x) shares of Common Stock, (y) a
subdivision, split or combination of shares of Common Stock to which Section
7(b) applies or (z) rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of
Common Stock to which Section 7(c) applies (or any combination thereof),
shall be deemed instead to be:

  



  

(A) a dividend or distribution of the evidences of indebtedness,
assets, shares of capital stock, rights or warrants, other than such shares
of Common Stock, such subdivision, split or combination or such rights or
warrants to which Section 7(a), Section 7(b) and Section 7(c) apply,
respectively (and any Conversion Rate adjustment required by this Section 7(d)
with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made),
immediately followed by

  



  

   

13

 



    



   



  

(B)  a dividend or distribution of such shares of Common Stock,
such subdivision, split or combination or such rights or warrants (and any
further Conversion Rate increase required by Section 7(a), Section 7(b) and
Section 7(c) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be
made), except:

  



  

(I) the Record Date of such dividend or distribution shall be
substituted as (i) "the date fixed for the determination of
stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution,"
"Record Date fixed for such determinations" and "Record Date" within the
meaning of Section 7(a), (ii) "the day upon which such subdivision or split
becomes effective" or "the day upon which such combination becomes effective"
(as applicable) within the meaning of Section 7(b), and (iii) as "the Record
Date fixed for the determination of the stockholders entitled to receive such
rights or warrants" and such "Record Date" within the meaning of Section
7(c); and

  



  

(II) any reduction or increase in the number of shares of Common Stock
resulting from such subdivision, split or combination (as applicable) shall
be disregarded in connection with such dividend or distribution.

  



  

(e)  If the Corporation shall, at any time or from time to time
while any shares of Series C Preferred Stock are outstanding, by dividend or
otherwise, distribute to all or substantially all holders of its outstanding
shares of Common Stock during any quarterly fiscal period, cash (including
any quarterly cash dividends, but excluding any cash that is distributed upon
a reclassification, change, merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange,
combination, sale or conveyance to which Section 8 applies or as part of a
distribution referred to in Section 7(d)) which results in an annualized
Common Stock dividend yield which is greater than 6.25% (the "Dividend
Threshold Amount"), then, and in each case, immediately after the close of
business on such date, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the
following formula:

  



  

(i) CR1 = CRo +(($25.00 x (CSY -- 6.25%)/4)/SP) where,

  



  

(A)  CRo = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the
Record Date for such distribution;

  



  

(B)  CR1 = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the
Record Date for such distribution;

  



  

(C)  SP = the average of the Closing Sale price per share of
Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period prior to the Trading
Day immediately preceding the earlier of the Record Date or the ex-dividend
date of such cash excess dividend or cash excess distribution; and

  



    

14

 



    



  

(D)   CSY = the annualized Common Stock dividend yield, calculated
as all cash dividends and cash distributions paid to the
Corporation's holders of Common Stock during the fiscal quarter, multiplied
by four, divided by SP.

  



  

Such increase shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of
business on the day following the Record Date for such distribution. In
the event that such distribution is not so made, the Conversion Rate shall
again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if
such distribution had not been declared.

  



  

(f)  (i) If any tender offer made by the Corporation or any of
its subsidiaries for all or any portion of Common Stock shall expire, then,
if the tender offer shall require the payment to the holders of Common Stock
of consideration per share of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value that
exceeds the Closing Price per share of Common Stock on the Trading Day next
succeeding the last date (the "Expiration Date") tenders could have been made
pursuant to such tender offer (as it may be amended) (the last time at which
such tenders could have been made on the Expiration Date is hereinafter
sometimes called the "Expiration Time"), the Conversion Rate shall be
adjusted so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the
Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the
Expiration Date by a fraction:

  



  

(A)  the numerator of which shall be the sum of (x) the Fair
Market Value of the aggregate consideration payable to holder of the Common
Stock based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the
tender offer) of all shares validly tendered and not withdrawn as of the
Expiration Time (the shares deemed so accepted, up to any such maximum, being
referred to as the "Purchased Shares") and (y) the product of (i) the number
of shares of Common Stock outstanding (less any Purchased Shares and
excluding any shares held in the treasury of the Corporation) at the
Expiration Time and (ii) the Current Market Price on the Trading Day next
succeeding the Expiration Date; and

  



  

(B)  the denominator of which shall be the product of (x) the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including Purchased Shares but
excluding any shares held in the treasury of the Corporation) at the
Expiration Time multiplied by (y) the Current Market Price on the Trading Day
next succeeding the Expiration Date.

  



  

(ii)  An adjustment pursuant to Section 7(f)(i) shall become
effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following
the Expiration Date.

  



  

(iii)  If the Corporation is obligated to purchase shares pursuant
to any such tender offer, but the Corporation is permanently prevented by
applicable law from effecting any or all such purchases or any or all such
purchases are rescinded, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be
the Conversion Rate which would have been in effect based upon the number of
shares actually purchased, if any. If the application of this Section 7(f) to
any tender offer would result in a decrease in the Conversion Rate, no
adjustment shall be made for such tender offer under this Section 7(f).

  



    

15

 



    



  

(iv)   For purposes of this Section 7, the term "tender offer"
shall mean and include both tender offers and exchange offers, all references
to "purchases" of shares in tender offers (and all similar references)
shall mean and include both the purchase of shares in tender offers and the
acquisition of shares pursuant to exchange offers, and all references to
"tendered shares" (and all similar references) shall mean and include shares
tendered in both tender offers and exchange offers.

  



  

(g)  Notwithstanding the foregoing and to the extent permitted
by law, whenever successive adjustments to the Conversion Rate are called for
pursuant to this Section 7, such adjustments shall be made as may be necessary
or appropriate to effectuate the intent of this Section 7 and to avoid unjust
or inequitable results as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

  



  

(h)  The Corporation shall be entitled to make such additional
increases in the Conversion Rate, in addition to those required by Section
7(a), Section 7(b), Section 7(c), Section 7(d), Section 7(e) or Section 7(f),
if the Board of Directors determines that it is advisable, in order that any
dividend or distribution of Common Stock, any subdivision, reclassification or
combination of Common Stock or any issuance of rights or warrants referred to
above, or any event treated as such for United States federal income tax
purposes, shall not be taxable to the holders of Common Stock for United
States federal income tax purposes or to diminish any such tax. The
Corporation shall give holders of Series C Preferred Stock at least 15 Trading
Days' notice of any increase in the Conversion Rate.

  



  

(i)  To the extent permitted by law, the Corporation may, from
time to time, increase the Conversion Rate for a period of at least 20
Trading Days if the Board of Directors determines that such an increase would
be in the Corporation's best interests. Any such determination by Board of
Directors shall be conclusive. The Corporation shall give holders of Series C
Preferred Stock at least 15 Trading Days' notice of any increase in the
Conversion Rate.

  



  

(j)  The Corporation shall not adjust the Conversion Rate
pursuant to this Section 7 to the extent that the adjustments would reduce
the Conversion Price below $0.0001. The Corporation shall not be required to
make an adjustment in the Conversion Rate unless the adjustment would require
a change of at least one percent in the Conversion Rate. However, any
adjustments that are not required to be made because they would have required
an increase or decrease of less than one percent shall be carried forward and
taken into account in any subsequent adjustment of the Conversion Rate.
Except as described in this Section 7, the Corporation shall not adjust the
Conversion Rate for any issuance of shares of Common Stock or any securities
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for its shares of Common
Stock or rights to purchase its shares of Common Stock or such convertible,
exchangeable or exercisable securities.

  



  

(k) In the event that at any time, as a result of an adjustment
made pursuant to this Section 7, the holder of any Series C Preferred Stock
thereafter surrendered for conversion shall become entitled to receive any
shares of capital stock of the Corporation other than Common Stock into which
the Series C Preferred Stock originally were convertible, the Conversion
Rate of such other shares so receivable upon conversion of any such Series C
Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner
and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with
respect to Common Stock contained in subparagraphs (a) through (1) of this
Section 7, and any other applicable provisions of the Charter with respect to
the Common Stock shall apply on like or similar terms to any such other
shares.

  



  

   

16

 



    



  

(l)  To the extent the Corporation has a rights plan in effect
upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock,
the holder shall receive (except to the extent the Corporation settles its
conversion obligations in cash), in addition to the shares of Common Stock,
the rights under the rights plan unless the rights have separated from the
shares of Common Stock prior to the time of conversion, in which case the
Conversion Rate shall be adjusted at the time of separation as if the
Corporation made a distribution referred to in Section 7(d) above (without
regard to any of the exceptions therein).

  



  

(8)  Consolidation or Merger of the Corporation.

  



  

(a) In the case of the following events (each, a "Business
Combination"): (i) any recapitalization, reclassification or change of the
Common Stock, other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par
value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of subdivision or a
combination; (ii) a consolidation, merger or binding share exchange of the
Corporation with another Person; (iii) a sale, conveyance or lease to another
corporation of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the
Corporation; or (iv) a statutory share exchange; in each case, as a result of
which holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive stock, other securities,
other property or assets (including cash or any combination thereof) with
respect to or in exchange for Common Stock, the Corporation or the successor
or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, shall provide that the holders
of Series C Preferred Stock will be entitled thereafter to convert such
Series C Preferred Stock into the Conversion Cash together with the kind and
amount of stock, other securities or other property or assets (including cash
or any combination thereof) which such holder of Series C Preferred Stock
would have owned or been entitled to receive upon such Business Combination
had such shares been converted into Conversion Cash and Common Stock
immediately prior to such Business Combination. If holders of Common Stock
have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in
such Business Combination, the Corporation will make adequate provision
whereby the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock shall have a reasonable
opportunity to determine the form of consideration into which all of the
Series C Preferred Stock, treated as a single class, shall be convertible
from and after the effective date of such Business Combination. Such
determination shall be based on the weighted average of elections made by the
holders of the Series C Preferred Stock who participate in such determination,
shall be subject to any limitations to which all of the holders of Common
Stock are subject, such as pro rata reductions applicable to any portion
of the consideration payable in such Business Combination, and shall be
conducted in such a manner as to be completed by the date which is the
earliest of (i) the deadline for elections to be made by holders of Common
Stock, and (ii) two Trading Days prior to the anticipated effective date of
the Business Combination. The Corporation shall provide notice of the
opportunity to determine the form of such consideration, as well as notice of
the determination made by the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock (and
the weighted average of elections), by issuing a press release or providing
other appropriate notice, and by providing a copy of such notice to the Board
of Directors. If the effective date of the Business Combination is delayed
beyond the initially anticipated effective date, the holders of the Series C
Preferred Stock shall be given the opportunity to make subsequent similar
determinations in regard to such delayed effective date. The documents
governing the rights of such securities shall provide for adjustments of the
Conversion Rate and other appropriate numerical thresholds which shall be as
nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments of the Conversion
Rate provided for in Section 7. If, in the case of any such Business
Combination, the stock or other securities and assets receivable thereupon by
a holder of shares of Common Stock includes shares of stock or other
securities and assets of a corporation other than the successor or purchasing
corporation, as the case may be, in such Business Combination, then such
documents governing the rights of such securities shall also be executed by
such other corporation and shall contain such additional provisions
to protect the interests of the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock as
the Board of Directors shall reasonably consider necessary by reason of the
foregoing, including to the extent practicable the provisions providing for
the repurchase rights set forth in Section 12(a) hereof.

  



  

   

17

 



    



  

(b)  The Corporation shall cause notice of the execution of such
documents governing the rights of such securities to be mailed to each holder
of Series C Preferred Stock, at the address of such holder as it appears on
the Register, within 20 days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such
notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such documents governing
the rights of such securities.

  



  

(c)  The above provisions of this Section 8 shall similarly
apply to successive Business Combinations.

  



  

(d)  The Corporation shall not become a party to any Business
Combination unless its terms are consistent in all material respects with the
provisions of this Section 8.

  



  

(e)  None of the provisions of this Section 8 shall affect the
right of a Series C Preferred Stockholder to convert its shares of Series C
Preferred Stock into Common Stock prior to the effective date of a Business
Combination.

  



  

(f)  If this Section 8 applies to any event or occurrence,
Section 7 hereof shall not apply.

  



  

 _(9)  Notice of Adjustment._ Whenever an adjustment in the
Conversion Rate with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock is required:

  



  

(a)  the Corporation shall forthwith place on file with the
transfer agent for the Series C Preferred Stock a certificate of the Chief
Financial Officer (or such person having similar responsibilities of the
Corporation), stating the adjusted Conversion Rate determined as provided
herein and setting forth in reasonable detail such facts as shall be necessary
to show the reason for and the manner of computing such adjustment; and

  



  

(b)  a Notice stating that the Conversion Rate has been adjusted
and setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate shall forthwith be given by
the Corporation to each holder of Series C Preferred Stock. Any Notice so
given shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not
the holder receives such Notice.

  



  

 _(10)  Notice in Certain Events._ In case of:

  



  

(a) a consolidation or merger to which the Corporation is a
party and for which approval of any holders of Common Stock of
the Corporation is required, or of the sale or conveyance to another person
or entity or group of persons or entities acting in concert as a partnership,
limited partnership, syndicate or other group (within the meaning of Rule
13d-3 under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) of all
or substantially all of the property and assets of the Corporation; or

  



  

   

18

 



    



  

(b)  the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or
winding up of the Corporation; or

  



  

(c)  any action triggering an adjustment of the Conversion Rate
referred to in clauses (x) or (y) below; then, in each case, the Corporation
shall cause to be given, to the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock, at
least 15 days prior to the applicable date hereinafter specified, a Notice
stating:

  



  

(x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of any
distribution or grant of rights or warrants triggering an adjustment to the
Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 7 hereof, or, if a record is not to be
taken, the date as of which the holders of record of Common Stock entitled to
such distribution, rights or warrants are to be determined; or

  



  

(y) the date on which any reclassification, consolidation, merger,
sale, conveyance, dissolution, liquidation or winding up triggering an
adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this Section 10 hereof is
expected to become effective, and the date as of which it is expected that
holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their shares
of Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such
reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance, dissolution,
liquidation or winding up.

  



  

Failure to give such Notice or any defect therein shall not affect the
legality or validity of the proceedings described in Section 10(a), Section
10(b) or Section 10(c).

  



  

(11)  Purchase of Series C Preferred Stock upon a Fundamental
Change.

  



  

(a)  In the event of a fundamental change, a holder of Series C
Preferred Stock shall have the right to require the Corporation to purchase
(the "Repurchase Right") for cash all or any part of such holder's shares of
Series C Preferred Stock at a purchase price (the "Fundamental Change
Repurchase Price") equal to 100% of the liquidation preference of the Series
C Preferred Stock to be purchased plus accrued and unpaid dividends (including
additional dividends, if any) to, but not including, the Fundamental Change
Repurchase Date (as defined below). Shares of Series C Preferred Stock
submitted for purchase must be $25.00 liquidation preference or an integral
multiple thereof.

  



  

(b)  Within 30 calendar days after the occurrence of a
fundamental change, the Corporation shall provide to all holders of Series C
Preferred Stock and the transfer agent a Notice of the occurrence of the
fundamental change and of the resulting Repurchase Right. Such Notice shall
state:

  



  

(i) the events constituting the fundamental change;

  



  

(ii)  the date of the fundamental change;

  



    

19

 



    



  

(iii)   the last date on which a holder may exercise the Repurchase
Right;

  



  

(iv)  the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price;

  



  

(v) the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date;

  



  

(vi)  the name and address of the transfer agent;

  



  

(vii)  that Series C Preferred Stock with respect to which a
repurchase notice is given by the holder may be converted, if
otherwise convertible, only if the repurchase notice has been properly
withdrawn; and

  



  

(viii)   the procedures that a holder must follow to exercise the
Repurchase Right.

  



  

(c)  Simultaneously with providing such Notice, the Corporation
shall publish a notice containing this information in a newspaper of general
circulation in the City of New York or through such other public medium as the
Corporation may use at that time and publish such information on its
corporate website.

  



  

(d)  To exercise the Repurchase Right, subject to Section 11(e),
a holder of the Series C Preferred Stock must deliver, on or before the
twentieth Trading Day after the date of the Corporation's delivery of Notice
of a fundamental change (subject to extension to comply with applicable law),
the Series C Preferred Stock to be purchased, duly endorsed for transfer,
together with a written repurchase notice and the form entitled "Form of
Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice" duly completed to the transfer agent.
The repurchase notice must state:

  



  

(i) the applicable Fundamental Change Repurchase Date;

  



  

(ii)  the portion of the liquidation preference of Series C
Preferred Stock to be purchased, in integral multiples of $25.00; and

  



  

(iii)   that the shares of Series C Preferred Stock are to be
purchased by the Corporation pursuant to this Section 11.

  



  

(e)  If the shares of Series C Preferred Stock are not in
certificated form, a holder's repurchase notice must comply with applicable
DTC procedures.

  



  

(f)  A holder of Series C Preferred Stock may withdraw any
repurchase notice (in whole or in part) by a written notice of
withdrawal delivered to the Corporation prior to the close of business on the
Trading Day prior to the Repurchase Date. The notice of withdrawal shall
state:

  



  

(i)  the liquidation preference of the withdrawn Series C
Preferred Stock, in integral multiples of $25.00;

  



  

(ii)  if certificated shares of Series C Preferred Stock have
been issued, the certificate numbers of the withdrawn Series C
Preferred Stock; and

  



    

20

 



    



  

(iii)   the liquidation preference, if any, which remains subject
to the repurchase notice.

  



  

(g)  If the shares of Series C Preferred Stock are not in
certificated form, a holder's notice of withdrawal must comply with
applicable DTC procedures.

  



  

(h)  The Corporation shall be required to purchase the Series C
Preferred Stock no less than 30 days nor more than 45 days after the date of
the Corporation's delivery of Notice of the fundamental change, subject to
extension to comply with applicable law (as set forth in the Notice of the
fundamental change, the "Fundamental Change Repurchase Date"). A holder of
Series C Preferred Stock shall receive payment of the Fundamental Change
Repurchase Price promptly following the later of the Fundamental Change
Repurchase Date or the time of book-entry transfer or delivery of the Series C
Preferred Stock.

  



  

(i)  If the transfer agent holds cash sufficient to pay the
Fundamental Change Repurchase Price of the Series C Preferred Stock on the
Trading Day following the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date, then:

  



  

(i)  the Series C Preferred Stock shall cease to be
outstanding and dividends (including additional dividends, if any)
shall cease to accrue (whether or not book-entry transfer of the Series C
Preferred Stock is made or whether or not the Series C Preferred Stock
certificate, if applicable, is delivered to the transfer agent); and

  



  

(ii)  all other rights of the holder shall terminate (other than
the right to receive the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price upon delivery or
transfer of the Series C Preferred Stock).

  



  

(j)  In connection with a fundamental change repurchase, the
Corporation shall comply with all U.S. federal and state securities laws in
connection with any offer by the Corporation to purchase the Series C
Preferred Stock upon a fundamental change.

  



  

(k)  The Corporation shall not be required to repurchase the
Series C Preferred Stock upon a fundamental change if a third party (1) makes
an offer to purchase the Series C Preferred Stock in the manner, at the times
and otherwise in compliance with the requirements applicable to the
Corporation to repurchase Series C Preferred Stock upon a fundamental change
and (2) purchases all of the Series C Preferred Stock validly delivered and
not withdrawn under such offer to purchase Series C Preferred Stock.

  



  

(l)  A "fundamental change" shall be deemed to occur upon a
change of control or a termination of trading.

  



  

(m)  A "change of control" shall be deemed to have occurred at
such time, after the Effective Time of the merger of Anworth Mortgage Asset
Corporation, a Maryland corporation, with and into a wholly owned subsidiary
of the Corporation, when the following has occurred:

  



  

(i) any  "person" or "group" (as such terms are used in
Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) acquires the beneficial
ownership, directly or indirectly, through a purchase, merger or other
acquisition transaction or series of transactions, of 50% or more of the
total voting power of the Corporation's total outstanding voting stock other
than an acquisition by the Corporation or any of subsidiaries of the
Corporation;

  



  

   

21

 



    



  

(ii)  the Corporation consolidates with, or merges with or into,
another person or conveys, transfers, leases or otherwise disposes of all or
substantially all of the Corporation assets to any person, or any person
consolidates with or merges with or into the Corporation, other than: (1) any
transaction (A) that does not result in any reclassification, exchange or
cancellation of outstanding shares of the Corporation's capital stock and (B)
pursuant to which the Corporation's capital stockholders immediately prior to
the transaction have the entitlement to exercise, directly or indirectly, 50%
or more of the total voting power of all shares of the Corporation's capital
stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of the
continuing or surviving person immediately after the transaction; or (2) any
merger solely for the purpose of changing the Corporation's jurisdiction of
formation and resulting in a reclassification, conversion or exchange of
outstanding shares of common stock solely into shares of common stock of the
surviving entity; or

  



  

(iii)  the Corporation approves a plan of liquidation or
dissolution.

  



  

(n)  A "termination of trading" is deemed to occur if the Common
Stock (or other common stock into which the shares of Series C Preferred
Stock are then convertible) is neither listed for trading on a United States
national securities exchange nor approved for trading on an established
automated over-the-counter trading market in the United States.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it shall not constitute a change of control if
100% of the consideration for the Common Stock (excluding cash payments for
fractional shares and cash payments made in respect of dissenters' appraisal
rights) in the transaction or transactions constituting the change of control
consists of common stock traded on a United States National securities
exchange (including the Nasdaq Global Market and Nasdaq Capital Market), or
which shall be so traded when issued or exchanged in connection with the
change of control, and as a result of such transaction or transactions the
shares of Series C Preferred Stock become convertible solely into such common
stock.

  



  

(12)  Voting Rights.

  



  

(a)  Holders of the Series C Preferred Stock shall not have any
voting rights, except as set forth below.

  



  

(b) Whenever dividends on any shares of Series C Preferred
Stock shall be in arrears for six or more quarterly periods (whether or
not consecutive) (a "Preferred Dividend Default"), the holders of such shares
of Series C Preferred Stock (voting separately as a class with all other
series of Parity Stock, upon which like voting rights have been conferred
and are exercisable), shall be entitled to vote for the election of a total
of two additional directors of the Corporation (the  "Preferred Stock
Directors"), and the number of directors on the Board of Directors shall
increase by two, at a special meeting called by the holders of record of at
least 10% of the Series C Preferred Stock or the holders of any other series
of Parity Stock so in arrears (unless such request is received less than 90
days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of
stockholders) or at the next annual meeting of stockholders, and at each
subsequent annual meeting until all dividends accumulated on such shares of
Series C Preferred Stock for the past dividend periods and the dividend for
the then current dividend period shall have been fully paid or declared and a
sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside for payment.

  



  

   

22

 



    



  

(c)  If and when all accumulated dividends and the dividend for
the then current dividend period on the Series C Preferred Stock shall have
been paid in full or set aside for payment in full, the holders of shares of
Series C Preferred Stock shall be divested of the voting rights set forth in
Section 12(b) hereof (subject to revesting in the event of each and every
subsequent Preferred Dividend Default) and, if all accumulated dividends and
the dividend for the current dividend period have been paid in full or set
aside for payment in full on all other series of Parity Stock upon which like
voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, the term of office of
each Preferred Stock Director so elected shall terminate and the number of
directors on the Board of Directors shall decrease by two. Any Preferred
Stock Director may be removed at any time with or without cause by the vote
of, and shall not be removed otherwise than by the vote of, the holders of
record of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series C
Preferred Stock when they have the voting rights set forth in Section 12(b)
(voting separately as a class with the Parity Stock upon which like voting
rights have been conferred and are exercisable). So long as a Preferred
Dividend Default shall continue, any vacancy in the office of a Preferred
Stock Director may be filled by written consent of the Preferred Stock
Director remaining in office, or, if none remains in office, by a vote of the
holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series C
Preferred Stock when they have the voting rights set forth in Section 12(b)
(voting separately as a class with all other series of Parity Stock upon
which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable). The
Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on
any matter.

  



  

(d)  So long as any shares of Series C Preferred Stock remain
outstanding, the Corporation shall not, without the affirmative vote of the
holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of the Series C Preferred Stock
outstanding at the time, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at
a meeting (voting separately as a class, together with all other series of
Parity Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are
exercisable), (i) authorize or create, or increase the authorized or
issued amount of, any class or series of capital stock ranking prior to the
Series C Preferred Stock with respect to payment of dividends or the
distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or
reclassify any authorized capital stock of the Corporation into any such
shares, or create, authorize or issue any obligation or security convertible
into or evidencing the right to purchase any such shares or (ii) amend, alter
or repeal the provisions of the Charter, whether by merger, consolidation or
otherwise, so as to materially and adversely affect any right, preference,
privilege or voting power of the Series C Preferred Stock or the
holders thereof; provided, however, that with respect to the occurrence of
any event set forth in (ii) above, so long as the Series C Preferred Stock
remains outstanding with the terms thereof materially unchanged, the
occurrence of any such event shall not be deemed to materially and adversely
affect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series C
Preferred Stock and; provided, further, that any increase in the amount of
the authorized preferred stock, including the Series C Preferred Stock, or the
creation or issuance of any additional Series C Preferred Stock or any other
series of preferred stock, or any increase in the amount of authorized shares
of such series, in each case ranking on a parity with or junior to the Series
C Preferred Stock with respect to payment of dividends or the distribution of
assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, shall not be deemed to
materially and adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or
voting powers.

 _(13)   Restrictions on Transfer._ The Series C Preferred Stock is
governed by and issued subject to all of the limitations, terms and
conditions of the Charter, including but not limited to the terms and
conditions (including exceptions and exemptions) of Article VII of the
Charter; provided, however, that the terms and conditions (including
exceptions and exemptions) of Article VII of the Charter shall also be
applied to the Series C Preferred Stock separately and without regard to any
other series or class. The foregoing sentence shall not be construed to limit
the applicability of any other term or provision of the Charter to the
Series C Preferred Stock. In addition to the legend contemplated by Article
VII, Section 7.2.9 of the Charter, each certificate for Series C Preferred
Stock shall bear substantially the following legend:

charge a full statement of the designations and any preferences,
conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to
dividends, qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption of the stock
of each class which the Corporation is authorized to issue, to the extent they
have been set, and of the authority of the Board of Directors to set the
relative rights and preferences of a subsequent series of a preferred or
special class of stock. Such request may be made to the Secretary of the
Corporation or to its transfer agent."

  



  

 _(14)  Settlement._ Nothing in this Article Second of these
Articles Supplementary shall be interpreted to preclude the settlement of any
transaction entered into through the facilities of the New York Stock Exchange
or other securities exchange (including Nasdaq) or an automated inter-dealer
quotation system.

  



  

THIRD: These Articles Supplementary have been approved by the Board in the
manner and by the vote required by law.

READY CAPITAL CORPORATION

  



  

ARTICLES SUPPLEMENTARY

  

ESTABLISHING AND FIXING THE RIGHTS AND PREFERENCES OF A

  

SERIES OF SHARES OF PREFERRED STOCK

  



  

READY CAPITAL CORPORATION, a Maryland corporation (hereinafter called the
"Corporation"), hereby certifies to the State Department of Assessments and
Taxation of Maryland that:

  



  

FIRST: Under a power contained in Section 2-208 of the Maryland General
Corporation Law and Article VI of the Corporation's Articles
of Incorporation, as amended (the "Charter"), the Board of Directors (the
"Board"), by resolutions duly adopted, classified and designated 2,010,278
shares of the unissued preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the
Corporation ("Preferred Stock"), as 7.625% Series D Cumulative Redeemable
Preferred Stock and has provided for the issuance of such series. Capitalized
terms used and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in the
Charter.

  



  

SECOND: The terms of the Preferred Stock as set by the Board and the pricing
committee thereof, including preferences, conversion or other rights, voting
powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends, qualifications, or terms or
conditions of redemption, are as follows:

  



  

 _(1)  Designation and Number._ A series of Preferred Stock of
the Corporation, designated as "7.625% Series D Cumulative Redeemable
Preferred Stock" (the "Series D Preferred Stock"), is hereby established. The
par value of the Series D Preferred Stock is $0.0001 per share. The number of
shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall be 2,010,278.

  



  

 _(2)  Rank._ The Series D Preferred Stock shall, with respect
to dividend rights and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
the Corporation, rank (a) senior to all classes or series of Common Stock of
the Corporation and to all equity securities the terms of which specifically
provide that such equity securities rank junior to such Series D Preferred
Stock; (b) on parity with the Parity Stock (as defined below); and (c) junior
to all equity securities issued by the Corporation the terms of
which specifically provide that such equity securities rank senior to the
Series D Preferred Stock. The term "equity securities" shall not include
convertible debt securities. The term "Parity Stock" means all classes and
series of preferred stock that the Corporation may issue ranking on parity
with the Series D Preferred Stock, including the Corporation's Series B
Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock, with respect to the payments of
distributions and rights to payment upon liquidation, dissolution or winding
up.

  



  

(3)  Dividends.

  



  

(a) Holders of the then outstanding shares of Series D
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when and as authorized by the
Board of Directors, out of funds legally available for the payment of
dividends, cumulative preferential cash dividends at the rate of 7.625% of
the $25.00 liquidation preference per annum (equivalent to a fixed annual
amount of $1.90625 per share). Such dividends shall be cumulative from [ • ],
20211 and shall be payable quarterly in arrears on or before January 15,
April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year or, if not a business day, the
next succeeding business day (each, a "Dividend Payment Date"). Any dividend
payable on the Series D Preferred Stock for any partial dividend period shall
be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day
months. Dividends shall be payable to holders of record as they appear in the
stock records of the Corporation at the close of business on the applicable
record date, which shall be the last day of each of March, June, September
and December, as the case may be, immediately preceding the applicable
Dividend Payment Date (each, a "Dividend Record Date").

  



  

   



 



    



  

(b)  No dividends on shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall
be declared by the Corporation or paid or set apart for payment by the
Corporation at such time as the terms and provisions of any agreement of the
Corporation, including any agreement relating to its indebtedness, prohibit
such declaration, payment or setting apart for payment or provide that such
declaration, payment or setting apart for payment would constitute a breach
thereof or a default thereunder, or if such declaration or payment shall be
restricted or prohibited by law.

  



  

(c)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, dividends on the Series D
Preferred Stock shall accrue whether or not the terms and provisions set
forth in _Section 3(b)_ hereof at any time prohibit the current payment of
dividends, whether or not the Corporation has earnings, whether or not there
are funds legally available for the payment of such dividends and whether or
not such dividends are declared. Accrued but unpaid dividends on the Series D
Preferred Stock shall accumulate as of the Dividend Payment Date on which
they first become payable.

  



  

(d)  Except as provided in _Section 3(e)_ hereof, unless full
cumulative dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock have been or
contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for
the payment thereof is set apart for payment for all past dividend periods
and the then current dividend period, no dividends (other than dividends in
shares of Common Stock or dividends in shares of any series of Preferred
Stock ranking junior to the Series D Preferred Stock as to dividends and
upon liquidation) shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment nor
shall any other distribution be declared or made upon the Common Stock, or
any Preferred Stock of the Corporation ranking junior to or on a parity with
the Series D Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, nor shall
any shares of Common Stock, or any shares of Preferred Stock of the
Corporation ranking junior to or on a parity with the Series D Preferred
Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation be redeemed, purchased or otherwise
acquired for any consideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available
for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such shares) by the Corporation
(except by conversion into or exchange for other capital stock of the
Corporation ranking junior to the Series D Preferred Stock as to dividends
and upon liquidation and except for transfers made pursuant to the provisions
of Article VII of the Charter).

  



  

(e) When dividends are not paid in full (or a sum sufficient
for such full payment is not so set apart) on the Series D Preferred Stock
and the shares of any other series of Parity Stock, all dividends declared
upon the Series D Preferred Stock and the shares of any other series of
Parity Stock shall be declared pro rata so that the amount of dividends
declared per share of Series D Preferred Stock and the shares of any other
series of Parity Stock shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio
that accrued dividends per share on the Series D Preferred Stock and the
shares of any other series of Parity Stock (which shall not include any
accrual in respect of unpaid dividends for prior dividend periods if such
preferred stock does not have a cumulative dividend) bear to each other. No
interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of
any dividend payment or payments on Series D Preferred Stock which may be in
arrears.

  



  

  



  

  

1 To be the last dividend payment date before the Effective Time of the
Merger (provided that if such Effective Time occurs after the dividend record
date for a dividend and before the dividend payment date for such dividend,
such date shall be the dividend payment date for such dividend).

  



  

   

2

 



    



  

(f)  Any dividend payment made on shares of the Series D
Preferred Stock shall first be credited against the earliest accrued but
unpaid dividend due with respect to such shares which remains payable. Holders
of Series D Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any dividend, whether
payable in cash, property or stock in excess of full cumulative dividends on
the Series D Preferred Stock as described above.

  



  

(4)  Liquidation Preference.

  



  

(a)  Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution
or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, the holders of shares of
Series D Preferred Stock then outstanding are entitled to be paid out of the
assets of the Corporation, legally available for distribution to its
stockholders, a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share, plus an amount
equal to any accrued and unpaid dividends (whether or not declared) to the
date of payment, before any distribution of assets is made to holders of
Common Stock or any series of Preferred Stock of the Corporation that ranks
junior to the Series D Preferred Stock as to liquidation rights.

  



  

(b)  In the event that, upon any such voluntary or involuntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the available assets of the
Corporation are insufficient to pay the amount of the liquidating
distributions on all outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock and the
corresponding amounts payable on all shares of other classes or series of
Parity Stock in the distribution of assets, then the holders of shares of
Series D Preferred Stock and stockholders of such classes or series of Parity
Stock shall share ratably in any such distribution of assets in proportion to
the full liquidating distributions to which they would otherwise be
respectively entitled.

  



  

(c)  After payment of the full amount of the liquidating
distributions to which they are entitled, the holders of Series D
Preferred Stock shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets
of the Corporation.

  



  

(d)  Written notice of any such liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation, stating the payment date or dates when, and
the place or places where, the amounts distributable in such circumstances
shall be payable, shall be given by first class mail, postage prepaid, not
less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the payment date stated therein,
to each record holder of the Series D Preferred Stock at the respective
addresses of such holders as the same shall appear on the stock transfer
records of the Corporation.

  



  

(e) The consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into
any other corporation, trust or entity or of any other corporation with or
into the Corporation, or the sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially
all of the assets or business of the Corporation, shall not be deemed to
constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation.

  



  

   

3

 



    



  

(5)  Redemption.

  



  

(a)   _Optional Redemption Right_. The Corporation may, at its
option, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' written notice, redeem
the Series D Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to
time, for cash at a redemption price of Twenty-Five Dollars ($25.00) per
share, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to, but not including,
the date fixed for redemption. If the Corporation elects to redeem any shares
of Series D Preferred Stock as described in this _Section 5(a)_ , it may use
any available cash to pay the redemption price, and it will not be required to
pay the redemption price only out of the proceeds from the issuance of other
equity securities or any other specific source.

  



  

(b)   _Special Optional Redemption Right_. Upon the occurrence
of a Change of Control (as defined below), the Corporation may, at its
option, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' written notice, redeem
the Series D Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, within 120 days after the
first date on which such Change of Control occurred, for cash at a redemption
price of Twenty-Five Dollars ($25.00) per share, plus any accrued and unpaid
dividends thereon to, but not including, the date fixed for redemption. If,
prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date (as defined below), the
Corporation has provided notice of its election to redeem some or all of the
shares of Series D Preferred Stock pursuant to this _Section 5_ , the holders
of Series D Preferred Stock will not have the Change of Control Conversion
Right (as defined below) with respect to the shares of Series D Preferred
Stock called for redemption. If the Corporation elects to redeem any shares of
Series D Preferred Stock as described in this _Section 5(b_ ), it may use any
available cash to pay the redemption price, and it will not be required to pay
the redemption price only out of the proceeds from the issuance of other
equity securities or any other specific source.

  



  

(c)  A "Change of Control" is deemed to occur when, after the
effective time of the merger of Anworth Mortgage Asset Corporation, a
Maryland corporation, with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Corporation, the following have occurred and are continuing:

  



  

(i)  (A) any "person" or "group" (as such terms are used in
Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended)
acquires the beneficial ownership, directly or indirectly, through a purchase,
merger or other acquisition transaction or series of transactions, of 50% or
more of the total voting power of the total outstanding voting stock of the
Corporation other than an acquisition by the Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries;

  



  

(B) the Corporation consolidates with, or merges with or into, another
person or conveys, transfers, leases or otherwise disposes of all or
substantially all of its assets to any person, or any person consolidates with
or merges with or into the Corporation, other than: (x) any transaction (1)
that does not result in any reclassification, exchange, or cancellation of
outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation, and (2) pursuant
to which the Corporation's capital stockholders immediately prior to the
transaction have the entitlement to exercise, directly or indirectly, 50% or
more of the total voting power of all shares of the capital stock of the
Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of the
continuing or surviving person immediately after the transaction; or (y) any
merger solely for the purpose of changing the Corporation's jurisdiction of
formation and resulting in a reclassification, conversion or exchange of
outstanding shares of common stock solely into shares of common stock of the
surviving entity; or

  



  

   

4

 



    



  

(C) the Corporation approves a plan of liquidation or dissolution; and

  



  

(ii)  following the closing of any transaction referred to in
_clause (i)_ above, neither the Corporation nor the acquiring or surviving
entity has a class of common securities listed for trading on a United States
national securities exchange (including the Nasdaq Stock Market ("Nasdaq")).

  



  

(d)  In the event the Corporation elects to redeem Series D
Preferred Stock, the notice of redemption will be mailed by the
Corporation, postage prepaid, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to
the redemption date, to each holder of record of Series D Preferred Stock
called for redemption at such holder's address as it appears on the stock
transfer records of the Corporation and shall state: (i) the redemption date;
(ii) the number of shares of Series D Preferred Stock to be redeemed; (iii)
the redemption price; (iv) the procedure for surrendering shares of Series D
Preferred Stock to be redeemed for payment of the redemption price; (v) that
dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accumulate on the
redemption date; (vi) whether such redemption is being made pursuant to
_Section 6(a)_ or _Section 6(b)_ hereof; (vii) if applicable, that such
redemption is being made in connection with a Change of Control and, in that
case, a brief description of the transaction or transactions constituting
such Change of Control; and (viii) if such redemption is being made in
connection with a Change of Control, that the holders of the shares of Series
D Preferred Stock being so called for redemption will not be able to tender
such shares of Series D Preferred Stock for conversion in connection with the
Change of Control, and that each share of Series D Preferred Stock tendered
for conversion that is called, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date
(as defined below), for redemption will be redeemed on the related date of
redemption instead of converted on the Change of Control Conversion Date. If
less than all of the Series D Preferred Stock held by any holder are to be
redeemed, the notice mailed to such holder shall also specify the number of
shares of Series D Preferred Stock held by such holder to be redeemed. No
failure to give such notice or any defect thereto or in the mailing thereof
shall affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any shares
of Series D Preferred Stock except as to the holder to whom notice was
defective or not given. Any such redemption may be made conditional on such
factors as may be determined by the Board and as set forth in the notice of
redemption.

  



  

(e)  Holders of Series D Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall
follow the procedures for surrendering the Series D Preferred Stock set forth
in the notice of redemption and shall be entitled to the redemption price and
any accrued and unpaid dividends payable upon the redemption following the
surrender.

  



  

(f) If notice of redemption of any shares of Series D
Preferred Stock has been given and if the Corporation irrevocably sets
aside the funds necessary for redemption in trust for the benefit of the
holders of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock so called for redemption,
then from and after the redemption date (unless the Corporation shall default
in providing for the payment of the redemption price plus accrued and unpaid
dividends, if any), dividends will cease to accrue on those shares of Series
D Preferred Stock, those shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall no longer be
deemed outstanding, and all rights of the holders of those shares will
terminate, except the right to receive the redemption price plus accrued and
unpaid dividends, if any, payable upon redemption.

  



  

   

5

 



    



  

(g)  If any redemption date is not a business day, then the
redemption price and accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, payable upon
redemption may be paid on the next business day and no interest, additional
dividends or other sums will accrue on the amount payable for the period from
and after that redemption date to that next business day.

  



  

(h)  If less than all of the outstanding Series D Preferred
Stock is to be redeemed, the Series D Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be
selected pro rata (as nearly as may be practicable without creating fractional
shares).

  



  

(i)  Immediately prior to any redemption of Series D Preferred
Stock, the Corporation shall pay, in cash, any accrued and unpaid dividends
through and including the redemption date, unless a redemption date falls
after a Dividend Record Date and prior to the corresponding Dividend Payment
Date, in which case each holder of Series D Preferred Stock at the close of
business on such Dividend Record Date shall be entitled to the dividend
payable on such shares on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date
notwithstanding the redemption of such shares before such Dividend Payment
Date. Except as provided in this _Section 6(i)_ , the Corporation will make
no payment or allowance for unpaid dividends, whether or not in arrears, on
shares of the Series D Preferred Stock to be redeemed.

  



  

(j)  Unless full cumulative dividends on all shares of Series
D Preferred Stock shall have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid
or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been or
contemporaneously is set apart for payment for all past dividend periods, no
shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall be redeemed unless all outstanding
shares of Series D Preferred Stock are simultaneously redeemed and the
Corporation shall not purchase or otherwise acquire directly or indirectly any
shares of Series D Preferred Stock (except by exchanging it for its capital
stock ranking junior to the Series D Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon
liquidation); _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not prevent
the purchase or acquisition by the Corporation of shares of Series D
Preferred Stock to preserve its status as a REIT for federal income tax
purposes or pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms
to holders of all outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock.

  



  

(k)  Subject to applicable law, the Corporation may purchase
shares of Series D Preferred Stock in the open market, by tender or by
private agreement. Any shares of Series D Preferred Stock redeemed, purchased
or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever may be
retired and re-classified as authorized but unissued shares of preferred
stock, without designation as to class or series, and may thereafter be
reissued by us as any class or series of Preferred Stock.

  



  

 _(6)  Conversion Rights._ Shares of Series D Preferred Stock
are not convertible into or exchangeable for any other property or securities
of the Corporation, except as provided in this _Section 6_.

  



  

   

6

 



    



     

(a)   Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each holder
of Series D Preferred Stock will have the right (unless, prior to the Change
of Control Conversion Date, the Corporation has provided notice of its
election to redeem some or all of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock held
by such holder pursuant to _Section 5_ hereof, in which case such holder will
have the right only with respect to any shares of Series D Preferred Stock
that are not called for redemption) to convert some or all of the shares of
Series D Preferred Stock held by such holder (the "Change of Control
Conversion Right") on the Change of Control Conversion Date into a number of
shares of Common Stock per share of Series D Preferred Stock (the "Common
Stock Conversion Consideration") equal to the lesser of:

  



  

(i)  the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the sum of the $25.00
liquidation preference per share of Series D Preferred Stock plus the amount
of any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to, but not including, the Change
of Control Conversion Date (unless the Change of Control Conversion Date is
after a Dividend Record Date and prior to the corresponding Dividend Payment
Date for the Series D Preferred Stock, in which case no additional amount for
such accrued and unpaid dividends will be included in this sum) by (B) the
Common Stock Price (as defined below); and

  



  

(ii)  [______]2 (the "Share Cap"), subject to adjustments
provided in _Section 6(b)_ hereof.

  



  

(b)  The Share Cap is subject to pro rata adjustments for any
share splits (including those effected pursuant to a distribution of Common
Stock to existing holders of Common Stock), subdivisions or combinations (in
each case, a "Share Split") with respect to Common Stock as follows: the
adjusted Share Cap as the result of a Share Split will be the number of shares
of Common Stock that is equivalent to the product obtained by multiplying (i)
the Share Cap in effect immediately prior to such Share Split by (ii) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately after giving effect to such Share Split and the
denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such Share Split. For the avoidance of doubt, subject to
the immediately succeeding sentence, the aggregate number of shares of
Common Stock (or equivalent Alternative Conversion Consideration (as defined
below), as applicable) issuable or deliverable, as applicable, in connection
with the exercise of the Change of Control Conversion Right will not exceed
the Share Cap multiplied by the number of shares of Series D Preferred Stock
issued and outstanding at the Change of Control Conversion Date (or equivalent
Alternative Conversion Consideration, as applicable) (the "Exchange Cap").
The Exchange Cap is subject to pro rata adjustments for any Share Splits on
the same basis as the corresponding adjustment to the Share Cap.

  



  

  



  

  

2 Amount equal to the product of the (i) Share Cap applicable to the Anworth
Series C Preferred Stock immediately prior to the effective time of the
Merger and (ii) a fraction in which (x) the numerator is equal to the sum of
(A) the final Per Share Cash Consideration in the Merger and (B) the product
of (I) the Exchange Ratio in the Merger and (II) the average of the
Corporation's closing sales prices per share for the ten consecutive trading
days immediately preceding but not including the date on which the effective
time of the Merger occurs and (y) the denominator is the average of the
Corporation's closing sales prices per share for the ten consecutive trading
days immediately preceding but not including the date on which the effective
time of the Merger occurs.

  



  

   

7

 



    



     

(c)   The "Change of Control Conversion Date" is the date the
Series D Preferred Stock is to be converted, which will be a business day
selected by the Corporation that is no fewer than 20 days nor more than 35
days after the date on which it provides the notice described in _Section
6(h)_ hereof to the holders of Series D Preferred Stock.

  



  

(d)  The "Common Stock Price" is (i) if the consideration to be
received in the Change of Control by the holders of Common Stock is solely
cash, the amount of cash consideration per share of Common Stock, or (ii) if
the consideration to be received in the Change of Control by holders of
Common Stock is other than solely cash, (A) the average of the closing sale
prices per share of Common Stock (or, if no closing sale price is reported,
the average of the closing bid and ask prices per share or, if more than one
in either case, the average of the average closing bid and the average closing
ask prices per share) for the ten consecutive trading days immediately
preceding, but not including, the date on which such Change of Control
occurred as reported on the principal United States national securities
exchange on which Common Stock is then traded, or (B) the average of the
last quoted bid prices for Common Stock in the over-the-counter market as
reported by Pink OTC Markets Inc. or another similar organization for the ten
consecutive trading days immediately preceding, but not including, the date on
which such Change of Control occurred, if Common Stock is not then listed for
trading on a United States national securities exchange.

  



  

(e)  In the case of a Change of Control pursuant to which
Common Stock is or will be converted into cash, securities or other property
or assets (including any combination thereof) (the "Alternative Form
Consideration"), a holder of Series D Preferred Stock will receive upon
conversion of such Series D Preferred Stock the kind and amount of Alternative
Form Consideration which such holder would have owned or been entitled to
receive upon the Change of Control had such holder held a number of shares of
Common Stock equal to the Common Stock Conversion Consideration immediately
prior to the effective time of the Change of Control (the "Alternative
Conversion Consideration"; the Common Stock Conversion Consideration or the
Alternative Conversion Consideration, whichever shall be applicable to a
Change of Control, is referred to as the "Conversion Consideration").

  



  

(f)  If the holders of Common Stock have the opportunity to
elect the form of consideration to be received in the Change of Control, the
Conversion Consideration in respect of such Change of Control will be deemed
to be the kind and amount of consideration actually received by holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock that made or voted for such
an election if electing between two types of consideration, or holders of a
plurality of the outstanding shares of Common Stock that made or voted
for such an election if electing between more than two types of
consideration, as the case may be, and will be subject to any limitations to
which all holders of Common Stock are subject, including, without limitation,
pro rata reductions applicable to any portion of the consideration payable in
such Change of Control.

  



  

(g)  No fractional shares of Common Stock upon the conversion of
the Series D Preferred Stock in connection with a Change of Control will be
issued. Instead, the Corporation will make, and the holders of Series D
Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive, a cash payment equal to the
value of such fractional shares based upon the Common Stock Price used in
determining the Common Stock Conversion Consideration for such Change of
Control.

(h)   Within 15 days following the occurrence of a Change of
Control, provided that the Corporation has not then exercised its right to
redeem all shares of Series D Preferred Stock pursuant to _Section 5_ hereof,
the Corporation will provide to holders of Series D Preferred Stock a notice
of occurrence of the Change of Control that describes the resulting Change of
Control Conversion Right, which notice shall be delivered to the holders of
record of the shares of the Series D Preferred Stock in their addresses as
they appear on the stock transfer records of the Corporation and shall state:
(i) the events constituting the Change of Control; (ii) the date of the
Change of Control; (iii) the last date on which the holders of Series D
Preferred Stock may exercise their Change of Control Conversion Right; (iv)
the method and period for calculating the Common Stock Price; (v) the Change
of Control Conversion Date; (vi) that if, prior to the Change of Control
Conversion Date, the Corporation has provided notice of its election to
redeem any or all shares of Series D Preferred Stock, holders will not be able
to convert such shares of Series D Preferred Stock called for redemption and
such shares will be redeemed on the applicable redemption date, even if such
shares have already been tendered for conversion pursuant to the Change of
Control Conversion Right; (vii) if applicable, the type and amount of
Alternative Conversion Consideration entitled to be received per share of
Series D Preferred Stock; (viii) the name and address of the paying agent,
transfer agent and conversion agent for the Series D Preferred Stock; (ix) the
procedures that the holders of Series D Preferred Stock must follow to
exercise the Change of Control Conversion Right (including procedures for
surrendering shares for conversion through the facilities of DTC (as defined
below)), including the form of conversion notice to be delivered by such
holders as described below; and (x) the last date on which holders of Series
D Preferred Stock may withdraw shares surrendered for conversion and
the procedures that such holders must follow to effect such a withdrawal.

  



  

(i)  The Corporation shall also issue a press release
containing such notice provided for in _Section 6(h)_ hereof for
publication on Dow Jones and Company, Inc., Business Wire, PR Newswire or
Bloomberg Business News (or, if these organizations are not in existence at
the time of issuance of the press release, such other news or press
organization as is reasonably calculated to broadly disseminate the relevant
information to the public), and post a notice on its website, in any event
prior to the opening of business on the first business day following any date
on which it provides the notice provided for in _Section 6(h)_ hereof to
the holders of Series D Preferred Stock.

  



  

(j)  To exercise the Change of Control Conversion Right, the
holders of Series D Preferred Stock will be required to deliver, on or before
the close of business on the Change of Control Conversion Date, the shares of
Series D Preferred Stock to be converted through the facilities of DTC,
together with a written conversion notice in the form provided by the
Corporation, duly completed, to its transfer agent. The conversion notice
must state: (i) the relevant Change of Control Conversion Date; (ii) the
number of shares of Series D Preferred Stock to be converted; and (iii) that
the Series D Preferred Stock is to be converted pursuant to the applicable
provisions of the Series D Preferred Stock.

  



  

(k) Holders of Series D Preferred Stock may withdraw any
notice of exercise of a Change of Control Conversion Right (in whole or in
part) by a written notice of withdrawal delivered to the transfer agent of
the Corporation prior to the close of business on the business day prior to
the Change of Control Conversion Date. The notice of withdrawal delivered by
any holder must state: (i) the number of withdrawn shares of Series D
Preferred Stock; and (ii) the number of shares of Series D Preferred Stock,
if any, which remain subject to the holder's conversion notice.

  



  

   

9

 



    



  

(l)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
_Sections 6(j) and (k)_ hereof, the conversion notice and/or the notice of
withdrawal, as applicable, must comply with applicable procedures, if any, of
The Depository Trust Company ("DTC").

  



  

(m)  Series D Preferred Stock as to which the Change of Control
Conversion Right has been properly exercised and for which the conversion
notice has not been properly withdrawn will be converted into the applicable
Conversion Consideration in accordance with the Change of Control Conversion
Right on the Change of Control Conversion Date, unless prior to the Change of
Control Conversion Date the Corporation has provided notice of its election
to redeem some or all of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock pursuant to
_Section 5_ hereof, in which case only the shares of Series D Preferred Stock
properly surrendered for conversion and not properly withdrawn that are not
called for redemption, if any, will be converted as aforesaid. If the
Corporation elects to redeem shares of Series D Preferred Stock that would
otherwise be converted into the applicable Conversion Consideration on a
Change of Control Conversion Date, such shares of Series D Preferred Stock
will not be so converted and the holders of such shares will be entitled to
receive on the applicable redemption date the redemption price as provided in
_Section 5_ hereof.

  



  

(n)  The Corporation shall deliver all securities, cash
(including, without limitation, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Common
Stock) and any other property owing upon conversion no later than the third
business day following the Change of Control Conversion Date. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the persons entitled to receive any shares of Common Stock or
other securities delivered on conversion will be deemed to have become the
holders of record thereof as of the Change of Control Conversion Date.

  



  

(o)  In connection with the exercise of any Change of Control
Conversion Right, the Corporation shall comply with all federal and state
securities laws and stock exchange rules in connection with any conversion of
Series D Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock or other property.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Series D Preferred Stock, no holder
of Series D Preferred Stock will be entitled to convert such Series D
Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock to the extent that receipt of
such Common Stock would cause such holder (or any other person) to exceed the
applicable share ownership limitations contained in the Charter or these
Articles Supplementary, unless the Corporation provides an exemption from this
limitation to such holder pursuant to the Charter and these Articles
Supplementary.

  



  

(p)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein and except
as otherwise required by law, the persons who are the holders of record of
shares of Series D Preferred Stock at the close of business on a Dividend
Record Date will be entitled to receive the dividend payable on the
corresponding Dividend Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion of those
shares after such Dividend Record Date and on or prior to such Dividend
Payment Date and, in such case, the full amount of such dividend shall be paid
on such Dividend Payment Date to the persons who were the holders of record
at the close of business on such Dividend Record Date. Except as provided in
this _Section 6(p)_ , the Corporation will make no allowance for unpaid
dividends that are not in arrears on the shares of Series D Preferred Stock
to be converted.

  



  

   

10

 



    



     

(7)   Voting Rights.

  



  

(a)  Holders of the Series D Preferred Stock shall not have any
voting rights, except as set forth below.

  



  

(b)  Whenever dividends on any shares of Series D Preferred
Stock shall be in arrears for six or more quarterly periods (whether or not
consecutive) (a "Preferred Dividend Default"), the holders of such shares of
Series D Preferred Stock (voting separately as a class with all other series
of Parity Stock, upon which like voting rights have been conferred and
are exercisable), shall be entitled to vote for the election of a total of
two additional directors of the Corporation (the "Preferred Stock
Directors"), and the number of directors on the Board of Directors shall
increase by two, at a special meeting called by the holders of record of at
least 10% of the Series D Preferred Stock or the holders of any other series
of Parity Stock so in arrears (unless such request is received less than 90
days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting
of stockholders) or at the next annual meeting of stockholders, and at each
subsequent annual meeting until all dividends accumulated on such shares of
Series D Preferred Stock for the past dividend periods and the dividend for
the then current dividend period shall have been fully paid or declared and a
sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside for payment.

  



  

(c)  If and when all accumulated dividends and the dividend for
the then current dividend period on the Series D Preferred Stock shall have
been paid in full or set aside for payment in full, the holders of shares of
Series D Preferred Stock shall be divested of the voting rights set forth in
_Section 13(b)_ hereof (subject to revesting in the event of each and every
subsequent Preferred Dividend Default) and, if all accumulated dividends and
the dividend for the current dividend period have been paid in full or set
aside for payment in full on all other series of Parity Stock upon which like
voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, the term of office of
each Preferred Stock Director so elected shall terminate and the number of
directors on the Board of Directors shall decrease by two. Any Preferred
Stock Director may be removed at any time with or without cause by the vote
of, and shall not be removed otherwise than by the vote of, the holders of
record of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series D
Preferred Stock when they have the voting rights set forth in _Section 13(b)_
hereof (voting separately as a class with the Parity Stock upon which like
voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) so long as a Preferred
Dividend Default shall continue, any vacancy in the office of a Preferred
Stock Director may be filled by written consent of the Preferred Stock
Director remaining in office, or, if none remains in office, by a vote of the
holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series D
Preferred Stock when they have the voting rights set forth in _Section 13(b)_
hereof (voting separately as a class with all other series of Parity Stock
upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) the
Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on
any matter.

  



  

(d) So long as any shares of Series D Preferred Stock remain
outstanding, the Corporation shall not, without the affirmative vote of the
holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of the Series D Preferred Stock
outstanding at the time, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at
a meeting (voting separately as a class, together with all other series of
Parity Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are
exercisable), (i) authorize or create, or increase the authorized or issued
amount of, any class or series of capital stock ranking prior to the Series D
Preferred Stock with respect to payment of dividends or the distribution of
assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or reclassify any
authorized capital stock of the Corporation into any such shares, or create,
authorize or issue any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing
the right to purchase any such shares or (ii) amend, alter or repeal the
provisions of the Charter, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, so
as to materially and adversely affect any right, preference, privilege
or voting power of the Series D Preferred Stock or the holders thereof;
provided, however, that with respect to the occurrence of any event set forth
in (ii) above, so long as the Series D Preferred Stock remains outstanding
with the terms thereof materially unchanged, the occurrence of any such event
shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such
rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series D Preferred
Stock and; provided, further, that any increase in the amount of the
authorized preferred stock, including the Series D Preferred Stock, or the
creation or issuance of any additional Series D Preferred Stock or any other
series of preferred stock, or any increase in the amount of authorized shares
of such series, in each case ranking on a parity with or junior to the Series
D Preferred Stock with respect to payment of dividends or the distribution of
assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, shall not be deemed
to materially and adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or
voting powers.

  



  

   

11

 



    



  

(e)  Further to _Section 7(d)(ii)_ hereof, if any amendment,
alteration or repeal of the provisions of the Charter, whether by merger,
consolidation or otherwise, would materially and adversely affect any right,
preference, privilege or voting power of the Series D Preferred Stock or the
holders thereof but not all series of Parity Stock upon which like voting
rights have been conferred and are exercisable, the affirmative vote or
consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of the Series D
Preferred Stock outstanding at the time, given in person or by proxy, either
in writing or at a meeting, shall be required in addition to the vote or
consent that would otherwise be required by _Section 7(d)(ii)_ hereof.

  



  

 _(8)  Restrictions on Transfer._ The Series D Preferred Stock
is governed by and issued subject to all of the limitations, terms and
conditions of the Charter, including but not limited to the terms and
conditions (including exceptions and exemptions) of Article VII of the
Charter; _provided_ , _however_ , that the terms and conditions (including
exceptions and exemptions) of Article VII of the Charter shall also be
applied to the Series D Preferred Stock separately and without regard to any
other series or class he foregoing sentence shall not be construed to limit
the applicability of any other term or provision of the Charter to the Series
D Preferred Stock in addition to the legend contemplated by Article VII,
Section 7.2.9 of the Charter, each certificate for Series D Preferred Stock
shall bear substantially the following legend:

  



  

"The Corporation will furnish to any stockholder on request and without
charge a full statement of the designations and any preferences,
conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to
dividends, qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption of the stock
of each class which the Corporation is authorized to issue, to the extent they
have been set, and of the authority of the Board of Directors to set the
relative rights and preferences of a subsequent series of a preferred or
special class of stock. Such request may be made to the Secretary of the
Corporation or to its transfer agent."

  



  

 _(9) Settlement._ Nothing in this Second Article of these
Articles Supplementary shall be interpreted to preclude the settlement of
any transaction entered into through the facilities of the NYSE or other
securities exchange (including Nasdaq), or an automated inter-dealer
quotation system.

  



  

   

12

 



    



  

THIRD: These Articles Supplementary have been approved by the Board in the
manner and by the vote required by law.

  



  

FOURTH: These Articles Supplementary shall be effective at the time the State
Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland accepts these Articles
Supplementary for record.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused these Articles Supplementary
to be signed in its name and on its behalf by its Chief Executive
Officer, and witnessed by its Secretary on [_________], 2021.

 _EXHIBIT A_

  



    

  

 _Form of First Amendment to Management Agreement_

  



  

THIS FIRST AMENDMENT TO MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (this " _Amendment_ ") is made
and entered into as of December 6, 2020 by and among Anworth Mortgage Asset
Corporation, a Maryland corporation (the " _Company_ "), Anworth Management,
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the " _Manager_ "), and, solely
for the purposes of _Section 6_ hereof, Ready Capital Corporation, a Maryland
corporation (" _Parent_ "). The Company, the Manager and Parent are each
sometimes referred to herein as a " _Party_ ", and collectively as, the "
_Parties "._ Capitalized terms used herein but not defined shall have the
meanings ascribed to such terms in the Management Agreement or the Merger
Agreement (each as defined below), as the case may be.

  



  

 _RECITALS_

  



  

WHEREAS, the Company and the Manager are parties to that certain Management
Agreement, dated as of December 31, 2011 (the " _Management Agreement_ ");

  



  

WHEREAS, contemporaneously with the entry into this Amendment, the Company
has entered into that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
December 6, 2020, by and among Parent, RC Merger Subsidiary, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger
Sub_ "), and the Company (as may be amended from time to time, the " _Merger
Agreement_ "), pursuant to which it is contemplated that the Company will
merge with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub being the surviving entity of
the merger (the " _Merger_ "); and

  



  

WHEREAS, in connection with the Merger Agreement and the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated thereby, the Parties desire, subject to the
terms and conditions set forth herein, to amend the Management Agreement to
provide, among other things, for: (i) the termination of the Management
Agreement effective as of the Closing Date (as defined in the Merger
Agreement); and (ii) certain additional obligations and agreements among the
Parties and for the benefit of Parent.

  



  

 _AGREEMENT_

  



  

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as follows:

  



  

1.   _Termination of Management Agreement; Survival of Certain Provisions_.

  



  

(a)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Management
Agreement, the Parties hereby agree that the Management Agreement and all
rights and obligations of the Company and the Manager thereunder (including,
without limitation, Section 3(b) thereof) shall be automatically terminated
and of no further force or effect as of the Closing Date (such termination,
the " _Termination_ ", which shall be deemed a Termination Without Cause (as
defined in the Management Agreement)), without any further notice or
action by any of the Company or the Manager. Notwithstanding the foregoing:

  



  

(i) The Manager shall be entitled to receive the monthly Management
Fee payable to the Manager pursuant to the terms and conditions of Management
Agreement, prorated through the date of the Termination. Within 15 days
following the Closing Date, the Manager will deliver to Parent, as successor
to the Company, a written statement setting forth in reasonable detail
the Manager's good faith computation, in accordance with the Management
Agreement and consistent with past practice, of any and all Management Fees
accrued pursuant to Section 6 of the Management Agreement and unpaid as of the
Closing Date (the  " _Accrued Management Fee_ "); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (A) the Accrued Management Fee for the month in which the Closing occurs
shall be pro-rated based on the number of days in such month that have elapsed
up to and including the Closing Date compared to the total number of days in
such month, and (B) for purposes of the computation of the Accrued Management
Fee for the month in which the Closing occurs, Equity (as defined in the
Management Agreement) shall be determined as of the end of the month which
occurred immediately prior to the Closing Date. Within five (5) Business Days
following the Manager's delivery of such written statement of the Accrued
Management Fees pursuant to the preceding sentence, Parent or Merger Sub, as
successor to the Company, will pay to the Manager the Accrued
Management Fees.

  



  

   

1

 



    



  

(ii)  Within 15 days following the Closing Date, the Manager will
deliver to Parent, as successor to the Company, a written statement setting
forth in reasonable detail a calculation of all unreimbursed expenses (A)
incurred by the Manager or its Affiliates on behalf of the Company in the
ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice prior to the
Closing Date, which are reimbursable to the Manager or its Affiliates in
accordance with the terms of Section 7 of the Management Agreement, and (B)
that have been incurred by the Manager in connection with the Termination,
including, without limitation, third-party legal, expert and other fees and
expenses relating to any actions, proceedings, lawsuits, demands, causes of
action and claims, whether actual or threatened, made by or against the
Company in connection with, or after public announcement of, the Merger
Agreement, the Merger or other Transactions (collectively, the "
_Unreimbursed Expenses_ "). Within five (5) Business Days following
the Manager's delivery of such written statement of the Unreimbursed Expenses
pursuant to the preceding sentence, Parent or Merger Sub, as successor to the
Company, will pay to the Manager the Unreimbursed Expenses.

  



  

(iii)  Promptly following the Closing Date, the Manager shall take
those actions required of the Manager pursuant to Section 13 of the
Management Agreement upon the terms and conditions set forth therein;
_provided_ , that for such purposes all payments shall be made, and all
documents and property delivered, to the Parent as successor to the Company.

  



  

(iv)  The following provisions of the Management Agreement shall
survive the Termination and shall continue to remain in full force and
effect: Section 5 (Records; Confidentiality), Section 7 (Expenses of the
Company), solely to the extent of any Unreimbursed Expenses, Section 8
(Limits of the Manager's Responsibility), Section 13 (Action Upon
Termination), and Section 14 (Release of Money or Other Property Upon Written
Request).

  



  

(b)  Prior to the Termination, (i) the Company and the Manager shall
comply in all respects with all the terms and conditions of the Management
Agreement, (ii) the Company and the Manager shall not amend the Management
Agreement or this Amendment, in each case without the prior written consent
of Parent, and (iii) except as specifically permitted or required by the
Merger Agreement, as required by law, or as consented to in writing by Parent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), the Manager shall conduct its activities with respect to the
Company and the Company's subsidiaries, and its obligations pursuant to the
Management Agreement, in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice in all material respects. Further, the Manager agrees to cooperate
with the Company and Parent prior to the Closing and take all actions
reasonably requested by the Company or Parent prior to the Closing in order
to carry out and effect the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement.

  



  

2.   _Termination Payment_.

  



  

(a) In consideration for the Termination and the other promises,
undertakings and releases of the Manager hereunder, the Company shall pay to
the Manager the termination fee amount of $20,300,000 (the " _Termination
Payment_ "), payable in a lump sum cash payment on the Closing Date, subject
to the Manager's compliance with the terms and conditions of the Management
Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, as amended by this
Amendment). The Termination Payment shall be deemed (i) to constitute, and
shall in all respects satisfy all obligations with respect to, the
"Termination Fee" (as defined by the Management Agreement), and (ii) to be
the aggregate unpaid Management Fee that, had the Management Agreement not
been automatically terminated as of the Closing, would have accrued under
Section 6 of the Management Agreement for the period commencing on the day
immediately following the Closing Date and the Termination through the end of
the Automatic Renewal Term (as defined in the Management Agreement) ended
December 31, 2021.

  



  

   

2

 



    



  

(b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Management
Agreement, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the Termination Payment,
any Accrued Management Fee, and any Unreimbursed Expenses payable hereunder,
shall be the entire amounts payable to the Manager or any of its affiliates
in connection with the Termination and thereafter under or in respect of the
Management Agreement, as amended by this Amendment, unless the Merger
Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1 of the Merger
Agreement without the occurrence of the Effective Time (as defined in the
Merger Agreement), and except with respect to those rights and obligations
which, pursuant to _Section 1_ hereof, survive the Termination. For the
avoidance of doubt, prior to the Termination, the Manager shall only be
entitled to receive payments from the Company that are consistent with past
practice and pursuant to the terms of the Management Agreement; _provided_ ,
that this _Section 2(b)_ shall not be deemed to limit any bona fide claims
the Manager may have (and any payments related thereto) pursuant to Section 7
(to the extent of any Unreimbursed Expenses to be reimbursed after the
Closing), Section 8, Section 13, or Section 14 of the Management Agreement.

  



  

3.   _Waiver of Notice Requirement_. Each of the Company and the Manager hereby (i) agree that this Amendment constitutes all required notice of termination of the Management Agreement pursuant to the terms of the Management Agreement, and (ii) waives, whether exercisable now or at any time in the future, any and all rights to notice under the Management Agreement, to the extent relating to the transactions contemplated by this Amendment or the Merger Agreement.

  



  

4.   _Release_.

  



  

(a)  Effective as of, and contingent upon, the Termination, each of
the Company, the Manager, and its respective affiliates hereby fully and
unconditionally releases and forever discharges the other party and the
affiliates of the other party (including, as applicable, the Company's
Subsidiaries, Parent, the affiliates of Parent, and the Surviving Company),
and their respective administrators, executors, representatives, successors
and assigns, from any and all actions, causes of action, suits, debts,
accounts, covenants, liabilities, disputes, agreements, promises, damages,
judgments, executions, claims, and demands whatsoever in law or in equity ("
_Claims_ ") that they ever had, now have, or that they or their
administrators, executors, representatives, successors and assigns hereafter
can or may have, arising under or pursuant to the Management Agreement, except
with respect to those rights and obligations which, pursuant to _Section 1_
hereof, survive the Termination.

  



  

(b) Each of the Company and the Manager agrees that it shall not
make any assignment of any Claim or any right of any kind whatsoever embodied
in any of the Claims released herein, and that no other person or entity of
any kind shall have any interest in any of the Claims released herein.

  



  

5. _Certain Reduction of Payments by the Company_. If, notwithstanding such agreement and understanding of the parties, it is ultimately established, pursuant to a final determination of a court or an Internal Revenue Service proceeding which has been finally and conclusively resolved (in any such case, a " _Final Determination_ "), that some portion of the Termination Payment paid pursuant to _Section 2_ hereof constitutes an excess parachute payment under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), then the Manager and/or any of its service providers that are deemed to be disqualified individuals who received excess parachute payments under Section 280G of the Code (each, a " _Recipient_ ") shall be obligated to pay back to the Parent, as successor to the Company, or, if such Recipient is or was a service provider to the Manager, such Recipient shall be obligated to pay back to the Manager who shall, in turn, be obligated to pay such amounts received to Parent, as successor to the Company, a portion of such payments equal to the Repayment Amount within 30 days of such Final Determination. The " _Repayment Amount_ " shall be the smallest such amount, if any, as shall be required to be repaid to the Parent, as successor to the Company, so that such Recipient's net after-tax proceeds (after taking into account the payment of the excise tax imposed pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code (the " _Excise Tax_ ") and all other taxes imposed on the Termination Payment) shall be maximized, and shall include interest at the applicable Federal rate, as determined under Section 1274 of the Code. If the Excise Tax is not eliminated pursuant to this _Section 5_, such Recipient shall pay the applicable Excise Tax. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Manager, the Recipients, the Company, and Parent, as successor to the Company, agree to work together and use commercially reasonable efforts to address any potential effects of Section 280G of the Code, including, without limitation (and in the Manager's discretion), engaging a third-party valuation expert to help demonstrate that any payments made or to be made to a Recipient should be considered "reasonable compensation" for purposes of Section 280G of the Code.

  



  

   

3

 



    



  

6.   _Successors and Assigns; Third Party Beneficiaries; Guarantee; Further Actions; Specific Performance; Representations and Warranties_.

  



  

(a)  This Amendment shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of the Parties and their respective heirs, personal
representatives, successors and assigns as provided in this Amendment. Parent
and its affiliates, successors and assigns shall be entitled to rely on this
Amendment in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement. Parent shall be an express third-party beneficiary
of this Amendment (including applicable provisions of the Management
Agreement), and Parent shall be entitled to enforce any such provisions _._

  



  

(b)  Effective as of, and contingent upon, the Closing, Parent fully
and unconditionally guarantees the timely and full performance of the
obligations of the Company that by their terms survive the Closing and the
Termination under this Amendment and the Management Agreement as if it were
the Company. Parent waives promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance and any
other notice with respect to this _Section 6(b)_ , its guaranteed
obligations, and all demands whatsoever. Parent covenants that the guarantee
in this  _Section 6(b)_ will not be discharged, except by complete
performance of the obligations contained in this Amendment, subject in all
cases to the terms of this Amendment.

  



  

(c)  Each Party agrees to execute and deliver such additional
documents and instruments and to perform such additional acts as any Party
may reasonably request or as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to
effectuate, consummate and perform the terms, provisions, or conditions of
this Amendment.

  



  

(d)  It is understood and agreed that money damages may not be an
adequate remedy for any breach of this Amendment by any Party and that any
non-breaching Party shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including,
without limitation, injunction and specific performance, as a remedy for any
such actual or potential breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the
exclusive remedies for a breach by a Party of this Amendment, but shall be in
addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to any non-
breaching Party.

  



  

(e)  Each of the Parties hereby represents and warrants to the other
Parties that (i) such Party has the absolute and unrestricted right, power,
and authority to (A) execute and deliver this Amendment, and (B) perform its
obligations hereunder, and (ii) such Party has consulted with, or has been
afforded the opportunity to consult with, counsel of its own choosing in
connection with this Amendment and that it enters into this Amendment of its
own free will and as its independent act.

  



  

7.   _Termination_.
