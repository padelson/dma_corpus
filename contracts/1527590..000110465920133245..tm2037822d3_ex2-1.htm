subject, as to enforceability, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other Laws of general applicability

prepare and file with the SEC the Registration Statement (of which the Joint Proxy Statement will be a part). The Company and Parent
shall each use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement to comply with
the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff. Parent and the
Company shall each use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become effective under the Securities
Act as soon after such filing as practicable and Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Registration
Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger. Each of the Company and Parent will advise the other promptly
after it receives any request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement or comments thereon
and responses thereto or any request by the SEC for additional information. Each of the Company and Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause all documents that it is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the Transactions to
comply as to form and substance in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange

the Joint Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto,
each of the Company and Parent will (i) provide the other with an opportunity to review and comment on such document or response
(including the proposed final version of such document or response), (ii) shall include in such document or response all comments
reasonably proposed by the other and (iii) shall not file or mail such document or respond to the SEC prior to receiving the approval
of the other, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; <I>provided</I>, <I>however</I>, that
with respect to documents filed by a party that are incorporated by reference in the Joint Proxy Statement or Registration Statement,
this right of approval shall apply only with respect to information relating to the other party, its Subsidiaries and its Affiliates,
their business, financial condition or results of operations or the Transactions; and <I>provided</I>, <I>further</I> that the
Company, in connection with any Company Change of Recommendation, or Parent, in connection with any Parent Change of Recommendation,
may amend or supplement the Joint Proxy Statement (including by incorporation by reference) and make other filings with the SEC,

adequate provision whereby the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock shall have a reasonable opportunity to determine the

rights of such securities shall provide for adjustments of the Conversion Rate and other appropriate numerical thresholds
which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments of the Conversion Rate provided for in Section
7. If, in the case of any such Business Combination, the stock or other securities and assets receivable thereupon by a
holder of shares of Common Stock includes shares of stock or other securities and assets of a corporation other than the
successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, in such Business Combination, then such documents governing the
rights of such securities shall also be executed by such other corporation and shall contain such additional provisions to
