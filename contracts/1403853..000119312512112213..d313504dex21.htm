-iii-  _STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT_

 

This STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made as of March 7,
2012, by and among Heckmann Hydrocarbons Holdings Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (" _Buyer_ "), Heckmann Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("
_Parent_ "), TFI Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "),
and Green Fuel Services, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("
_Seller_ "). Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein have the
meanings set forth in _ARTICLE 10_ below.

 

WHEREAS, Seller owns all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of the
Company, which as of the date hereof consists of (and as of the Closing shall
consist of) one thousand (1,000) shares of the Companys common stock, par
value $0.01 per share (collectively, the " _Shares_ "); and

 

WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, Buyer
desires to acquire from Seller all of the Shares, and Seller desires to sell
to Buyer all of such Shares.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, representations
and warranties and mutual covenants contained herein and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE 1

 

 _PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES_

1.01 _Purchase and Sale of Shares_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, Seller shall sell,
assign, transfer and convey to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase and acquire
from Seller, all of the Shares owned by Seller, free and clear of all Liens,
in exchange for the payment by Buyer to Seller of cash and stock as provided
in this Agreement.

 

1.02 _Closing and Final Consideration_.

(a) _Purchase Price_. As consideration for the acquisition of the Shares at
Closing, Buyer shall pay Seller an amount equal to the Closing Consideration
_plus_ the Escrow Amount, _plus_  amounts paid pursuant to _Section 1.05_
(as adjusted for Final Net Working Capital, calculated, credited and payable
as set forth below, the " _Purchase Price_ ").

 

(b) _Closing Consideration_. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Closing
Consideration_ " means an amount equal to: (i) Two Hundred Forty-Five Million
Dollars ($245,000,000); _minus_ (ii) the outstanding amount of Indebtedness as
of the Closing (payable by Buyer pursuant to _Section 1.05(a)_ below);
_minus_ (iii) the amount of Company Transaction Expenses unpaid as of the
Closing (payable by Buyer pursuant to _Section 1.05(b)_ below); _plus_ (iv)
the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Net Working Capital exceeds the Net
Working Capital Target;  _minus_ (v) the amount, if any, by which the
Estimated Net Working Capital is less than the Net Working Capital Target;
_minus_ (vi) the Escrow Amount, payable as set forth in _Section 1.02(c)_
below; _plus_  (vii) Nine Hundred Five Thousand Ten Dollars and 83/100
($905,010.83) (the " _Add-On Acquisition Amount_ ") in respect of costs
relating to the Add-On Acquisition.

 



-1-  (c) _Payment of Closing Consideration and Escrow Amount_. On the Closing Date,
Buyer shall make the following payments:

(i) Buyer shall deliver to Seller an amount in cash equal to the
Closing Consideration by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account specified by Seller to Buyer at least two (2) Business Days prior to
Closing; and

 

(ii) In addition to the payment under _Section 1.02(c)(i)_, at the Closing,
Buyer shall contribute on behalf of Seller a number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to (A) the Escrow Amount, _divided by_ (B) the Closing Date
Stock Price (such shares, the " _Escrow Shares_ "), to the Escrow Agent to
hold under the Escrow Agreement, which Escrow Shares shall be issued under a
valid private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) promulgated under the
Securities Act.

(d) _Estimated Net Working Capital_. Between the date hereof and the Closing
Date, the Company shall keep Buyer reasonably informed regarding its
preparation of the calculation of Net Working Capital pursuant to this
_Section 1.02(d)_, and shall consider in good faith any comments made by
Buyer with respect thereto. Within five (5) Business Days, but in no event
less than three (3) Business Days, prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to Buyer its final good faith estimate of the Net Working
Capital (the " _Estimated Net Working Capital_ "), which amount shall increase
or decrease, as applicable, the Purchase Price at Closing.

 

(e) _Post-Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment_.

 

(i) As promptly as possible, but in any event within sixty (60) days after the
Closing Date, Buyer will deliver to Seller: (A) an unaudited, consolidated
balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiary as of the Closing Date (the "
_Closing Date Balance Sheet_ ") and (B) its calculation of Net Working Capital
as of the Closing Date, in each case duly certified by Buyer as setting forth
Buyers good faith determination of the information set forth therein, and
together, in each case, with reasonable supporting documentation (together,
the " _Closing Statement_ "). The Closing Statement shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with the definition of the term "Net Working Capital" set
forth in this Agreement and under GAAP, as applicable. The Closing Statement
shall disregard: (x) any and all effects on the assets or liabilities of the
Company and its Subsidiary as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby
or of any financing or refinancing arrangements entered into at any time by
Buyer or any other transaction entered into by Buyer in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; and (y) any of the
plans, transactions or changes which Buyer intends to initiate or make, or
cause to be initiated or made, after the Closing with respect to the Company
and its Subsidiary or their respective businesses or assets, or any facts or
circumstances that are unique or particular to Buyer or any of its assets or
liabilities.

 



-2-  (ii) Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiary shall grant Seller and
its authorized representatives reasonable access to all such papers and
documents and all such personnel as it or its representatives may reasonably
request, and Seller shall have up to sixty (60) days after receiving the
Closing Statement to review the Closing Statement (the " _Review Period_ ");
_provided_ that, in the event Buyer, the Company or its Subsidiary does not
provide, in all material respects, any papers or documents or access to
personnel reasonably requested by Seller or any of its authorized
representatives within five (5) Business Days of request therefor (or such
shorter period as may remain in the Review Period), the Review Period shall be
extended by five (5) Business Days plus one (1) Business Day for each
additional day required for Buyer, the Company or its Subsidiary to so respond
to such request.

(iii) To the extent that Seller confirms its acceptance of the Closing
Statement within the Review Period or has not objected in writing to the
calculation of Net Working Capital on the Closing Statement by the end of the
Review Period, the Closing Statement and the calculation of Net Working
Capital thereon as prepared by Buyer shall be final, binding and non-
appealable by the parties hereto.

 

(iv) If Seller has any objections to the Closing Statement, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer a statement (an " _Objections Statement_ ") describing in
reasonable detail those items and amounts to which Seller objects (the "
_Disputed Items_ "). Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to resolve
the Disputed Items, but if they do not reach a final resolution within thirty
(30) days after the delivery of the Objections Statement to Buyer, Seller and
Buyer shall submit any unresolved Disputed Items to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
(" _PWC_ ");  _provided_ that, if PWC is unable or unwilling to serve in such
capacity, Seller and Buyer shall submit any unresolved Disputed Items to an
alternative mutually agreed upon independent accounting or valuation firm of
national reputation (PWC or such alternative firm, the " _Firm_ "). Each
party may furnish to the Firm such information and documents as it deems
relevant, with copies of such submission and all such documents and
information being concurrently given to the other party. Seller and Buyer
shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Firm
to resolve such unresolved Disputed Items and notify them in writing of such
resolution as soon as practicable, but in any event within thirty (30) days
after the date on which the Firm is first retained. In resolving any disputed
item, the Firm shall resolve each item of disagreement based solely on the
supporting material provided by Buyer and Seller and not pursuant to
an independent review, and may not assign a value to any particular item
greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either Party or less
than the lowest value for such item claimed by either Party, in each case
presented to the Firm. The decision of the Firm regarding each of the
Disputed Items shall be final, binding and non-appealable by the parties
hereto. Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses in connection with
the resolution of such dispute by the Firm. The fees and expenses of the Firm
shall be borne on a proportionate basis by Buyer and Seller based on the
inverse proportion of the respective percentages of the dollar value of
Disputed Items determined in favor of Buyer and Seller, respectively. Seller
and Buyer shall, and Buyer shall cause the Company and its Subsidiary to,
cooperate fully with the Firm and respond on a timely basis to all requests
for information or access to documents or personnel made by the Firm, all with
the intent to fairly and in good faith resolve all

 



-3-   Disputed Items as promptly as reasonably practicable. Once all Disputed
Items are resolved, the calculation of the Net Working Capital on the Closing
Statement shall be adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect (A) any resolution of
Disputed Items as agreed between Buyer and Seller; and/or (B) any
determination of Disputed Items by the Firm, and the Closing Statement and the
calculation of the Net Working Capital thereon (in each case, as so adjusted)
shall be final, binding and non-appealable by the parties hereto.

(v) If the Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to this
_Section 1.02(e)_ (the " _Final Net Working Capital_ ") is greater than the
Estimated Net Working Capital by more than One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars
($150,000) (the " _Collar Amount_ "), then the amount of such difference
shall be an adjustment in favor of Seller, payable as set forth in _Section
1.02(e)(vi)_ below. Alternatively, if the Final Net Working Capital is less
than the Estimated Net Working Capital by more than the Collar Amount, then
the amount of such difference shall be an adjustment in favor of Buyer,
payable as set forth in _Section 1.02(e)(vi)_ below.

 

(vi) If the aggregate net difference between the Final Net Working Capital and
the Estimated Net Working Capital results in a net amount payable to Seller
pursuant to _Section 1.02(e)(v)_, then Buyer shall pay such net amount to
Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds. If the aggregate net
difference between the Final Net Working Capital and the Estimated Net
Working Capital results in a net amount payable to Buyer pursuant to _Section
1.02(e)(v)_, then Seller shall pay such net amount to Buyer, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds.

 

(vii) All payments required pursuant to this _Section 1.02(e)_ shall be
deemed to be adjustments, for Tax purposes, to the aggregate Purchase Price
paid by Buyer for the Shares purchased by it pursuant to this Agreement.

1.03  _The Closing_. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Kirkland and
Ellis LLP, located at 300 North LaSalle, Chicago, Illinois, on the
third (3rd) Business Day following satisfaction or waiver of all of the
closing conditions set forth in _ARTICLE 2_ hereof (other than those which by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing), or on such other date as is
mutually agreeable to Buyer and Seller. The date of the Closing is herein
referred to as the " _Closing Date_." The Closing shall be deemed to occur at,
and the calculation of all Closing amounts to be made hereunder (including the
Net Working Capital) shall be made as of, 12:01 a.m. Chicago time on the
Closing Date.

1.04 _Escrow Deposit_. At the Closing, Buyer shall deposit the Escrow Amount
(in the form of Escrow Shares) with the Escrow Agent in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement.

1.05 _Payoff of Indebtedness; Payment of Company Transaction Expenses_.

(a) At the Closing, Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, on behalf of the
Company and its Subsidiary, the amounts of Indebtedness indicated in the
payoff letters delivered pursuant to _Section 2.01(g)(viii)_ by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the Persons or bank accounts specified in
such payoff letters.

 



-4-  (b) At the Closing, Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, on behalf of the
Company and its Subsidiary, the Company Transaction Expenses specified on
_Schedule 1.05(b)_ , by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
Persons or bank accounts specified on such Schedule.

(a) Seller is an "accredited investor" within the meaning of Rule 501(a)
promulgated under the Securities Act. With respect to the Escrow Shares,
Seller understands that the Escrow Shares issuable hereunder are being offered
and sold in reliance on specific exemptions from the registration requirements
of United States federal and state securities Laws and that Parent is relying
in part upon the truth and accuracy of, and Sellers compliance with, the
representations, warranties, agreements, acknowledgements and understanding of
Seller set forth in this _Section 3.05_ in order to determine
the availability of such exemptions and the eligibility of Seller to acquire
the Escrow Shares to be acquired, or that may be acquired, hereunder.

report, registration statement and definitive proxy statement filed by Parent
with the SEC and has been afforded the opportunity to ask questions of and
receive answers from Parent regarding Parent and the transactions contemplated
hereby. Seller understands that its investment in the shares of Parent Common
Stock being issued, or issuable, hereunder involves a high degree of risk.
Seller has sought such accounting, legal and Tax advice as it has considered
necessary to make an informed investment decision with respect to its
acquisition of shares of Parent Common Stock that may be acquired
hereunder. Seller understands that no United States federal or state agency
or any other Governmental Body has passed on or made any recommendation or
endorsement of the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable hereunder, or the
fairness or suitability of the investment in Parent Common Stock, nor have
such authorities passed upon or endorsed the merits of the offering of Parent
Common Stock contemplated hereby.

directly or indirectly, with any Person to distribute any of the shares of
Parent Common Stock that may be received hereunder in a transaction that
would violate the Securities Act or any state securities Laws.

(d) Seller understands that the Escrow Shares issued hereunder have not been
and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities
Laws, and may not be offered for sale, sold, assigned or transferred unless
(i) subsequently registered thereunder or (ii) pursuant to an exemption from
such registration, including pursuant to Rule 144 (or a successor rule
thereto), and that neither Parent nor any other Person is under any obligation
to register such shares of Parent Common Stock under the Securities Act or
any state securities Laws. Seller further understands and acknowledges that
Escrow Shares issued to it at Closing pursuant to _Section 1.02_ will be
placed into the Escrow Account pursuant to the terms and conditions herein
and in the Escrow Agreement and that, except as expressly provided for herein
or in the Escrow Agreement (including without limitation _Section 9.04(c)_
hereof), Seller may not sell, assign or transfer the Escrow Shares during
the term of the Escrow Agreement.

(e) Seller understands that the certificates or other instruments representing
the Escrow Shares issuable hereunder will bear a restrictive legend as set
forth below and an additional legend indicating the certificates are subject
to the holding period restrictions of _Section 3.05(d)_ above, and that a
stop-transfer order may be placed against transfer of such stock
certificates; _provided_ that any such legend shall be removed and Parent
shall issue a certificate

 



-9-   without legend to the holder of the shares of Parent Common Stock at
Parents cost and expense, if (i) such shares of Parent Common Stock are
registered pursuant to an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act; or (ii) in connection with a sale, assignment or other
transfer, Parent receives an opinion of counsel, in a reasonably acceptable
form, to the effect that such sale, assignment or transfer of such shares of
Parent Common Stock may be made without registration under the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act and state Law, including pursuant to Rule
144; _provided_ _further_ that, after the expiration of the holding period
applicable pursuant to Rule 144, the legend indicating that the certificates
are subject to restrictions thereof shall be removed and Parent shall issue a
certificate without such legend to the holder of the shares of Parent Common
Stock at Parents cost and expense, as and when requested by Seller.

(f) Seller understands that, except as provided in  _Section 3.05(e)_, all
certificates or other instruments representing the Escrow Shares issuable
hereunder shall bear the following restrictive legends:

THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION OR THE SECURITIES COMMISSION OF ANY STATE IN RELIANCE UPON AN
EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE

PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR
PURSUANT TO AN AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM, OR IN A TRANSACTION NOT SUBJECT TO,
THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH
APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS.

6.02 _Access_. From the date hereof until the Closing Date, the Company shall
provide Buyer and its authorized representatives (" _Buyer s

reasonable notice and in a manner so as not to interfere with the normal
business operations of the Company and its Subsidiary, to the offices, assets,
properties, books and records, agreements and senior management of the Company
and its Subsidiary in order for Buyer to have the opportunity to make such
investigation and inspection as it shall reasonably desire as to the affairs
of the Company and its Subsidiary (except that Buyer shall conduct no
environmental sampling or testing of the sort commonly referred to as a "Phase
II environmental assessment" without the Companys written approval). Buyer
shall comply and shall cause Buyers Representatives to comply (and Parent
shall cause Buyer and Buyers Representatives to comply) with all of
their obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement, dated December 10,
2011, between Parent and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "),

and Parent in connection with any such filing (including, to the extent

non-filing parties prior to filing and considering all reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith) and in connection with
resolving any investigation or other inquiry of any of the FTC or other
Governmental Body under any antitrust Laws with respect to any such filing or
such transaction. The Company shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, promptly inform Buyer or Parent of any oral communication with, and
provide copies of written communications with, any Governmental Body
regarding any such filings or any such transaction.

6.04 _Conditions_. The Company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the conditions set forth in _Section 2.01_ hereof to be satisfied

6.05 _Exclusive Dealing_. During the period from the date of this Agreement
through the Closing Date or the earlier termination of this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 8.01_ hereof, neither Seller nor the Company shall take or permit
any other Person on its behalf to take any action to encourage, initiate or
engage in discussions or negotiations with, provide any information to, or
enter into any agreement or understanding with, any Person (other than Parent,

securities) of the Company or its Subsidiary; (iv) liquidation, dissolution,
or other similar type of transaction with respect to the Company or its
Subsidiary; or (v) transaction which is similar in form, substance or purpose
to any of the foregoing transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that the term "
_Acquisition Proposal_ " shall not include the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Each of Seller and the Company will immediately: (x) cease
any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties
conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing; and (y) notify
Parent in writing in the event that any of the foregoing receives any
requests for information or proposals relating to any Acquisition Proposal
(including the terms of any such proposal and the identity of the maker
thereof).

6.06 _Updated Disclosures; Interim Financial Statements_

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, the Company shall disclose
to Parent in writing promptly upon discovery thereof: (i) (in the form of
updated Schedules) any material variances from the representations and

written notice from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or
may be required with respect to a Material Contract in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that such disclosure
shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to Buyer
or Parent, or the representations or warranties contained in _ARTICLE 4_ , or
the conditions to the obligation of Buyer or Parent to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except with respect to any
Updated Disclosures that disclose underlying events that occurred and
circumstances that arose or which the Company first obtained knowledge of
(which shall not include any matters which the Company would have obtained
knowledge of prior to the date hereof in connection with reasonable internal
inquiry) exclusively between the day after the date of this Agreement and the
Closing which are delivered to Parent in no event later than three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing (a " _Qualifying Updated Disclosure_ "),
which Qualifying Updated Disclosure will be treated as included in the
Companys disclosure schedule solely for the purpose of determining whether an
indemnification obligation exists under _ARTICLE 9_ , and such Qualifying
Updated Disclosure will not be treated as though it had been included in the
disclosure schedules for the determination of whether the conditions set forth
in _ARTICLE 2_ have been satisfied.

 

(b) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, the Company shall promptly
deliver to Parent copies of the monthly consolidated financial statements of
the Company and its Subsidiary as they are finalized, but in no event later

_Interim Financial Statements_ ").

 



-29-  6.07 _Financing Process Assistance_. Seller and the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts, at Buyers sole cost and expense, to provide

subject to customary confidentiality requirements reasonably acceptable to the
Company, providing to Parents Financing sources all material financial
information in their possession with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiary as reasonably requested by Parent or Parents Financing sources;
(ii) making the Companys senior officers reasonably available to Parents
Financing sources in connection with the Financing, to reasonably participate

limitation, assistance with respect to procuring survey and title for Owned
Real Property); (iv) obtaining the payoff letters and Lien terminations and
instruments of discharge contemplated by this Agreement; and (v) furnishing
Parent and its Financing sources reasonably promptly with such documentation
and other information in the Companys possession which any lender providing

determined is required by regulatory authorities in connection with
such Financing under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations, including without limitation the Patriot
Act.

6.08 _Maintaining Corporate Existence of Seller_. During the period of time
from the Closing Date until December 31, 2013, Seller take all commercially
reasonable actions to maintain its status as a separate and validly existing
legal entity, and without the written consent of Buyer or Parent, shall not
during such period, enter into a merger, sale, dissolution, liquidation or
other disposition of Seller, _provided_ , _however_ , that such restrictions
will not apply in the case of a transaction that is reasonably likely to
increase the creditworthiness of Seller or otherwise make it more likely for
Seller to discharge Sellers obligations hereunder.

 

ARTICLE 7

 

 _COVENANTS OF BUYER_

7.01 _Access_. From and after the Closing until the fifth (5th) anniversary
thereof (and subject to any applicable legal or contractual confidentiality
limitations restricting the obligations of Buyer hereunder), Buyer shall
cause the Company to provide Seller and its authorized representatives with
reasonable access (for the purpose of examining and copying), during normal
business hours, to the personnel, books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiary solely with respect to periods or occurrences prior to the Closing
Date in connection with a reasonable business purpose communicated by Seller
to the Company, whether or not relating to or arising out of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby. Unless otherwise consented to in
writing by Seller, Buyer shall not, and shall not permit the Company or its
Subsidiary to, for a period of five (5) years following the Closing Date,
intentionally destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any books and records of
the Company or its Subsidiary, or any portions thereof, relating to periods
prior to the Closing Date without first giving reasonable prior notice to
Seller and offering to surrender to Seller such books and records or such
portions thereof.

 



-30-  7.02 _Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification_.

 

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, Buyer shall cause the
Organizational Documents of the Company and its Subsidiary to contain
provisions relating to the exculpation, indemnification or advancement of
expenses of any officers and directors, that are no less favorable to the
officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiary who were officers
and directors prior to the Closing (each, a " _D andO Indemnified Person_")
than are presently set forth in Organizational Documents of the Company and
its Subsidiary.

 

(b) In addition, from and after the Closing through the sixth (6th)
anniversary thereof, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiary (each, a " _D andO Indemnifying Party_") to, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law (but solely to the extent of the coverage actually
provided under the Tail Policy), (i) indemnify and hold harmless the DandO
Indemnified Persons against all DandO Expenses (as defined below), losses,
claims, damages, judgments or amounts paid in settlement (collectively, " _D
andO Costs_") in respect of any threatened, pending or completed claim, action,
suit or proceeding, whether criminal, civil, administrative or investigative,
based on or arising out or relating to the fact that such Person is or was a
director or officer of the Company or its Subsidiary and arising out of acts
or omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing (but solely to the extent
of the coverage actually provided for under the Tail Policy) (a " _D andO
Indemnifiable Claim_"), and (ii) advance to such DandO Indemnified Persons
all DandO Expenses incurred in connection with any DandO Indemnifiable Claim
(including in circumstances where the DandO Indemnifying Party has assumed the
defense of such claim) promptly after receipt of reasonably detailed
statements therefor (but solely to the extent of the coverage actually
provided for under the Tail Policy); _provided_ , _however_ , that the DandO
Indemnified Person to whom DandO Expenses are to be advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
DandO Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification. Any DandO
Indemnifiable Claims shall continue until such DandO Indemnifiable Claim is
disposed of or all judgments, orders, decrees or other rulings in connection
with such DandO Indemnifiable Claim are fully satisfied (but solely to the
extent of the coverage actually provided for in the Companys or its
Subsidiarys certificate of incorporation or bylaws). For the purposes of
this _Section 7.02(a)_, " _D andO Expenses_" means reasonable attorneys fees
and all other costs, charges and expenses paid or incurred in connection with
investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating in (including
on appeal), or preparing to defend, be a witness in or participate in any DandO
Indemnifiable Claim, but shall exclude losses, claims, damages, judgments or
amounts paid in settlement (which items are, for the avoidance of doubt,
included in the definition of DandO Costs, but solely to the extent of the
coverage actually provided for in the Companys or its Subsidiarys
certificate of incorporation or bylaws).

 

(c) At the Closing, Seller may purchase and continually pay for irrevocable
"tail" insurance policies naming the DandO Indemnified Persons as direct
beneficiaries (the " _Tail Policy_ "). Buyer shall not, and shall cause the
Company not to, cancel or change such insurance policies in any respect,
provided that all maintenance and premium obligations shall be the sole
financial responsibility of Seller and the DandO Indemnified Persons.

 



-31-  (d) In the event Buyer, the Company or its Subsidiary, or any of their
respective successors or assigns, (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then and in either such case
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer,
the Company or its Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this  _Section 7.02_. The provisions of this
_Section 7.02_ shall survive the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and are expressly intended to benefit each of
the DandO Indemnified Persons.

Laws relating to the exchange of information, the Company shall have the right
to review in advance, and to the extent practicable shall have the right to

avoid the institution of any such action or proceeding and to contest and
resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any temporary, preliminary or permanent decree, judgment,
injunction or other order that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents,
delays or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither Parent,
Buyer nor any of their Affiliates shall be required to bring any proceeding
against any Person or accept, as a condition to obtaining any required
approval or resolving any objection of any Governmental Body, any requirement
to divest or hold separate or in trust (or the imposition of any other
material condition or restriction with respect to) any of the respective
businesses or assets of Parent, Buyer, any Affiliate of Parent, Buyer the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

 

7.04 _Conditions_. Buyer and Parent shall use all commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the conditions set forth in  _Section 2.02_ hereof to be
satisfied and to consummate the transactions contemplated herein as soon as

and their respective representatives shall contact and communicate with the

Seller (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



-32-  7.06 _WARN Act_. Buyer will indemnify the Seller Indemnitees (as defined
below) from and against any Losses (as defined below) that may be incurred by
them (a) under the WARN Act (or any similar state or local Law with respect to
plant closing, layoff or relocation) arising at or after the Closing as a
result of any action or omission of the Company or its Subsidiary occurring
following the Closing or (b) with respect to any obligation to provide notice,
payment or any other benefit as a result of or arising out of any termination
of employment of any employee of the Company or its Subsidiary following the
Closing.

7.07 _Escrow Shares_.

 

(a) With a view to making available to Seller the benefits of Rule 144 as it
relates to the Escrow Shares, Parent shall: (i) file all required reports
under section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as applicable; (ii) submit
electronically and post on its corporate website, if any, every interactive
data file required to be submitted and posted pursuant to Rule 405
of Regulation S-T; (iii) upon Sellers request, furnish to Seller a written
statement that it has complied with the reporting, submission and posting
requirements of Rule 144; and (iv) provide Seller at Parents expense such
other documentation (including an opinion of company counsel) reasonably
required in order to remove the restrictive legend set forth in _Section
3.05(f)_.

(b) To the extent it is necessary for Seller or any of its Affiliates to enter
into any agreements or other arrangements with brokers, purchasers of the
Escrow Shares or other third parties in connection with the marketing or sale
of such Escrow Shares, Parent shall indemnify and hold Seller and its
Affiliates harmless from any Losses incurred by Seller or its Affiliates
pursuant to the terms and conditions of such agreements or arrangements.

cure hereunder unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Seller); or

(d) (i) by Seller or Buyer, upon written notice to the other, if the
transactions contemplated hereby have not been consummated on or prior to
April 15, 2012; _provided_ that, if, as of such date, all of the conditions

"), it being understood that so long as such claim for indemnification arises
and such written notice is given on or prior to the Survival Date, such

specific claim for indemnification until such claim is resolved.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing _Section 9.01(a)_, there shall be no time
limitation with respect to any claim arising out of any breach of any of the
Fundamental Representations.

9.02 _Indemnification of Buyer_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing, subject to the provisions of this _ARTICLE 9_
, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Company), and their respective officers,
directors, employees and agents (the " _Buyer Indemnitees_ "), from and
against and all liabilities, obligations, deficiencies, demands,
claims, suits, actions, causes of action, assessments, fines, forfeitures,
civil penalties, losses, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees) (hereinafter individually a " _Loss_ " and collectively " _Losses_ ")
suffered or incurred by the Buyer Indemnitees to the extent such Losses result
from or arise out of: (i) any breach of any representation or warranty of
Seller or the Company contained in _ARTICLE 3_ or  _ARTICLE 4_ of this
Agreement, or any certificate delivered in connection herewith (with Losses
resulting from or arising out of such breach (other than in the first sentence
of each of _Section 4.07_ and _4.20_ and in the defined term "Material
Contract") being calculated for purposes of this _ARTICLE 9_ without regard to
any qualification of "material," "materiality," "Material Adverse Change" or
"Material Adverse Effect" qualification contained in such representations and
warranties); (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement by Seller or (prior
to Closing) by the Company; (iii) any and all Pre-Closing Taxes; or (iv) any
Indebtedness or any Company Transaction Expenses that are not taken into
account in the calculation of the Closing Consideration.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,

a Loss pursuant to this Agreement, the Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled
to indemnification for such Loss pursuant to _Section 9.02(a)(i)_ (other
than in respect of Fundamental Representations, for which the Deductible shall
not apply), _Section 9.02(a)(ii)_ (other than the covenants under _Sections
1.02(e)_  (Post-Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment), _9.04(d)_ (Escrow
Shares Purchase Price Adjustments) and the last sentence of _Section 9.11(f)_
(Refunds), to which the Deductible shall not apply) or _Section 9.02(a)(iii)_
of this Agreement, until the aggregate amount of all Losses eligible for
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement exceeds on a cumulative basis an
amount equal to Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000) (the "
_Deductible_ "), and then only to the extent Losses suffered by Buyer
Indemnities exceed the Deductible. All payments under this _Section 9.02_
shall be treated by the parties as an adjustment to the proceeds received by
Seller pursuant to _ARTICLE 1_. 

 



-35-  (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
any indemnification of the Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to _Section 9.02(a)_
(other than in respect of Fundamental Representations and other than the
covenants under _Sections 1.02(e)_ (Post-Closing Net Working Capital
Adjustment),  _9.04(d)_ (Escrow Shares Purchase Price Adjustments) and the
last sentence of _Section 9.11(f)_ (Refunds)) (collectively, the " _Limited
Claims_ ") shall be effected solely by a payment made from the Escrow Funds,
in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, and such payments shall
not exceed the Escrow Funds available on any given payment date. If and to the
extent that the Escrow Funds are insufficient to cover the Limited Claims, the
Buyer Indemnitees right to indemnification for the uncovered portion is
extinguished. Any indemnification of the Buyer Indemnitees in respect of
Fundamental Representations shall not exceed that portion of the Purchase
Price actually received by Seller, and shall be payable first from Escrow
Funds, to the extent that there are any remaining Escrow Funds available for
indemnification, but not limited thereby. Any payment required to be made by
Seller to Buyer under _Sections 1.02(e)_  (Post-Closing Net Working Capital
Adjustment), _9.04(d)_ (Escrow Shares Purchase Price Adjustments) or the last
sentence of _Section 9.11(f)_ (Refunds) shall not be required to come from
the Escrow Funds but shall be the direct financial obligation of Seller.

(d) No Buyer Indemnitees shall have any right to indemnification hereunder
with respect to Losses for the conduct of any environmental corrective or
remedial action except as: (i) required by applicable Environmental Laws; (ii)
reasonably necessary to resolve an unsolicited third-party notice or claim
asserting liability or potential liability arising out of an environmental
condition in connection with acts, events or circumstances existing or
occurring prior to the Closing; or (iii) necessary to address conditions of
contamination which exceed standards applicable under Environmental Laws and
then only to the extent of such remedial action reasonably necessary to attain
compliance in a cost-effective manner with Environmental Laws; resolve such
claim in a cost-effective manner or address such conditions in a cost-effect
manner, in each case assuming continued use or expansion of such use of a
subject property in a commercial or industrial capacity. Where permitted by
Environmental Laws, Buyer shall employ risk-based standards and institutional
controls in connection with any corrective or remedial action. Seller shall
have no obligation to indemnify any of the Buyer Indemnitees or the Company
with respect to any environmental corrective or remedial action arising
from (A) any conditions of contamination identified through any environmental
sampling or analysis, or (B) any report to any Governmental Body, in either
case which is not: (i) affirmatively required by Environmental Laws; (ii)
required in connection with due diligence requirements of any Person providing
the Buyer with financing for the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or any refinancing thereof and taking a security interest in
any applicable site (after diligent efforts by Buyer to obtain a waiver of
any such requirement); (iii) precipitated by Buyers reasonable determination
as communicated to Seller in writing that an environmental condition exists or
likely exists which would present a risk of material harm to human health,
violate applicable Environmental Laws or require remediation under any
applicable Environmental Laws; (iv) required in connection with any lease
arrangement affecting any applicable property; or (v) reasonably necessary in
response to an unsolicited third-party claim.

members, its and their Affiliates, and its and their officers, directors,
employees and agents (the " _Seller Indemnitees_ ") against and hold them
harmless from any Losses suffered or incurred by the Seller Indemnitees to
the extent such Losses arise from or relating to: (i) a breach of any
representation or warranty of Buyer or Parent contained in this Agreement, or
any certificate delivered in connection herewith; (ii) a breach of any
covenant or agreement by Buyer or Parent contained in this Agreement requiring
performance by Buyer or Parent prior to the Closing or by Buyer, Parent or the
Company and its Subsidiary after the Closing; or (iii) the operation of the
business of the Company or its Subsidiary following the Closing or actions
taken by Buyer or the Company or its Subsidiary at (after the Company is owned
by Buyer) or after the Closing. All payments under this  _Section 9.03_
shall be treated by the parties as an adjustment to the proceeds received by
Seller pursuant to _ARTICLE 1_.

9.04 _Escrow_.

(a) On the Closing Date, the Escrow Amount in the form of the Escrow Shares
shall be delivered to the Escrow Agent to be held pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement to satisfy claims related to Losses suffered by Buyer Indemnities.
After the Survival Date, other than to the extent that there are pending
claims for any Losses suffered by Buyer Indemnities, the Escrow Amount then
remaining in the Escrow Account shall be released from the Escrow Account (if
there are pending claims for Losses suffered by Buyer Indemnities then only
such portion of the Escrow Amount in excess of such pending claims for Losses
shall be released from the Escrow Account).

(b) To the extent the Escrow Funds are held in Parent Common Stock at the
time any payment is due for Losses suffered by Buyer Indemnities, the amount
of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to release from the Escrow Fund to
cover any Losses suffered by Buyer Indemnities shall be satisfied by
releasing a number of Escrow Shares to Buyer determined by dividing the amount
of such Losses by the Closing Date Closing Price.

(c) In accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, at such time as
Seller has satisfied the six (6)-month holding period requirement of Rule 144
with respect to the Escrow Shares: subject to the obligations of Seller set
forth in this _Section 9.04(c)_, the Escrow Shares shall be transferable by
Seller pursuant to Rule 144, _provided_ that (i) to the extent such Escrow
Shares are held in the Escrow Account and still subject to being used to
satisfy indemnification claims of the Buyer Indemnitees in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement, Seller shall not sell any Escrow Shares (x) without the
consent of the Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, or
(y) if the Parent Common Stock Sale Price to be received for such Escrow
Shares in connection with such sale is less than the Closing Date Stock Price;
(ii) Seller shall use its best efforts to arrange for such Escrow Shares to
be sold through a registered broker-dealer reasonably acceptable to Parent,
and Parent shall use its best efforts to assist and support Seller in
connection with such sales (including without limitation providing to Seller
all reasonably requested documentation and opinions with respect to such open
market transactions); and (iii) the Escrow Shares shall not be released from
the Escrow Account in connection with such transactions unless (x) all net
proceeds received in respect of such Escrow Shares equal to the Closing Date
Stock Price are concurrently deposited with the Escrow Agent into the Escrow
Account, and (y) net proceeds in excess of the Closing Date Stock Price (if
any) received in respect of such Escrow Shares is promptly delivered to
Buyer.

 



-37-  (d) _Escrow Shares Purchase Price Adjustments_.

 

(i) With respect to any Escrow Shares sold after such Escrow Shares are no
longer held in the Escrow Account to satisfy indemnification claims of the
Buyer Indemnitees in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, in the event that
the Parent Common Stock Sale Price for such shares is less than the Closing
Date Stock Price, then Parent agrees to pay Seller within five (5) Business
Days after Seller provides Parent with evidence of the completion of such
sales, as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, an amount in cash equal to the
product of (x) the Closing Price Spread _multiplied by_ (y) the number of
Escrow Shares sold by Seller. With respect to any Escrow Shares sold after
such Escrow Shares are no longer held in the Escrow Account, in the event that
the Parent Common Stock Sale Price for such shares is greater than the Closing
Date Stock Price, Seller agrees to pay Buyer within five (5) Business Days
after the completion of such sales, as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, an
amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the Closing Price Spread
_multiplied by_  (B) the number of Escrow Shares sold by Seller.

(ii) If Parent shall fail to pay any amount payable to Seller under Section
9.04(d)(i), then, in addition to any other rights and remedies Seller may have
at law or in equity, such amount shall thereafter, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, bear interest, compounding daily, at an interest
rate of 10.00% per annum.

(iii) In the event that Parent breaches  _Section 9.04(d)(i)_, then, in
addition to any other rights or remedies Seller may have at law or in equity,
Parent shall pay, and hereby indemnifies and holds Seller harmless from, all
Losses, costs and attorneys fees and expenses incurred by Seller or its
Affiliates in connection with the collection or enforcement of _Section
9.04(d)(i)_.

9.05  _Procedures Relating to Indemnification_.

(a) In order for a party to be entitled to seek any indemnification
provided for under this Agreement (such party, the " _Claiming Party_ "), in
respect of a claim or demand made against the Claiming Party by any Person who
is not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate thereof (a " _Third-
Party Claim_ "), such Claiming Party must notify the party to this Agreement
that is or may be required to provide indemnification hereunder with respect
to such Third-Party Claim (the " _Defending Party_ ") in writing, and
in reasonable detail, of the Third-Party Claim as promptly as reasonably
possible but in any event within fifteen (15) days after receipt by such
Claiming Party of notice of the Third-Party Claim (or within such shorter time
as may be necessary to give the Defending Party a reasonable opportunity to
respond to and defend such Third-Party Claim); _provided_ that any delay or
failure in giving such notification shall not affect the indemnification
provided hereunder except to the extent the Defending Party shall have been
prejudiced as a result of such failure. Thereafter, the Claiming Party shall
deliver to the Defending Party, within five (5) business days after the
Claiming Partys receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the Claiming Party relating to the Third-
Party Claim.

 



-38-  (b) The Defending Party shall have the right upon written notice to the
Claiming Party within thirty (30) days after receipt from the Claiming Party
of notice of such claim, to conduct at the sole cost and expense of the
Defending Party the defense against such claim; _provided_ that before the
Defending Party assumes control of such defense it must first agree and
acknowledge in such notice that the Defending Party is fully responsible
(subject to the limitations of _Section 9.02_) for all Losses relating to
such Third-Party Claim (a " _Control Notice_ "); _provided_ _further_ that
the Defending Party shall not have the right to assume control of such defense
if the Third-Party Claim; (i) seeks non-monetary relief (except where non-
monetary relief is merely incidental to a primary claim or claims for
monetary damages); (ii) involves criminal allegations; (iii) is one in which
the Defending Party is also a party and joint representation would, as
determined in each case by the Claiming Party based on advice of outside
counsel, be inappropriate or there may be legal defenses available to the
Claiming Party which are different from or additional to those available to
the Defending Party; (iv) involves a claim which, upon petition by
the Claiming Party, the appropriate court rules that the Defending Party
failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend; or (v) is with respect
to Taxes (which shall be governed by _Section 9.11(e)_). In the event that
the Defending Party validly delivers a Control Notice, the Claiming Party
will reasonably cooperate, at the sole cost and expenses of the Defending
Party, with and make reasonably available to the Defending Party such
assistance and materials as may be reasonably requested by it, and the
Claiming Party shall have the right at its expense to participate in the
defense assisted by counsel of its own choosing. Whether or not the Defending
Party shall have assumed the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Claiming
Party shall not admit any liability with respect to, and shall not have the
right to compromise, settle, discharge or consent to entry of judgment with
respect to, such Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of
the Defending Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Without the prior written consent of the Claiming
Party, the Defending Party will not enter into any settlement of any Third-
Party Claim or consent to entry of judgment with respect to such claim, if
pursuant to or as a result of such settlement or consent, (x) injunctive or
other equitable relief would be imposed against the Claiming Party, or (y)
such settlement or consent would lead to liability or create any financial
obligation on the part of the Claiming Party for which the Claiming Party is
not entitled to indemnification hereunder (other than to the extent of the
Deductible). If an offer is made to settle a Third-Party Claim, which offer
the Defending Party is permitted to settle under this _Section 9.05(b)_ only
upon the prior written consent of the Claiming Party, and the Defending Party
desires to accept and agree to such offer, the Defending Party will
give prompt written notice to the Claiming Party to that effect. If the
Claiming Party does not consent to such firm offer within twenty (20) calendar
days after its receipt of such notice, the Claiming Party may continue to
contest or defend such Third-Party Claim and, in such event, the maximum
liability of the Defending Party as to such Third-Party Claim will not exceed
the amount of such settlement offer, plus costs and expenses paid or incurred
by the Claiming Party through the date such settlement offer is given to the
Claiming Party to the extent such amount is otherwise indemnifiable hereunder.

9.06  _Mitigation_. The Indemnified Parties shall take all actions required
by applicable Law to mitigate their Losses which are Indemnifiable hereunder.
In the event that a Defending Party makes any payment to a Claiming Party for
indemnification for which the Claiming Party could have collected on a claim
against a third party (including under any contract and any insurance claims),
the Defending Party shall be entitled to pursue claims and conduct litigation
on behalf of the Claiming Party and any of its successors to pursue and
collect

 



-39-   on any indemnification or other remedy available to the Claiming Party
thereunder with respect to such claim and generally to be subrogated to the
rights of the Claiming Party. Except pursuant to a settlement agreed to by
the Defending Party (which agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), the Claiming Party shall not voluntarily waive or release any
contractual right to recover from a third party any loss subject
to indemnification hereby without the prior written consent of the Defending
Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The
Claiming Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Company
and its Subsidiary, if applicable) to, cooperate with the Defending Party, at
the Defending Partys expense, with respect to any such effort to pursue and
collect with respect thereto.

9.07 _Determination of Loss Amount_.

(a) Losses for breaches of representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement shall be net of any insurance proceeds or third-party payments
actually received by and paid to the Claiming Party in each case net of costs
and expenses incurred in procuring such recovery and any retro premium
adjustments, increases in premium, deductibles or other costs directly related
thereto. In the event that any such insurance or other recovery is actually
received by any Claiming Party with respect to any Loss for which any such
Claiming Party has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the
aggregate net amount of such recovery or the indemnification payment,
whichever is less, shall be made promptly to the Defending Party.

 

(b) Absent actual fraud, in no event shall any Party be entitled to recover or
make a claim for any amounts in respect of consequential, incidental or
indirect damages or punitive damages, except to the extent such damages are
awarded against the indemnified party in a Third-Party Claim, and, in
particular, no "multiple of profits" or "multiple of cash flow" or other
valuation methodology shall be used in calculating the amount of any Losses.
In addition, in no event shall a Defending Party be liable hereunder in
respect of any claim if such claim would not have arisen but for a change in
legislation or accounting policies or a change in interpretation of
applicable Law as determined by a court or pursuant to an administration rule-
making decision. Furthermore, the Buyer Indemnitees shall have no right to
make a claim for any Loss to the extent it is primarily a possible or
potential Loss that the Buyer Indemnitees believes may be asserted rather than
a Loss that has, in fact, been paid or incurred by or asserted against the
Buyer Indemnitees.

 

(c) No Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to any indemnification under this
_ARTICLE 9_ to the extent: (i) such matter was specifically taken into
account in determining the Closing Consideration or the Net Working Capital
pursuant to _Section 1.02_, (ii) that there is included in the Closing
Statement a specific liability relating to such matter, (iii) such matter
would not have arisen but for any act, omission, transaction or election on
the part of or carried out by any Buyer Indemnitee or its Affiliates or (iv)
to the extent that Buyer is determined to not be entitled to indemnification
based on a breach of _Section 5.12_. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
indemnification for breach of any representation or warranty contained in 
_Section 4.09_ (Tax Matters) shall be limited to Losses incurred with respect
to Pre-Closing Periods and any portion of the Straddle Periods ending on the
Closing Date (determined in accordance with _Section 9.11(d)_). 

 



-40-  9.08 _Tax Benefits_.

 

(a) To the extent that a Claiming Party actually received Tax Benefits as a
result of any Loss for which an indemnification payment has been made, such
party shall pay the amount of such Tax Benefits (but not in excess of the
indemnification payment or payments actually received from the Defending Party
with respect to such Loss) to the Defending Party as such Tax Benefits
are actually received by the Claiming Party. For purposes of the foregoing, "
_Tax Benefit_ " means any refund of Taxes paid or any reduction in the amount
of Taxes which otherwise would have been paid, calculated on a with and
without basis. Where a party has other items of loss, deduction or credit
available to it, the item of Tax Benefit attributable to the loss underlying
the indemnity claim shall be deemed to be used by such party proportionately
with such other items in determining when the Tax Benefit attributable to the
loss underlying the indemnity claim is realized by such party. A Tax Benefit
shall be actually received upon the receipt of a refund of Taxes paid or the
filing of a Tax Return, including an estimated Tax Return, showing a Tax
Benefit (or, if later, the date when such a Tax Return should have been timely
filed, including properly obtained extensions).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Tax Benefit
shall be required to be paid by an indemnified party to an indemnitor pursuant
to this _Section 9.08(b)_ to the extent such Tax Benefit has not been
actually realized prior to the fifth taxable year following the taxable year
that the deduction or loss relating to the Loss that gave rise to
indemnification hereunder was generated.

 

9.09 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 9.09_
the provisions of this _ARTICLE 9_  constitute the sole and exclusive
remedies for recovery of Losses or other claims relating to or arising from
this Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and
Buyer and Parent waive and release Seller from any and all other remedies,
including without limitation any arising under CERCLA or any other
Environmental Laws or otherwise relating to environmental, health or safety
matters. The provisions of this _Section 9.09_ shall not, however, prevent or
limit a cause of action hereunder with respect to (i) actual fraud; (ii)
disputes under _Section 1.02(e)_ (Post-Closing Net Working Capital
Adjustment) (which disputes under _Section 1.02(e)_ will be resolved in
accordance with the dispute resolution mechanisms set forth therein); (iii)
amounts payable by Parent to Seller, or Seller to Parent, as applicable,
pursuant to _Section 1.02(e)_ (Post-Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment)
or  _Section 9.04(d) _(Escrow Shares Purchase Price Adjustments) (which
Seller or Parent shall enforce pursuant to _Section 1.02(e)_ or _Section
9.04(d)_, as applicable); (iv) amounts payable from Seller to Parent pursuant
to the last sentence of Section 9.11(f) (Refunds); or (v) to obtain an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement, to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof or to obtain other equitable
remedies with respect hereto.

9.10 _Acknowledgement by Buyer_.

 

(a) Each of Buyer and Parent acknowledges that it has conducted, to its
satisfaction, an independent investigation and verification of the financial
condition, results of operations, assets, liabilities, properties and
projected operations of the Company and its Subsidiary and, in making its
determination to proceed with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
each of Buyer and Parent has relied on the results of its own independent

 



-41-   investigation and verification, in addition to the representations and
warranties of the Company and Seller expressly and specifically set forth in
this Agreement. SUCH REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES BY THE COMPANY AND SELLER
CONSTITUTE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE
COMPANY AND SELLER TO BUYER AND PARENT IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, AND EACH OF BUYER AND PARENT UNDERSTANDS, ACKNOWLEDGES
AND AGREES THAT ALL OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED (INCLUDING ANY RELATING TO THE FUTURE OR HISTORICAL
FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, ASSETS OR LIABILITIES OF THE
COMPANY OR TO ANY ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH OR SAFETY MATTERS) ARE SPECIFICALLY
DISCLAIMED BY THE COMPANY AND SELLER AND ARE NOT BEING RELIED UPON BY EITHER
BUYER OR PARENT OR ANY OF THEIR REPRESENTATIVES OR AFFILIATES.

 

(b) No Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to any indemnification pursuant to
this _ARTICLE 9_ for any Loss or other amount that the Buyer Indemnitees may
suffer, and the Buyer Indemnitees shall have no remedies under this _ARTICLE
9_ with respect to (i) the subject matter of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) any other matter relating to the
Company or its Subsidiary prior to the Closing, the operation of their
respective businesses prior to the Closing, or any other transaction or state
of facts involving the Company or its Subsidiary prior to the Closing
(including any common law or statutory rights or remedies for environmental,
health or safety matters, including under CERCLA), other than remedies payable
from the Escrow Funds pursuant to _Section 9.02_, which are the Buyer
Indemnitees sole and exclusive remedies with respect thereto. The Buyer
Indemnitees may not avoid such limitation on liability by seeking damages for
breach of contract or tort or pursuant to any other theory of liability, all
of which are hereby waived. EACH OF BUYER AND PARENT, ON BEHALF OF THE BUYER
INDEMNITEES, EXPRESSLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS AFFORDED BY ANY STATUTE WHICH LIMITS
THE EFFECT OF A RELEASE WITH RESPECT TO UNKNOWN CLAIMS. EACH OF BUYER AND
PARENT, ON BEHALF OF THE BUYER INDEMNITEES, ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT UNDERSTANDS
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS RELEASE OF UNKNOWN CLAIMS AND WAIVER OF STATUTORY
PROTECTION AGAINST A RELEASE OF UNKNOWN CLAIMS. EACH OF BUYER AND PARENT, ON
BEHALF OF THE BUYER INDEMNITEES, ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS WAIVER IS
AN ESSENTIAL AND MATERIAL TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT.

9.11 _Tax Matters_. The provisions of this _Section 9.11_ shall govern the
allocation of responsibility as between Buyer and the Company on the one hand,
and Seller on the other hand, for certain Tax matters following the Closing:

(a) _Cooperation_. Seller, Buyer and the Company shall cooperate, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors and
representatives to cooperate, as and to the extent reasonably requested by
the other Parties, in preparing and filing Tax Returns, and any audit,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon another Partys request) the provision of
records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or
audit or litigation and making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional 

 



-42-   information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Buyer shall,
and shall cause the Company and each of its Subsidiary to, retain and maintain
such records and information until the later of (i) six (6) years following
the Closing Date; and (ii) the applicable statute of limitations with respect
to the Tax for which such records or information relate, and allow Seller (and
its agents and representatives of Seller) to inspect, review and make copies
of such records and information as the Stockholders or its agents and
representatives of Seller reasonably request from time to time during normal
business hours and after appropriate prior notification. Buyer. Seller and
the Company further agree, upon request, to use reasonable efforts to obtain
any certificate or other document from any Governmental Body or any other
Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that
could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect to the
transaction contemplated hereby).

(b) _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns of the Company and Its
Subsidiary_.

(i) Buyer shall, at Buyers cost and expense, prepare, or cause to be
prepared all Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns required to be filed by or on
behalf of each of the Company and its Subsidiary which have not yet been filed
as of the Closing Date. Buyer shall also prepare or cause to be prepared, at
Buyers cost and expense, all Straddle Period Tax Returns required to be filed
by or on behalf of each of the Company and its Subsidiary. All such Pre-
Closing Period Tax Returns and Straddle Period Tax Returns shall be prepared
and filed in a manner that is consistent with the prior practice of the
Company or its Subsidiary (as the case may be), except as required by
applicable Law; _provided_ that, (i) for the avoidance of doubt and to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, all deductions related to or arising out
of the Tax Benefit Amount shall be treated as arising on or before the Closing
Date, and (ii) neither the Company nor its Subsidiary shall waive any
carryback of any net operating loss, capital loss or credit on any such Pre-
Closing Period Tax Return or Straddle Period Tax Return. Buyer shall deliver
or cause to be delivered drafts of all such Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns
(and all relevant work papers and other items required to understand such Tax
Return or other items as reasonably requested by Seller) to Seller for its
review within sixty (60) days after final determination of Net Working Capital
pursuant to _Section 1.02(e)_ and Buyer shall deliver or cause to be
delivered drafts of all such Straddle Period Tax Returns (and all relevant
work papers and other items required to understand such Tax Return or other
items as reasonably requested by Seller) to Seller for its review within
sixty (60) days of the end of such Straddle Period; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such drafts of any such Tax Return shall be subject to Sellers review,
comment and approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed.

(ii) If Seller disputes any item on such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return or
Straddle Period Tax Return, it shall notify Buyer (by written notice within
thirty (30) days of receipt of such draft of such Tax Return) of such disputed
item (or items) and the basis for its objection. If Seller does not object by
written notice within such period, the amount of Taxes shown to be due and
payable on such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return or Straddle Period Tax Return,
as the case may be, shall be deemed to be accepted and agreed upon, and final
and conclusive, for purposes of this  _Section 9.11(b)_ only. Buyer and
Seller shall act in good faith to resolve any dispute with thirty (30) days of
Sellers notification of such disputed item (or items). If Buyer and Seller
cannot resolve any 

 



-43-   disputed item, the item in question shall be resolved by the Firm as
promptly as practicable (in accordance with the provisions of this _Section
9.11(b)_), whose determination shall be final and conclusive for purposes of
this _Section 9.11(b)_ only. Without limitation, each Party may submit data
and information to the Firm as such Party deems appropriate. The Firm shall be
instructed to use every reasonable effort to complete its services within
fifteen (15) calendar days after submission of the dispute to it, in any case,
as soon as practicable after such submission. The fees and expenses of the
Firm shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by Buyer and fifty percent (50%) by
Seller. Buyer, Seller and the Company agree to file all such Pre-Closing
Period Tax Returns for income Taxes within 150 days of the Closing Date and
Straddle Period Tax Returns for income Taxes within 150 days of the end of
such Straddle Period.

(c) _Transfer Taxes_. Buyer shall pay all transfer, real property transfer,
documentary, sales, use, stamp, duty, recording and similar Taxes (including
any penalties, interest and additions to Tax) incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (together, " _Transfer
Taxes_ "). Buyer shall be responsible for preparing and filing all Tax
Returns or other applicable documents in connection with all Transfer Taxes,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, _provided_ , _however_ , that
Seller shall cooperate with Buyer in the preparation and filing of all Tax
Returns or other applicable documents for or with respect to Transfer Taxes,
including timely signing and delivering such Tax Returns, documents, and
certificates as may be necessary or appropriate to file such Tax Returns or
establish an exemption from (or otherwise reduce) Transfer Taxes.

(d) _Computation of Liabilities_. To the extent permitted or required, the
taxable year of each of the Company and its Subsidiary that includes the
Closing Date shall close as of the end of the Closing Date. Whenever it is
necessary to determine the liability for Taxes for a Straddle Period, the
amount of any Taxes based on or measured by income or receipts of each of the
Company and its Subsidiary for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on
the Closing Date shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books
as of the close of business on the Closing Date and the amount of other Taxes
of each of the Company and its Subsidiary for the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax
for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period.

 

(e) _Tax Contests_.

(i) Buyer shall deliver a written notice to Seller in writing promptly
following any demand, claim, or notice of commencement of a claim, proposed
adjustment, assessment, audit, examination or other administrative or court
Proceeding with respect to Taxes of any of the Company or its Subsidiary for
which Seller may be liable (" _Tax Contest_ ") and shall describe in
reasonable detail (to the extent known by Buyer) the facts constituting the
basis for such Tax Contest, the nature of the relief sought, and the amount of
the claimed Losses (including Taxes), if any (the " _Tax Claim Notice_ "),
_provided_ , _however_ , that the failure or delay to so notify Seller shall
not relieve Seller of any obligation or liability that Seller may have to
Buyer except to the extent that Seller demonstrates that Seller is materially
or adversely prejudiced thereby.

 



-44-  (ii) With respect to Tax Contests for Taxes of each of the Company and
its Subsidiary for a Pre-Closing Period for which Seller would have liability
for any indemnification payments under this Agreement, Seller may elect to
assume and control the defense of such Tax Contest by written notice to Buyer
within thirty (30) days after delivery by Buyer to Seller of the Tax Claim
Notice. If Seller elects to assume and control the defense of such Tax
Contest, Seller (A) shall bear its own costs and expenses, (B) shall be
entitled to engage its own counsel and (C) may (1) pursue or forego any and
all administrative appeals, Proceedings, hearings and conferences with any
Taxing Authority, (2) either pay the Tax claimed or sue for refund where
applicable Law permits such refund suit, or (3) contest, settle or compromise
the Tax Contest in any permissible manner, _provided_ , _however_ , that
Seller shall not settle or compromise (or take other actions described herein
with respect to) any Tax Contest without the prior written consent of Buyer
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) if such
settlement or compromise would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
Tax liability of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including any of the Company
or its Subsidiary) for any Tax period ending after the Closing Date. If Seller
elects to assume the defense of any Tax Contest, Seller shall (x) keep Buyer
reasonably informed of all material developments and events relating to such
Tax Contest (including promptly forwarding copies to Buyer of any related
correspondence, and shall provide Buyer with an opportunity to review and
comment on any material correspondence before Seller sends
such correspondence to any Taxing Authority), (y) consult with Buyer in
connection with the defense or prosecution of any such Tax Contest and (z)
provide such cooperation and information as Buyer shall reasonably request,
and Buyer shall have the right to participate, at its own expense, in (but
not control) the defense of such Tax Contest (including participating in any
discussions with the applicable Taxing Authorities regarding such Tax
Contests).

 

(iii) In connection with any Tax Contest that relates to Taxes of each of the
Company and its Subsidiary for a Pre-Closing Period that Seller does not
elect to control pursuant to _Section 9.11(e)(ii)_, such Tax Contest shall be
controlled by Buyer (and Seller shall reimburse Buyer for all reasonable costs
and expenses incurred by Buyer relating to a Tax Contest described in this
_Section 9.11(e)(iii)_), and Seller agrees to cooperate with Buyer in
pursuing such Tax Contest. In connection with any Tax Contest that is
described in this _Section 9.11(e)(iii)_ and controlled by Buyer, Buyer
shall (x) keep Seller informed of all material developments and events
relating to such Tax Contest (including promptly forwarding copies to Seller
of any related correspondence and shall provide Seller with an opportunity
to review and comment on any material correspondence before Buyer sends such
correspondence to any Taxing Authority), (y) consult with Seller in connection
with the defense or prosecution of any such Tax Contest and (z) provide
such cooperation and information as Seller shall reasonably request, and, at
its own costs and expenses, Seller shall have the right to participate, at its
own expense, in (but not control) the defense of such Tax Contest (including
participating in any discussions with the applicable Taxing Authorities
regarding such Tax Contests). Buyer may not settle or compromise any Tax
Contest of a Pre-Closing Period without the prior written consent of Seller
(which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) if Seller would be
liable for any indemnification payments under this Agreement.

 



-45-  (iv) In connection with any Tax Contest for Taxes of each of the Company
and its Subsidiary for any Straddle Period, such Tax Contest shall be
controlled by Buyer; _provided_ that, and only to the extent that Seller would
have liability for any indemnification payments under this Agreement, Buyer
shall not settle or compromise (or take such other actions described herein
with respect to) any Tax Contest without the prior written consent of Seller,
such consent not to be unreasonable withheld, conditioned or delayed. Buyer
shall (x) keep Seller informed of all material developments and events
relating to such Tax Contest (including promptly forwarding copies to Seller
of any related correspondence and shall provide Seller with an opportunity to
review and comment on any material correspondence before Buyer sends such
correspondence to any Taxing Authority), (y) consult with Seller in connection
with the defense or prosecution of any such Tax Contest and (z) provide such
cooperation and information as Seller shall reasonably request, and, at its
own costs and expenses, Seller shall have the right to participate in (but not
control) the defense of such Tax Contest (including participating in any
discussions with the applicable Taxing Authorities regarding such Tax
Contests). 

(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
procedures for all Tax Contests shall be governed exclusively by this
_Section 9.11(e)_.

(vi) Notwithstanding anything else set forth herein to the contrary, Seller,
at Sellers expense, shall have the right to require Buyer to contest any
asserted Straddle Period Tax deficiencies for which Seller would have
liability for indemnification payments under this Agreement. 

(f) _Refunds_. Buyer may (except as provided in _Section 9.11(b)_), at its
option, cause any of the Company or its Subsidiary to elect, where permitted
by applicable Law, to carry forward or carry back any Tax attribute carryover
that would, absent such election, be carried back to a Pre-Closing Period or

11.04 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, except that neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be
assigned or delegated by any party hereto without the prior written consent of
the other parties hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Buyer may assign
this Agreement to any Subsidiary of Buyer or of Parent, or to any lender to
Buyer or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof as security for obligations to
such lender in respect of any financing arrangements entered into in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and any refinancings,
extensions, refundings or renewals thereof, _provided_ that no assignment to
any 

 



-61-   such Subsidiary or lender shall in any way affect Buyers obligations or
liabilities under this Agreement, and (ii) after the Closing, with Buyers
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), Seller may assign this
Agreement to any of its beneficial owners or successors by operation of law so
long as such beneficial owners or successors agree to honor Sellers
obligations under this Agreement (in the case of beneficial owners, on a pro
rata basis based upon their respective percentage beneficial ownership in
Seller).

11.05  _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement
shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be
prohibited by or invalid under applicable Law, such provision shall be
ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without
invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of
this Agreement.

 

11.06 _No Strict Construction; Disclosure Schedules_. The language used in
this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties
hereto to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction
shall be applied against any Person. The disclosure schedules attached to this
Agreement have been arranged for purposes of convenience in separately
titled sections corresponding to sections of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that each section of the disclosure schedules shall be deemed to
incorporate by reference information disclosed in any other section of the
disclosure schedules to the extent that the application thereof is reasonably
apparent. Capitalized terms used in the disclosure schedules and not otherwise
defined therein have the meanings given to them in this Agreement. The
specification of any dollar amount or the inclusion of any item in the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or the disclosure
schedules attached hereto is not intended to imply that the amounts, or higher
or lower amounts, or the items so included, or other items, are or are not
required to be disclosed (including, without limitation, whether such amounts
or items are required to be disclosed as material or threatened) or are within
or outside of the ordinary course of business, and no party shall use the fact
of the setting of the amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any item in
this Agreement or the disclosure schedules in any dispute or controversy
between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described
or included in this Agreement or in any disclosure schedule is or is not
required to be disclosed (including, without limitation, whether such amounts
or items are required to be disclosed as material or threatened) or is within
or outside of the ordinary course of business for purposes of this Agreement.
The information contained in this Agreement and in the disclosure schedules
hereto is disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no information
contained herein or therein shall be deemed to be an admission by any party
hereto to any third party of any matter whatsoever (including, without
limitation, any violation of Law or breach of contract).

11.07 _Amendment and Waiver_. Any provision of this Agreement or the
disclosure schedules or Exhibits hereto may be amended only in a writing
signed by Buyer, the Company and Seller. No waiver by any party of any
provision of this Agreement or any default, misrepresentation or breach
hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be valid unless the same shall be
in writing and signed by the party making such waiver, and no such waiver
shall extend to or affect in any way any other provision or prior or
subsequent breach, misrepresentation or default.

 



-62-  11.08 _Complete Agreement_. This Agreement, including the disclosure schedules
and Exhibits hereto, the Escrow Agreement and the other documents referred to
herein (including the Confidentiality Agreement) contain the complete
agreement between the parties hereto and supersede any prior understandings,
agreements or representations by or between the parties, written or oral,
which may have related to the subject matter hereof in any way.

 

11.09 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts
(including by means of telecopied signature pages), any one of which need not
contain the signatures of more than one party, but all such counterparts taken
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

11.10 _Governing Law_. All matters relating to the interpretation,
construction, validity and enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the domestic Laws of the State of Delaware
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

11.11 _Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process_. The parties to this
Agreement submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts located in
Chicago, Illinois or the courts of the United States located in Chicago,
Illinois in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of
this Agreement and any related agreement, certificate or other document
delivered in connection herewith and by this Agreement waive, and agree not to
assert, any defense, in any action for the interpretation or enforcement of
this Agreement and any related agreement, certificate or other
document delivered in connection herewith, that they are not subject thereto
or that such action may not be brought or is not maintainable in such courts
or that this Agreement may not be enforced in or by such courts or that their
property is exempt or immune from execution, that the action is brought in an
inconvenient forum, or that the venue of the action is improper. Service of
process with respect thereto may be made upon any party by mailing a copy
thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to such party at
its address as provided in _Section 11.04_.

11.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereto hereby acknowledges and
agrees that any controversy which may arise under this Agreement is likely to
involve complicated and difficult issues, and therefore each such party hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such party may have to a
trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each party certifies and acknowledges that (i) no representative,
agent or attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise,
that such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce
the foregoing waiver, (ii) such party understands and has considered
the implications of this waiver, (iii) such party makes this waiver
voluntarily, and (iv) such party has been induced to enter into this Agreement
by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this _Section
11.12_. 

 



-63-  11.13 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. No Person other than the parties hereto
shall have any rights, remedies, or benefits under any provision of this
Agreement, other than _Sections 9.02_ and _9.03_ (to the extent provided
therein), except for the directors and officers of the Company and its
Subsidiary solely as expressly provided in _Section 7.02_.

11.14 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that, if any of the
provisions of this Agreement or any other document contemplated by this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were
otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy at law
would exist and damages would be difficult to determine, and, therefore, the
parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof and
thereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or in equity.

 

11.15 _Conflict Between Transaction Documents_. The parties hereto agree and
acknowledge that, to the extent any terms and provisions of this Agreement
are in any way inconsistent with or in conflict with any term, condition or
provision of any other agreement, document or instrument contemplated hereby,
this Agreement shall govern and control.

 

11.16 _Release_. Effective upon the Closing, except with respect to a claim
(i) arising out of this Agreement or the other agreements contemplated
hereby; or (ii) for indemnification under the Companys organizational
documents, so long as such claim for indemnification does not arise out of any
matter indemnified under _ARTICLE 9_ of this Agreement, Seller hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably waives, releases and forever discharges each
of the Company and its Subsidiary and each of their respective past and
present directors, officers, employees, agents, predecessors, successors,
assigns, equityholders, partners, insurers, and Affiliates (other than Seller
and its equityholders) from any and all liabilities of any kind or nature
whatsoever arising prior to the Closing Date, in each case whether absolute or
contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, known or unknown, and Seller shall
not seek to recover any amounts in connection therewith or thereunder from the
Company or its Subsidiary. Such released liabilities shall include, without
limitation, any right to recover against the Company or its Subsidiary for
any indemnification claims made against or paid directly or indirectly by
Seller pursuant to _ARTICLE 9_. Seller understands that this is a full and
final release of all claims, demands, causes of action and liabilities
arising prior to the Closing Date of any nature whatsoever, whether or not
known, suspected or claimed, that could have been asserted in any legal or
equitable proceeding against the Company or its Subsidiary, except as
expressly set forth in this _Section 11.16_. To the extent permitted by Law,
Seller expressly waives all rights afforded by any statute which limits the
effect of a release with respect to unknown claims in connection with the
release expressly granted by this _Section 11.16_. Seller understands the
significance of its release of unknown claims and its waiver of statutory
protection against a release of unknown claims.

 

11.17 _Tax Benefit Amount_. At the Closing, in addition to any amounts payable
pursuant to _Section 1.02_, Buyer shall pay to Seller cash in an amount
equal to the Tax Benefit Amount by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account specified by Seller to Buyer at least two (2) Business
Days prior to Closing. Buyer shall deliver to Seller in reasonable detail its
written calculation of any refund of Taxes paid, or any reduction in the
amount of Taxes which otherwise would have been paid, received by the Company,
Buyer or any Affiliate as a result of the amounts included in the calculation
of Tax Benefit Amount (the " _Final Tax Benefit_

 



-64-    _Amount_ "). If the Tax Benefit Amount is greater than the Final Tax
Benefit Amount by more than ten percent (10%), then the amount of such
difference shall be an adjustment in favor of Buyer, payable by Seller to
Buyer within thirty (30) days of delivery of the written calculation of such
amount to Seller. Alternatively, if the Tax Benefit Amount is less than the
Final Tax Benefit Amount by more than ten percent (10%), then the amount of
such difference shall be an adjustment in favor of Seller, payable by Buyer to
Seller within thirty (30) days of delivery of the written calculation of such
amount to Seller. For purposes of the foregoing, a refund of Taxes paid, or
any reduction in the amount of Taxes which otherwise would have been paid,
shall be received by the Company, Buyer or any Affiliate upon the receipt of a
refund of Taxes paid or the filing of a Tax Return, including an estimated Tax
Return, showing such refund or reduction in Taxes (or the date when such a
Tax Return should have been timely filed, including properly obtained
extensions).

11.18 _Representation of Seller and its Affiliates_. The parties agree that
the fact that Kirkland and Ellis LLP may have represented the Company and its
Affiliates prior to Closing shall not prevent Kirkland and Ellis LLP from
representing such Affiliates, or their respective equityholders, officers, or
managers, in connection with any matters involving, including without
limitation any disputes with, any of the parties to this Agreement after
Closing. The parties agree to take the steps necessary to ensure that any
privilege attaching as a result of legal counsel representing the Company or
its Subsidiary in connection with this transaction will survive Closing, will
be vested solely with Seller and will remain in effect.
