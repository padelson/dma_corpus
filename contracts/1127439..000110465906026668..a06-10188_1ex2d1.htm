A. HSW has formed Parent as its wholly owned subsidiary and shall contribute
to Parent certain assets, properties and rights, including, without

exchange for the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock, upon the terms

C. The Board of Directors of each of Company and HSW deem it fair, advisable
and in the best interests of Company and HSW, respectively, and their
respective stockholders that Company and HSW engage in the Contribution and

D. The respective Boards of Directors of HSW, Parent, Merger Sub and Company,
and Parent, in its capacity as Merger Subs sole stockholder, have approved
this Agreement, the Transaction, the Contribution and the Merger, as
applicable, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.

disabilities and duties of each of Company and Merger Sub shall become the

 **2.4** ** ****Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving**
**Corporation**.

  



  

(a) The Articles of Incorporation of Company as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation, until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by

 **ARTICLE** III 
CONVERSION OF SHARES

  

 ** **

  

 **3.1** ** ****Merger Consideration**. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of any stockholder, officer or
director of Merger Sub, Company or the holders of any of the following
securities:

  



  

(a) Each share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of Company and
each share owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent or of Company immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be canceled without any conversion thereof and no payment or
distribution shall be made with respect thereto;

  



  

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock (other than shares cancelled and
retired in accordance with Section 3.1(a)) issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be converted into the right to receive,
and upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of the underlying share certificates
subject to Article IV hereof, become exchangeable for one share of validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Parent Common Stock (the
"Merger Consideration");

  



  

(c) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of any stockholder, officer or director of
Company or Merger Sub, be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

 **3.2** ** Company Stock Options. **At the Effective Time, all outstanding
options ("Company Options") to purchase shares of Company Common Stock issued
under the Companys 2001 Long Term Incentive Plan (the "Stock Plan") shall be
assumed by Parent. Each Company Option so assumed shall continue to be
subject to the same terms and conditions set forth in the Stock Plan and all
other written collateral agreement(s) between the Company and the optionee
related to the Company Option (including, without limitation, the adjustment

  



        
   

  



  

provisions set forth in Section 3.4 of the Stock Plan as revised to reflect
that, following the Effective Time, Company Options are options to purchase
Parent Common Stock), except that the Company Option shall be exercisable for
that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the number of
shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of the
Company Options immediately prior to the Effective Time (assuming the Company
Option was fully exercisable).

  



  

 **3.3** ** ****No Further Rights** **.** As a result of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holders of any shares of Company Common
Stock (the "Company Stockholders"), at the Effective Time, all shares of
Company Common Stock shall cease to be outstanding and shall be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of
Company Common Stock (a "Company Certificate") shall thereafter cease to have
any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except the
right (subject to Section 3.1(a)) to receive the Merger Consideration as set
forth in Section 3.1.

  



  

 **ARTICLE IV 
 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES**

  

 ** **

  

 **4.1** ** ****Exchange Fund**. Prior to the Effective Time, Company and
Parent shall appoint a mutually acceptable commercial bank or trust company
with assets in excess of $500,000,000 to act as exchange agent hereunder for
the purpose of exchanging Company Certificates for the applicable Merger
Consideration (the "Exchange Agent").  At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, certificates for Parent Common
Stock, representing the Merger Consideration. Any stock
certificates representing Parent Common Stock deposited with the Exchange
Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange Fund."  Except as
contemplated by this Section 4.1, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
other purpose.

  



  

 **4.2** ** ****Exchange Procedures**.  Promptly after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each person who was, at the
Effective Time, a holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock entitled
to receive the Merger Consideration: (a) a letter of transmittal that shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Company Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Company
Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which letter shall be in customary
form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify (such
letter to be reasonably acceptable to Company prior to the Effective Time),
and (b) instructions for effecting the surrender of such Company Certificates
in exchange for the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to such letter
of transmittal.  Upon surrender of a Company Certificate to the Exchange
Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly and validly executed and
completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of
such Company Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
such shares of Parent Common Stock (which, at Parents option, shall be in
uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested or
is otherwise required by applicable law) representing, in the aggregate, the
whole number of shares that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 3.1(b) (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock
then held by such holder), and the Company Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any
amount due. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to

  



        
   

  



  

be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Company
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that the
Company Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be
in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall
pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of
such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Company
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such
tax has been paid or is not payable. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this Section 4.2, each Company Certificate shall be deemed at all times after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
the certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends
or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
4.4.

  



  

 **4.3** ** ****No Further Ownership Rights in Stock**. All shares of Parent
Common Stock issued upon surrender of shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of Article III shall be deemed to have been issued
and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares formerly
represented by such Company Common Stock.

  



  

 **4.4** ** ****Dividends** **.** No dividends, interest or other
distributions with respect to securities of Parent shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Company Certificates until such Company
Certificates are surrendered in accordance with this Article IV.  Upon such
surrender and subject to the effect of escheat, tax or other applicable laws,
there shall be paid, without interest, to the Person in whose name the
securities of Parent have been registered, all dividends, interest and other
distributions payable in respect of such securities on a date subsequent to,
and in respect of a record date after, the Effective Time.

  



  

 **4.5** ** ****Termination of Exchange Fund**. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Certificates for
six months after the Effective Time shall, at Parents request, be delivered
to Parent or otherwise on the written instruction of Parent, and holders of
Company Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article IV
shall after such delivery look only to Parent for the Merger Consideration
with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented
thereby to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 3.1(b). Any
such portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of
Company Common Stock immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to
the extent permitted by law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of
any claims, liens or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

 **4.6** **No Liability**. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, none of Parent, Merger Sub, Company, Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

  



  

 **4.7** ** ****Lost Certificates**. If any Company Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Company Certificate to be so lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond or
other collateral security in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Company Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed

  



        
   

  



  

Company Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby.

  



  

 **4.8** ** ****Stock Transfer Books** **. **The stock transfer book of
Company shall be closed at the Effective Time and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock thereafter on the
records of Company.  On and after the Effective Time, all Company
Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason shall
represent only the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration with
respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby
and unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock
deliverable in respect thereof, pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

 **4.9** ** ****Withholding Rights** **.** Each of the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common
Stock and to HSW such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of Company Common Stock or to HSW in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as
the case may be.

  



  

 **4.10** ** Affiliates.** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
no Merger Consideration shall be delivered to a person who may be deemed an
"affiliate" of Company in accordance with Section 7.6 hereof for purposes of
Rule 145 under the Securities Act until such person has executed and
delivered to Parent an executed copy of the affiliate letter contemplated in
Section 7.6 hereof.

  



  

 **ARTICLE V 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY**

  



  

Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule that has been prepared
by Company and delivered by Company to HSW, Parent and Merger Sub in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the "Company
Disclosure Schedule") or as disclosed in the Company Filed SEC Reports or as

licensed to do business, and, to the extent that such concept is legally
recognizable, is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character
of its properties owned or held under lease or the nature of its activities
makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to have such
power or authority or to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing could
not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay consummation of the
Transaction or otherwise prevent or materially delay Company from performing
its obligations under this Agreement and could not reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material

Company has filed all required registration statements, prospectuses,
notifications, reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents
required to be filed by it with the SEC since March 30, 2004 (collectively
the "Company SEC Reports").  No Subsidiary of Company is required to file any
form, report, registration statement, prospectus or other document with the
SEC. As of its filing date (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to
the date hereof, on the date of such filing), each Company SEC Report filed
pursuant to the Exchange Act did not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements made therein not misleading. Each Company SEC Report that is
a registration statement, as amended or supplemented, if applicable,
filed pursuant to the Securities Act, as of the date such registration
statement or amendment became effective, did not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. Each of
the consolidated financial statements (including the related notes) included
in the Company SEC Reports presents fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations and
cash flows of Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the respective
dates or for the respective periods set forth therein, all in conformity with
United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") consistently
applied during the periods and at the respective dates involved (except as
may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC), and subject, in the case
of the

  



        
   

  



  

unaudited interim financial statements, to the absence of notes and normal
year-end adjustments that have not had and are not reasonably expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. All of such Company SEC Reports, at
their respective dates (and at the date of any amendment to the respective
Company SEC Report), complied as to form in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

  



  

(b) Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports filed and publicly
available with respect to the two (2) year period immediately prior to the
date hereof (the "Company Filed SEC Reports"), Company and its Subsidiaries
have not incurred any liabilities that are of a nature that would be required
to be disclosed on a balance sheet of Company and its Subsidiaries or the
footnotes thereto prepared in conformity with GAAP, other than (A)
liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business that have not had and
could not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect
and could not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay
consummation of any of the Transactions or otherwise prevent or materially
delay the Company from performing its obligations under this Agreement, or
(B) liabilities incurred in accordance with Section 7.1.

  



  

(c) Company has furnished HSW with a true and correct copy of a payment
schedule agreement between Company and Lam Ching Wing pursuant to which Lam
Ching Wing has agreed to repay an account receivable owed to Company. To the
knowledge of Company, Lam Ching Wing is materially in compliance with the
terms of such agreement.

(a) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by Company for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in (A) the Form S-4 will, at the time
the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented
or at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act or at the
Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, not misleading, and (B) the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will, on the date it is first mailed to the Company
Stockholders or at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Form S-4
and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will comply when filed as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the
Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.8, no
representation or warranty is made by Company with respect to statements made
or incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus based on information supplied in writing by HSW,
Parent or Merger Sub or any stockholder of HSW, or any of their
respective representatives for inclusion or incorporation by reference
therein.

  



  

 **5.9** ** ****Board Approval** **. **The Board of Directors of Company,
by resolutions duly adopted and not subsequently rescinded or modified in any
way, has, as of the date hereof, duly (i) determined that this Agreement and

transactions and commitments in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practices or those expressly contemplated by this Agreement;

accounting principles or practice by Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
except for any such change required by reason of a change in GAAP or
Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act;

  



  

(i) any (i) grant of any severance or termination pay to (or amendment to any
existing arrangement with) any director, officer or employee of Company or
any of its Subsidiaries other than in the ordinary course of business

adoption or amendment (except as required by applicable law) of any
collective bargaining, bonus, profit-sharing, thrift, pension,
retirement, deferred compensation, compensation, stock option, restricted
stock or other benefit plan or arrangement covering any director, officer or
employee of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except in connection with the
extension of the exercise period of existing Company Options held by Company
directors and officers or any actions taken in connection with Section
1.2(b); or

  



  

(j) any material Tax election made or changed, any annual tax accounting
period changed, any method of tax accounting adopted or changed, any material
amended Tax Returns or claims for material Tax refunds filed, any material
closing agreement entered into, any material Tax claim, audit or assessment
settled, or any right to claim a material Tax refund, offset or other
reduction in Tax liability surrendered.

  



  

 **5.12** ** ****Title to Property and Leases** **.**

  



  

(a) Company and its Subsidiaries own, or hold a valid leasehold or
subleasehold interest in, all assets and properties, tangible or intangible,
necessary for the conduct of the business of Company and its Subsidiaries as
presently conducted, except where the failure to own, or hold such leasehold
or subleasehold interest in, such assets and properties could not reasonably
be expected to prevent or materially delay consummation of the Transaction or
otherwise prevent or materially delay Company from performing its obligations
under this Agreement and could not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(b) Neither Company nor any Subsidiary owns any real property. Section
5.12(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and correct
list of each parcel of real property leased by Company or any Subsidiary
("Real Property"), such list setting forth the location of each parcel of
Real Property, the landlord of the Real Property, the approximate square
footage of the premises subject to the lease relating thereto, the term of
such lease and the payments required to be made by Company or such Subsidiary
under such lease.

  



  

(c) With respect to any leases relating to the Real Property and all material
personal property leases, there exist no default by Company or any Subsidiary
or, to the knowledge of Company, any actual default or default that has been
threatened by any third party

  



        
   

  



  

(including any landlord) thereunder, that has had or could reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(d) With respect to any land use rights, building, property and/or investment
held or leased by Company or a Subsidiary in the PRC, subject to PRC law and
to the knowledge of Company, each of Company and its Subsidiaries has full,
exclusive and unimpaired legal and beneficial ownership of its rights,
leasehold interests, property and investments free from any mortgages or
security interests of any nature, third party rights, conditions, orders or
other restrictions and has obtained all necessary approvals and effected all
necessary registrations with government authorities with respect thereto,
except where the failure to have, or the suspension or cancellation of, any
approvals or registrations could not reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay consummation of the Transaction or otherwise prevent or
materially delay Company from performing its obligations under this Agreement
and could not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

  



  

 **5.13** ** ****Intellectual Property** **.**

  

 ** **

  

(a) (i) Company and/or each of its Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed to use
(in each case, free and clear of any Liens), all material Intellectual
Property used in the conduct of its business as currently conducted; (ii) to
the knowledge of Company, the use of any Intellectual Property by Company
and/or its Subsidiaries does not infringe on or otherwise violate the rights
of any Person, (iii) the use of the Intellectual Property is in accordance,
in all material respects, with subsisting and enforceable licenses pursuant
to which Company or any Subsidiary acquired the right to use any Intellectual
Property; and (iv) to the knowledge of Company, no Person is challenging,
infringing or otherwise violating any right of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to any Intellectual Property owned by
and/or licensed to Company or its Subsidiaries.  Neither Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has knowledge of any pending claim, order or proceeding with
respect to any Intellectual Property used by Company and its Subsidiaries and
to its knowledge no Intellectual Property owned and/or licensed by Company or
its Subsidiaries is being used or enforced in a manner that would reasonably
be expected to result in the abandonment, cancellation or unenforceability of
such Intellectual Property. The consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement will not result in the loss or impairment of the right of
Company and/or its Subsidiaries to own or use any material Intellectual
Property relating to the business of Company and/or its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(b) To the knowledge of Company, none of the material Intellectual Property
or other know-how used in the business of Company and/or its Subsidiaries,
the value of which to Company is contingent upon maintenance of the
confidentiality thereof has been disclosed by Company or any of its
Affiliates to any Person other than those Persons who are bound to hold such
information in confidence pursuant to confidentiality agreements or by
operation of law. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries are party to
any contract that materially restricts or otherwise materially limits the
ability of Company or such Subsidiary to perform services for any other
Person.

  



  

(c) Except as set forth in Section 5.13(c) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, with respect to the Intellectual Property owned by Company and/or
its Subsidiaries, Company and its Subsidiaries have taken commercially
reasonable actions consistent with industry standards in the region where
Company and/or its Subsidiaries operate to protect their

  



        
   

  



  

Intellectual Property under applicable law. Without limiting the foregoing,
the PRC Subsidiaries have and enforce a policy requiring each of their
employees who have participated in the creation of any Intellectual Property
that is used by the PRC Subsidiaries to enter into proprietary information,
confidentiality and assignment agreements and all such current and former
employees of the PRC Subsidiaries have executed such an agreement.  Neither
Company nor any Subsidiary has disclosed, nor is under any contractual or
other obligation to disclose, to another person any of its material Trade
Secrets, except pursuant to an enforceable confidentiality agreement or
undertaking, and, to the knowledge of Company, no person has materially
breached any such agreement or undertaking.

  



  

 **5.14** ** ****Material Contracts** **.**

  



  

(a) Except for the contracts, leases, licenses, commitments, and other
instruments (collectively, the "Company Contracts") specifically disclosed in
the Company Filed SEC Reports or set forth in Section 5.14 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, as of the date hereof, neither Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by: (i) any material partnership, joint
venture or other similar agreement or arrangement; (ii) any agreement
relating to indebtedness for borrowed money or the deferred purchase price of
property, in either case whether incurred, assumed, guaranteed or secured by
an asset and of an amount, together with all such other agreements, in excess
of U.S. $5,000,000 other than in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice in connection with the purchases by Company or any of its
Subsidiaries of wireless handset products for sale and resale; or (iii) any
agreement containing any provision or covenant limiting the ability of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to compete (with respect to the businesses
conducted on the date hereof) with any Person in any geographic area.

  



  

(b) Each Company Contract specifically disclosed in any Company Filed SEC
Report or required to be disclosed pursuant to this Section 5.14 is valid and
in full force and effect except to the extent it has previously expired in
accordance with its terms. Except as set forth in Section 5.14 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule or except as could not reasonably be expected to prevent
or materially delay consummation of the Transaction or otherwise prevent or
materially delay Company from performing its obligations under this Agreement
and could not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect, neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has (i) violated any
provision of, or committed or failed to perform any act which with or without
notice, lapse of time or both would constitute a default under the provisions
of, any Company Contract or (ii) waived any right it may have under any of
the Company Contracts. Unless such document is made available on a website
designated by the SEC, correct and complete copies of all Company Contracts
(or correct and complete narrative descriptions of any oral Company
Contracts) specifically disclosed in any Company Filed SEC Report or required
to be disclosed pursuant to this Section 5.14 have previously been provided
or made available to Parent.

  



  

 **5.15** ** ****Litigation** **.** Except as disclosed in the Company Filed
SEC Reports, there is no suit, action, claim, investigation or proceeding
pending or, to the knowledge of Company, threatened against Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any property or asset of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, nor is there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of
any Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding against Company or any of
its Subsidiaries that

  



        
   

  



  

(a) has had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material
Adverse Effect or (b) seeks to materially delay or prevent the consummation
of any of the Transaction.

  



  

 **5.16** ** ****Labor Relations** **.** Neither Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any collective bargaining or similar agreement; to
the knowledge of Company, no collective bargaining agent has been certified
as a representative of any of the employees of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; to the knowledge of Company, no representation campaign or
election is now in progress with respect to any employee of Company or any of
its Subsidiaries; and there are no labor disputes, grievances, controversies,
strikes or requests for union representation pending, or, to the knowledge of
Company, threatened, against Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective businesses. To the knowledge of Company, no event has occurred
that could give rise to any such dispute, controversy, strike or request for
representation. Each of Company and its Subsidiaries has complied with all
applicable PRC laws and regulations, including laws and regulations
pertaining to welfare funds, social benefits, medical benefits, insurance,
retirement benefits, pensions or the like, except as could not reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially delay consummation of the Transaction or
otherwise prevent or materially delay Company from performing its obligations
under this Agreement and could not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

 **5.17** ** ****Employee Benefits** **.**

  

 ** **

  

(a) Prior to the date hereof, Company has made available to Parent each
material "employee benefit plan", as defined in ERISA, and each material plan
or other material arrangement (written or oral) (including employment and
severance agreements) providing for compensation, bonuses, profit-sharing,
stock option or other equity-related rights or other forms of incentive or
deferred compensation, employee loans, vacation benefits, insurance coverage
(including any self-insured arrangements), health, medical, dental or vision
benefits, disability benefits, workers compensation, supplemental
unemployment benefits, severance benefits and post-employment or retirement
benefits (including compensation, pension, health, medical, or life insurance
benefits), in each case which is maintained, administered, or contributed to
by Company or any ERISA Affiliate thereof and covers any employee, director
or independent contractor or former employee, director or independent
contractor of Company or any ERISA Affiliate thereof or under which Company
or any ERISA Affiliate thereof has any material liability with respect to
current or former employees, directors or independent contractors of
Company or any ERISA Affiliate thereof. Copies of such plans or other
arrangements (and, if applicable, related trust agreements) and all
amendments thereto and written interpretations thereof have been made
available to Parent prior to the date hereof together with the most recent
annual report (Form 5500 Annual Report including, if applicable, Schedule B
thereto) prepared in connection with any such plan or other arrangement.
 Such plans or other arrangements are referred to collectively as the
"Company Benefit Plans"; _provided_ _that_ a plan or other arrangement
with respect to a former employee, director or independent contractor
shall constitute an "Company Benefit Plan" only to the extent that Company or
its ERISA Affiliate has any present or future liability or obligation. An
"ERISA Affiliate" of any person means any other person which, together with
such person, would be treated as a single employer under Section 414 of the
Code. At no time has Company or any person who from time to time is or was an
ERISA Affiliate of Company ever maintained an employee benefit plan that is
subject to Title IV of ERISA. Section 5.17(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule lists each Company Benefit Plan.

  



         
  

  



  

(b) Each of the Company Benefit Plans, and the administration thereof, is,
and has been, in material compliance with the requirements provided by any
and all applicable statutes, orders or governmental rules or regulations
currently in effect, including, but not limited to, ERISA and the Code.
Each Company Benefit Plan and its related trust which is intended to qualify
under Section 401(a) and Section 501(a) of the Code is so qualified, and
nothing has occurred to cause the loss of such qualification. Company has
made available to Parent copies of the most recent Internal Revenue Service
determination letters with respect to each such Company Benefit Plan, if any.
Each Company Benefit Plan which is intended to be exempt under Section
501(c)(9) or 501(c)(17) of the Code satisfies the requirements for such
exemption, so qualifies in form and in operation, and meets, or has
satisfied, the requirements of Section 505(c) of the Code and the regulations
thereunder.

  



  

(c) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, there are no material funded
benefit obligations for which contributions have not been made or properly
accrued and there are no material unfunded benefit obligations which have not
been accounted for by reserves, or otherwise properly footnoted in accordance
with GAAP, on the Company Filed SEC Reports.

  



  

(d) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan (i) no prohibited transactions
as defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code have occurred
or are expected to occur as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and (ii) no action, suit, grievance, arbitration or other manner
of litigation, or claim with respect to the assets thereof of any Company
Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for benefits made in the ordinary
course of plan administration for which plan administrative review procedures
have not been exhausted) is pending, threatened or imminent against or with
respect to any of the Company Benefit Plans, Company, any ERISA Affiliate or
any fiduciary, as such term is defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA
("Fiduciary"), including but not limited to any action, suit, grievance,
arbitration or other manner of litigation, or claim regarding conduct that
allegedly interferes with the attainment of rights under any Company Benefit
Plans. None of Company or its directors, officers, or employees, or any
Fiduciary has any material liability for failure to comply with ERISA or the
Code for any action or failure to act in connection with the administration
or investment of such plans.

  



  

(e) No Company Benefit Plan is a multiemployer plan within the meaning of
Section 3(37) of ERISA.

  



  

(f) Company and its Subsidiaries are in material compliance with all federal,
state, local and foreign requirements regarding employment.

  



  

(g) Except as set forth in Section 5.17(g) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, no employee of Company or any of its Subsidiaries will become
entitled to any change-in-control, retirement, severance, retention or
similar benefit or enhanced or accelerated benefit or any forgiveness of
an outstanding advance or loan as a result of the transactions contemplated
hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as a result of such transactions
in conjunction with any other event).  Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, no amount required to be paid or payable to or with respect to
any employee of Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as a
result of such transactions in conjunction with any other event) will, to the

  



        
   

  



  

knowledge of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, be an "excess parachute
payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

  



  

(h) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or announcement
(whether or not written) by Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates relating
to, or change in participation or coverage under, any Company Benefit Plan
which would increase materially the expense of maintaining such Company
Benefit Plan above the level of the expense incurred in respect thereof for
the twelve months ended on September 30, 2005.

  



  

 **5.18** ** ****Taxes** **. **Each of Company and its Subsidiaries has filed
all material Tax Returns required to have been filed (or extensions have been
duly obtained) and has paid all material Taxes required to have been paid by
it (or has established in accordance with GAAP an adequate accrual for
all material Taxes through the end of the last period for when Company and
its Subsidiaries ordinarily record items on their respective books). All such
Tax Returns are, or will be at the time of filing, true and complete in all
material respects. No audit is pending or, to the knowledge of Company,
threatened with respect to any Tax Returns filed by, or Taxes due from,
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.  There is no current deficiency or
adjustment for any Taxes proposed, asserted or assessed against Company or
any of its Subsidiaries. There are no material Liens for Taxes upon the
assets of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except for statutory Liens for
current Taxes not yet due and those being contested in good faith. Neither
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or bound by, or otherwise
in any way obligated under, any tax sharing or similar agreement. Neither
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owns an interest in real property in
any jurisdiction in which a Tax is imposed, or the value of the interest
is reassessed, on the transfer of an interest in real property and which
treats the transfer of an interest in an entity that owns an interest in real
property as a transfer of the interest in real property.  Neither Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action or knows of any fact that is
reasonably likely to prevent (a) the Contribution together with the exchange
of Company Common Stock for Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger from
qualifying as a transaction under Section 351 of the Code or (b) the exchange
of Company Common Stock for Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger from
qualifying as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.

  



  

 **5.19** ** ****Compliance with Applicable Laws** **.**  Company and its
Subsidiaries have been issued and hold all consents, authorizations, permits,
licenses, franchises, variances, exemptions, waivers, orders and approvals of
all Governmental Entities necessary to own, lease or operate all of the
assets and properties of Company and its Subsidiaries, as appropriate, and to
carry on the businesses of Company and its Subsidiaries as now conducted,
including registrations with the Ministry of Commerce of the PRC, the State
Administration of Industry and Commerce of the PRC, the State Administration

 **6.12** ** ****Compliance with Applicable Laws** **.** HSW, Parent and

licenses, franchises, variances, exemptions, waivers, orders and approvals of
all Governmental Entities necessary to own, lease or operate all of their
respective assets and properties, as appropriate, and to carry on their
respective businesses as now conducted and to be conducted as contemplated
hereunder at the Effective Time (the "Parent Permits"), and no suspension or
cancellation of any of the Parent Permits is pending, or to the knowledge of
HSW, Parent or Merger Sub, threatened, except where the failure to have, or
the suspension or cancellation of, any of the Parent Permits could
not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay consummation of
the Transaction or otherwise prevent or materially delay HSW, Parent or
Merger Sub from performing its respective obligations under this Agreement
and could not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect
or an HSW Material Adverse Effect. HSW, Parent and Merger Sub are in

pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of without registration under the
Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws, except pursuant to
an exemption from such registration under the Securities Act and such laws.
HSW is able to bear the economic risk of holding such shares for an
indefinite period (including total loss of its investment), and (either alone
or together with its advisors) has sufficient knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits
and risk of its investment.

  



  

 **6.14** ** ****Brokers** **.** Except as set forth in Section 6.14 of
the Parent Disclosure Schedule, no agent, broker, investment banker,
financial advisor or other firm or Person is or will be entitled to any

with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of HSW, Parent or Merger Sub.

prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC, subject to reasonable approval of
Parent, proxy materials that shall constitute the proxy statement/prospectus

parties hereto shall cooperate to prepare and file with the SEC
a registration statement on Form S-4 with respect to the issuance of
Parent Common Stock to the Company Stockholders pursuant to the Merger (such

information concerning it and its businesses as the other parties may
reasonably request in connection with the preparation of the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and Form S-4. The parties hereto shall use reasonable
best efforts to have the Proxy Statement/Prospectus cleared by the SECs
staff and the

  



        
   

  



  

Form S-4 declared effective by the SEC as promptly as practicable and to keep
the Form S-4 effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and
the transactions contemplated hereby. Prior to the effective date of the

or any action required under any applicable federal or state securities laws
in connection with the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
the Merger. As promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, the parties
hereto shall provide the other parties with copies of all written comments
and advise the other parties of any oral comments with respect to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or Form S-4 received from the SECs staff. The parties

to be mailed to Companys stockholders as promptly as practicable after the
Form S-4 is declared effective by the SEC under the Securities Act. Parent
shall also take any action (other than qualifying to do business in any
jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or to file a general consent
to service of process) required to be taken under any applicable state
securities and Blue Sky Laws in connection with the Merger and Company shall
furnish all information concerning it and the holders of its capital stock as
may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action. Each party
will advise the other party, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of
the time when the Form S-4 has been declared effective, the issuance of any
stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock
issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or any request by the SECs staff for amendment of the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 or the submission of any supplemental
materials (for review by the SEC Staff) in connection therewith. If at any
time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to any party or any
of its affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by such party
which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Form S-4 or
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus such that any of such documents would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties and, to the extent
required by law, rules or regulations, an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the Company Stockholders.

Act.

  

###

Common Stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of assumed Company Options
(the "Parent Option Shares") have been registered under the Securities Act of

exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. Following the Effective

act could cause the Contribution together with the exchange of Company Common
Stock for Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger to fail to qualify as a

reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.

capital stock of its Subsidiaries) of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, or (C) any purchase or sale of, or tender or exchange offer for,
any equity or voting debt securities of such party, which, if consummated,
would result in any Person acquiring "beneficial ownership" (within the
meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of any securities representing
15% or more of the outstanding voting power of such party (or of the
surviving, resulting or ultimate parent entity in such transaction) or any of
its Significant Subsidiaries.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Company or
its Board of Directors (including any duly constituted committee thereof)
shall be permitted to engage in any discussions or negotiations with, or
provide (by any medium) material, non-public data or information to, any
Person in response to a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal by any such
Person (not made or received in violation of paragraph (a) of this Section
7.11), if and only to the extent that, (i) its Board of Directors concludes
in good faith after consultation with outside counsel and independent
financial advisors that such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably expected to
lead to a Superior Proposal, (ii) prior to providing any information or data
to any Person in connection with an Acquisition Proposal by any such Person,
its Board of Directors receives from such Person an executed confidentiality
agreement having provisions that are customary in such agreements relative to
proposed transactions such as the Acquisition Proposal, as advised by outside
counsel, and (iii) Company notifies HSW and Parent promptly (and, in any case
within 48 hours) of such inquiries, proposals or offers received by, any such
information requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations sought to
be initiated or continued with, such Person or any of its representatives
indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the
material terms and conditions (including for this purpose the price,
structure,

  



        
   

  



  

intended accounting and tax treatment, closing conditions, anticipated
closing date and requisite regulatory approvals, to the extent then known or
specified by such Person) of any inquiries, indications of interest,
proposals, term sheets or offers.

  



  

If, in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, the Company or its Board
of Directors (including any duly constituted committee thereof),
withdraws, modifies or qualifies (or proposes publicly or otherwise to
withdraw, modify or qualify) in any manner adverse to HSW or Parent the
Company Recommendation, or (y) takes any action or makes any statement (not
described in the foregoing clause (x)) in connection with the Company
Stockholders Meeting otherwise inconsistent with the Company Recommendation
(including any action contemplated under subsection (c) below), Company (A)
shall provide immediate written notice to HSW and Parent advising HSW and
Parent of such occurrence and specifying the identity of the Person making
the Acquisition Proposal as well as the material terms and conditions
(including for this purpose, price structure, intended accounting and tax
treatment, closing conditions, anticipated closing date and requisite
regulatory approvals, to the extent known) of such Acquisition Proposal and
(B) shall postpone or delay the Company Stockholders Meeting for not less
than five (5) days after the date such written notice is provided to HSW and
Parent. During such five (5) day period, Company shall negotiate in good
faith with HSW and Parent with respect to any changes to this Agreement
proposed by HSW and Parent (it being understood and agreed that any material
amendment to the financial or other material terms of a Superior Proposal, if
any, shall require a new five (5) day period to afford HSW and Parent the
opportunity to negotiate with Company).

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary but subject to
the obligations of the Company under this Section 7.11, Company or its Board
of Directors (including any duly constituted committee thereof) shall be
permitted to approve or recommend, or propose, publicly or otherwise, to
approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, any term sheet, memorandum of
understanding, letter of intent, agreement-in-principle, contract,
commitment, plan, arrangement or agreement, or propose, publicly or otherwise
or agree to do any of the foregoing, related to any Superior Proposal.

  



  

"Superior Proposal" means a bona fide written proposal made by a Person other
than a party to this Agreement (1) regarding a merger, reorganization,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization or
similar transaction involving Company as a result of which the other party
thereto or its stockholders would own a majority or more of the outstanding
combined voting power of the entity surviving or resulting from such
transaction (or the ultimate parent entity thereof), (2) which is on terms
which the Board of Directors of Company in good faith concludes (following
receipt of the advice of an independent financial advisor of national
standing and of independent outside counsel), after taking into account,
among other things, the long-term strategic objectives of such party and all
legal, financial, tax, accounting, regulatory and other aspects of the
proposal and the Person making the proposal (including its likelihood of
consummation and anticipated timing thereof), is more favorable to its
stockholders (in their capacities as stockholders) than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (3) which provides that any requisite
external financing (sufficient to pay the cash portion, if any, of the
proposed transaction consideration and expenses related thereto) is either
then committed or otherwise funded and not subject to any
material contingency (other than customary third party lender "market outs").

  



        
   

  



  

(d) Company agrees that it shall, and shall cause its officers, directors and
representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all
activities, discussions and negotiations existing as of the date of this
Agreement with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. Company agrees that it will promptly inform its

Agreement and herein.

  



  

D. The Board of Directors of Company has determined to recommend that the
stockholders of Company adopt and approve the Transaction Agreement and
approve the Transaction.

  



  

E. It is a condition and inducement to HSWs willingness to enter into

and it is a condition to HSWs, Companys, Parents and Merger Subs
obligations to complete the Transaction that the stockholders of Company
adopt and approve the Transaction Agreement and approve the Transaction.

to which the Stockholder is a party or by which the Stockholder (or any of
his assets) is bound, except for any such breach, violation, conflict or

all of the matters set forth in this Agreement, in each case with respect to
all of the Stockholders Existing Shares and with respect to all of the

obligation of HSW, enforceable against HSW in accordance with its terms,

SECTION 2.01 _General_. (a) HSW understands and agrees that the shares of
Common Stock issued to HSW pursuant to the Merger Agreement (the "HSW Stock")
will not have been registered for resale under the Securities Act.
During the Applicable Restricted Period, HSW may not make or solicit any Sale
of, or create, incur or assume any Encumbrance with respect to, the HSW
Stock; _provided_  that, during the Applicable Restricted Period, HSW may
make or solicit a Sale to a Permitted Transferee and may pledge an interest
in the HSW Stock to High River Limited Partnership and/or StuffWorks, LLC
pursuant to a Stock Pledge Agreement dated as of the date hereof (pursuant to
which High River Limited Partnership and/or StuffWorks, LLC, as applicable,
shall succeed to all of the rights and obligations of HSW under this
Agreement with respect to any shares of HSW Stock foreclosed upon
thereunder); _provided_ , _further_ , that the restrictions contained in this
Section 2.01 shall terminate and be of no further force and effect (i) with
respect to one-third (1/3) of the shares of the HSW Stock, on the date that
is twelve (12) months after the Closing, (ii) with respect to the next one-
third (1/3) of the shares of the HSW Stock, on the date that is eighteen (18)
months after the Closing, and (iii) with respect to the remaining one-third
(1/3) of the shares of the HSW Stock, on the date that is twenty-four (24)
months after the Closing.

  



  

### (b) No Sale of HSW Stock to a Permitted Transferee shall be effective if
a purpose or effect of such transfer shall have been to circumvent the
provisions of this Section 2.01. HSW shall remain responsible for
the performance of this Agreement by each Permitted Transferee of HSW to
which HSW Stock is transferred. If any Permitted Transferee to which HSW
Stock is transferred pursuant to Section 2.01(a) ceases to be a Permitted
Transferee of HSW, such Person shall reconvey such Stock to HSW immediately
before such Person ceases to be a Permitted Transferee of HSW so long as such
Person knows of its upcoming change of status immediately prior thereto. If
such change of status is not known until after its occurrence, the former
Permitted Transferee shall make such transfer to HSW as soon as is
practicable after the former Permitted Transferee receives notice thereof.

  

### 

  

### (c) HSW agrees that it will not make or solicit any Sale of, or create,
incur or assume any Encumbrance with respect to, its interest in any
Permitted Transferee to which it has transferred HSW Stock unless prior
thereto HSW Stock held by such entity is transferred to HSW or to one or more
Permitted Transferees.

  

### 

  

SECTION 2.02 _Improper Sale or Encumbrance_. Any attempt not in compliance
with this Agreement to make any Sale of, or create, incur or assume any
Encumbrance with respect to, any shares of Common Stock shall be null and
void and of no force and effect, the purported transferee shall have no
rights or privileges in or with respect to the Company, and the

  



        
   

  



  

Company shall not give any effect in the Companys stock records to such
attempted Sale or Encumbrance. Furthermore, HSW and the other parties
engaging or attempting to engage in such Sale or Encumbrance shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Company and the other Stockholder from all losses that
the Company and the other Stockholder may incur (including, without
limitation, incremental tax liability and lawyers fees and expenses) in
enforcing the provisions of this Agreement.

the shares of HSW Stock and each certificate representing any shares of
Common Stock acquired by HSW following its acquisition of Common Stock
pursuant to the Merger Agreement shall be stamped or otherwise imprinted with

required by agreement or by applicable state securities laws):

  



  

##### (i) THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE GENERALLY MAY NOT BE
SOLD OR TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE OF REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT

##### 

  

##### (ii) THE SHARES REPRESENTED HEREBY ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS
UNDER THE TERMS OF STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT DATED APRIL 20, 2006, AS AMENDED

##### 

  

### (b) HSW consents to the Company making a notation on its records and
giving instructions to any transfer agent of its capital stock in order to

### 

  

### (c) If any HSW Stock ceases to be subject to any and all restrictions on
Sale or Encumbrance set forth in Section 2.01 of this Agreement or the other
provisions set forth in this Agreement, the Company, upon the written request
of the holder thereof, shall issue to such holder a new certificate

# **ARTICLE 3 
 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE**

  

# 

  

SECTION 3.01 _Composition of the Board, Committees and Management_. (a) From
and after the Closing, the number of directors comprising the Board shall be
seven (7), or such number of directors as may be determined by the Board in
accordance with the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the
Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company, effective as of the Closing. At
all times, a majority of the directors on the Board shall be independent
directors and the independent directors (including those designated by any

  



        
   

  



  

Stockholder) shall meet all requirements regarding the independence of
directors as may be applicable to the Company pursuant to applicable Law or
the rules of the stock exchange on which the shares of Common Stock are
listed.

  



  

As of the Closing, HSW, WEI ZHOU and the Company, through the Board, shall
take all such action as may be necessary (i) to cause the persons designated
by each Stockholder as set forth in _Exhibit 3.01(a) _to be duly appointed
to the Board, each to serve until the next annual election of directors of
the Company (unless any such person originally designated by a Stockholder is
unable to serve in such capacity, in which event such Stockholder shall
designate a substitute individual), and (ii) to cause the Special Committee,
the Compensation Committee and the Audit Committee of the Board to be
duly established, each composed of the persons set forth in _Exhibit 3.01(a)
_and to serve for such term during which such person remains a director of
the Company. HSW shall have the right to designate five (5) directors (three
(3) of whom shall be independent directors) and such directors designated by
HSW shall be referred to herein as the " _HSW Designees_ ". WEI ZHOU shall
have the right to designate two (2) directors (one (1) of whom shall be an
independent director) and such directors designated by WEI ZHOU shall be
referred to herein as the " _WEI ZHOU Designees_ ". Each Stockholder shall
have the right to request the removal, with or without cause, of any
directors designated by such Stockholder, and HSW, WEI ZHOU and the Company,
through the Board, shall cause any such person to be removed from the Board.

  



  

If any director shall be unable or unwilling to serve as a director
(including as a member of any committee), the Stockholder which designated
such individual as set forth in _Exhibit 3.01(a) _shall designate another
individual and each of HSW, WEI ZHOU and the Company, through the Board,
shall cause such person to be nominated for such position. If it is determined
that any incumbent director designated by a Stockholder shall not stand for
re-election at any annual meeting of the Companys stockholders, such
Stockholder shall designate the person who shall be nominated for election as
a director in lieu of such incumbent director.

  



  

### (b) Following the nomination of the designees to the Board pursuant to
Section 3.01(a), at each election of directors at which the term of any
director designated by a Stockholder will expire, the Board shall (i)
recommend for election to the Board a nominee who shall be designated by the
Stockholder that initially designated the director whose term will expire,
and (ii) shall use best efforts to solicit proxies in favor of such nominee
consistent with the efforts used to solicit proxies for any other Board
nominees.  

  

### 

  

### (c) In addition to the Special Committee, the Compensation Committee and
the Audit Committee, the Board shall have such other committees as the Board
may from time to time determine, as may be permitted under applicable Law,
the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the Amended and
Restated Bylaws of the Company. Each of the Special Committee, the
Compensation Committee and the Audit Committee shall be comprised of at least
three (3) members.  One independent director designated by each Stockholder
shall serve on each committee of the Board. All members of the Compensation
Committee and the Audit Committee shall be independent directors.

  

### 

  

### (d) Each Stockholder hereby agrees that at every meeting of the Companys
stockholders at which directors are to be elected or at any meeting at which
the removal of a

  



        
   

  



  

### director is subject to the vote of the Companys stockholders,
each Stockholder and its Permitted Transferees shall cause all of their
shares of Common Stock to be represented either by proxy or in person and to
be voted in favor of (i) the election of the HSW Designees and WEI ZHOU
Designees and (ii) the removal of any HSW Designee if requested by HSW or the
removal of any WEI ZHOU Designee if requested by WEI ZHOU. If directors are
to be elected or removed by written consent of the Companys stockholders,
each Stockholder agrees that it and its Permitted Transferees shall execute
written consents in favor of (x) the election of the HSW Designees and WEI
ZHOU Designees and (y) the removal of any HSW Designee if requested by HSW or
the removal of any WEI ZHOU Designee if requested by WEI ZHOU.

  

### 

  

(e) In order to effectuate this Section 3.01, each Stockholder hereby grants
to the Secretary of the Company an irrevocable proxy pursuant to Section
212(e) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, coupled with
an interest, such proxy to be used solely in the event of a breach of or non-
compliance with Section 3.01(d) above, solely for the purpose of voting all
of the shares of Common Stock of the Company owned by such Stockholder in
favor of (i) the election of all HSW Designees and WEI ZHOU Designees and
(ii) the removal of any HSW Designee if requested by HSW or the removal of
any WEI ZHOU Designee if requested by WEI ZHOU.

to all matters submitted to a vote of holders of Common Stock (other than the

Agreements) in any territory outside the United States or the Territories (an
"Other Market Transaction"), HSW agrees to:

  

### 

  

(i) give the Company written notice of such contemplated Other Market
Transaction which written notice shall constitute an irrevocable offer to the
Company to participate in such Other Market Transaction in accordance with
this Section (should such Other Market Transaction occur) and shall include

Transaction, including the identity of the parties, a description of the
assets and business in reasonable detail, the price and the basis for

time expiring on the earlier of: (A) sixty (60) days from the date of such
written notice, and (B) the date on which the Company notifies HSW that it is

the date of the written notice from HSW under Section 5.01(a) within which to
notify HSW, in writing, that it elects to purchase a portion (and stating the
amount of such portion) of HSWs interest in such Other Market Transaction.
Failure by the Company to give written notice to HSW within such period shall
constitute a rejection of the offer to participate in such Other Market
Transaction.  

  

### 

  

### (c) The closing of the purchase by the Company of a portion of HSWs
interest in any such Other Market Transaction shall occur (i) at the time and
place of the closing of such Other Market Transaction or (ii) if the closing
of such Other Market Transaction has occurred prior to notice of election

under no obligation to enter into any Other Market Transaction and the
determination of whether to enter into any Other Market Transaction shall be
made by HSW in its sole and absolute discretion.

for HSW unless HSW agrees to bear such additional fees and/or costs. In the
event additional fees or costs are required, the Company shall give HSW the
opportunity to be involved in the negotiations regarding amount of such
additional fees and/or costs (and the Additional Rights obtained therefor)
and shall obtain HSWs written consent prior to agreeing to such additional
fees and/or costs.

  



  

SECTION 5.03 _Non-Competition_. The Company covenants and agrees that, during
the term of this Agreement, it shall not, and shall use its best efforts to
cause each of its

legal representatives and assigns.

  



        
   

  



  

SECTION 6.05 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, all
costs and expenses, including, without limitation, fees and disbursements of
counsel, financial advisors and accountants, incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party
incurring such costs or expenses.

  



  

SECTION 6.06 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. (a) This Agreement shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New
York applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed in that State.

  



  

### (b) All actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to this
Agreement shall be heard and determined exclusively in any New York state or
federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of The City of New York.
The parties hereto hereby (i) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of
any state or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of The City of
New York for the purpose of any action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement brought by any party hereto, and (ii) irrevocably waive, and agree
not to assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such action,
any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-
named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or
execution, that the action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the
venue of the action is improper, or that this Agreement may not be enforced
in or by any of the above-named courts.

  

### 

  

### (c) Subject to applicable Law, process in any such claim, action, suit or
proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within
or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting
the foregoing and subject to applicable Law, each party agrees that service
of process on such party as provided in Section 6.02 shall be
deemed effective service of process on such party.  Nothing herein shall
affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by Law or at equity. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO
A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING
OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT.  Each of the parties
hereto (i) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other
party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would
not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver and
(ii) acknowledges that it and the other party have been induced to enter into
this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications
in this article.

  

### 

  

SECTION 6.07 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement
was not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties
hereto shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in
addition to any other remedy at Law or in equity.

  



  

SECTION 6.08 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and
delivered (including by facsimile transmission) in one or more counterparts,
and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which
when executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original but all of
which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.  Copies of
executed counterparts transmitted by telecopy or other electronic
transmission service shall be considered original executed counterparts for
purposes of this Section 6.08; provided that receipt of copies of such
counterparts is confirmed.

  



        
   

  



  

SECTION 6.09 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement constitutes the
entire agreement among the parties hereto pertaining to the subject matter
hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings pertaining
thereto.

  



  

SECTION 6.10 _Headings_. The headings and subheadings in this Agreement are
included for convenience and identification only and are in no way intended
to describe, interpret, define or limit the scope, extent or intent of this
Agreement or any provision hereto.

  



  

SECTION 6.11 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is held to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule
of Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect for so long as
the economic or legal substance of the transactions is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a
mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby
be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  



  

SECTION 6.12 _Public Announcements_. Except as required by Law or by
the requirements of any securities exchange on which the securities of a
party hereto are listed, no party to this Agreement shall make, or cause to
be made, any press release or public announcement in respect of this
Agreement or otherwise communicate with any news media with respect to this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other parties, and the
parties shall cooperate as to the timing and contents of any such press
release or public announcement.

  



  

SECTION 6.13 _Cumulative Remedies_. The rights and remedies provided by
this Agreement are cumulative and the use of any one right or remedy by any
party shall not preclude or waive its right to use any or all other remedies.
Said rights and remedies are given in addition to any other rights the
parties may have by law, statute, ordinance or otherwise.

  



  

SECTION 6.14 _Interpretation_. Throughout this Agreement, nouns, pronouns and
verbs shall be construed as masculine, feminine, neuter, singular or plural,
whichever shall be applicable.  Unless otherwise specified, all references
herein to "Articles", "Sections" and paragraphs shall refer to corresponding
provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

SECTION 6.15 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
permitted assigns and successors, and nothing herein, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other Person or entity, any legal or
equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement.

  



  

SECTION 6.16 _Construction_. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees it has
had the opportunity to draft, review and edit the language of this Agreement
and that no presumption for or against any party arising out of drafting all
or any part of this Agreement will be applied in any controversy, claim or
dispute relating to, in connection with or involving this Agreement.
Accordingly, the parties hereto hereby waive the benefit of any rule of Law,
or any

  



        
   

  



  

legal decision that would require, in cases of uncertainty, that the language
of a contract should be interpreted most strongly against the party who
drafted such language.
