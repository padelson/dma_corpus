 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

  

This  **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER** (this " ** _Agreement_** ") is made
and entered into as of June 26, 2007, by and among CommScope, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (" ** _Parent_** "), DJRoss, Inc., a Delaware
corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" ** _Merger
Sub_** "), and Andrew Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" ** _Andrew_**
").

  

 **WITNESSETH:**

  

 **WHEREAS** , the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and
Andrew have deemed it advisable and in the best interests of their respective
corporations and stockholders that Parent and Andrew enter into a business
combination transaction;

  

 **WHEREAS** , in furtherance thereof, the Board of Directors of each of
Parent, Merger Sub and Andrew have approved this Agreement and the merger of
Merger Sub with and into Andrew (the " ** _Merger_** ") so that Andrew
continues as the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes referred to
in such capacity as the " ** _Surviving Corporation_** "), upon the terms of
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance
with the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " ** _DGCL_**
");

  

 **WHEREAS** , the Board of Directors of Andrew has determined to recommend
to its stockholders the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the
Merger;

  

 **WHEREAS** , the sole stockholder of Merger Sub has approved this Agreement
and the Merger, and

  

 **WHEREAS** , the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties
and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.

  

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

  

# **Article I**

  

# **The Merger**

  

## 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms of and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective
Time (as defined in Section 1.3), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into
Andrew, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Andrew
shall continue as the Surviving Corporation in the Merger and shall succeed
to and assume all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
Merger Sub in accordance with the DGCL.

  

## 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " ** _Closing_** ") shall
take place at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on the third business day after
satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in Article VII
(other than delivery of items to be delivered at the Closing and other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, it
being understood that the occurrence of the Closing shall remain subject to
the delivery of such items and the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions
at the Closing), but in any event no earlier than August 10, 2007, at the
offices of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver and Jacobson LLP, One New York Plaza,
New York, New York 10004, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in
writing by the parties hereto. The date on which the Closing occurs is
referred to herein as the " ** _Closing Date_**."

  

## 1.3 _Effective Time_. Upon the terms of and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall
cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger executed
in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the " ** _Certificate
of Merger_** ") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "
** _Secretary of State_** ") and shall make all other filings or recordings
required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as
the Certificate of Merger is duly filed     

## with the Secretary of State, or at such subsequent date or time as Andrew
and Parent shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger. The date and
time at which the Merger becomes effective as set forth in the Certificate of
Merger is referred to herein as the " ** _Effective Time_**."

  

## 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the Merger shall have
the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of
the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of Andrew and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of Andrew and Merger Sub
shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

  

## 1.5 _Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation_.  At the
Effective Time, and subject to compliance with Section 6.4(a), the Andrew
Charter (as defined in Section 4.1(b)) shall be amended and restated in its
entirety to be identical to the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub in
the form attached as **Exhibit A** hereto, and such amended Andrew Charter
shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with the DGCL and as provided in such
certificate of incorporation; _provided, however,_ that, at the Effective
Time, Article 1 of the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:
"The name of the corporation is Andrew Corporation." After the Effective
Time, the authorized capital stock of the Surviving Corporation shall consist
of 1,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share. At the Effective
Time, the Andrew By-Laws (as defined in Section 4.1(b)) shall be amended and
restated in their entirety to be identical to the By-Laws of Merger Sub, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, in the form attached as
**Exhibit B** hereto, and such By-Laws shall be the By-Laws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the DGCL
and as provided in such By-Laws.

  

## 1.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_.  The directors
of the Merger Sub shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors
of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly
elected or appointed and qualified. The officers of the Merger Sub shall,
from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation until their respective successors are duly appointed.

  

## 1.7 _Alternative Structure_. Parent and Andrew may mutually agree to
revise the structure of the Merger provided for herein at any time prior to
receipt of the Andrew Stockholder Approval (as defined in Section 4.3(c)), or
at any time thereafter if, with appropriate disclosure, any required further
approval of the revised structure is obtained from the stockholders of
Andrew.

  

# **Article II**

  

# **Effects of the Merger; Exchange of Certificates**

  

## 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, Andrew or
the holders of any shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Andrew (the " ** _Andrew Common Stock_** "):

  

### (a) _Conversion of Andrew Common Stock_. Each share of Andrew Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, _other
than_ any shares of Andrew Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section
2.1(c) and any Dissenting Shares, shall automatically be converted into the
right to receive (i) at the election of Parent, in its sole discretion, by
written notice to Andrew at least two business days before the Closing Date,
either (x) $1.50 in cash, (y) a fraction of a fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent (" ** _Parent
Common Stock_** ") equal to (A) $1.50 _divided by_ (B) the volume weighted
average of the closing sale prices (calculated to the nearest tenth of a
cent) for a share of Parent Common Stock on the NYSE Composite Transactions
Tape (as reported by The Wall Street Journal (Northeast Edition), or, if not
reported thereby, as reported by any other authoritative source) over the ten
(10) consecutive trading days ending two trading days prior to the day on
which the Effective Time occurs (the " ** _Average Parent Common Stock
Price_** " and such quotient, the " ** _Exchange Ratio_** ") or (z) a
combination of cash and a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock,
determined as provided above, together equaling $1.50 (the form of
consideration elected by Parent, the " ** _Election Merger Consideration_**
"), plus (ii) $13.50 in cash (the " ** _Cash Merger Consideration_** "),
upon surrender

        

### of the Certificate (as defined in Section 2.2(b)) which immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented such share of Andrew Common Stock, in the
manner provided in Section 2.2(b) (or, in the case of a lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, Section 2.2(h)). The Election Merger Consideration and
Cash Merger Consideration to be issued or paid to holders of Andrew Common
Stock pursuant to this Agreement, together with any cash in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.1(e), are referred to as the " **
_Merger Consideration_**." As a result of the Merger, at the Effective Time,
each holder of a Certificate shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, _except_ the right to receive the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the shares of Andrew Common Stock represented by such
Certificate immediately prior to the Effective Time, and any dividends or
other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c), all to be issued or
paid, without interest, in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with Section 2.2(b) (or, in the case of a lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, Section 2.2(h)).

  

### (b) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub shall be converted
into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  

### (c) _Cancellation of Treasury Shares_. Each share of Andrew Common Stock
held as treasury stock by Andrew, if any, shall automatically be extinguished
without any conversion, and no consideration shall be delivered in respect
thereof.

  

### (d) _Andrew Options and Other Equity Awards_.

  

#### (i) Holders of outstanding options to purchase Andrew Common Stock
(each, an " ** _Andrew Option_** ") may elect, not less than five (5) days
prior to the Effective Time, to have some or all of their options cancelled
as of the Effective Time. In exchange for such cancellation, holders of
Andrew Options shall  be entitled to receive in respect of each share of
Andrew Common Stock subject to the cancelled Andrew Option immediately after
the Effective Time, an amount equal to the Merger Consideration  less the
exercise price of the cancelled Andrew Option; _provided_ _however_ , that
the exercise price shall be deducted from the sum of the cash portion of the
Election Merger Consideration and the Cash Merger Consideration and if
the exercise price of the cancelled option is in excess of such sum, the
number of Parent Shares issuable shall be reduced by a number having a value
(based on the Average Parent Common Stock Price) equal to such excess. As
soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Andrews Board of
Directors (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Andrew Stock
Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as are
required to allow such Andrew Options that were heretofore granted under any
Andrew Stock Plan or otherwise that are outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time to be so cancelled.  All amounts payable pursuant to this
Section 2.1(d)(i) shall be subject to any required withholding of Taxes and
shall be paid without interest. Holders of Andrew Options who do not elect
do have all of their options cancelled as of the Effective Time shall have
each then issued and outstanding option to purchase Andrew Common Stock under
any Andrew Stock Plan not so cancelled converted into an option to acquire a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product (rounded to the
nearest whole number) of (i) the number of shares of Andrew Common Stock
subject to the Andrew Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii)
the Option Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share (rounded to the
nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the exercise price per share of Andrew
Common Stock of that Andrew Option immediately prior to the Effective Time,
divided by (B) the Option Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , that the exercise
price and the number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable pursuant to
the Andrew Options will be determined in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the " **Code** "); and _provided_ , _further_ , that in the case of any
Andrew Option to which Section 422 of the Code applies, the exercise price
and the number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable pursuant to such
Andrew Option will be determined in accordance with the foregoing, subject to
those adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of
Section 424(a) of the Code. " ** _Option Exchange Ratio_** " means $15.00
divided by the Average Parent Common Stock Price. As soon as reasonably
practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall file a
registration statement under the Securities Act (as defined in Section
3.3(d)(ii)(B)) on Form S-8 or another appropriate form (and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness thereof and
maintain the current status of the prospectuses contained therein) with
respect to Andrew Options assumed by Parent pursuant

        

#### hereto and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
registration statement to remain in effect for so long as such assumed Andrew
Options shall remain outstanding.

  

#### (ii) At the Effective Time, all restricted stock units (including, to
the extent applicable, performance stock units) granted under the Andrew
Stock Plans will be assumed by Parent and will be converted into the right to
receive, upon the vesting thereof in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Andrew Stock Plan or the terms of the applicable award, (A) the
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the
number of shares of Andrew Common Stock to which such restricted stock units
(including performance stock units) relate multiplied by the stock portion of
the Election Merger Consideration, rounded down to the nearest whole number
of shares of Parent Common Stock and (B) that amount of cash equal to the
product of the number of shares of Andrew Common Stock to which such
restricted stock units (including performance stock units) relate multiplied
by the sum of the cash portion of the Election Merger Consideration and the
Cash Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent as of
the date hereof provided in the Andrew Stock Plans or the terms of
any restricted stock unit (including performance stock unit) award
agreement evidencing an award, each restricted stock unit (including each
performance stock unit) shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time in
exchange for a cash payment to the holder thereof in an amount equal to the
product of (A) the number of shares of Andrew Common Stock subject thereto
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) $15.00.

  

#### (iii) At the Effective Time, any share of Andrew Common Stock issued
under the Andrew Stock Plans with restrictions or limitations on transfer
with respect thereto shall be treated in accordance with the terms of the
respective Andrew Stock Plan under which such shares were issued, and the
shares of Parent Common Stock and cash issued in exchange for such Andrew
Common Stock hereunder shall have the same restrictions and limitations, if
any, as such shares of Andrew Common Stock exchanged therefor at the
Effective Time.

  

#### (iv) Andrews Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) will adopt
amendments to, or make determinations with respect to, the Andrew Stock Plan,
individual agreements evidencing the grant of Andrew Options, restricted
stock units (including performance stock units), any other awards under the
Andrew Stock Plans, and Andrew Benefit Plans (as defined in Section 4.9(a)),
if necessary, to implement the provisions of this Section 2.1(d)(iv).

  

### (e) _Fractional Shares_. If any Parent Common Stock is included in
the Election Merger Consideration, no fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock will be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder
of shares of Andrew Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive
a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be received by
such holder) shall, upon surrender of such holders Certificate(s), receive
from Parent an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without
interest, equal to the product of: (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the
Average Parent Common Stock Price.

  

### (f) _Adjustments to Exchange Ratio_. Notwithstanding any provision of
this Article II to the contrary (but without in any way limiting the
covenants in Section 5.1), the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to
reflect fully the appropriate effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Parent Common Stock or Andrew Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with respect to
Parent Common Stock or Andrew Common Stock having a record date on or after
the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

  

### (g) _Andrew Warrant and Andrew Notes_. At the Effective Time, (i) the
warrant, dated January 16, 2004, to purchase 1,000,000 shares of
Andrew Common Stock issued to TruePosition, Inc. (the " ** _Andrew Warrant_**
") shall become exercisable for the Merger Consideration in accordance with
its terms and (ii) all issued and outstanding 3 1/4% Convertible
Subordinated Notes Due 2013 (the " ** _Andrew Notes_** "), subject to the
indenture, dated August 8, 2003, between Andrew and BNY Midwest Trust Company
(the " ** _Andrew Indenture_** "), shall become convertible into the Merger
Consideration in accordance with the terms of the Andrew Indenture.

        

### (h) _Dissenting Shares_.

  

#### (i) Shares of Andrew Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by holders of
Andrew Common Stock who have not voted in favor of or consented to the Merger
and who have properly demanded and perfected their rights to be paid the fair
value of such shares of Andrew Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL (the " ** _Dissenting Shares_** ") shall not be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, and the holders thereof shall be
entitled to only such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL;
provided, however, that if any such stockholder of Andrew shall fail to
perfect or shall effectively waive, withdraw or lose such
stockholders rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, such stockholders shares
of Andrew Common Stock in respect of which the stockholder would otherwise be
entitled to receive fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon
be deemed to have been converted, at the Effective Time, into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration without any interest thereon.

  

#### (ii) Andrew will give Parent (x) prompt notice of any notice received by
Andrew of intent to demand the fair value of any shares of Andrew Common
Stock, withdrawals of such notices and any other instruments served pursuant
to Section 262 of the DGCL and received by Andrew and (y) the opportunity to
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to the exercise of
dissenters rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. Andrew shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to
any such exercise of dissenters rights or offer to settle or settle any such
rights.

  

## 2.2 _Exchange of Shares and Certificates_.

  

### (a) _Exchange Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
engage Mellon Investor Services, L.L.C. (or such other institution reasonably
satisfactory to Parent and Andrew) to act as exchange agent in connection
with the Merger (the " ** _Exchange Agent_** "), pursuant to an agreement
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and Andrew. Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust
for the benefit of the holders of shares of Andrew Common Stock, the
aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to
Section 2.1(a), if any Parent Common Stock is included in the Election Merger
Consideration, and an amount of cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash
Merger Consideration and cash portion of the Election Merger Consideration
payable pursuant to Section 2.1(a). In addition, Parent shall make available
by depositing with the Exchange Agent, as necessary from time to time after
the Effective Time as needed, cash in an amount sufficient to make
the payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and
any dividends or distributions to which holders of shares of Andrew Common
Stock may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c).  All shares of Parent
Common Stock and cash deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be
referred to as the " ** _Exchange Fund_**."

  

### (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of
a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding shares of Andrew Common Stock and that at the
Effective Time were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1 (the " ** _Certificates_** "), (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the
Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions payable
pursuant to Section 2.2(c). Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation
to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent,
the holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1, the cash portion, if any, of
the Election Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled to
pursuant to Section 2.1, the Cash Merger Consideration to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1, payment in lieu of fractional shares
which such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and any
dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c), and
the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of
a transfer of ownership of Andrew Common Stock which is not registered in the
transfer records of Andrew, the proper number of shares of Parent Common
Stock, if any, may be issued to, and the cash portion, if any, of the
Election Merger Consideration, the Cash Merger Consideration,

        

### payment in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends or distributions
payable may be paid to, a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person
requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock, payment of the
cash portion of the Election Merger Consideration and payment of the Cash
Merger Consideration, payment in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends
or distributions payable to a Person other than the registered holder of
such Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that
such tax has been paid or is not applicable.  Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.2(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration (and any amounts to be paid pursuant to Section 2.2(c))
upon such surrender.  No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any amount

such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person to whom such consideration would otherwise
have been paid.

  

### (h) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange
Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, such Merger Consideration as may be required pursuant to Section 2.1
and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c);

may reasonably direct as indemnity, against any claim that may be made
against Parent or the Exchange Agent in respect of the Certificates alleged
to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

not, when taken together with the fair market value of such total
consideration issued by Andrew in previously committed or consummated
transactions pursuant to this Section 5.1(b)(iv), exceed $25,000,000 in the
aggregate, (C) which does not present a material risk of delaying the Merger

or

  

#### (iii) authorize, or commit or agree to take, any of the foregoing
actions.

  

## 5.2 _Solicitation_.

  

### (a) The following terms will have the definitions set forth below:

following transactions: (i) any transaction or series of related transactions
with one or more third Persons involving: (A) any purchase from Andrew or
acquisition by any Person or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder) of more than a 20%
interest in the total outstanding voting securities of Andrew or any

securities of Andrew or any merger, consolidation or business combination
involving Andrew as a whole, or (B) any sale, lease (other than in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice), exchange,
transfer, license (other than in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice), acquisition or disposition of more than 20% of the
assets of Andrew (including equity securities of any Subsidiary of such

Andrew;

  

#### (ii) An " ** _Alternative Transaction Proposal_** " shall mean any offer
or proposal relating to an Alternative Transaction;

  

#### (iii) A " ** _Superior Proposal_** " means an unsolicited, bona fide,
written Alternative Transaction Proposal made by a third Person to acquire,
directly or indirectly, pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger,
consolidation or other business combination, (A) 50% or more of the assets of
Andrew on a consolidated basis or (B) 50% or more of the outstanding voting
securities of Andrew, and as a result of which, the

        

#### stockholders of Andrew immediately preceding such transaction would hold
less than 50% of the aggregate equity interests in the surviving or resulting
entity of such transaction (or its ultimate parent), which the Board of
Directors of Andrew has in good faith determined (taking into account, among
other things, (1) the advice of its outside legal counsel and its financial
adviser, and (2) all terms of such Alternative Transaction Proposal and this
Agreement (as it may be proposed to be amended by Parent)), to be more
favorable to Andrews stockholders (in their capacities as stockholders) than
the terms of this Agreement (as it may be proposed to be amended by Parent)
and to be reasonably capable of being consummated on the terms proposed,
taking into account all other legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects
of such Alternative Transaction Proposal and the Person making such
Alternative Transaction Proposal including, if such Alternative Transaction
Proposal involves any financing, the likelihood of obtaining such financing
and the terms on which such financing may be secured.

  

### (b) Andrew shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, or
authorize or permit any of its officers, directors or employees or any
investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other
representative retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way of
furnishing any information), or take any other action intended to facilitate,
induce or encourage, any inquiries with respect to, or the making, submission
or announcement of, any Alternative Transaction Proposal, (ii) participate in
any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any
information with respect to, any, or any possible, Alternative Transaction
Proposal (except (A) to disclose the existence of the provisions of this
Section 5.2, or (B) to the extent specifically permitted pursuant to Section
5.2(d)), (iii) approve, endorse or recommend any Alternative Transaction
(except to the extent specifically permitted pursuant to Section 5.3), or
(iv) enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any contract,
agreement or commitment contemplating or otherwise relating to any possible
or proposed Alternative Transaction Proposal. Andrew and each of its
Subsidiaries will immediately cease, and will cause their officers, directors
and employees and any investment banker, financial adviser, attorney,
accountant or other representative retained by it to cease, any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any third Persons
conducted heretofore with respect to any possible or proposed Alternative
Transaction, and will use its reasonable best efforts to enforce (and not
waive any provisions of) any confidentiality agreement (or any similar
agreement) relating to any such possible or proposed Alternative Transaction.

  

### (c) As promptly as practicable (and in any event within 48 hours) after
receipt of any Alternative Transaction Proposal or any request for nonpublic
information or any inquiry relating to any Alternative Transaction Proposal,
Andrew shall provide Parent with oral and written notice of the material
terms and conditions of such Alternative Transaction Proposal, request or
inquiry, and the identity of the Person or group making any such Alternative
Transaction Proposal, request or inquiry. In addition, Andrew shall provide
Parent as promptly as practicable with oral and written notice setting forth
all such information as is reasonably necessary to keep Parent informed in
all material respects of all material developments regarding the status
and terms (including material amendments or proposed material amendments) of,
any such Alternative Transaction Proposal, request or inquiry, and,
without limitation of the other provisions of this Section 5.2, shall
promptly provide to Parent a copy of all written materials (including written
materials provided by e-mail or otherwise in electronic format) subsequently
provided by or to it in connection with such Alternative Transaction
Proposal, request or inquiry. Andrew shall provide Parent with 48 hours
prior notice (or such lesser prior notice as is provided to the members of
its Board of Directors) of any meeting of its Board of Directors at which its
Board of Directors is reasonably likely to consider any such Alternative
Transaction Proposal or Alternative Transaction.

  

### (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.2(b),
in the event that Andrew receives an unsolicited, bona fide Alternative
Transaction Proposal which is determined by its Board of Directors to be, or
to be reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal, it may then take the
following actions (but only (1) if and to the extent that (x) its Board of
Directors concludes in good faith, after receipt of advice of its outside
legal counsel, that the failure to do so is reasonably likely to result in a
breach of its fiduciary obligations to its stockholders under Applicable Law
and (y) Andrew has given Parent at least three business days prior written
notice of its intention to take any of the following actions and of the
identity of the Person or group making such Superior Proposal and the
material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and (2) if it shall
not have breached in any material respect any of the provisions of this
Section 5.2):

   

31  

   

#### (i) furnish nonpublic information to the Person or group making such
Superior Proposal, _provided_ that (A) prior to furnishing any such nonpublic
information, it receives from such Person or group an
executed confidentiality agreement containing terms at least as restrictive
as the terms contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (except that such
confidentiality agreement need not include a standstill), dated as of April
3, 2007, between Andrew and Parent (together with the Confidentiality
Agreement, dated as of May 17, 2007, between Parent and Andrew, the " **
_Confidentiality Agreements_** "), and (B) contemporaneously with furnishing
any such nonpublic information to such Person or group, it furnishes such
nonpublic information to Parent (to the extent such nonpublic information has
not been previously so furnished to Parent); and

  

#### (ii) engage in negotiations with such Person or group with respect to
such Superior Proposal; _provided, however_ , in no event shall Andrew enter
into any definitive agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement as
permitted hereunder) to effect such Superior Proposal unless the Board of
Directors of Andrew approves a Superior Proposal in accordance with Section
5.3 and authorizes Andrew to enter into a binding written agreement with
respect to that Superior Proposal and, in connection with the termination of
this Agreement and entering into the agreement reflecting the
Superior Proposal, pays to Parent in immediately available funds the
Termination Fee required to be paid by Section 8.3(a)(v).

  

### (e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Andrew or its
Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to Andrews stockholders a
position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or making any disclosure required by Applicable Law.

  

## 5.3 _Board of Directors Recommendation_.

  

### (a) In response to the receipt of an unsolicited, bona fide Alternative
Transaction Proposal which is determined by the Board of Directors of Andrew
to be a Superior Proposal, Andrews Board of Directors may withhold,
withdraw, amend or modify its recommendation in favor of approval and
adoption of this Agreement and the Merger and may approve or recommend to its
shareholders any Superior Proposal (any of the foregoing actions, whether by
a Board of Directors or a committee thereof, a " ** _Change of
Recommendation_** ") if the Board of Directors of Andrew has concluded in
good faith, after receipt of advice of its outside legal counsel, that, in
light of such Superior Proposal, the failure of the Board of Directors to
effect a Change of Recommendation is reasonably likely to result in a breach
of its fiduciary obligations to its stockholders under Applicable Law.

  

### (b) Prior to announcing any Change of Recommendation pursuant to Section
5.3(a), Andrew shall (A) provide to Parent three business days prior written
notice which shall (x) state expressly that it intends to effect a Change of
Recommendation and (y) describe any modifications to the material terms and
conditions of the Superior Proposal and the identity of the Person or group
making the Superior Proposal from the description of such terms and
conditions and such Person contained in the notice required under Section
5.2(d), (B) make available to Parent all materials and information made
available to the Person or group making the Superior Proposal in connection
with such Superior Proposal, and (C) during the three business-day period
commencing upon receipt of the notice described in Section 5.3(b)(A), if
requested by Parent, engage in good faith negotiations to amend this
Agreement in such a manner that the Alternative Transaction Proposal which
was determined to be a Superior Proposal no longer is a Superior Proposal.

  

### (c) In addition to the circumstances set forth in Section 5.3(a), the
Board of Directors of Andrew may effect a Change of Recommendation (but only
insofar as the same involves withholding, withdrawing, amending or modifying
its recommendation in favor of the approval and adoption of this Agreement
and the Merger) if there shall have occurred and be continuing any other
event, occurrence or circumstance as a result of which, in the good faith
judgment of the Board of Directors of Andrew, after consultation with outside
counsel of Andrew, the failure to effect a Change in Recommendation would
violate the fiduciary duties of the Andrew Board of Directors to Andrews
stockholders under Applicable Law.

  

### (d) If the Board of Directors of Andrew has effected a Change of
Recommendation, Andrew shall promptly notify Parent in writing of such Change
in Recommendation, including the specific subparagraph, but not more than one
subparagraph, of Section 5.3 in reliance upon which such Change in
Recommendation is made.

        

### If Parent thereafter terminates this Agreement in accordance with Section
8.1 based upon such notice, then the termination effects with respect to the
specific subparagraph identified in such notice that are set forth in Section
8.3 shall apply.

  

## 5.4 _Control of Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall be construed to give Parent, directly or indirectly, the
right to control or direct Andrews operations or give Andrew, directly
or indirectly, the right to control or direct Parents operations, in each
case, prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of
Parent and Andrew shall exercise, on the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its respective
operations.

  

 **Article VI**

  

# **Additional Agreements**

  

## 6.1 _Preparation of SEC Documents; Stockholders  Meeting_.

  

### (a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Andrew
and Parent shall agree upon the terms of, prepare and file with the SEC the
Proxy Statement, and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC the Form S-4,
in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each
of Andrew and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have the
Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing. Andrew will use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to Andrews stockholders as
promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the
Securities Act.  Parent shall also take any action (other than qualifying to
do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or to
file a general consent to service of process) reasonably required to be taken
under any applicable state securities laws in connection with the Parent
Share Issuance, and Andrew shall furnish all information concerning Andrew
and the holders of Andrew Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in
connection with any such action. Each party shall cooperate and provide the
other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any
amendment or supplement to the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement or any filing
with the SEC incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or the
Proxy Statement, in each case prior to filing such with the SEC, except where
doing so would cause the filing to not be filed timely, without regard to
any extension pursuant to Rule 12b-25 of the Exchange Act; _provided,
however_ , that each party shall be deemed to have consented to the inclusion
in the Form S-4, the Proxy Statement or any filing with the SEC incorporated
by reference in the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement of any information,
language or content specifically agreed to by such party or its counsel on or
prior to the date hereof for inclusion therein. Parent will advise Andrew
promptly after it receives notice of (i) the time when the Form S-4
has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, (ii)
the issuance or threat of any stop order, (iii) the suspension of the
qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with this
Agreement for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or (iv) any request by
the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 or comments
thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional
information. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information
(including any Change of Recommendation) relating to Andrew or Parent, or any
of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered
by Andrew or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to any of the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party
which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement, including, where
appropriate, a filing pursuant to Rules 165 and 425 of the Securities Act,
describing such information shall promptly be filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by law, disseminated to the stockholders of Andrew.

  

### (b) Andrew shall, as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is
declared effective under the Securities Act, take all action necessary in
accordance with Applicable Law and the Andrew Organizational Documents to
duly give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders to be
held as promptly as practicable to consider the approval and adoption of this
Agreement and the Merger (the " ** _Andrew Stockholders  Meeting_**"). Except
in the case of a Change of Recommendation in accordance with Section 5.3,
Andrew will use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from its
stockholders proxies in favor of the approval and adoption of this Agreement
and the Merger and will take all other action reasonably necessary or
advisable to secure the vote or

        

### consent of its stockholders required by the rules of NASDAQ or Applicable
Law to obtain such approvals. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, Andrew may adjourn or postpone the
Andrew Stockholders Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any
necessary supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to its
stockholders in advance of a vote on the adoption and approval of this
Agreement and the Merger or, if, as of the time for which the Andrew
Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares
of Andrew Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting.
 Andrew shall use commercially reasonable efforts such that the
Andrew Stockholders Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and
conducted, and that all proxies solicited in connection with the Andrew
Stockholders Meeting are solicited in compliance with Applicable Law, the
rules of the NASDAQ and the Andrew Organizational Documents.  Without the
prior written consent of Parent, the approval and adoption of this Agreement
and the Merger is the only matter which Andrew shall propose to be acted on
by Andrews stockholders at the Andrew Stockholders Meeting.

  

### (c) Andrew will use commercially reasonable efforts to hold the Andrew
Stockholders Meeting as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of
this Agreement, subject to the requirements of Instruction D.3 to Schedule
14A (Rule 14a-101) promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  

### (d) Except to the extent expressly permitted by Section 5.3: (i) the
Board of Directors of Andrew shall recommend that its stockholders vote in
favor of the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger at the
Andrew Stockholders Meeting, (ii) the Proxy Statement shall include a
statement to the effect that the Board of Directors of Andrew has recommended
that Andrews stockholders vote in favor of approval and adoption of this
Agreement and the Merger at the Andrew Stockholders Meeting, and (iii)
neither the Board of Directors of Andrew nor any committee thereof shall
withdraw, amend or modify, or propose or resolve to withdraw, amend or modify
in a manner adverse to the other party, the recommendation of its respective
Board of Directors that the stockholders of Andrew vote in favor of the
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger.

  

### (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if Parent
shall have determined, by irrevocable written notice to Andrew, not to
include any Parent Common Stock in the Election Merger Consideration, Parent
shall have no obligation to file or have declared effective the Form S-4 with
the SEC.

  

## 6.2 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

  

### (a) Subject to the Confidentiality Agreements and Applicable Law, each of
Andrew and Parent shall, and shall cause each of its respective Subsidiaries
to, afford to the other party and to the officers, employees, accountants,
counsel, financial advisors and other representatives of such other party,
reasonable access during normal business hours during the period prior to the
Effective Time to all their respective properties, books, contracts,
commitments, personnel and records (provided that such access shall not
interfere with the business or operations of such party) and, during such
period, each of Andrew and Parent shall, and shall cause each of its
respective Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to the other party (a) a copy of
each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it
during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state
securities laws and (b) all other information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as such other party may reasonably request. No
review pursuant to this Section 6.2 shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty contained herein, the covenants or agreements of
the parties hereto or the conditions to the obligations of the parties hereto
under this Agreement. Between the date hereof and Closing, Andrew and its
Subsidiaries shall afford Parent and its authorized
representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable notice, to the Real Property to conduct such activities as are
necessary to consummate the Merger (including to satisfy requirements of
lenders that will provide financing for the Merger) only, and for no other
purposes, provided that any such investigations shall be conducted in such a
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the normal operations of Andrew
and its Subsidiaries.

  

### (b) Andrew agrees to deliver to Parent as soon as is reasonably
practicable, to the extent in the possession or control of Andrew or its
Subsidiaries, true and correct copies of the most recent title insurance
policy (or if none, title opinion, title certificate or other equivalent
evidence of title) and most recent survey for each Owned Real Property and
any lease agreements regarding the Real Property to which it is a party.

        

### (c) Each of Andrew and Parent will hold, and will cause its respective
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other
representatives and Affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information received
from the other party in confidence in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreements.

  

### (d) If, on the date that is five business days before the date that the
parties obligations under the Confidentiality Agreements terminate, (i) the
Effective Time has not occurred and (ii) this Agreement has not been
terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, then the parties shall amend the
Confidentiality Agreements to extend the term of each partys obligations
under the Confidentiality Agreements to the earlier of (A) the Effective Time
and (B) the date on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
8.1.

  

## 6.3 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_.

  

### (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done,
and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including commercially reasonable efforts to
accomplish the following: (i) the taking of all acts necessary to cause the
conditions to the Closing to be satisfied (but in no event shall a party be
required to waive any such condition) as promptly as practicable, (ii) the
obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents,
clearances and approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all
necessary registrations and filings, including all filings required by the
HSR Act (the initial filing required by the HSR Act to be filed as soon as
reasonably practicable, but in any event within 15 days, following the
execution of this Agreement) and any applicable antitrust, competition
or similar laws of any foreign jurisdiction, and the taking of all steps as
may be necessary to obtain an approval, clearance or waiver from, or to avoid
an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (iii) the obtaining of
all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iv) the
defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including seeking to have any
stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other
Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, and (v) the execution and delivery
of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement.
In furtherance of the covenants contained in Sections 6.3(a)(ii) and
6.3(a)(iv), Parent and Andrew shall, if required by one or more Governmental
Entities acting pursuant to any applicable antitrust, competition or similar
laws to obtain any of the actions or nonactions, waivers, consents,
clearances, approvals, or avoidance of actions or proceedings referred to in
Sections 6.3(a)(ii), or pursuant to Section 6.3(a)(iv) or if required by a
federal, state or foreign court, agree to the divestiture by Parent, Andrew
or any of their respective Subsidiaries of shares of capital stock or of any
business, assets or property of Parent or its Subsidiaries or Andrew or its
Subsidiaries and the imposition of any limitation on the ability of Parent or
its Subsidiaries or Andrew or its Subsidiaries to conduct their
respective businesses or to own or exercise control of their respective
assets, properties and stock (including licenses, hold separate agreements,
covenants affecting business operating practices or similar matters) if such
divestitures and limitations, individually or in the aggregate, would not be
reasonably expected to result in the loss of annualized revenue of Parent and
Andrew on a combined consolidated basis of more than $225,000,000.  Subject
to Applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information and in addition to
Section 6.3(b), Parent and Andrew, or their respective counsel, shall have
the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will
consult the other on, all the information relating to Parent and
its Subsidiaries or Andrew and its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that
appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third
party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

### (b) Subject to Applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information,
each of Andrew and Parent shall keep the other reasonably apprised of the
status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated
hereby and work cooperatively in connection with obtaining all required
approvals, consents or clearances of any Governmental Entity (whether
domestic, foreign or supranational). In that regard, each party shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) promptly notify the other of, and
if in writing, furnish the other with copies of (or, in the case of material
oral communications, advise the other orally of) any communications from or
with any Governmental Entity (whether domestic, foreign or supranational)
with respect to the Merger or any of the

        

### other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) permit the other
to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the
other in connection with, any proposed written (or any material proposed
oral) communication with any such Governmental Entity, (iii) not participate
in any meeting with any such Governmental Entity unless it consults with the
other in advance and to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity
gives the other the opportunity to attend and participate thereat, (iv)
furnish the other with copies of all correspondence, filings and
communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between it
and any such Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement and the
Merger, and (v) furnish the other with such necessary information
and reasonable assistance as Andrew or Parent may reasonably request in
connection with its preparation of necessary filings or submissions of
information to any such Governmental Entity. Each of Andrew and Parent shall
designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other under
this Section 6.3 as "outside counsel only." Such material and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of the
recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers, or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained
in advance from the source of the materials (Andrew or Parent, as the case
may be) or its legal counsel.

  

### (c) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, Andrew and
Parent shall (i) take all action necessary to ensure that no state takeover
statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) if any
state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, take all
action necessary to ensure that such transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms required by, or provided for, in this
Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation
on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

## 6.4 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

  

### (a) Immediately after the Effective Time, the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation will contain
provisions with respect to exculpation and indemnification that are at least
as favorable to the present and former officers and directors of Andrew and
its Subsidiaries (each an " ** _Indemnified Party_** ") as those contained in
the Andrew Charter and the Andrew By-laws as in effect on the date
hereof, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified
for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who, immediately prior
to the Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees or agents of
Andrew, unless such modification is required by law.  Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Party
against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines
and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and
disbursements incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of actions taken by them in their capacity as officers or
directors at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby), or taken by them at
the request of Andrew, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after
the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law for
a period of six years after the Effective Time. Each Indemnified Party shall
be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation from the Surviving Corporation
within ten Business Days of receipt by the Surviving Corporation from the
Indemnified Party of a request therefor; _provided, however_ , that any
Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not
entitled to indemnification.  Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any
proceeding or threatened action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim in
which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder,
without the consent of such Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, unless such settlement,
compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified
Party from all liability arising out of such action, suit, proceeding,
investigation or claim.

  

### (b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall purchase a directors and
officers and fiduciary liability insurance policy providing coverage for a
period of at least six years following the Effective Time for persons who
were officers and/or directors of Andrew prior to the Effective Time for
claims arising after the

        

### Effective Time from facts or events which occurred at or prior to the
Effective Time, and in each case, which policy shall provide for at least the
same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are not less
advantageous than the respective policies of Andrew, as in place at the
Effective Time; _provided, however_ , that in no event will Parent be
required to expend in any year an amount in excess of 250% of the annual
aggregate premiums currently paid by Andrew for such insurance (the " **
_Maximum Premium_** "). If such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at
all, or can only be obtained at an annual premium in excess of the Maximum
Premium, Parent will cause to be maintained the most advantageous policies of
directors and officers insurance obtainable for an annual premium equal to
the Maximum Premium.

  

### (c) In the event that Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing
or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision will be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 6.4.

  

### (d) The provisions of this Section 6.4 are intended for the benefit of,
and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and
representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Indemnified
Party may have had by contract or otherwise.

  

## 6.5 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 6.5
and in Section 8.3, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with
the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses
(including Andrews fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
printing and mailing of the Proxy Statement to its shareholders), whether or
not the Merger is consummated,  _provided_ that Andrew shall pay any
foreign, state or local real estate transfer or similar taxes imposed on the
stockholders of Andrew as a result of the transactions contemplated in
this Agreement. Parent and Andrew shall each bear one-half of the filing
fees required by the HSR Act and any antitrust, competition or similar laws
of any foreign jurisdiction. Parent shall bear the fee to the SEC for
the Form S-4 (including any amendments thereto).

  

## 6.6 _Announcements_. Parent and Andrew will consult with each other before
issuing, and will provide each other the opportunity to review, comment upon
and concur with, and use commercially reasonable efforts to agree on, any
press release, public statements or other announcements with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any announcement
to employees, customers, suppliers or others having dealings with Parent
or Andrew, respectively, or similar publicity with respect to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall not issue any
such press release or make any such public statement or other announcement
prior to such consultation, _except_ as either party may determine is
required by Applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange or stock market.

  

## 6.7 _Listing_. Parent shall use all reasonable best efforts to cause the
Parent Common Stock issuable under Article II and those shares of Parent
Common Stock required to be reserved for issuance under the Andrew
Stock Plans, the Andrew Warrant and the Andrew Indenture to be authorized for
listing on the NYSE, upon notice of issuance, exercise or conversion, as
applicable.

  

## 6.8 _Conveyance Taxes_. Parent and Andrew shall cooperate in
the preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires,
applications or other documents regarding any real property transfer, sales,
use, transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp taxes, any transfer,
recording, registration and other fees or any similar taxes which become
payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that are required or permitted to be filed on or before the Effective Time,
and any such taxes shall be paid one-half by Parent and one-half by Andrew.

        

## 6.9 _Employee Benefits_.

  

### (a) For one year following the Effective Time (the " ** _Continuation
Period_** "), with respect to each country in which Andrew has an employee
workforce, Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to the employee
workforce of the Surviving Corporation and the other members of the employee
workforce of any other Affiliate of Parent who were employees of Andrew or
any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (" **
_Continuing Employees_** "), employee benefits that, in the aggregate, are no
less favorable than the employee benefits package provided by Andrew to the
Continuing Employees in such country by Andrew or any of its Subsidiaries;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that, subject to Applicable Law, if Parent has an
employee workforce in such country, Parent may, in lieu thereof, provide to
the Continuing Employees the benefits package offered to Parents employee
workforce in such country immediately prior to the execution of this
Agreement; and, _provided, further,_ that with respect to equity based
compensation, Parent shall have no obligation to provide equity awards to the
Continuing Employees during the Continuation Period covering a number of
shares of Parent Common Stock in excess of the number of shares of Andrew
Common Stock available under the 2000 Management Incentive Program and/or
2005 Long Term Incentive Plan of Andrew as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time (as appropriately adjusted to reflect the Merger).
 Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.9(a) to the contrary,
each employee of Andrew or any of its Subsidiaries, other than any director
or officer of Andrew, who is covered and eligible for benefits under an
Andrew Domestic Benefit Plan that provides for payment of cash severance
benefits upon certain employment termination shall, upon termination of
employment within one year following the Effective Time, receive the
severance benefits provided by the Andrew Domestic Benefit Plans applicable
to non-officer and non-director employees (including, without limitation, the
Allen Telecom, Inc. Key Employee Severance Policy and the Andrew Employee
Severance Plan effective May 1, 2007) or, if the cash severance payments
would be higher under a severance plan maintained by Parent or its Affiliates
(other than Andrew and its Subsidiaries) applicable to non-officer and non-
director employees, such plan of Parent or its Affiliates. From and after the
Effective Time, Parent and its Affiliates shall continue, and shall cause the
Surviving Entity to continue, the Allen Telecom, Inc. Key Employee Severance
Policy in accordance with its terms in effect on the date hereof until it is
amended or terminated in accordance with the provisions of the policy,
including (without limitation) the consent requirement described in Section
II of the policy.

  

### (b) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall recognize (or cause to be
recognized) the service of each Continuing Employee with Andrew or any of its
Subsidiaries for purposes of (i) eligibility and vesting under any Parent
Benefit Plan, (ii) determination of benefits levels under any vacation or
severance Parent Benefit Plan and (iii) determination of "retiree" status
under any Parent Benefit Plan, for which the Continuing Employee is otherwise
eligible and in which the Continuing Employee is offered participation, in
each case _except _ where such crediting would result in a duplication of
benefits or such service would not be recognized for a similarly situated
employee of Parent or one of its subsidiaries. To the extent Parent
establishes or designates a Parent Benefit Plan to provide group health
benefits to Continuing Employees, (x) Parent shall, with respect to each such
Parent Benefit Plan, waive pre-existing condition limitations with respect to
Continuing Employees to the same extent waived or no longer applicable under
the applicable group health plan of Andrew and (y) each Continuing Employee
shall be given credit under the applicable Parent Benefit Plan for amounts
paid under the corresponding group health plan of Andrew or an Affiliate
during the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of
applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums for such
plan year.

  

### (c) As of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall assume all
rights (including the rights to modify in accordance with their terms) under
and agree to perform in accordance with their terms (i) all
employment, severance and other compensation agreements and arrangements
existing as of the date hereof (and provided to Parent by Andrew prior to the
date hereof) between Andrew or any of its Subsidiaries and any director,
officer or employee thereof, and (ii) any such agreements or arrangements
entered into after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time by Andrew
or any of its Subsidiaries in compliance with the terms of this Agreement.

  

### (d) For a period not less than one year following the Effective Time,
Parent and its Affiliates shall maintain, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to maintain, each Andrew Domestic Benefit Plan that is a Welfare
Plan providing benefits to retirees and other current and future former
employees of Andrew (and their respective spouses and dependents) in
accordance with the terms of each such plan (including cost sharing feature)
as in effect immediately prior to the date hereof.

        

### (e) Andrew shall, if requested to do so by Parent and if permitted by
Applicable Law, take any action required to terminate its defined
contribution 401(k) plan, such termination to be effective immediately prior
to and conditioned upon the Effective Time; provided, however, that Andrew
shall be permitted to authorize a profit sharing contribution to such plan
for 2007 for allocation to eligible employees in an amount equal to the
lesser of (x) 3.5% of the adjusted pre-tax income of Andrew and its
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis and (y) $5,400,000 and further provided
that nothing in this Section 6.9(e) shall be construed as requiring Andrew to
make plan termination distributions or otherwise wind up its 401(k) plan
prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall provide, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to provide, that each Continuing Employee who is
a participant in Andrews 401(k) plan shall be given the opportunity to
"roll over" his or her account balance (including any promissory note
evidencing an outstanding loan) from the terminated plan to a tax-qualified
defined contribution plan maintained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation.

  

### (f) Without limiting the generality of Section 9.7, nothing in this
Agreement will be construed to create a right in any employee of Andrew or
any Subsidiary to employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
other Subsidiary of Parent or grant or create any right in any employee or
beneficiary of such employee under an Parent Benefit Plan or an Andrew
Benefit Plan, nor shall anything is this Agreement be deemed to constitute an
amendment of any Andrew Benefit Plan.

  

## 6.10 _Consents of Accountants_. Andrew and Parent will each use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to each
other consents from their respective independent auditors, dated the date on
which the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, is amended or supplemented, and
becomes effective or a date not more than two days prior to each such date,
in form reasonably satisfactory to the recipient and customary in scope and
substance for consents delivered by independent public accountants in
connection with registration statements on Form S-4 under the Securities Act.

  

## 6.11 _Financing_.

  

### (a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange debt financing for the purpose of funding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " ** _Debt Financing_**
") so as to close within the time period provided in Section 1.2 hereof.
Parent shall keep Andrew informed on a reasonably current basis of the status
of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing.

  

### (b) Andrew shall provide to Parent all cooperation reasonably requested
by Parent that is reasonably necessary and customary in connection with the
Debt Financing (provided that such requested cooperation shall not
unreasonably interfere with the operation of the business of Andrew or
require Andrew to take any action Andrew reasonably believes to be
inconsistent with Applicable Laws and provided further that Andrew shall not
be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other
cost, expense or liability that is not simultaneously reimbursed by Parent in
connection with the Debt Financing or any of the actions contemplated by this
Section 6.11 prior to the Closing), including:

  

#### (i) participating in a reasonable number of customary meetings,
presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and
sessions with rating agencies;

  

#### (ii) assisting Parent with the preparation of materials for rating
agency presentations and offering documents (including private placement
memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents)
necessary and customary in connection with the Debt Financing; provided, that
any private placement memoranda or prospectuses in relation to high yield
debt securities need not be issued by Andrew or any of its Subsidiaries;
provided further, that any such memoranda or prospectuses shall contain
disclosure and financial statements with respect to Andrew or the Surviving
Corporation reflecting the Surviving Corporation and/or its Subsidiaries as
the obligor;

  

#### (iii) assisting Parent with the preparation of all financial statements
and financial data of the type required by Regulation S-X (provided that
information required by Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X

        

#### may be in summary form) and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act
(without giving effect to the executive compensation and related person
disclosure rules related to SEC Release Nos. 33-8732A; 34-54302A; IC-27444A);

  

#### (iv) furnishing Parent with financial and other pertinent information
regarding Andrew as may be reasonably requested by Parent to consummate the
Debt Financing, including all financial statements and financial data
reasonably required to consummate the Debt Financing if such offering were
registered under the Securities Act and of the type and form customarily
included in private placements under Rule 144A of the Securities Act and the
financial data required by Item 3-01 of Regulation S-K under the Securities
Act;

  

#### (v) using reasonable best efforts to assist Parent in procuring
accountants comfort letters and consents, payoff letters, lien releases,
legal opinions, surveys and title insurance as reasonably requested by
Parent;

  

#### (vi) providing and executing customary officers certificates and other
similar documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent so long as no such
document is effective until the occurrence of the Closing;

  

#### (vii) using reasonable best efforts to cooperate with the marketing
efforts of Parent and its financing sources for any Debt Financing to be
raised by Parent to complete the transactions contemplated hereby;

  

#### (viii) executing and delivering definitive financing documentation and
delivering collateral for the Debt Financing, all effective at the Effective
Time; and

  

#### (ix) taking all corporate actions, subject to the occurrence of the
Closing, reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the consummation
of the Debt Financing.

  

### (c) The parties acknowledge that the active participation and assistance
of appropriate members of management of Andrew will be necessary in order to
enable Parent to create an offering memorandum or bank memorandum for any
bond offering or bank credit facility that is part of the Debt Financing.
 Andrew will endeavor to make such individuals reasonably available
to Parent for the purpose described in the preceding sentence to an
extent generally consistent with the availability that would reasonably be
expected in other comparable companies operating under a similar timetable.

  

### (d) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding Andrew
obtained by Parent pursuant to this Section 6.11 shall be kept confidential
in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreements.

  

### (e) Parent shall, promptly upon request by Andrew, reimburse Andrew for
all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by Andrew or its
Subsidiaries in connection with their respective cooperation pursuant to this
Section 6.11 and shall indemnify and hold harmless Andrew, its Subsidiaries
and their respective representatives for and against any and all losses
suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith (other than in
respect of any actions or omissions of Andrew, its Subsidiaries and its
Affiliates  which constitute willful misconduct or gross negligence or
any information provided by Andrew or its Subsidiaries).

  

### (f) Parent acknowledges and agrees that consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is not conditional upon the receipt by Parent
of the proceeds of the Financing Commitments and that any failure by Parent
to consummate the Merger on the Closing Date, _provided_ , that at such time
the conditions to Closing set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 are satisfied,
shall constitute a breach by Parent of this Agreement.

  

## 6.12 _Affiliate Legends_. Section 6.12 of the Andrew Disclosure
Letter sets forth a list of those Persons who are, in Andrews reasonable
judgment, "affiliates" of Andrew within the meaning of Rule 145 promulgated
under the Securities Act (" ** _Rule 145 Affiliates_** "). Andrew shall notify
Parent in writing regarding any change in the identity of its Rule 145
Affiliates prior to the Closing Date. Parent shall be entitled to issue
appropriate stop transfer

        

## instructions to the transfer agent for Parent Common Stock (provided that
such legends or stop transfer instructions shall be removed one year after
the Effective Time upon the request of any holder of shares of Parent Common
Stock issued in the Merger if such holder is not then a Rule 145 Affiliate).

  

## 6.13 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Andrew shall give prompt notice
to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to Andrew, of the occurrence,
or failure to occur, of any event, which is in Andrews or
Parents Knowledge, as applicable, and as to which the occurrence or failure
to occur would reasonably be likely to result in the failure of any of the
conditions set forth in Article VII to be satisfied.  Each of the parties
shall give prompt written notice to the other party of any material
correction to any of the Parent SEC Documents or the Andrew SEC Documents, as
the case may be, from and after the date hereof. Notwithstanding the above,
the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.13 will not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such
notice or the conditions to such partys obligation to consummate the Merger.

  

## 6.14 _Section 16 Matters_.

  

### (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Andrews Board of Directors, or an
appropriate committee of non-employee directors of Andrew, shall, if
necessary, adopt a resolution consistent with the SECs interpretive guidance
to approve the disposition by any officer or director of Andrew who is a
"covered person" of Andrew for the purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act
of Andrew Common Stock or Andrew Stock Options pursuant to this Agreement and
the Merger for the purposes of qualifying the disposition as an exempt
transaction under Section 16 of the Exchange Act.

  

### (b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parents Board of Directors, or an
appropriate committee of non-employee directors of Parent, shall, if
necessary, adopt a resolution consistent with the SECs interpretive guidance
to approve the acquisition by any officer or director of Andrew who will
become a "covered person" of Parent for the purposes of Section 16 of the
Exchange Act of Parent Common Stock or Parent Stock Options pursuant to this
Agreement and the Merger for the purposes of qualifying the acquisition as an
exempt transaction under Section 16 of the Exchange Act.

  

## 6.15 _State Takeover Laws_.

  

### (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Andrew shall not take any action to
render inapplicable, or to exempt any third Person from, any state takeover
law or state law that purports to limit or restrict business combinations or
the ability to acquire or vote shares of capital stock unless (i) required to
do so by order of a court of competent jurisdiction or (ii) Andrews Board of
Directors has concluded in good faith, after receipt of advice of its outside
legal counsel, that, in light of a Superior Proposal with respect to it, the
failure to take such action is reasonably likely to result in a breach of its
Board of Directors fiduciary obligations to its stockholders under
Applicable Law.

  

## 6.16 _Reservation of Parent Common Stock_. Effective at or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall reserve out of its reserved but unissued shares
of Parent Common Stock sufficient shares of Parent Common Stock to provide
for (i) the issuance of Parent Common Stock as part of the Election Merger
Consideration, if applicable, (ii) the issuance of Parent Common Stock upon
the exercise of the Andrew Options, (iii) the issuance of Parent Common Stock

## 8.3 _Payments_.

  

### (a) _Payment by Andrew_.

  

#### (i) In the event that (A) this Agreement is terminated by Andrew or
Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i) or 8.1(b)(iii), (B) following the date
hereof and prior to such termination, any Person shall have made to Andrew or
its stockholders, or publicly announced, a proposal, offer or indication of
interest relating to any " ** _Acquisition_** " ("Acquisition" shall have the

such termination, any Person shall have made to Andrew or its stockholders,
or publicly announced, a proposal, offer or indication of interest relating
to an Alternative Transaction with respect to Andrew and (C) Andrews breach
is willful or intentional and intended to facilitate, assist or otherwise
benefit, or such breach has the effect of facilitating or assisting or
otherwise benefiting, an Alternative Transaction or the Person making such
Alternative Transaction, then Andrew shall pay Parent the Termination Fee in
immediately available funds, such payment to be made within two business days
of such termination.  Any breach

        

#### of the covenants contained in Section 5.2 shall be considered willful,
intentional and intended to facilitate, assist or otherwise benefit an
Alternative Transaction.

  

#### (iii) In the event that (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent
pursuant to Section 8.1(e) and (B) the Board of Directors of Andrew has
effected a Change of Recommendation as permitted by and in compliance with

termination, any Person shall have made to Andrew or its stockholders, or

Section 8.3 shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to

the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these
agreements, the other party hereto would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if Andrew fails to pay in a timely manner the amounts due
pursuant to this Section 8.3 and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
makes a claim that results in a judgment against Andrew, Andrew shall pay to
Parent its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amounts set forth in this Section 8.3 at the rate of interest
per annum publicly announced by Bank of America, N.A. as its prime rate at

payment was required to be made. This entire Section 8.3 shall survive any
termination of this Agreement.

may be amended by the parties in writing at any time before or after the
Andrew Stockholder Approval; _provided, however_ , that after the Andrew
Stockholder Approval, there may not be, without further approval of the
stockholders of Andrew, any amendment of this Agreement that changes the
amount or the form of the consideration to be delivered to the holders of
Andrew Common Stock hereunder, or which by law or NASDAQ rule otherwise
expressly requires the further approval of such stockholders. This Agreement
may not be amended _except_ by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
each of the parties hereto and duly approved by the parties respective
Boards of Directors or a duly designated committee thereof.

  

## 8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, a party
may, subject to the proviso of Section 8.4 (and for this purpose treating any
waiver referred to below as an amendment), (a) extend the time for
the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties,
(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the
other parties contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered
pursuant to this Agreement or (c) waive compliance by the other party with
any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any
agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
party.  Any extension or waiver given in compliance with this Section 8.5
or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with
respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

disclosure letter (the " ** _Andrew Disclosure Letter_** "). Each Disclosure
Letter sets forth items of disclosure with specific reference to the
particular Section or subsection of this Agreement to which the information
in such Disclosure Letter relates; _provided, however_ , that any
information set forth in one section of a Disclosure Letter will be deemed to
apply to each other Section or subsection of this Agreement to which its
relevance is reasonably apparent; _provided_ , further, that,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the inclusion of
an item in such section of the Disclosure Letter as an exception to a
representation or warranty will not be deemed an admission that such
item represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance
or that such item has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent or Andrew, as appropriate.

  

## 9.6 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or

provisions of Article II (which are intended to benefit the holders of Andrew

rights or remedies.

that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflict of laws
thereof.

personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such

invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect, insofar as the foregoing
can be accomplished without materially affecting the economic benefits
anticipated by the parties to this Agreement. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely
as possible to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

  

## 9.13 _Failure or Indulgence Not a Waiver; Remedies Cumulative_.  No
failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right
hereunder shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or
acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or
agreement herein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other right. All
rights and remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not
exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.

  

## 9.14 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND ANDREW
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)

HERBY OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, MERGER SUB OR ANDREW IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.

or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any federal court
located in the State of Delaware or in Delaware state court, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
