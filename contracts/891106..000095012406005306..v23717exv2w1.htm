AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of September 17, 2006 (this "Agreement"), is entered into by and between Sterling Financial Corporation, a Washington corporation ("Sterling"), and Northern Empire Bancshares, a California corporation ("Northern Empire"). 

  

 WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Sterling and Northern Empire have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and shareholders to consummate the business combination transaction provided for herein in which Northern Empire will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, merge with and into Sterling, with Sterling being the surviving corporation in such merger (the "Merger"). 

  

 WHEREAS, prior to the consummation of the Merger, if Sterling so elects, Sterling and Northern Empire will respectively cause Sterling Savings Bank, a Washington-chartered bank and wholly owned subsidiary of Sterling ("Sterling Savings Bank"), and Sonoma National Bank, a national banking association and wholly owned subsidiary of Northern Empire ("Sonoma"), to enter into a merger agreement, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Institution Merger Agreement"), providing for the merger (the "Institution Merger") of Sonoma with and into Sterling Savings Bank, with Sterling Savings Bank being the "Surviving Institution" of the Institution Merger. 

  

 WHEREAS, the Merger is intended to be treated as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). 

  

 WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger. 

  

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and as a material inducement to the willingness of Sterling to enter into this Agreement, (a) each of the Northern Empire shareholders identified on Schedule 7.2(d) hereto is executing and delivering to Sterling a voting agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C (the "Voting Agreement"), (b) each of the Northern Empire employees identified on Schedule 7.2(e) hereto is executing and delivering to Sterling an employment agreement, to be effective at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2 hereof), and (c) each of the Northern Empire shareholders identified on Schedule 7.2(f) hereto is executing and delivering to Sterling a noncompetition agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D (the "Noncompetition Agreement"), to be effective at the Effective Time. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows. 

   ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE I 
 THE MERGER 

   

 1.1 THE MERGER. 

  

 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Northern Empire shall merge with and into Sterling, with Sterling being the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes called the "Surviving Corporation") in the Merger. Upon consummation of the Merger, the corporate existence of Northern Empire shall cease and the Surviving Corporation shall continue to exist as a Washington corporation. 

  

 1.2 EFFECTIVE TIME. 

  

 The Merger shall become effective on the Closing Date (as defined in Section 9.1 hereof), as set forth in the articles of merger (the "Washington Articles of Merger") in the form attached as Exhibit B-1 hereto which shall be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Washington on the Closing Date and the articles of merger (the "California Articles of Merger") in the form attached as Exhibit B-2 hereto which shall be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of California on the Closing Date. The term "Effective Time" shall be the date and time when the Merger becomes effective on the Closing Date. 

  

 1.3 EFFECTS OF THE MERGER. 

  

 At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 23B.11.060 of the Washington Business Corporation Act (the "WBCA") and Section 1103 of the California Corporations Code (the "CCC"). 

  

 1.4 CONVERSION OF NORTHERN EMPIRE COMMON STOCK. 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of Northern Empire common stock with no par value (the "Northern Empire Common Stock"), each share of Northern Empire Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive (i) 0.8050 (the "Stock Exchange Ratio") shares of Sterling common stock, par value $1.00 per share ("Sterling Common Stock"), and (ii) $2.71 in cash (such combination of cash and stock, the "Merger Consideration"), provided, however, that the maximum number of shares of Sterling Common Stock that may be issued in the Merger shall be 9,434,960 shares. 

  

 (b) All of the shares of Northern Empire Common Stock converted pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate previously representing any such shares of Northern Empire Common Stock (each a "Certificate") shall thereafter represent the right to receive (i) the amount of cash and the number of whole shares of Sterling Common Stock, and (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the shares of Northern Empire Common Stock represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant to this Agreement. Certificates previously representing shares of Northern Empire Common Stock shall be exchanged for certificates representing whole shares of 

   ##### 

  

    

Sterling Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares issued in
consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Certificates in accordance
with Section 2.2 hereof, without any interest thereon. If after the date
hereof and prior to the Effective Time, Sterling should split or combine its
common stock, or declare a dividend or other distribution on such common
stock, with a distribution or record date, as applicable, prior to the
Effective Time, then the Stock Exchange Ratio, the Option Exchange Ratio (as
defined in Section 1.6(a) of this Agreement) and the maximum number of shares
of Sterling Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 1.4(a) of this
Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such split, combination,
dividend or distribution. 

  

 (c) At the Effective Time, all shares of Northern Empire Common Stock that are owned by Northern Empire as treasury stock, if any, and all shares of Northern Empire Common Stock that are owned directly or indirectly by Sterling or Northern Empire or any Subsidiary of Northern Empire or Sterling (i) held in a fiduciary capacity or (ii) held as a result of debts previously contracted in good faith, shall be canceled and shall cease to exist and no stock of Sterling or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. For purposes of this Agreement, "Subsidiary" shall have the meaning given that term in Item 210.1-02 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). 

  

 (d) Certificates for fractions of shares of Sterling Common Stock will not be issued. In lieu of a fraction of a share of Sterling Common Stock, each holder of Northern Empire Common Stock entitled to a fraction of a share of Sterling Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement shall be entitled to receive an amount of cash equal to such fraction of a share of Sterling Common Stock multiplied by the average of the Daily Sales Prices (as defined in Section 8.1(h) of this Agreement) of Sterling Common Stock on the five consecutive Trading Days ending on and including the Sterling Determination Date (as defined in Section 8.1(h)). Following consummation of the Merger, no holder of Northern Empire Common Stock shall be entitled to dividends or any other rights in respect of any such fraction. 

  

 (e) Dissenting Shares (as defined below) (if any) shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive cash and Sterling Common Stock hereunder and shall be entitled to receive only the payment provided for by Section 1300 et. seq. of the CCC with respect to such Dissenting Shares, unless and until the holder of such Dissenting Shares (the "Dissenting Shareholder") shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such Dissenting Shareholders right to dissent from the Merger as provided under the CCC. Northern Empire will give Sterling prompt notice (and in any case, within two business days) of any demand received by Northern Empire for payment in connection with the exercise of Dissenters Rights, and Sterling will have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demand. Northern Empire agrees that, except with Sterlings prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, it will not voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for payment. If any Dissenting Shareholder fails to make an effective demand for payment or otherwise loses such holders status as a Dissenting Shareholder, Sterling will, as of the later of the Effective Time or ten business days from the occurrence of such event, issue and deliver, upon surrender by such Dissenting Shareholder of its Certificate(s), the cash and shares of Sterling Common 

   ##### 

  

    

Stock and any cash payment in lieu of fractional shares, in each case without
interest thereon, to which such Northern Empire shareholder would have been
entitled under Section 1.4(a). 

  

 For purposes of this Agreement, "Dissenting Shares" shall mean any shares of Northern Empire Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to which dissenters rights to obtain payment for such dissenting shares in accordance with Section 1300 et. seq. of the CCC have been duly and properly exercised and perfected in connection with the Merger. 

  

 1.5 STERLING COMMON STOCK. 

  

 Each share of Sterling Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be unchanged and shall remain issued and outstanding as common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 1.6 OPTIONS. 

  

 At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Northern Empire Common Stock (a "Northern Empire Option") granted by Northern Empire pursuant to the Northern Empire 1997 Stock Option Plan (the "Northern Empire Stock Option Plan") that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto shall be automatically converted into an option to purchase shares of Sterling Common Stock in an amount and at an exercise price determined as provided below and otherwise subject to the terms of the Northern Empire Stock Option Plan: 

  

 (a) The number of shares of Sterling Common Stock to be subject to the option immediately after the Effective Time shall be equal to the product of the number of shares of Northern Empire Common Stock subject to the option immediately before the Effective Time, multiplied by 0.8873 (the "Option Exchange Ratio"), provided that any fractional shares of Sterling Common Stock resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded to the nearest whole share; and 

  

 (b) The exercise price per share of Sterling Common Stock under the option immediately after the Effective Time shall be equal to the exercise price per share of Northern Empire Common Stock under the option immediately before the Effective Time divided by the Option Exchange Ratio, provided that such exercise price shall be rounded to the nearest cent. The adjustment provided herein shall be and is intended to be effected in a manner that is consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code. The duration and other terms of the option immediately after the Effective Time shall be the same as the corresponding terms in effect immediately before the Effective Time, except that all references to Northern Empire in the Northern Empire Stock Option Plan (and the corresponding references in the option agreement documenting such option), shall be deemed to be references to Sterling. 

   ##### 

  

  

 1.7 RESERVATION OF SHARES AND SECURITIES FILINGS. 

  

 At all times after the Effective Time, Sterling shall reserve for issuance such number of shares of Sterling Common Stock as necessary so as to permit the exercise of Northern Empire Options converted under Section 1.6 of this Agreement. Sterling shall make all filings required under federal and state securities laws promptly after the Effective Time so as to permit the exercise of such converted Northern Empire Options and the sale of the Sterling Common Stock received by the optionee upon such exercise at and after the Effective Time. 

  

 1.8 ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION. 

  

 At the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of Sterling, as in effect at the Effective Time, shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 1.9 BYLAWS. 

  

 At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Sterling, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 1.10 DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. 

  

 Subject to Section 6.15, at the Effective Time, the directors and officers of Sterling immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 1.11 TAX CONSEQUENCES. 

  

 It is intended that the Merger, either alone or in conjunction with the Institution Merger, shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" for the purposes of the Code. 

  

 1.12 ACCOUNTING TREATMENT. 

  

 It is intended that the Merger shall be accounted for as a "purchase" under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). 

  

ARTICLE II 
 EXCHANGE OF SHARES 

   

 2.1 STERLING TO MAKE SHARES AVAILABLE. 

  

 At or prior to the Effective Time, Sterling shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with Sterlings transfer agent, American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, or such other similarly-qualified bank, trust company or transfer agent as Sterling may select (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, cash, certificates representing the shares of Sterling Common Stock and the cash in 

   ##### 

  

    

lieu of fractional shares (such cash and certificates for shares of Sterling
Common Stock, being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund") to be
issued pursuant to Section 1.4 and paid pursuant to Section 2.2(a) hereof in
exchange for outstanding shares of Northern Empire Common Stock. 

  

 2.2 EXCHANGE OF SHARES; CONVERSION OF OPTIONS. 

  

 (a) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates a form letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for cash and certificates representing the shares of Sterling Common Stock and the cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the shares of Northern Empire Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement. Upon surrender of a Certificate for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of Sterling Common Stock to which such holder of Northern Empire Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions hereof and (y) a check representing the amount of cash and cash in lieu of a fractional share, if any, which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Certificate surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash and cash in lieu of fractional shares, unpaid dividends, and distributions, if any, payable to holders of Certificates. 

   

 (b) No dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective Time with respect to Sterling Common Stock and payable to the holders of record thereof shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Article II. After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to shares of Sterling Common Stock represented by such Certificate. 

   

 (c) If any certificate representing shares of Sterling Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate representing shares of Sterling Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable. 

   

 (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Northern Empire of the shares of Northern Empire Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates 

    ##### 

  

    

representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent,
they shall be canceled and exchanged for certificates representing shares of
Sterling Common Stock and cash as provided in this Article II.

To the knowledge of Sterling, all applicable remedies against all borrowers and guarantors are enforceable except as such enforcement may be limited by general principles of equity whether applied in a court of 

     ##### 

  

    

law or a court in equity and by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
and similar Laws affecting creditors rights and remedies generally. All
Loans purchased or originated by Sterling or any of its Subsidiaries and
subsequently sold by Sterling or any of its Subsidiaries have been sold
without recourse to Sterling or any of its Subsidiaries (other than with
respect to customary representations and warranties) and without any
liability under any yield maintenance or similar obligation. 

   

 (c) Each outstanding Loan participation sold by Sterling or any of its Subsidiaries was sold with the risk of non-payment of all or any portion of that underlying Loan to be shared by each participant (including Sterling or any of its Subsidiaries) proportionately to the share of such Loan represented by such participation without any recourse of such other lender or participant to Sterling or any of its Subsidiaries for payment or repurchase of the amount of such Loan represented by the participation or liability under any yield maintenance or similar obligation.

 4.17 UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. 

  

 Except for (i) those liabilities that are accrued for or recorded in the Sterling Exchange Act Reports or (ii) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business since the latest Sterling Exchange Act Report, neither Sterling nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued or contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due) that, either alone or when combined with all similar liabilities, has had, or would be reasonably expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on Sterling. 

  

 4.18 TAX TREATMENT OF MERGER. 

  

 As of the date of this Agreement, Sterling is not aware of any fact or state of affairs relating to Sterling that could cause the Merger not to be treated as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code. 

  

 4.19 STERLING INFORMATION. 

  

 The information relating to Sterling and its Subsidiaries to be contained in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Registration Statement, any filings or approvals under applicable state securities laws, any filing pursuant to Rule 165 or Rule 425 under the Securities Act or Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act, or in any other document filed with any other Governmental Entity in connection herewith, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading and will comply in all material respects

 (ii) (a) split, combine or reclassify any shares of its capital stock or issue, authorize or propose the issuance of any other securities in respect of, in lieu of or in substitution for shares of its capital stock except upon the exercise or fulfillment of rights or options issued and outstanding as of the date hereof pursuant to the Northern Empire Stock Option Plan in accordance with their present terms, or (b) repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire (except in partial or complete satisfaction of debts previously contracted or upon the forfeiture of outstanding restricted stock) any shares of the capital stock of Northern Empire or Sonoma, or any securities convertible into or exercisable for any shares of the capital stock of Northern Empire or Sonoma;

   ##### 

  

 

Northern Empire may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and their
Representatives to, take any action described in this clause (b) to the
extent that the Board of Directors of Northern Empire concludes in good faith
(after receipt of advice from its outside counsel) that failure to take such
actions would more likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary
duties under applicable law. Prior to providing any nonpublic information
permitted to be provided pursuant to this Section, Northern Empire shall have
entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no
less favorable to Northern Empire than the Confidentiality Agreement (as
defined in Section 6.2). Northern Empire will immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before
the date of this Agreement with any persons other than Sterling with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal and will use its reasonable best efforts
to enforce any confidentiality or similar agreement relating to an
Acquisition Proposal. Northern Empire will promptly (within one business day)
advise Sterling following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal of the
substance thereof (including the identity of the person making such
Acquisition Proposal), and will keep Sterling apprised of any related
developments, discussions and negotiations (including the terms and
conditions of the Acquisition Proposal) on a current basis. As used in this
Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any tender or exchange offer,
proposal for a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving
Northern Empire or any of its Subsidiaries or any proposal or offer to
acquire in any manner more than 15% of the voting power in, or more than 15%
of the business, assets or deposits of, Northern Empire or any of
its Subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
As used in this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal which the Board of Directors of Northern Empire
concludes in good faith to be more favorable from a financial point of view
to its shareholders than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, (1) after receiving the advice of its financial advisor (who shall be
a regionally recognized investment banking firm), (2) after taking into
account the likelihood of consummation of such transaction on the terms set
forth therein (as compared to, and with due regard for, the terms herein) and
(3) after taking into account all legal (after receipt of advice from its
outside counsel), financial (including the financing terms of any such
proposal), regulatory and other aspects of such proposal and any other
relevant factors permitted under applicable Law. For purposes of the
definition of "Superior Proposal," the references to "more than 15%" in the
definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "a
majority" and the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall only refer to a
transaction involving Northern Empire and not its Subsidiaries; 

   

 (vi) other than commitments entered into prior to the date of this Agreement, as set forth in Section 5.1(b)(vi) of the Northern Empire Disclosure Letter, make capital expenditures aggregating in excess of $50,000, except for emergency repairs and replacements;

 (c) Sterling and Northern Empire agree that, in order to effectively compensate and retain Rule 16(b) Insiders (as defined below) in connection with the Merger, both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that Rule 16(b) Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion of shares of Northern Empire Common Stock into shares of Sterling Common Stock and the assumption of Northern Empire Options by Sterling in the Merger, and that for compensatory and retentive purposes agree to the provisions of this Section 5.2(c).

 "Northern Empire Section 16 Information" shall mean information accurate in all material respects regarding the Rule 16(b) Insiders, the number of shares of Northern Empire Common Stock held by each such Rule 16(b) Insider and expected to be exchanged for Sterling Common Stock in the Merger, and the number and description of Northern Empire Options held by each such Rule 16(b) Insider and expected to be assumed by Sterling in connection with the Merger; provided that the requirement for a description of any Northern Empire Options shall be deemed to be satisfied if copies of all plans, and forms of agreements, under which such options have been granted have been made available to Sterling and the specific plans and forms of agreements underlying such options have been specified by Northern Empire in such information. 

  

 "Rule 16(b) Insiders" shall mean those officers and directors of Northern Empire who are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and who are listed in the Northern Empire Section 16 Information. 

  

 The consent of Northern Empire to any action by Sterling or Sterling Savings Bank that is not permitted by any of the preceding paragraphs shall be evidenced only by a writing signed by the President or any Executive Vice President of Northern Empire. With respect to any written request by Sterling for Northern Empires consent to any non-permitted action of Sterling 

   ##### 

  

    

described in this Section 5.2, Northern Empire shall not unreasonably withhold
or delay its consent. 

  

 5.3 MERGER COVENANTS. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding that Northern Empire believes that it has established all allowances and taken all provisions for losses required by GAAP and applicable Laws, Northern Empire recognizes that Sterling may have adopted different loan, accrual and allowance policies (including loan classifications and levels of allowances for losses). In that regard and in general from and after the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, Northern Empire and Sterling shall consult and cooperate with each other in order to formulate the plan of integration for the Merger, including, among other things, with respect to conforming immediately prior to the Effective Time, based upon such consultation, Northern Empires loan, accrual and allowance policies to those policies of Sterling to the extent consistent with GAAP, provided, however, that no such additional accruals and loss allowances will be: (i) required to be made more than two business days prior to the Closing Date and only after all conditions under Article VII have been satisfied or waived or (ii) deemed to have a Material Adverse Effect upon Northern Empire if made upon Sterlings written request. 

   

 (b) Except as provided in Schedule 5.3(b), Northern Empire shall use its reasonable best efforts to terminate or withdraw from all employee benefits plans maintained by Northern Empire or its Subsidiaries, except for the Northern Empire Bancshares 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan and the Northern Empire Stock Option Plan, at or as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, in accordance with the applicable Plan documents and Laws; provided, however, that at Sterlings written request, Northern Empire shall use its reasonable best efforts to take steps for one or more of the above-referenced Plans, as designated by Sterling, instead to be terminated or withdrawn from or merged into a corresponding Sterling plan. Northern Empire and Sterling shall cooperate in this regard.

 (d) Sterling and Northern Empire shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement which causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval (as defined in Section 7.1(c) hereof) will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will be materially delayed.

action or make any other public statement in connection with the Northern
Empire Meeting inconsistent with such recommendation (collectively, a "Change

permitted by Section 6.3(b). Notwithstanding any Change in Northern Empire
Recommendation, this Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of
Northern Empire at the Northern Empire Shareholders Meeting for the purpose
of adopting this Agreement and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
relieve Northern Empire of such obligation. In addition to the foregoing,
Northern Empire shall not submit to the vote of its shareholders at or prior

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Northern Empire and its Board of Directors shall be permitted to effect a Change in Northern Empire Recommendation, if and only to the extent that: 

   

 (i) Northern Empires Board of Directors, after receipt of advice from its outside counsel, determines in good faith that failure to take such action is inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and 

  

 (ii) Prior to effecting such Change in Northern Empire Recommendation: (A) Northern Empire shall have complied in all material respects with Section 5.1(b)(v); (B) the Board of Directors of Northern Empire shall have determined in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by Sterling pursuant to clause (D) below; (C) Northern Empire shall notify Sterling, at least five business days in advance, of its intention to effect a Change in Northern Empire Recommendation in response to such Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal and furnishing to Sterling a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the party making such Superior Proposal and other material documents; and (D) Northern Empire shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, during the period following Northern Empires delivery of the notice referred to in clause (C) above, negotiate with Sterling in good faith (to the extent Sterling desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal.

 6.6 EMPLOYEES. 

  

 (a) To the extent permissible under the applicable provisions of the Code and ERISA, for purposes of crediting periods of service for eligibility to participate and vesting, but not for benefit accrual purposes, under employee pension benefit plans (within the meaning of ERISA Section 3(2)) maintained by Sterling or a Sterling Subsidiary, as applicable, individuals who are employees of Northern Empire or any Northern Empire Subsidiary at the Effective Time will be credited with periods of service with Northern Empire or the applicable Northern Empire Subsidiary before the Effective Time (including service with any predecessor employer for which service credit was given under similar employee benefit plans of Northern Empire or the applicable Northern Empire Subsidiary) as if such service had been with Sterling or a Sterling Subsidiary, as applicable. Similar credit shall also be given by Sterling or a Sterling Subsidiary, as applicable, in calculating all other employee benefits for such employees of Northern Empire or a Northern Empire Subsidiary after the Merger. Sterling will or will cause its applicable Subsidiary to (i) give credit to employees of Northern Empire and its Subsidiaries, with respect to the satisfaction of the waiting periods for participation and coverage which are applicable under the welfare benefit plans of Sterling or its applicable Subsidiary, equal to the credit that any such employee had received as of the Effective Time towards the satisfaction of any such limitations and waiting periods under the comparable welfare benefit plans of Northern Empire and its Subsidiaries; (ii) provide each employee of Northern Empire and its Subsidiaries with credit for any co-payment and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any deductible or out-of-pocket requirements; (iii) allow each employee of Northern Empire and its Subsidiaries to have credit for all unused sick leave as of the Effective Time; and (iv) provide coverage for all pre-existing conditions that were covered under any welfare plan of Northern Empire or the applicable Northern Empire Subsidiary. Northern Empire and its Subsidiaries shall cash out any unused vacation time accrued but not taken by employees as of the Effective Time, and Sterling or its Subsidiaries shall give employees credit for prior service for vacation accruals after the Effective Time. 

   

 (b) Sterling or Sterling Savings Bank shall provide severance benefits to those employees of Northern Empire and its Subsidiaries whose employment is involuntarily terminated without cause at or within 180 days after the Effective Time (other than employees who are entitled to receive severance payments under any employment, severance or similar plans or agreements, including the agreements listed in Section 3.12 of the Northern Empire Disclosure Letter) in accordance with Northern Empires current written severance policy as previously delivered to Sterling. 

   

 6.7 INDEMNIFICATION. 

  

 (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, in which any person who is now, or has 

    ##### 

  

    

been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to
the Effective Time, a director or officer or employee of Northern Empire or
any Northern Empire Subsidiary (the "Indemnified Parties") is, or is
threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in
whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a
director, officer or employee of Northern Empire or any Northern Empire
Subsidiary or any of their respective predecessors or (ii) this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby, whether in any case asserted or
arising before or after the Effective Time, the parties hereto agree to
cooperate and use their best efforts to defend against and respond thereto.
It is understood and agreed that, after the Effective Time, Sterling shall
indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, including California law, each such Indemnified Party
against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition
of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to
the fullest extent permitted by Law (upon receipt of any undertaking required
by applicable Law from such Indemnified Party to repay such advanced expenses
if it is determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party was not entitled to
indemnification hereunder), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement
in connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, and in the event of any such threatened or
actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether asserted or
arising before or after the Effective Time), the Indemnified Parties may
retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to Sterling; provided, however, that
(1) Sterling shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and upon such
assumption Sterling shall not be liable to any Indemnified Party for any
legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred
by any Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof, except that
if Sterling elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified
Parties reasonably advises the Indemnified Parties that there are issues
which raise conflicts of interest between Sterling and the Indemnified
Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory
to Sterling, and Sterling shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel for the Indemnified Parties, (2) Sterling shall be obligated pursuant
to this paragraph to pay for only one firm of counsel reasonably required in
each applicable jurisdiction for such Indemnified Parties, and (3) Sterling
shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this
Section 6.7, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall notify Sterling thereof; provided, however, that
the failure to so notify shall not affect the obligations of Sterling under
this Section 6.7 except to the extent such failure to notify materially
prejudices Sterling. Sterlings obligations under this Section 6.7 shall
continue in full force and effect for a period of six years from
the Effective Time; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in
respect of any claim asserted or made within such period shall continue until
the final disposition of such claim. 

   

 (b) Sterling shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the persons serving as officers and directors of Northern Empire and the Northern Empire Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered by a directors and officers liability insurance tail policy of substantially the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are generally not less advantageous than Northern Empires current policy with 

    ##### 

  

    

respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time that were
committed by such officers and directors in their capacity as such for a
period of six years. 

   

 (c) This Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective Time and is intended to benefit each indemnified person (each of whom shall be entitled to enforce this Section against Sterling) and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Sterling. 

   

 (d) In the event Sterling or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to one or more other persons, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Sterling assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7. 

   

 6.8 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS. 

  

 In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, or to vest the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Institution with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, or the constituent parties to the Institution Merger, as the case may be, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and Sterlings Subsidiaries and Northern Empires Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by Sterling. 

  

 6.9 ADVICE OF CHANGES. 

  

 Sterling and Northern Empire shall promptly advise the other party of any change or event that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained herein. From time to time prior to the Effective Time, each party will promptly supplement or amend its disclosure letter delivered in connection with the execution of this Agreement to reflect any matter which, if existing, occurring or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in such disclosure letter or which is necessary to correct any information in such disclosure letter which has been rendered inaccurate thereby. No supplement or amendment to such disclosure letter shall have any effect for the purpose of determining satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.2(a) or 7.3(a) hereof, as the case may be, or the compliance by Northern Empire or Sterling, as the case may be, with the respective covenants set forth in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 hereof. 

  

 6.10 CURRENT INFORMATION. 

  

 During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, each party will cause one or more of its designated representatives to confer on a regular and frequent basis (not less than monthly) with representatives of the other party and to report the general status of its ongoing operations. Each party will promptly notify the other party of any material change in the normal course of business or in the operation of the properties of itself or any of its 

   ##### 

  

    

Subsidiaries and of any governmental complaints, investigations or hearings
(or communications indicating that the same may be contemplated), or the
institution or the threat of litigation involving itself or any of its
Subsidiaries, and will keep the other party fully informed of such events.

 Prior to the Effective Time, if Sterling elects to effect the Institution Merger, (a) Sterling and Northern Empire shall each approve the Institution Merger Agreement as the sole shareholder of Sterling Savings Bank and Sonoma, respectively, and (b) Sonoma and Sterling Savings Bank shall execute and deliver the Institution Merger Agreement. Notice of such election by Sterling shall be in writing delivered to Northern Empire pursuant to Section 9.4. 

  

 6.12 CHANGE IN STRUCTURE. 

  

 Sterling may elect to modify the structure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as noted herein so long as (i) there are no adverse tax consequences to the Northern Empire shareholders as a result of such modification, (ii) the consideration and other benefits to be paid to or received by the Northern Empire shareholders and optionees, and the Northern Empire and Sonoma directors, officers and employees under this Agreement are not thereby changed or reduced in amount, and (iii) such modification will not delay or jeopardize receipt of any Requisite Regulatory Approvals. In the event that the structure of the Merger is modified pursuant to this Section 6.12, the parties agree to modify this Agreement and the various exhibits hereto to reflect such revised structure. In such event, Sterling shall prepare appropriate amendments to this Agreement and the exhibits hereto for execution by the parties hereto. Northern Empire agrees to cooperate fully with Sterling to effect such amendments. 

  

 6.13 TRANSACTION EXPENSES OF NORTHERN EMPIRE. 

  

 As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, Northern Empire will provide to Sterling an estimate of the expenses Northern Empire expects to incur in connection with the Merger, and shall keep Sterling reasonably informed of material changes in such estimate.

ARTICLE VIII 
 TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT 

   

 8.1 TERMINATION. 

  

 This Agreement may be terminated (based upon action of the appropriate Board of Directors) at any time prior to the Effective Time: 

  

 (a) by mutual written consent of Sterling and Northern Empire; 

   

 (b) by either Sterling or Northern Empire if: (i) any Governmental Entity which must grant a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied such approval and such denial has become final and nonappealable or (ii) any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final nonappealable order enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, unless such denial or order shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein; 

   

 (c) by either Sterling or Northern Empire if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before April 2, 2007; provided, that a party that is then in material breach of any of its covenants or obligations under this Agreement shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(c); 

   

 (d) by either Sterling or Northern Empire (provided that the terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein) if the other party shall have materially breached (i) any of the covenants or agreements made by such other party herein or (ii) any of the representations or warranties made by such other party herein such that any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) or 7.3(a), as applicable, would not be satisfied, and in either case, such breach is not cured within 30 days following written notice to the party committing such breach, or which breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the Closing Date; 

   

 (e) by either Sterling or Northern Empire if the approval of the shareholders of Sterling or Northern Empire contemplated by this Agreement shall not have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the vote required at the Sterling Meeting or the Northern Empire 

    ##### 

  

    

Meeting, provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this Section 8.1(e) will not be available to Northern Empire where the
failure to obtain the approval of the shareholders of Northern Empire will
have been caused by (i) a material breach by Northern Empire of this
Agreement, or (ii) a breach of the Voting Agreements by any party thereto
other than Sterling; 

   

 (f) by Sterling if: (i) the Board of Directors of Northern Empire shall have failed to recommend to its shareholders the approval of the Merger, or shall have made, or publicly announced its intention to make, a Change in Northern Empire Recommendation and the shareholders of Northern Empire fail to approve the Merger at the Northern Empire Meeting, or (ii) Northern Empire shall have breached the terms of Section 5.1(b)(v) hereof in any respect adverse to Sterling; 

   

 (g) by Sterling if a tender offer or exchange offer for 25% or more of the outstanding shares of Northern Empire Common Stock is commenced (other than by Sterling or a Subsidiary thereof), and the Board of Directors of Northern Empire recommends that the shareholders of Northern Empire tender their shares in such tender or exchange offer or otherwise fails to recommend that such shareholders reject such tender offer or exchange offer within the ten business day period specified in Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act; or 

   

 (h) by Northern Empire, upon its written notice to Sterling within the two business days following the Determination Date (as defined below), in the event that: 

   

 (1) Sterling does not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d) of this Agreement, or Sterling has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d) of this Agreement and does not exercise such right; 

  

 (2) The Sterling Determination Price (as defined below) on the Determination Date is less than $27.97; and 

  

 (3) (a) the number obtained by dividing the Sterling Determination Price by $32.91 (the "Sterling Change Ratio") is less than (b) the number obtained by dividing the Final Index Price (as defined below) by the Initial Index Price (as defined below) and then multiplying the quotient in this clause 3(b) by 0.85 (the "Index Change Ratio"). 

  

 For purposes of this Section 8.1(h), the following terms have the meanings indicated below: 

   

 "Trading Day" means a day that Sterling Common Stock is traded on NASDAQ as reported on the website of www.nasdaq.com. 

   

 "Determination Date" shall mean the later of (a) the date on which Northern Empire receives written notice in accordance with the requirements of Section 9.4 regarding notices, that the last regulatory approval (and waivers, if applicable) necessary for consummation of the Merger has been received (disregarding any waiting period) and (b) the date immediately 

    ##### 

  

    

following the date of approval of the Merger by the Northern Empire
shareholders at the Northern Empire Meeting. 

   

 "Daily Sales Price" for any Trading Day means the daily closing price per share of Sterling Common Stock on NASDAQ. 

   

 "Sterling Determination Price" shall mean the average of the Daily Sales Prices of Sterling Common Stock on the twenty consecutive Trading Days ending on and including the Determination Date. 

   

 "Final Index Price" means the weighted average of the Final Prices for each company comprising the Index Group. 

   

 "Final Price," with respect to any company belonging to the Index Group, means the average of the closing sales price of a share of common stock of such company, as reported on the consolidated transaction reporting system for the market or exchange on which such common stock is principally traded, on the twenty consecutive Trading Days ending on and including the Determination Date. 

   

 "Index Group" means the 20 financial institution holding companies listed on Exhibit F attached hereto. In the event that the common stock of any such company ceases to be publicly traded or a proposal to acquire any such company is announced at any time during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and ending on the Determination Date, such company will be removed from the Index Group, and the weights attributed to the remaining companies will be adjusted proportionately for purposes of determining the Final Index Price and the Initial Index Price. The 20 financial institution holding companies and the weights attributed to them are listed on Exhibit F. 

   

 "Initial Index Price" means the sum of each per share average closing price of the common stock of each company comprising the Index Group multiplied by the applicable weighting, as such prices are reported on the consolidated transactions reporting system for the market or exchange on which such common stock principally traded for the twenty consecutive Trading Days ending on and including the day before announcement of the signing of this Agreement. 

   

 If Sterling declares or effects a stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, forward or reverse stock split, or similar transaction between the date of this Agreement and the Determination Date, the prices for the Sterling Common Stock shall be appropriately adjusted for the purposes of applying this Section 8.1(h). 

   

 If Northern Empire elects to exercise its termination right pursuant to this Section 8.1(h), it shall give written notice to Sterling within two business days after the Determination Date, such termination will be effective on the third business day after the giving of such notice (the "Effective Termination Date"); provided that within two business days after Sterlings receipt of such notice, Sterling shall have the option to increase the consideration to be received by holders of Northern Empire Common Stock hereunder by increasing the Merger 

    ##### 

  

    

Consideration such that the value of the increased Merger Consideration (such
increased Merger Consideration, the "Adjusted Merger Consideration") is equal
to a value no less than the lesser of (i) 25.23 or (ii) the sum of (a) the
product of 26.49 multiplied by the Index Change Ratio, plus (b) $2.71. Such
adjustment to the Merger Consideration can be effected by an increase in the
cash portion of the Merger Consideration, the stock portion of the Merger
Consideration or a combination of the cash and stock portions of the Merger
Consideration, at Sterlings discretion; provided, however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing, any such adjustment shall not result in the
cash portion of the Adjusted Merger Consideration constituting more than 40%
of the value of the Adjusted Merger Consideration and the amount expected to
be paid to Dissenting Shareholders, if any. If Sterling so elects, it shall
timely give written notice to Northern Empire of such election and of the
Adjusted Merger Consideration, whereupon no termination shall be deemed to
have occurred pursuant to Section 8.1(h) and this Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect in accordance with its terms (except as the Merger
Consideration shall have been so modified). 

   

 8.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. 

  

 (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Sterling or Northern Empire as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect except: (i) Sections 6.2(b), 8.2, and 9.3 shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no party shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its willful or intentional material breach of any provision of this Agreement unless and until the other party has chosen, at such partys sole discretion, as its sole remedy for any such willful or intentional breach, the payment of a termination fee as provided in Section 8.2(b). 

   

 (b) (i) Northern Empire shall pay Sterling a fee (the "Northern Empire Termination Fee") if this Agreement is terminated under certain conditions. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(f)(i) or 8.1(g), the Northern Empire Termination Fee shall be $12.5 million, and the payment thereof by Northern Empire to Sterling in accordance with the terms hereof shall be Sterlings sole and exclusive remedy for such termination. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(f)(ii) and Sterling elects to receive the payment of the Northern Empire Termination Fee, the Northern Empire Termination Fee shall be $12.5 million, and the payment thereof by Northern Empire to Sterling in accordance with the terms hereof shall be Sterlings sole and exclusive remedy for such termination. If this Agreement is terminated by Sterling pursuant to Section 8.1(d) as a result of the willful or intentional material breach by Northern Empire, and Sterling elects to receive the payment of the Northern Empire Termination Fee, the Northern Empire Termination Fee shall be $3 million, and the receipt thereof by Sterling in accordance with the terms hereof shall be Sterlings sole and exclusive remedy for such termination; provided, however, that if this Agreement is terminated by Sterling pursuant to Sections 8.1(d) as a result of the willful or intentional material breach by Northern Empire, and Sterling has elected to receive the payment of the Northern Empire Termination Fee, and within twelve months after such termination Northern Empire or any of its Subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, an Acquisition Proposal, the Northern Empire Termination Fee shall be $12.5 million (net of any prior payment of said $3 million). 

    ##### 

  

     

 (ii) If Northern Empire terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d) as a result of the willful or intentional material breach by Sterling and Northern Empire elects to receive the payment of a termination fee, Sterling shall pay Northern Empire a fee of $3 million (the "Sterling Termination Fee"), which shall be Northern Empires sole and exclusive remedy for such termination. 

  

 (c) Except in the case of a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f)(i) or 8.1(g), the Northern Empire Termination Fee or the Sterling Termination Fee, as the case may be, shall be paid within two business days following written notice from the other party that it has elected to receive the termination fee to which it is entitled as its sole and exclusive remedy, with such notice to be provided within two business days following a termination referred to in Section 8.2(b), and if the Northern Empire Termination Fee is increased from $3 million to $12.5 million as provided in Section 8.2(b), the increase shall be paid within two business days following the earlier of the entry into a definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or the consummation of an Acquisition Proposal, and shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the party entitled to receive such fee. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(f)(i) or 8.1(g), Northern Empire shall pay the Northern Empire Termination Fee within two business days following such termination. 

   

 (d) Sterling and Northern Empire agree that the agreements contained in this Section 8 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, that without such agreements they would not have entered into this Agreement and that neither the Northern Empire Termination Fee nor the Sterling Termination Fee constitute a penalty. If a party hereto fails to pay the amounts due under Section 8.2(b) within the time periods specified in Section 8.2(c), that party shall pay the costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by the other party in connection with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit, taken to collect payment of such amounts, together with interest on the amount of such unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate as published in the Wall Street Journal from the date such amounts were required to be paid until the date of actual payment. 

   

 (e) If a party hereto commences a legal proceeding against the other party for damages or relief on account of willful or intentional material breach or a breach of Section 5.1(b)(v) hereto, it shall forfeit its right to payment under this Section 8.2. 

   

 8.3 AMENDMENT. 

  

 Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the shareholders of Northern Empire; provided, however, that after any approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by Northern Empires shareholders, there may not be, without further approval of such shareholders, any amendment of this Agreement which reduces the amount or changes the form of the consideration to be delivered to Northern Empire shareholders hereunder other than as contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. 

   ##### 

  

  

 8.4 EXTENSION; WAIVER. 

  

 At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. 

  

 8.5 DETERMINATION OF BREACH OF AGREEMENT. 

  

 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, a party shall not be deemed to have breached in any manner any representation, warranty, covenant, or any other agreement contained herein unless written notice specifying such breach has been given to the party committing such breach, and such breach has not been cured within 30 days from notice given as provided in this Agreement, except where the breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the Closing Date.
