detail Buyers good faith calculation of the Base Purchase Price, computed in
a manner consistent with the example set forth in _Schedule 2.5_ , and the
final Purchase Price based thereon (the "Final Closing Statement"). If
Sellers dispute any matter or item set forth in the Final Closing Statement,
Sellers may, within forty-five (45) days after receipt of the Final Closing
Statement, provide to Buyer a written statement (the "Dispute Notice") of
such disputes. If Sellers do not deliver to Buyer any Dispute Notice
concerning the Final Closing Statement, then Sellers shall be deemed to have
accepted the Final Closing Statement and the amounts set forth in the Final
Closing Statement shall be final and binding on all parties to this
Agreement. If Sellers timely deliver a Dispute Notice, Buyer and Sellers shall
use good faith efforts to jointly resolve such disputes within thirty (30)
days after Buyers receipt of the Dispute Notice, which resolution, if
achieved, shall be final and binding upon all parties to this Agreement. If
Buyer and Sellers cannot resolve such disputes to their mutual satisfaction
within such 30-day period, Buyer and Sellers shall, within the following ten
(10) days, jointly engage Ernst and Young LLP (the "Independent Accountants") to
review the Final Closing Statement together with Sellers statement of
disputes and any other relevant documents. The Independent Accountants shall
calculate the adjustments to the Base Purchase Price using the items included
in the Final Closing Statement that are not disputed by Buyer and Sellers and
shall make its own determination of any item that is disputed by Buyer and
Sellers, but otherwise in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement;
_provided, however,_ in no event shall any such determination by the
Independent Accountants for any disputed item be outside the range therefor
set forth in the Final Closing Statement and the written statement of
disputes. The determination of the Independent Accountants shall be
accompanied by a certificate that its determination was prepared in accordance
with this Agreement with respect to such dispute. The Independent Accountants
shall report its conclusions as to such disputes and its determination of the
adjustments to the Base Purchase Price and the final Purchase Price based
thereon pursuant to this Section 2.7 no later than thirty (30) days after it
is engaged by Buyer and Sellers, which determination shall be final and
binding on all parties to this Agreement and not subject to further dispute or
judicial review. If the Buyer does not deliver to the Sellers a Final Closing
Statement within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, then, within ninety
(90) days after the Closing Date the Sellers may, but shall not be obligated
to, deliver to the Buyer a Final Closing Statement, which shall be subject to
the same review and adjustment process that a Buyer-produced Final Closing
Statement would have been subject to if Buyer had delivered a Final Closing
Statement, as set forth in this Section 2.7.

 

(b) The fees and expenses (including any related indemnity obligation to such
independent public accounting firm) of the Independent Accountants (the
"Aggregate Accounting Fees") shall be allocated between Buyer, on the one
hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, as follows: a portion of the Aggregate
Accounting Fees equal to the product of the Aggregate Accounting Fees times a
fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate dollar amount of the
disputed items resolved by the Independent Accountants in favor of Sellers and
the denominator of which is the aggregate dollar amount of all disputed
items submitted to the Independent Accountants for resolution, shall be
allocated to Buyer, and the remainder shall be allocated to Sellers (in each
case as finally determined by the Independent Accountants).

 

(c) Within five Business Days after the final determination of the Purchase
Price: (i) if the Purchase Price (as finally determined in accordance with
Section 2.8) _exceeds_ the Estimated Purchase Price, Buyer will pay to Sellers
(or such other Person as designated by Sellers), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the bank account designated in writing
by Sellers, the amount of such excess; or (ii) if the Purchase Price (as
finally determined in accordance with Section 2.8) is _less than_ the
Estimated Purchase Price, Sellers shall pay to Buyer, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the bank account designated in writing by
Buyer, the amount of such deficit.

 



-12- (d) Sellers will provide to Buyer reasonable access during regular business
hours on reasonable advance notice to the Books and Records and to any other
information, to the extent necessary for Buyer to review the Preliminary
Closing Statement, to prepare the Final Closing Statement, to respond to
Sellers objections to the Final Closing Statement (if any), and to prepare
materials for presentation to the Independent Accountants in connection with
Section 2.7(a). Buyer will provide to Sellers reasonable access to the Books
and Records and to any other information used by Buyer in preparing the Final
Closing Statement, including to any Hired Employees or other employees of
Buyer, during regular business hours and on reasonable advance notice, to the
extent necessary for Seller to review the Final Closing Statement, to prepare
the Final Closing Statement if Buyer has not delivered it within the timeframe
specified in Section 2.7(a), and to prepare materials for presentation to the
Independent Accountants in connection with Section 2.7(a). Each party
will cooperate with the Independent Accountants as may be reasonably
necessary and will promptly provide to such independent public accounting firm
such information as may be reasonably requested by the Independent
Accountants.

 

Section 2.8 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. The Purchase Price (and other
relevant items for Tax purposes, including the Assumed Liabilities) will be
allocated among the Transferred Assets as provided in _Schedule 2.8_. Buyer
and Sellers agree (a) that any such allocation is consistent with the
requirements of Section 1060 of the Code, (b) to complete and file (and cause
each of their Affiliates to complete and file), all Tax Returns, reports and
forms (including, IRS Form 8594), and any amendments thereto, as and when
required by applicable Law in a manner consistent with such allocation,
and (c) to take no position inconsistent with the allocations set forth in
_Schedule 2.8_ and otherwise required by this Section 2.8 in any audit or
examination by any taxing authority.

 

Section 2.9 _Non-assignable Assets_.

 

 __(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, and subject
to the provisions of this Section 2.9, to the extent that the sale,
assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery, or attempted sale, assignment,
transfer, conveyance or delivery, to Buyer of any Transferred Asset would
result in a violation of applicable Law, or would require the
consent, authorization, approval or waiver of a Person who is not a party to
this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement (including any
Governmental Authority), and such consent, authorization, approval or waiver
shall not have been obtained prior to the Closing, this Agreement shall not
constitute a sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery, or an
attempted sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery, thereof;
_provided, however,_ that, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions contained in Article VII the Closing shall occur notwithstanding
the foregoing without any adjustment to the Purchase Price on account thereof.
Following the Closing, Sellers and Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts, and shall cooperate with each other, to obtain any such
required consent, authorization, approval or waiver, or any release,
substitution or amendment required to novate all liabilities and obligations
under any and all Contracts or other liabilities that constitute Assumed
Liabilities or to obtain in writing the unconditional release of all parties
to such arrangements, so that, in any case, Buyer shall be solely responsible
for such liabilities and obligations from and after the Closing Date;
_provided, however,_ that neither Sellers nor Buyer shall be required to pay
any consideration or incur any unreasonable expense therefor. Once such
consent, authorization, approval, waiver, release, substitution or amendment
is obtained, Sellers shall sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver to
Buyer the relevant Transferred Asset to which such consent, authorization,
approval, waiver, release, substitution or amendment relates for no additional
consideration. Applicable sales, transfer and other similar Taxes in
connection with such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or license shall
be paid by Buyer. __

 



-13- (b) To the extent that any Transferred Asset or Assumed Liability cannot be
transferred to Buyer following the Closing pursuant to this Section 2.9,
Buyer and Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into such
arrangements (such as subleasing, sublicensing or subcontracting) to provide
to the parties the economic and, to the extent permitted under applicable
Law, operational equivalent of the transfer of such Transferred Asset and/or
Assumed Liability to Buyer as of the Closing and the performance by Buyer of
its obligations with respect thereto. Buyer shall, as agent or subcontractor
for Sellers pay, perform and discharge fully the liabilities and obligations
of Sellers thereunder from and after the Closing Date. To the extent permitted
under applicable Law, Sellers shall, at Buyers expense, hold in trust for
and pay to Buyer promptly upon receipt thereof, such Transferred Asset and all
income, proceeds and other monies received by Sellers to the extent related to
such Transferred Asset in connection with the arrangements under this Section
2.9. Sellers shall be permitted to set off against such amounts all direct
costs associated with the retention and maintenance of such Transferred
Assets.

advisable under, any applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any
securities exchange, neither Sellers nor Buyer shall issue (and each shall
cause their Affiliates not to issue) any press release or other public
statement or announcement with respect to the Transactions without the consent
of the other party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed. Sellers and Buyer will consult with each other concerning the
means by which any Business Employee, customer or supplier of the Business or
any other Person having any material business relationship with the Business
will be informed of the Transactions.

Section 5.7 _Tax Covenants_. 

(a) _Payment of Transfer Taxes_. The party required by Law to file Tax Returns
with respect to transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and
other similar Taxes and fees that may be imposed or assessed in connection
with the transfer of the Transferred Assets, including interest and penalties
thereon (the "Transfer Taxes"), shall, at its own expense, file such Tax
Returns when due. The other party shall, at its own expense, cooperate in the
preparation of and join in the execution of any such properly completed Tax
Returns. Buyer and Sellers (collectively) shall each be liable for 50% of any
Transfer Taxes, _provided_ _that_ Buyers liability for such Transfer Taxes
shall not exceed $500,000 (the "Transfer Tax Cap") and therefore if the
Transfer Taxes exceed $1,000,000, Sellers and Seller Parent shall
be responsible for all of such Transfer Taxes, other than the $500,000 which
is the responsibility of the Buyer. The foregoing provisions of this Section
5.7(a) apply, regardless of the party that is required by Law to file such Tax
Returns or pay the Transfer Taxes. Buyer and Sellers will cooperate (and
cause each of their Affiliates to cooperate), as and to the extent reasonably
requested by any other party, in connection with the filing and preparation of
Tax Returns related to any Transfer Taxes and any Tax audit or proceeding
related thereto.

(b) _Allocation of Ad Valorem Taxes_. All personal property Taxes or ad
valorem obligations and similar recurring Taxes on the Transferred Assets ("Ad
Valorem Taxes") will be prorated between Buyer and Sellers as of the Closing
Date. Sellers will be responsible for all such Taxes on the
Transferred Assets to the extent attributable to any period (or portion
thereof) up to but not including the Closing Date. Buyer will be responsible
for all such Taxes on the Transferred Assets to the extent attributable to any
period (or portion thereof) commencing on or after the Closing Date
(including any revaluation or reassessment as a result of this Transaction
affecting Taxes after the Closing or any subsequent transaction after the
Closing Date). With respect to Ad Valorem Taxes, Sellers shall prepare and
timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns of
Sellers that are required to be filed for all taxable periods ending on or
before the Closing Date ("Pre-Closing Tax Periods") and shall control the
defense and settlement of any audit or Action relating to the Tax Returns for
the Sellers for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods. Buyer shall provide timely notice
to Sellers of any communication from a taxing authority that Buyer may
receive with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period. Buyer shall prepare and
timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all other Tax Returns
with respect to Ad Valorem Taxes that are required to be filed in respect of
the Transferred Assets, including for all taxable periods

 



-27-  beginning before and ending after the Closing Date ("Straddle Period"), and
shall control the defense and settlement of any audit or Action relating to
the Transferred Assets for such Straddle Periods. Seller shall provide timely
notice to Buyer of any communication from a taxing authority that Seller may
receive with respect to any Straddle Period. If one party remits to the
appropriate Governmental Entity payment for Taxes that are subject to
proration under this Section 5.7(b), and such payment includes the other
partys share of such Taxes, such other party will promptly reimburse the
remitting party for its share of such Taxes.

 

Section 5.8 _Bulk Transfer Laws_. The parties hereby waive compliance with the
provisions of any so-called "bulk transfer laws" of any jurisdiction in
connection with the sale of the Transferred Assets to Buyer. This provision
shall not be deemed in any way to limit the indemnity provided for in Article
VI hereof.

 

Section 5.9 _Noncompetition and Nonsolicitation_.

 

(a) For a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the third (3rd)
anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Restricted Period"), Sellers and Seller
Parent covenant and agree that they shall not directly or indirectly (A)
engage in or assist others in engaging in a Competitive Business anywhere in
the United States (subject to the last sentence of this Section 5.9, the
"Territory"); or (B) have an interest in any Person engaged directly or
indirectly in a Competitive Business anywhere in the Territory in any
capacity, including as a partner, owner, member, employee, principal, agent,
trustee, financing source, advisor or consultant.

(b) During the Restricted Period, Sellers and Seller Parent covenant and
agree that they shall not, and shall not knowingly permit any of their
respective Affiliates to, directly or indirectly in any manner hire or solicit
any Hired Employee as of the Closing Date or encourage any such Hired Employee
to leave such employment or service of the Buyer or its Affiliates; provided
that the foregoing shall not prevent the Sellers or Seller Parent from (i)
making any general solicitation for employees (including through the use of
employment agencies) not specifically directed at any Hired Person or (ii)
soliciting or hiring Hired Employees who have not been employed by the Buyer
or any of its Affiliates during the six (6) months prior to such solicitation
or hiring.

 

(c) Sellers and Seller Parent hereby acknowledge that a breach or threatened
breach of this Section 5.9 may cause irreparable harm to Buyer, for which
monetary damages may not be an adequate remedy, and hereby agrees that in the
event of such a breach or threatened breach by any Seller or Seller Parent of
its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.9, Buyer shall, in addition to any
and all other rights and remedies that may be available to it in respect of
such breach, be entitled to seek equitable relief, including a temporary
restraining order, an injunction, specific performance and any other relief
that may be available from a court of competent jurisdiction (without any
requirement to post bond). Sellers and Seller Parent acknowledge and agree
that the restrictions contained in this Section 5.9 are reasonable and
necessary to protect the legitimate interests of Buyer and constitute a
material inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement and consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that any covenant
contained in this Section 5.9 should ever be adjudicated to exceed the time,
geographic, product or service, or other limitations permitted by applicable
Law in any jurisdiction, then any court is expressly empowered to reform such
covenant, and such covenant shall be deemed reformed, in such jurisdiction to
the maximum time, geographic, product or service, or other limitations
permitted by applicable Law.

 



-28- Section 5.10 _Nonsolicitation of Seller Parent Employees_.

 

(a) During the Restricted Period, Buyer shall not, and Buyer shall cause its
Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly in any manner hire or solicit any
employee of Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than any Hired
Employee) or encourage any employee of Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates
(other than any Hired Employee) to leave such employment or service of Seller
Parent or its Affiliates; provided that the foregoing shall not prevent Buyer
from (i) making any general solicitation for employees (including through the
use of employment agencies) not specifically directed at any employee of
Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates or (ii) soliciting or hiring any
employee of Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates who have not been employed
by Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates during the six (6) months prior to
such solicitation or hiring.

 

(b) Buyer hereby acknowledges that a breach or threatened breach of this
Section 5.10 may cause irreparable harm to Seller Parent, Sellers and their
respective Affiliates, for which monetary damages may not be an adequate
remedy, and hereby agrees that in the event of such a breach or threatened
breach by any Buyer or its Affiliates of the obligations pursuant to
this Section 5.10, Seller Parent and Sellers shall, in addition to any and
all other rights and remedies that may be available to them in respect of such
breach, be entitled to seek equitable relief, including a temporary
restraining order, an injunction, specific performance and any other relief
that may be available from a court of competent jurisdiction (without any
requirement to post bond). Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the restrictions
contained in this Section 5.10 are reasonable and necessary to protect the
legitimate interests of Seller Parent and its Affiliates and constitute a
material inducement for Seller Parent and Sellers to enter into this Agreement
and consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event
that any covenant contained in this Section 5.10 should ever be adjudicated to
exceed the time, geographic, product or service, or other limitations
permitted by applicable Law in any jurisdiction, then any court is expressly
empowered to reform such covenant, and such covenant shall be deemed reformed,
in such jurisdiction to the maximum time, geographic, product or service, or
other limitations permitted by applicable Law.

 

Section 5.11 _Liquidity of Seller Parent_. If at any time prior to the Actual
Credit Losses Claims Deadline, Seller Parent shall fail to maintain Liquidity
of at least $15,000,000 for more than three (3) consecutive Business Days, the
Seller Parent shall provide Buyer with notice of such failure within three (3)
Business Days (a "Liquidity Notice"). The Buyer shall maintain the existence
of any Liquidity Notice and the content thereof in the strictest confidence
and not disclose such existence and content to any other Person other than
representatives of Buyer who have a need to know such information for
purposes of this Section 5.11, which representatives shall also be instructed
by Buyer to maintain the existence of the Liquidity Notice and contents
thereof in the strictest confidence. Within fifteen (15) days after receipt
of a Liquidity Notice, the Buyer may deliver to Seller Parent a notice (an
"Escrow Notice") informing the Seller Parent that the Buyer elects to enter
into a customary indemnity escrow agreement (the "Escrow Agreement") with
Seller Parent and Delaware Trust Company (the "Escrow Agent") under which
Seller Parent shall deposit with the Escrow Agent an amount equal to the then-
current Actual Credit Losses Cap (the "Escrow Amount"). Buyer shall draft,
and Buyer and Seller Parent shall in good faith mutually finalize and execute,
an Escrow Agreement in connection therewith. Upon the execution of the Escrow
Agreement the Seller Parent shall deposit the Escrow Amount with the Escrow
Agent solely as a source of recovery for the Buyer Indemnified Parties for
Actual Credit Losses. Portions of the Escrow Amount shall be delivered to the
applicable Buyer Indemnified Parties upon delivery of joint
written instructions of Seller Parent and the Buyer or a court order with
respect to Actual Credit Losses, if any, that are due and owing to Buyer
Indemnified Parties under Section 6.7, it being understood that such
instructions shall be delivered to the Escrow Agent within the timeframes
contemplated by Section 6.7 with respect to Actual Credit Losses that are
payable by Seller Parent. The Escrow Agreement will provide that (i) if the
Escrow Amount being held by the Escrow Agent at any time exceeds the Actual
Credit Losses Cap, then the Buyer and Seller Parent shall deliver joint
written

 



-29-  instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to deliver
such excess amount to the Seller Parent and (ii) at the Actual Credit Losses
Claims Deadline, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Seller Parent the
then-remaining Escrow Amount, less any portion of such amount that is subject
to any claims for Actual Credit Losses that remain pending or unpaid.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.11, if
after the Escrow Amount is deposited with the Escrow Agent, Seller Parent
delivers evidence to the Buyer that the Liquidity of Seller Parent has
exceeded $15,000,000 for thirty (30) consecutive days, then the Buyer
and Seller Parent shall execute and deliver join written instructions to the
Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to deliver the Escrow Amount to
Seller Parent, it being understood and agreed that if thereafter and before
the expiration of the Actual Credit Losses Claims Deadline, the Liquidity of
Seller Parent again becomes less than $15,000,000 for more than three (3)
consecutive Business Days, the Seller Parent shall provide a Liquidity Notice
to the Buyer in the timeframe set forth above and the provisions of this
Section 5.11 (for clarity, including Buyers right to deliver an Escrow
Notice) shall apply. Each of the Buyer and Seller Parent shall pay fifty
percent (50%) of any escrow fees under the Escrow Agreement.

ARTICLE VI

 

INDEMNIFICATION

 

Section 6.1 _Survival_. The representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of Sellers and Buyer contained in this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements (other than the Fundamental Representations) and any certificate
delivered pursuant hereto or thereto, and a partys ability to make claims
with respect thereto, shall survive the Closing for a period of fifteen (15)
months after the Closing Date (the "Claims Deadline"), and no claims (other
than with respect to the Fundamental Representations) may be made with respect
thereto after the Claims Deadline; it being understood that in the event
notice of any claim for indemnification under Section 6.2 or 6.3 hereof has
been given (in accordance with Section 6.4) on or prior to the Claims
Deadline, the representations, warranties and/or covenants that are
the subject of such indemnification claim shall survive with respect to such
claim (and solely with respect to such claim) until such time as such claim is
finally resolved; provided further that the Fundamental Representations and a
partys ability to make claims with respect thereto shall survive the Closing
until the fifth anniversary of the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, the
parties acknowledge and agree that the Claims Deadline is intended to shorten
the period otherwise provided by Law during which claims for breach of
representations, warranties and covenants, can be made, and that any such
claims (other than with respect to Fundamental Representations) must be made
on or prior to the Claims Deadline or be forever barred.

Section 6.2 _Indemnification by Sellers and Seller Parent_. From and after
Closing, Sellers and Seller Parent shall save, defend, indemnify and hold
harmless Buyer and its Affiliates, successors and assigns of each of the
foregoing (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified Parties") from and against any
and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, interest, awards,
judgments, penalties, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees, costs and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in investigating or
defending any Third Party Claim, but excluding all such fees, costs and
expenses to the extent relating to the investigation, documentation and
prosecution of claims that are not Third Party Claims unless awarded to the
Indemnified Party in connection with the final determination of a
disputed indemnification claim) (hereinafter collectively, "Losses") to the
extent arising out of or resulting from:

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Sellers contained in
this Agreement or made by Sellers in any Ancillary Agreement or certificate
delivered in connection with this Agreement;

 



-30- (b) any breach of any covenant or other agreement by Sellers contained in this
Agreement or by Sellers contained in any Ancillary Agreement; and

(c) any Excluded Liability.

 

In addition, the Sellers and Seller Parent shall indemnify the Buyer
Indemnified Parties for Actual Credit Losses in accordance with Section 6.7.
The Buyer, the Sellers and the Seller Parent acknowledge and agree that the
terms, conditions, limitations and procedures set forth in Sections 6.1
through 6.6 do not apply to Section 6.7, and the terms,
conditions, limitations and procedures set forth in Section 6.7 do not apply
to any claim for indemnification under this Agreement other than claims for
Actual Credit Losses.

 

Section 6.3 _Indemnification by Buyer_. From and after Closing, Buyer shall
save, defend, indemnify and hold harmless Sellers and their Affiliates,
direct and indirect equity holders, owners, general partners, managers and
members of Sellers or its Affiliates, and their respective successors and
assigns of each of the foregoing (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified
Parties") from and against any and all Losses to the extent arising out of or
resulting from:

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer contained in
this Agreement or in any Ancillary Agreement or certificate of Buyer delivered
in connection with this Agreement;

 

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement by Buyer contained in this
Agreement or in any Ancillary Agreement;

 

(c) any Assumed Liability; and

 

(d) any unsuccessful indemnification claim by Buyer against Sellers pursuant
to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.

 

Section 6.4 _Procedures_.

 

(a) A Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party (each, an
"Indemnified Party") shall make each claim for indemnification under this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement in respect of, arising out of or
involving a Loss, including with respect to a claim or demand made by any
Person other than Buyer, Sellers or their respective Affiliates (a "Third
Party") against such Indemnified Party (a "Third Party Claim"), by delivering
written notice of such indemnification claim to the party against whom
indemnity is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") promptly after becoming aware
of the Loss (if the claim is unrelated to a Third Party Claim) or promptly
after receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice of the Third Party
Claim (if the claim relates to a Third Party Claim). Such notice shall
describe in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances giving rise to any
claim for indemnification hereunder, the amount and the method of computation
of the amount of such claim (if known) and such other information with
respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The failure
to provide such notice, however, shall not release the Indemnifying Party from
any of its obligations under this Article VI except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice to the
Indemnified Party, to assume the defense thereof at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
have the

 



-31- _ _ right to employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense
thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of
the Indemnified Party; _provided, however,_ that if in the reasonable opinion
of counsel for the Indemnified Party, there is a conflict of interest between
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall
be responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel to such
Indemnified Party in connection with such defense. If the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense and, subject
to Section 5.2(b), make available to the Indemnifying Party all witnesses,
pertinent records, materials and information in the Indemnified Partys
possession or under the Indemnified Partys control relating thereto as
is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party. Whether or not the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or
discharge, or offer to settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party
Claim without the Indemnifying Partys prior written consent, which may be
granted or withheld in the Indemnifying Partys sole discretion. The
Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, which may be granted or withheld in the Indemnified Partys
sole discretion, settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise any Third
Party Claim on a basis that would result in (i) the imposition of a consent
order, injunction or decree that would restrict the future activity or conduct
of the Indemnified Party, (ii) a finding or admission of a violation of Law or
violation of the rights of any Person by the Indemnified Party, (iii) a
finding or admission that would have an adverse effect on other claims made or
threatened against the Indemnified Party, or (iv) any monetary liability of
the Indemnified Party that shall not be promptly paid or reimbursed by the
Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.4(b) to the
contrary, Sellers shall control the defense and settlement of any audit or
Action relating to the Tax Returns for Sellers for all Pre-Closing Tax
Periods. _ _

(c) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against any
Indemnifying Party hereunder that does not involve a Third Party Claim being
asserted against or sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such claim promptly to the
Indemnifying Party, describing in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to
any claim for indemnification hereunder, the amount or method of computation
of the amount of such claim (if known) and such other information with respect
thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The failure to
provide such notice, however, shall not release the Indemnifying Party from
any of its obligations under this Article VI except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnified Party shall
reasonably cooperate and assist the Indemnifying Party in determining the
validity of any claim for indemnity by the Indemnified Party and in otherwise
resolving such matters. Such assistance and cooperation shall include
providing reasonable access to and copies of information, records
and documents relating to such matters, furnishing employees to assist in the
investigation, defense and resolution of such matters and providing legal and
business assistance with respect to such matters.

 

Section 6.5 _Limits on Indemnification_.

 

(a) No claim may be asserted against either party for breach of any
representation, warranty, or covenant contained in this Agreement or
the Ancillary Agreements or any certificate delivered hereto or thereto, or
with respect to any Excluded Liability, unless written notice of such claim
made in accordance with Section 6.4(a) is received by such party on or prior
to the Claims Deadline, in which case such representation, warranty, covenant
or claim with respect to such Excluded Liability shall survive as to such
claim until such claim has been finally resolved.

 



-32- (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement:

 

(i) neither Sellers or Seller Parent, on the one hand, nor Buyer on the other
hand, shall be liable to any Buyer Indemnified Party or Sellers Indemnified
Party, as applicable, for any claim for indemnification relating to breaches
of representations or warranties (other than the Fundamental Representations)
unless and until the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses that may
be recovered from Sellers or Seller Parent under Section 6.2(a) or Buyer
under Section 6.3(a), as applicable, equals or exceeds $100,000, in which case
Sellers and Seller Parent or Buyer, as applicable, shall be liable for all
such Losses; 

(ii) the maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be
recovered by Buyer Indemnified Parties (other than with respect to the
Fundamental Representations) shall be an amount equal to five percent (5%) of
the Purchase Price (the "Cap");

 

(iii) no Losses may be claimed by any Buyer Indemnified Party under Section
6.2(a) or any Seller Indemnified Party under Section 6.3(a) or shall be
reimbursable by or shall be included in calculating the aggregate Losses set
forth in clause (i) above other than Losses in excess of $5,000 resulting from
any single claim or aggregated claims arising out of the same facts, events
or circumstances; provided that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to
any claim based on a Fundamental Representation;

 

(iv) Sellers shall not be obligated to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Party
with respect to any Loss to the extent that such Loss was included in the
Final Closing Statement (as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.7); and

(v) no party hereto shall have any liability under any provision of this
Agreement for any punitive, incidental, consequential, special or indirect
damages, including business interruption, loss of future revenue, profits or
income, or other damages calculated on the basis of any multiple relating to
the breach or alleged breach of this Agreement, or any other damages other
than damages that constitute actual damages.

 

(c) For all purposes of this Agreement, Losses shall be reduced by (i) any
insurance or other recoveries paid to the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates
in connection with the facts giving rise to the right of indemnification and
(ii) any Tax benefit actually realized by such Indemnified Party or its
Affiliates with respect to such Losses. Buyer shall seek full recovery under
all applicable insurance policies and other collateral sources covering any
Loss to the same extent as it would if such Loss were not subject to
indemnification hereunder and reimburse Sellers or Seller Parent for any such
recovery (net of any out of pocket expenses or costs incurred in procuring
such recovery) up to the extent of any indemnification payment received by
Buyer for such Loss. Nothing in this Section 6.5(c) shall delay an Indemnified
Partys ability to make a claim for indemnification or an Indemnifying
Partys obligation to make payment therefor. Any payment under this Article VI
shall initially be made without regard to this Section 6.5(c) and shall be
reduced to reflect any such Tax benefit only after the Indemnified Party has
actually realized such benefit. For purposes of this Agreement, the
Indemnified Party shall be deemed to have actually realized a net Tax
benefit to the extent that, and at such time as, the amount of Taxes required
to be paid by the Indemnified Party is reduced below the amount of Taxes that
it would have been required to pay but for deductibility of such Losses, in
each case: (i) during the same Tax year as the year in which the relevant
Losses occurred and the immediately subsequent Tax year; and (ii) calculated
so that the items related to the Indemnifying Partys indemnification
obligations are the last to be recognized in each such Tax year.

 



 



-33- (d) Buyer and Sellers shall cooperate with each other with respect to
resolving any claim or liability with respect to which one party is obligated
to indemnify the other party hereunder, including by making commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate or resolve any such claim or liability. In the
event that Buyer or Seller shall fail to make such commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate or resolve any claim or liability, then notwithstanding
anything else to the contrary contained herein, the other party shall not be
required to indemnify any person for any loss, liability, claim, damage or
expense that could reasonably be expected to have been avoided if Buyer or
Sellers, as the case may be, had made such efforts.

 

(e) Each Buyer Indemnified Party shall seek payment of any amount to which it
may be entitled under this Article VI from Sellers or Seller Parent.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (i) the
limitations set forth in this Section 6.5 shall not be applicable to any
Losses incurred as a result of knowing and intentional breach of covenant
committed by or on behalf of Sellers, and (ii) no Persons liability shall be
limited in any way for such Persons intentional fraud under Delaware common
law with respect to such Persons representations and warranties set forth in
this Agreement.

 

Section 6.6 _Assignment of Claims_. If any Buyer Indemnified Party receives
any payment with respect to any Losses pursuant to Section 6.2 and Buyer
Indemnified Party could have recovered all or a part of such Losses from a
third party (a "Potential Contributor") based on the underlying claim asserted
against Sellers, Buyer Indemnified Party shall assign, on a non-recourse
basis and without any representation or warranty, such of its rights to
proceed against the Potential Contributor as are necessary to permit Sellers
to recover from the Potential Contributor the amount of such payment.
Any payment received in respect of such claim shall be distributed: (i)
first, to Buyer Indemnified Party in the amount of any deductible or similar
amount required to be paid by Buyer Indemnified Party prior to Sellers being
required to make any payment to Buyer Indemnified Party; (ii) second, to
Sellers in an amount equal to the aggregate payments made by Sellers to Buyer
Indemnified Party in respect of such Loss, plus costs and expenses (including
attorneys costs and expenses) incurred in investigating, defending or
otherwise incurred in connection with addressing such claim; and (iii) the
balance, if any, to Buyer Indemnified Party.

 

Section 6.7 _Indemnification With Respect to Actual Credit Losses_.

 

(a) _General_. From and after the Closing and until the Actual Credit Losses
Claims Deadline, the Sellers and the Seller Parent shall save, defend,
indemnify and hold the Buyer Indemnified Parties harmless from Actual Credit
Losses, subject to the terms, limitations and conditions set forth in this
Section 6.7 (including without limitation, the Actual Credit Losses Cap
in effect from time to time); _provided_ _that_ neither any Seller nor Seller
Parent shall have any responsibility with respect to Actual Credit Losses
unless the Sellers and Seller Parent were provided the opportunity to
repurchase the applicable Covered Asset in accordance with this Section 6.7,
and the Sellers and Seller Parent affirmatively elected to decline to
repurchase such Covered Asset in accordance with this Section 6.7 or the
Exercise Period with respect to such Covered Asset expired prior to the
delivery by a Seller or the Seller Parent of an election to repurchase such
Covered Asset. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree
that the Applicable Credit Losses Claims Deadline is intended to shorten the
period otherwise provided by Law during which claims for Actual Credit Losses
can be made, and that any such claims must be made on or prior to the Actual
Credit Losses Claims Deadline, subject to the last sentence of the definition
of "Actual Credit Losses Cap". Buyer, on behalf of all Buyer Indemnified
Parties, hereby acknowledges and agrees that sales by Buyer of Covered Assets
that are not Defaulted Covered Assets below par and discounted payoffs or
any other type of discretionary transactions with respect to Covered Assets
that are not Defaulted Covered Assets will not entitle the Buyer Indemnified
Parties to indemnification under this Section 6.7 or otherwise unless agreed
to in writing by Sellers or Seller Parent.

 



-34- (b) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement, the following capitalized
terms shall have the following meanings:

(i) "Actual Credit Losses" means with respect to a Covered Asset the actual
charge-off with respect to a Defaulted Covered Asset calculated in accordance
with GAAP and applicable regulatory guidance ("Charge-Off"), in each case
occurring only at one or more of the following times: (A) 120 days after the
occurrence and only during the continuance of an uncured payment default with
respect to a Defaulted Covered Asset, (B) the sale of a Defaulted Covered
Asset to a third party resulting in a Charge-Off, (C) a Charge-Off resulting
from liquidation of the Defaulted Covered Asset to the extent such loss
exceeds the aggregate amount of Charge-Offs previously taken with respect to
such Defaulted Covered Asset, or (D) at such time that Buyer is, for any
reason, directed by any regulator with supervisory jurisdiction over Buyer to
take a Charge-Off with respect to a Defaulted Covered Asset. For the avoidance
of doubt, Actual Credit Losses shall include (x) any remaining valuation
adjustments resulting from purchase accounting, (y) all earned but unpaid
interest, and (z) all reasonable costs incurred by Buyer in connection with
the resolution of the Defaulted Covered Asset as of the date of the Actual
Credit Loss Indemnification Notice.

 

(ii) "Actual Credit Losses Cap" means, initially, $10,000,000, but shall be
reduced each year as follows:

 

(A) on December 31, 2017, the remaining Actual Credit Losses Cap is reduced to
$8,000,000 unless more than $2,000,000 in aggregate claims (net of Repurchase
Reductions and net of Recoveries) have been made under Section 6.7 as of such
date, in which case the remaining Actual Credit Losses Cap as of such date
will be $10,000,000 less the aggregate amount of such prior claims (net of
Repurchase Reductions and net of Recoveries);

(B) on December 31, 2018, the remaining Actual Credit Losses Cap is reduced
to $5,000,000 unless more than $5,000,000 in aggregate claims (net of
Repurchase Reductions and net of Recoveries) have been made under Section 6.7
as of such date, in which case the Actual Credit Losses Cap as of such date
will be $10,000,000 less the aggregate amount of such prior claims (net of
Repurchase Reductions and net of Recoveries);

 

(C) on December 31, 2019, the remaining Actual Credit Losses Cap is reduced to
$3,000,000 unless more than $7,000,000 in aggregate claims (net of Repurchase
Reductions and net of Recoveries) have been made under Section 6.7 as of such
date, in which case the remaining Actual Credit Losses Cap as of such date
will be $10,000,000 less the aggregate amount of such prior claims (net of
Repurchase Reductions and net of Recoveries); and

(D) on December 31, 2020, the Actual Credit Losses Cap is reduced to $0.

For the avoidance of doubt, upon the occurrence of (i) the payoff after
Closing of the entire Loans and Leases constituting Covered Assets, (ii)
indemnification payments in respect of Actual Credit Losses totaling
$10,000,000 or (iii) the expiration of the Actual Credit Losses Claims
Deadline, neither the 

 



-35-  Sellers nor the Parent shall have any further obligation with respect to
Actual Credit Losses under Section 6.7 or otherwise. Any repurchase by any
Seller or Seller Parent of a Covered Asset shall reduce the remaining
indemnification obligation of Sellers and Seller Parent as of the date of such
repurchase by the amount that Buyer would have made subject to a Charge-Off in
accordance with GAAP if the Charge-Off occurred on the date of repurchase by
any Seller or Seller Parent ("Repurchase Reductions"). The remaining Actual
Credit Losses Cap as of the date of payment of any Recoveries by Buyer to
Seller or Seller Parent shall be increased by the amount of such payment
(provided that no such increase shall cause the remaining Actual Credit Losses
Cap to exceed the amount of the remaining Actual Credit Losses Cap as of the
most recently passed reduction date set forth above in Sections (A)
through (D) of this definition). Any reduction in the Actual Credit Losses
Cap based solely on the passage of time shall not apply to Actual Credit
Losses with respect to Covered Assets that became Defaulted Covered Assets
prior to the date triggering such reduction (to the extent the Actual Credit
Losses Cap exceeded such Actual Credit Losses as of the date any such Covered
Asset became a Defaulted Covered Asset), but only if an Actual Claim Loss
Indemnification Notice is delivered to the Seller Parent with respect to such
Covered Asset within one hundred twenty (120) days after such Covered Assets
became Defaulted Covered Assets.

 

(iii) "Actual Credit Losses Claims Deadline" means December 31, 2020, subject
to the limitations applicable thereto (including the reduction of the Actual
Credit Losses Cap over time as set forth in the definition thereof, and
subject to the last sentence of the definition of "Actual Credit Losses Cap");

 

(iv) "Charge-Off" has the meaning ascribed to such term in the definition of
Actual Credit Losses;

 

(v) "Covered Assets" means the Loans and Leases included in the Transferred
Assets at Closing, excluding any extensions of credit or increases to Loan or
Lease commitments made subsequently to Closing;

(vi) "Defaulted Covered Asset" means a Covered Asset under which the
applicable lessee or borrower is in default under the terms of the applicable
Loan and Lease Document; provided that _if_ (A) an applicable lessee or
borrower files for bankruptcy protection, (B) the applicable Loan or Lease is
affirmed in connection with such proceeding and (C) the applicable lessee or
borrower continues to make payments required under the applicable Loan and
Lease Document, _then_ such Loan and Lease shall not be deemed to constitute
a Defaulted Covered Asset under this Agreement unless the Buyer is directed by
a regulator to treat the applicable Covered Asset as being in default;

 

(vii) "Material Downgrade" means (i) a risk rating downgrade resulting from a
material deterioration in credit performance or (ii) a material
underperformance regarding collection and creditworthiness taken on the books
and records of Buyer with respect to a Covered Asset;

 

(viii) "Net Investment in Receivables" has the meaning given such term in
Section 1.1;

 

(ix) "Recoveries" shall mean cash recovered in respect of a Loan and Lease,
including, without limitation, any cash recovered as a consequence of the
receipt of residuals, that was the subject of a Charge-Off hereunder, net of
unpaid interest under the applicable Loan and Lease owed to Buyer and all
expenses and fees reasonably incurred by Buyer in connection with the
resolution of such Loan and Lease (including expenses and fees in connection
with the collection of such residuals, but excluding any expenses and fees
already included in the Actual Credit Loss), in each case not to exceed the
amount of any indemnity payment made to any Buyer Indemnified Party by any
Seller or Seller Parent in respect of such Loan and Lease.

 



-36- (c) _Procedures_.

 

(i) Buyer shall promptly provide Seller Parent with written notice of any
Material Downgrade and any fact, condition, change or circumstance which
individually or in the aggregate with previously existing facts, conditions,
changes or circumstances causes any Covered Asset to become a Defaulted
Covered Asset, such notice to be delivered no later than five (5) days after
Buyer becomes aware of the Material Downgrade or other such fact, condition,
change or circumstance. Buyer shall also notify Seller Parent in writing no
later than five (5) days after Buyer becomes aware of any bankruptcy or other
insolvency event affecting any lessee or borrower under any Covered Asset.
Buyer shall include with any notice delivered pursuant to this Section
6.7(c)(i) an asset monitoring report that contains a comprehensive financial
summary of the Defaulted Covered Asset and any proposed workout and
resolution strategy (it being understood that no workout or resolution
strategy may be available at such time with respect to a Defaulted Covered
Asset).

 

(ii) Buyer shall provide to Seller Parent written notice no later than five
(5) days after (A) Buyer becomes aware that a Covered Asset has become ninety
(90) days past due, indicating that such Covered Asset has been placed on non-
accrual status or (B) a Covered Asset becomes the subject of a Charge-Off,
which notice shall set forth the amount of the actual Charge-Off with respect
to such Covered Asset, together with comprehensive supporting documentation
for the calculation of the Charge-Off (each, a "Charge-Off Notice"). Buyer
shall include with any Charge-Off Notice an asset monitoring report that
contains a comprehensive financial summary of the Defaulted Covered Asset and
any proposed workout and resolution strategy (it being understood that no
workout or resolution strategy may be available at such time with respect to
a Defaulted Covered Asset).

(iii) If any Seller or Seller Parent does not exercise its right to repurchase
a Covered Asset under Section 6.7(d) below, then, if Buyer seeks
indemnification under this Section 6.7, Buyer shall provide prompt written
notice to Seller Parent of any Actual Credit Losses with respect to such
Covered Asset, together with a request for indemnification under this Section
6.7 (an "Actual Credit Loss Indemnification Notice"), which, for the avoidance
of doubt, may not be delivered until the expiration of the applicable Exercise
Period.

 

(iv) A Seller or Seller Parent shall pay Buyer any Actual Credit Loss with
respect to a Covered Asset no later than thirty (30) days after Seller
Parents receipt of an Actual Credit Loss Indemnification Notice, unless a
Seller or Seller Parent have elected to repurchase the applicable Covered
Asset in accordance with Section 6.7(d).

 

(v) Buyer shall, and shall cause its applicable Affiliates to, pay to Seller
Parent any Recoveries no later than thirty (30) days following receipt
thereof.

(d) _Repurchase Right_. If (i) a Material Downgrade occurs, (ii) a Charge-Off
Notice is delivered to Seller Parent in accordance with Section 6.7(c)(ii),
or (iii) Buyer proposes selling a Defaulted Covered Asset (in each case that
has not already be subject to the repurchase right set forth in this Section
6.7(d)) at a price that would result in an indemnification claim for Actual
Credit Losses (in which case, the Buyer shall provide Seller Parent with
notice of such proposed sale, which notice shall include the price for such
proposed sale and the resulting Actual Credit Losses that would result
therefrom), _then_ in lieu of making an indemnity payment for Actual Credit
Loss, Seller Parent may, within 10 Business Days from the date of receipt of
such notice (the "Exercise Period"), provide written

 



-37-  notice to Buyer of its intention to exercise its right to repurchase such
Defaulted Covered Asset at a price equal to the then-current Net Investment in
Receivables with respect to such Covered Asset (including any remaining
valuation adjustment resulting from purchase accounting but excluding any
accrued but unpaid late charges and fees that would have the effect of
increasing the calculation of Net Investment in Receivables). At
its election, Seller Parent may cause Covered Assets repurchased by any
Seller or Seller Parent to continue to be serviced and worked out by Buyer at
market rates as charged by on-the-run equipment finance asset-backed
securitization issuers. In the case of clause (iii) of this Section 6.7(d),
if Seller Parent does not notify Buyer of its intent to repurchase such
Defaulted Covered Asset before the expiration of the Exercise Period, Buyer
may, during the subsequent seventy-five (75)-day period, sell the applicable
Defaulted Covered Asset and shall provide Seller with an Actual Credit Loss
Indemnification Notice in the amount of the Actual Credit Loss resulting from
such sale, and Seller shall make payment of such amount within thirty (30)
days of receipt thereof.

(e) _Applicable Limitations; Mitigation_. The provisions of Sections
6.5(b)(iv)-(v) and 6.5(c) are hereby incorporated into this Section 6.7 and
thereby made applicable to claims for Actual Credit Losses. In furtherance,
and not in limitation, of the foregoing, Buyer shall use reasonable best
efforts to follow its collection practices and procedures with respect to
Covered Assets in accordance with applicable regulatory and accounting
standards.

 

(f) _Ongoing Buyer Reporting Obligations_. Buyer shall deliver to Seller
Parent quarterly Loan and Lease status reports regarding the Covered Assets,
and Buyer and Seller Parent shall conduct quarterly Covered Asset portfolio
review telephonic update calls (to be scheduled in advance and subject to
cancellation or postponement if both Buyer and Seller Parent mutually agree
that such a call is not necessary for any given quarter) and until the
earlier to occur of the expiration of the Actual Credit Loss Claims Deadline
or the reduction of the remaining Actual Credit Losses Cap to zero. The
foregoing status reports shall include with respect to the Covered Assets,
among other items, notices of any Material Downgrade, financial statements,
financial projections, a summary description of financial performance,
financial and credit metrics, risk ratings, risk rating migration, allowances
and reserves, equipment descriptions, depreciation curves, NOLVs, collateral
coverage measures and any applicable exit, disposition and/or workout
strategies.

 

Section 6.8 _Exclusive Remedy_. After Closing the indemnification provisions
contained in this Article VI shall constitute the sole and exclusive recourse
and remedy of the parties for monetary damages for matters arising under this
Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements, and the Transactions, including with
respect to any breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, with
respect to any statements, communications, disclosures, failures to disclose,
representations or warranties not set forth in this Agreement, or with respect
to Losses resulting from, arising out of, or caused by Excluded Liabilities.
All representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement are contractual
in nature only and subject to the sole and exclusive remedies set forth
herein. No Person is asserting the accuracy of any representation and
warranty set forth in this Agreement; rather the parties have agreed that
should any representations and warranties of any party prove inaccurate, the
other party shall, subject to this Section 6.8, have the specific rights and
remedies herein specified as the exclusive remedy therefore, but that no other
rights, remedies or causes of action (whether in law or in equity or whether
in contract or in tort) are permitted to any party as a result of
the inaccuracy of any such representation and warranty. The provisions of
this Section 6.8, together with the provisions of Sections 3.23, 4.8 and 7.11
and the remedies and limitations specified in Article VI and Section 7.13,
were specifically bargained-for between Buyer and Sellers and were taken into
account by Buyer and Sellers in agreeing to the amount of the Base Purchase
Price, the adjustments thereto and the other terms and conditions hereof.
Sellers have specifically relied upon the provisions of this Section 6.8,
together with the provisions of Sections 3.23,

 



-38-  4.8 and 7.11 and the remedies and limitations specified in Article VI and
Section 7.13, in agreeing to the Base Purchase Price, the adjustments thereto
and the other terms and conditions hereof, including in agreeing to provide
the specific representations and warranties set forth herein. The provisions
of this Article VI are in lieu and substitution of any other remedies,
recourse or entitlements that the parties may have, including common law
claims and damages and statutory rights of contribution, it being agreed that
such other remedies, recourse and entitlements are expressly waived and
released by the parties to the fullest extent permitted by law. The
provisions of this Article VI will not, however, restrict the right of any
party to seek specific performance or other equitable remedies in connection
with any breach of any of the covenants contained in this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement.

 

Section 6.9 _Payments ; Disputes_. The Indemnifying Party shall pay all
amounts payable pursuant to this Article VI by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, promptly (and in any case within the applicable time periods
set forth in this Article VI) following receipt from an Indemnified Party of a
written payment request, together with all accompanying reasonably
detailed back-up documentation, for each Loss that is the subject of
indemnification hereunder. To the extent the Indemnifying Party in good faith
disputes the Loss or a portion thereof, in which event it shall so notify the
Indemnified Party and shall promptly make payment of the amount of such Loss
that is not in dispute. The parties shall endeavor in good faith to resolve
any dispute within 30 days of the delivery of such notice to the Indemnified
Party. In any event, the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified
Party (or as directed by the Indemnifying Party), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, the amount of any Loss for which it is liable
hereunder no later than three business days following any final determination
of such Loss and the Indemnifying Partys liability therefor. A "final
determination" shall exist when the parties to the dispute have reached an
agreement in writing, or a court of competent jurisdiction shall have entered
a final and non-appealable order or judgment. The preceding sentences of this
Section 6.9 shall not apply to Section 6.7, which the parties acknowledge and
agree provides for conditions to, and the timing of, payment obligations with
respect to Actual Credit Losses. All payments made by an Indemnifying Party to
an Indemnified Party under this Article VI shall be treated as adjustments to
the Purchase Price for Tax purposes unless otherwise required by Law.

 

ARTICLE VII

conduct, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right or power. Except as otherwise provided herein, the rights and

upon and inure solely to the benefit of each of the parties and their
respective successors and assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or

ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS SHALL BE

-41- Section 7.9 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties irrevocably agrees
that any legal action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect hereof
brought by the other party or its successors or assigns shall be brought and
determined in federal court sitting in the United States District Court for

unconditionally, with regard to any such action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement and the Transactions (and agrees not
to commence any action, suit or proceeding relating thereto except in such

of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions: (a) any claim that it is
not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any
reason other than the failure lawfully to serve process, (b) any claim that it
or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or
from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of
notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of

is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or

contained in the Disclosure Schedules or in this Agreement, the information
and disclosures contained in any Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be
disclosed and incorporated by reference in any other Disclosure Schedule as
though fully set forth in such Disclosure Schedule for which applicability of
such information and disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face. The fact
that any item of information is disclosed in any Disclosure Schedule shall not
be construed to mean that such information is required to be disclosed
by this Agreement. Such information and the dollar thresholds set forth
herein shall not be used as a basis for interpreting the terms "material" or
"Material Adverse Effect" or other similar terms in this Agreement. In
addition, the fact that any disclosure in the Disclosure Schedules is not
required to be disclosed in order to render the applicable representation or
warranty to which it relates true, or that the absence of such disclosure in
the Disclosure Schedules would not constitute a breach of such representation
or warranty, shall not be deemed or construed to expand the scope of any
representation or warranty hereunder or to establish a standard of disclosure
in respect of any representation or warranty. The information contained in
the Disclosure Schedules is disclosed solely for purposes of the Agreement,
and no information contained in the Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to be
an admission by any party to any third party of any matter
whatsoever (including any violation of applicable Law or breach of contract).

create or be deemed to create or permit any personal liability or obligation

reason of, the Transactions, including any alleged non-disclosure or
misrepresentations made by Sellers.

rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be directly or
indirectly assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of law or
otherwise, by any party without the prior written consent of the other parties
(excluding the assigning partys affiliates), and any such assignment without
such prior written consent shall be null and void; provided, that (a) Sellers
may assign any of their rights or interests in this Agreement, including the
right to receive the Purchase Price, to one or more Affiliates of Sellers and
(b) Sellers may collaterally assign their rights hereunder to its lenders (or
agent thereof), in each case without the prior consent of Buyer; and provided
further, that no assignment shall limit the assignors obligations hereunder.

Section 7.13 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. Accordingly, each of the parties shall be entitled to specific
performance of the terms hereof, including an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in federal court sitting in the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware (or, if such court lacks subject
matter jurisdiction, in the Delaware Court of Chancery or the Delaware
Superior Court), this being in addition to any other remedy to which the
parties are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties further
hereby waives (a) any defense in any action for specific performance that a
remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any requirement under any law to post
security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. To the extent any
party hereto brings any Action to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions of this Agreement when expressly available to such party
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Termination Date shall
automatically be extended by (i) the amount of time during which such Action
is pending, plus twenty Business Days, or (ii) such other time period
established by the court presiding over such Action.

 

Section 7.14 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not
affect any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction,
and this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such
jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or
portion of any provision had never been contained herein.

Section 7.15 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS.

(including by facsimile transmission or by means of portable document format
(pdf) transmission) in one or more counterparts, each of which when executed
shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same agreement.

 

Section 7.17 No _Presumption Against Drafting Party_. Each of Buyer and
Sellers acknowledge that each party to this Agreement has been represented by
counsel in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions. Accordingly,
any rule of law or any legal decision that would require interpretation of any
claimed ambiguities in this Agreement against the drafting party has
no application and is expressly waived.

 



-43- Section 7.18 _Further Assurances_. Each party covenants that at any time, and
from time to time, after the Closing Date, it will execute such additional
instruments and take such actions as may be reasonable requested by the other
party to confirm, perfect or otherwise carry out the intent and purposes of
this Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement.
