(D) UPS intends to merge with TNT by way of a recommended public offer (
_openbaar bod_ ) to be made by UPS or a wholly-owned subsidiary of UPS in
respect of all ordinary shares of TNT as further described in this Merger
Protocol (the _Offer_ and, together with the transactions contemplated in
connection therewith, the  _Merger_ ).

(E) On 11 January 2012, UPS and TNT entered into a confidentiality agreement
(the _Confidentiality Agreement_ ).

(F) UPS and its advisors have performed a high level due diligence
investigation into certain legal, financial, commercial, regulatory, tax and
pension aspects of the TNT Group and its businesses based on the information
included in the data room prepared by TNT, follow-up questions and other
information provided to UPS or its advisors by or on behalf of TNT (the _Pre-
Signing Due Diligence_ ).

(G) At the date of this Merger Protocol, the authorised share capital of TNT
amounts to EUR 120,000,000, divided into 750,000,000 ordinary shares with a
nominal value of EUR 0.08 each and 750,000,000 preference shares with a

(H) On 15 March 2012, there were approximately 10,453,831 American Depositary

and together representing approximately 1.92% of the issued and outstanding
ordinary shares of TNT.

(I) At the date of this Merger Protocol, the issued share capital of TNT

(L) TNT has entered into an agreement with Stichting Continuiteit TNT Express
(the _Foundation_ ) dated 31 May 2011 (the  _Foundation Option Agreement_ ),
pursuant to which the Foundation has been granted a call option to acquire
from TNT such number of preference shares with a nominal value of EUR 0.08

as referred to in Schedule 4, paragraph (b) in the period between the date of

other distribution declared or made by TNT in respect of each Share (before
any applicable withholding tax).

immediately following its execution and in any event prior to the opening of
the first trading day on Euronext Amsterdam following the execution of this
Merger Protocol by way of a press release issued jointly by UPS and TNT (the
_Joint Announcement_ ). The AFM and Euronext Amsterdam will be provided with

(international) press-agents, the Socio-Economic Council ( _Sociaal-

Announcement is attached hereto as Schedule 2\.

Commencement Date

2.7 UPS shall make the Offer no later than on the earlier of: 



     | (a) | the fifth Business Day after the day on which Phase I
Competition Clearance from the European Commission has been obtained; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | if Phase I Competition Clearance has not been obtained, the
fifth Business Day after the day on which ten (10) Business Days have passed
after the commencement of the Phase II Investigation; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | the last day on which the Offer has to be made pursuant to
the Decree, 
---|---|--- 

subject in all cases to all Commencement Conditions being satisfied or waived
by UPS and/or TNT, as the case may be, in accordance with this Merger Protocol
(the date on which the Offer is made, the  _Commencement Date_ ).

Offer Period

2.8 UPS may, in its sole discretion, determine the duration of the acceptance
period ( _aanmeldingstermijn_ ) of the Offer (the _Offer Period_ ), provided
that the initial Offer Period shall be no less than eight (8) weeks and no
longer than ten (10) weeks (the last day of the Offer Period, the _Closing
Date_ ).

 

2.9 Immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer Period, TNT shall provide
a written confirmation to UPS that, to the best knowledge of the members of
the Executive Board, after having made reasonable enquiries, the Offer
Conditions set forth in clause 4.3(d) (no breach by TNT) and clause 4.3(h) (no
breach of public offer regulations) have been satisfied (or not, in which case
reasonable details as to the non-satisfaction shall be included in the
written confirmation) as of that time. Immediately prior to the expiration of
the Offer Period, UPS shall provide a written confirmation to TNT that, to the
best knowledge of the members of its executive board, after having made
reasonable enquiries, the Offer Conditions set forth in clause 4.3(e) (no
breach by UPS) and clause 4.3(h) (no breach of public offer regulations) have
been satisfied (or not, in which case reasonable details as to the non-

Page 4  _EXECUTION COPY_



 

2.10 If any Offer Condition is not satisfied or waived on the initial Closing
Date, UPS may, at its sole discretion, extend the initial Offer Period once,
provided that:



     | (a) | such extension of the initial Offer Period shall be no less
than two (2) weeks and no more than ten (10) weeks after the initial Closing
Date; and  
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | if the Offer Condition relating to competition clearance set
out in clause 4.3(b) is not satisfied or waived on the initial Closing Date,
UPS must extend the initial Offer Period for one or more periods of time
(subject to, in respect of an extension by more than one period, receipt of an
exemption granted by the AFM, to be requested by UPS) until such time as the
Parties reasonably believe is necessary to cause such Offer Condition to be
satisfied. 
---|---|--- 

Any request to the AFM for an exemption to extend the Offer Period more than
once, other than pursuant to clause 2.10(b), shall require the prior written
consent of TNT, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

If, at any point in time prior to the Long Stop Date (i) the AFM does not
grant an exemption to extend the Offer Period as a consequence of which the
Offer Period has lapsed without the Offer having been declared unconditional (
_gestand gedaan_ ) and (ii) the Offer Condition relating to competition
clearance set out in clause 4.3(b) is not yet satisfied or waived, but no
decision has yet been made or deemed to have been made by the European
Commission in respect of Phase II Competition Clearance, UPS shall promptly
launch a new public offer on the same terms and conditions as the Offer (and
such new offer will then be deemed to be the "Offer" for purposes of this
Agreement).

 

In case of one or more extensions of the Offer Period, all references to the
Closing Date shall, unless the context requires otherwise, be deemed to refer
to the latest date and time to which the Offer Period has been so extended.

2.11 If the Offer Conditions have been satisfied or waived in accordance with
the terms and conditions of this Merger Protocol, UPS shall publicly declare
the Offer unconditional no later than the third (3rd) Business Day after the
Closing Date (the _Unconditional Date_ ). Settlement is expected to occur
on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the Unconditional Date (the
_Settlement Date_ ).

2.12 In the event that UPS declares the Offer unconditional ( _gestand doet_
), UPS shall also publicly announce a post acceptance period ( _na-
aanmeldingstermijn_ ) of no more than two (2) weeks (the _Post Closing
Acceptance Period_ ) and accept, against payment of the Offer Price, each
Share that is validly tendered and not withdrawn within such period.

2.13 Nothing is this clause 2 shall limit the rights of UPS under article 15
paragraph 5 of the Decree. 

Offer Memorandum and Position Statement

2.14 On the Commencement Date, UPS shall make the offer memorandum (
_biedingsbericht_ ) (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the
_Offer Memorandum_ ) generally available in The Netherlands and in those
other jurisdictions in which the Parties agree or are obliged pursuant to the
Applicable Rules to make the Offer. UPS and TNT shall jointly announce the
availability of the Offer Memorandum and shall disseminate the Offer
Memorandum in the jurisdictions where the Offer is made in accordance with the
applicable laws and regulations in such jurisdictions.

2.15 The Offer Memorandum (and all transactions contemplated thereby) shall
comply as to form and substance in all respects with the Applicable Rules,
may include such additional information as the Parties reasonably agree should
be included and shall otherwise be consistent with commercial practice. The
Offer Memorandum shall be drafted by UPS. TNT shall be given sufficient
opportunity to review, comment upon and, except for sections solely relating
to,and/or being under the responsibility of, UPS, approve the Offer Memorandum
(which approval shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld). TNT, acting
reasonably, undertakes to timely provide all such information and data
relating to TNT and the TNT Group as is reasonably required to be included in
the Offer Memorandum. UPS and TNT will timely submit the Offer Memorandum to
the AFM for approval.

2.16 TNT will prepare the position statement pursuant to article 18 of the
Decree (the _Position Statement_ ), which, subject to the terms of this
Merger Protocol, shall set forth the Recommendation referred to in clause
3.1(b) and otherwise be consistent with this Merger Protocol and the Offer
Document, shall comply as to form and substance in all respects with the
Applicable Rules and may include such additional information as TNT reasonably
determines should be included therein. Subject to the terms of this Merger
Protocol, TNT will issue the Position Statement to holders of Shares as and to
the extent required by the Applicable Rules, it being agreed that, to the
extent permissible under the Applicable Rules, issuance of the Position
Statement will not take place until consultations with the Works Council have
been completed in accordance with the WOR.

2.17 Subject to the terms of this Merger Protocol, both the Offer Memorandum
and the Position Statement shall contain a statement of the Boards that they
unanimously support and recommend the Offer to the shareholders of TNT. The
Fairness Opinions referred to in clause 3.2 will be included in the Position
Statement.

2.18 Each Party shall provide all information as may reasonably be required by
the other Party to make the Offer Memorandum and the Position Statement true,
accurate and complete. Each Party shall be responsible for the information
provided by it.

2.19 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Merger Protocol and to the
extent reasonably possible, the Parties shall complete the Offer in accordance
with the timetable applicable to the Offer pursuant to the provisions of the
Decree.

relevant information) of any event or circumstance it may become aware of and
which would be likely to have material adverse consequences for the Offer,
including any significant adverse impact on the satisfaction of the
Commencement Conditions and/or the Offer Conditions, provided that any delay
in or absence of such notification by UPS shall not prejudice any of UPSs
rights under or pursuant to this Merger Protocol and that any delay in or the
absence of such notification by TNT shall not prejudice any of TNTs rights
under or pursuant to this Merger Protocol.

4.6 UPS shall have the primary responsibility, and take all steps required in
consultation with TNT and with the assistance of its advisors, to make all
necessary filings to obtain the EU Competition Clearance and the Other Key
Competition Clearances as soon as permitted and practicably feasible under the

approvals of the relevant competition authorities as soon as practicable. In
particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, UPS
shall:



     | (a) | submit a briefing paper to the European Commission setting

satisfactory to UPS, acting reasonably, shall be accepted.

This clause 4.6 shall apply equally to the provision of Commitments to the
competent authorities of a Member State if the European Commission makes a

     | (c) | provide TNT with drafts of all written communications
intended to be sent to any Regulatory Authority, give TNT a reasonable

Best Efforts

4.7 Without prejudice to clauses 4.5 and 4.6, UPS and TNT shall consult with
each other and each of UPS and TNT undertakes to use its best efforts to
procure the fulfilment of the Commencement Conditions and the Offer
Conditions as soon as reasonably practicable. If at any time a Party becomes
aware of a fact or circumstance that might prevent a Commencement Condition or
an Offer Condition from being satisfied, it shall immediately inform the
other Party in writing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
each of the Parties shall make all applications and notifications required by
the Commencement Conditions and the Offer Conditions and shall use its best
efforts to procure that all such information as is requested by the relevant
authorities in connection with any such applications and notifications is
provided as promptly as reasonably practicable.

Binding advice in relation to Material Adverse Effect

4.8 If UPS considers that the Commencement Condition set out in clause 4.1(a)
or the Offer Condition set out in clause 4.3(c), as the case may be, has not
been satisfied, UPS may give written notice thereof to TNT, together with its
explanations and, where practicable, supported by documentation.

4.9 If, following such notice, TNT disagrees with UPSs position, TNT shall
respond within three (3) Business Days in writing stating, in detail and
supported by documents where possible, that it disagrees with such
Commencement Condition or such Offer Condition, as the case may be, not having
been satisfied (a _Notice of Disagreement_ ). 

4.10 If TNT has sent a Notice of Disagreement to UPS in accordance with clause
4.9, UPS shall reply within three (3) Business Days in writing thereto
responding to the arguments raised by TNT in its Notice of Disagreement (a
_Counter-Notice of Disagreement_ ).

 

4.11 Either Party shall be entitled upon lapse of three (3) Business Days from
the Counter-Notice of Disagreement to submit the dispute in writing, with a
copy to the other Party, to a binding advisor ( _Binding Advisor_ ) who shall
settle the matter by way of binding advice ( _bindend advies_ ) ( _Binding
Advice_ ) under articles 7:900 et seq. of the DCC and in accordance with the
terms as set out in Schedule 5\.

4.12 The Binding Advisor shall be the President of the Enterprise Chamber (
_Ondernemingskamer_ ) of the Court of Appeals of Amsterdam. If such agreed
Binding Advisor is not able (for whatever reason) to provide the Binding
Advice within ten (10) Business Days, each Party shall be entitled to request
the President of the District Court of Amsterdam to appoint another
independent lawyer as a Binding Advisor within two (2) Business Days. The
Binding Advisor shall decide as binding advisor, not as arbitrator. The
Parties shall fully cooperate with the Binding Advisor and shall provide him
promptly with all information that he reasonably requires. The Binding Advice
shall be rendered within ten (10) Business Days after the dispute having been
referred to the Binding Advisor or such shorter period as the Parties may
agree. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if the Binding Advice relates to
an Offer Condition, the Binding Advice shall be rendered no later than noon
CET on the Business Day before the Unconditional Date. The Binding Advice
shall be final and binding upon the Parties and each of the Parties shall
fully comply with the Binding Advice and the content thereof.

 

Employee Clearances

4.13 The Offer will require the obtaining of a number of approvals,
clearances and other forms of consent or non-objection and the seeking and/or
obtaining of a number of (formal or informal) advices, opinions or points of
view from employee representatives, including those of the central works
council of TNT Nederland B.V. (previously named TNT Head Office B.V.) (the
_Works Council_ ), the European works council and trade unions (together: the
_Employee Clearances_ ).

 



Page 11  _EXECUTION COPY_



 

4.14 Each Party shall use its best efforts to ensure that the Employee
Clearances are obtained as soon as possible following the date of this Merger
Protocol. Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, the Parties
agree that TNT shall have the primary responsibility for, and take all steps
necessary, in consultation with UPS and its advisors, as soon as practicably
possible following the date of this Merger Protocol, to file for and obtain
all Employee Clearances. TNT agrees that it shall keep UPS and its advisors
informed on the preparation of the filings necessary to obtain the Employee
Clearances. In the context of obtaining Employee Clearances in connection with
the Offer, TNT shall not send any letter or other document, nor make any
submission and/or commitment, to the relevant employee representatives
without UPSs prior consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

4.15 Without limiting the generality of clause 4.14, TNT will take all action
reasonably necessary to initiate, conduct and finalise the consultations with
the Works Council and obtain the advice from the Works Council in respect of
the Offer prior to the Commencement Date, resolving such outstanding issues
in connection therewith as may reasonably be required to accept the advice of
the Works Council, in a manner satisfactory to TNT and UPS, acting reasonably.
TNT and UPS will consult with each other closely with a view to seeking and
obtaining the Works Councils advice and TNT will keep UPS informed on a
continuing basis on all material correspondence and consultations in respect
thereof. TNT will give (representatives of) UPS the opportunity to give a
presentation to the Works Council about UPS, its general strategy and its
general views on the position of employees within the UPS group, and UPS will
attend meetings with (representatives of) the Works Council if requested by
the Works Council.

 

4.16 The Parties acknowledge that, as from the date of this Merger Protocol
until the date on which the consultations with the Works Council will
have been completed in accordance with the WOR, the obligations of TNT and
the Boards in relation to the Recommendation as set out in this Merger
Protocol and all other obligations of TNT in connection with the Offer and the
Merger as set out in this Merger Protocol are of a conditional nature (
_voorwaardelijk karakter_ ) only and in all respects subject to proper
completion of the Works Council consultation process. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, if consultations with the Works Council have not
yet been completed in accordance with the WOR by the Commencement Date, the
Offer Document will not contain the Recommendation, but will only set out the
conditional intention of the Boards to recommend the Offer to
TNTs shareholders for acceptance.



   5. | STRATEGY AND FINANCING 
---|--- 

5.1 The Parties intend to integrate and align their respective businesses to
fully benefit from the global reach, scale and resources of the Combined
Group, in order to provide a compelling growth platform and enhance the
Parties capabilities to service customers in a reliable and cost-efficient
way throughout the world.

5.2 UPS will finance the Offer through existing cash reserves and current and
new debt arrangements and will timely make a certain funds announcement as
required by article 7 paragraph 4 of the Decree.

 



   6. | GOVERNANCE

6.1 As soon as possible after completion of the Offer, the Parties will seek

---|---|--- 
 



Page 12  _EXECUTION COPY_



      | (b) | have UPS, or any of its Affiliates, acquire all Shares not

For as long as TNT remains listed on Euronext Amsterdam, it shall continue to
comply with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code (except for (i) current
deviations from the aforementioned code in accordance with the "explain"
requirement in respect of such deviations, (ii) deviations from the
aforementioned code that find their basis in this Merger Protocol) and (iii)
deviations as a result of resolutions adopted by TNTs general meeting of
shareholders scheduled for 11 April 2012).

6.2 If, following the Settlement Date, UPS and its Affiliates, alone or
together with TNT, hold at least 95% of the Shares, UPS will commence a
compulsory acquisition procedure ( _uitkoopprocedure_ ) in accordance with
article 2:92a or 2:201a of the DCC or the takeover buy-out procedure in
accordance with article 2:359c of the DCC to buy out the holders of Shares
that have not tendered their Shares under the Offer. TNT shall provide UPS
with any assistance as may reasonably be required, including, if needed,
joining such proceedings as co-claimant.

6.3 Without prejudice to clauses 6.1 and 6.2, UPS shall be entitled to effect
or cause to effect any other restructuring of the TNT Group for the purpose of
achieving an optimal operational, legal, financial and/or fiscal structure in
accordance with the Merger Rules and Dutch law in general, some of which may
have the (side) effect of diluting the interest of any remaining minority
shareholders of TNT ( _Post-Closing Measures_ ), including:

 



     | (a) | a sale of all, or substantially all, of the assets and
liabilities of TNT to UPS or an Affiliate of UPS; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | a subsequent public offer for any Shares held by minority
shareholders; 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | a statutory cross-border or domestic (bilateral or
triangular) legal merger ( _juridische (driehoeks-) fusie_ ) in accordance
with article 2:309 et seq of the DCC between TNT, UPS and/or one or more
Affiliate of UPS; 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | a statutory legal demerger ( _juridische splitsing_ ) of TNT

     | (e) | a contribution of cash and/or assets by UPS or by any
Affiliate of UPS in exchange for Shares or preference shares in TNTs share
capital, in which circumstances the pre-emptive rights ( _voorkeursrechten_
), if any, of minority shareholders of TNT could be excluded; 
---|---|--- 



     | (f) | a distribution of proceeds, cash and/or assets to the
shareholders of TNT; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (g) | a sale and transfer of assets and liabilities by UPS or any
of its Affiliates to any member of the TNT Group, or a sale and transfer of
assets and liabilities by any member of the TNT Group to UPS or any of its
Affiliates; 
---|---|--- 
 



Page 13  _EXECUTION COPY_



      | (h) | the conversion of TNT into a private company with limited
liability ( _besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid_ ); 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) | any transaction between TNT and UPS at terms that are not at
arms length; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (j) | any combination of the foregoing; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (k) | any transactions, restructurings, share issues, procedures
and/or proceedings in relation to TNT and/or one or more of its Affiliates
required to effect the aforementioned objectives. 
---|---|--- 

6.4 In the implementation of any Post-Closing Measure, due consideration will
be given to the interests of minority shareholders of TNT, if any. The
members of the Supervisory Board shall be requested to form their independent
view of the relevant matter, which shall be communicated to all shareholders
of TNT. In this respect, the Supervisory Board members shall have the
opportunity to engage, for the account of TNT, their own financial and legal
advisors, if and to the extent they believe that the advice of such advisors
is necessary to assist them in reviewing and assessing any matter that comes
before the Supervisory Board.

6.5 If any proposed Post-Closing Measure could reasonably be expected to lead
to dilution of remaining minority shareholders in TNT, other than pursuant to
a compulsory acquisition procedure ( _uitkoopprocedure_ ) in accordance with
article 2:92a or 2:201a of the DCC or the takeover buy-out procedure in
accordance with article 2:359c of the DCC, or could otherwise prejudice or
negatively affect the value of the Shares held by minority shareholders, then
the affirmative vote of at least one Independent Member shall be required
prior to the implementation of any such Post-Closing Measure.

6.6 Subject to the Offer being declared unconditional, and for so long as the
number of Shares which are held by UPS and its Affiliates represents less
than 95% (ninety-five per cent) of the Shares on a fully diluted basis, UPS
commits to use its commercially reasonable efforts to place and maintain a
standard order on Euronext Amsterdam to purchase the remaining Shares held by
minority shareholders against the Offer Price for a period of at least two (2)
weeks following the expiry of the Post Closing Acceptance Period.

Composition of the Boards

thereof individually, will use their respective best efforts, including

Supervisory Board, their (vote in favour of any) resignation from the

confirm that he or she has no claim whatsoever against TNT in respect of loss
of office or otherwise, other than his or her
contractual redundancy/termination entitlement in the amount as disclosed in
the TNT 2011 annual report. UPS shall allow TNT to pay such compensation to
the respective members of the Executive Board. UPS will procure that each
resigning member of the Executive Board will be fully released from his or

customary full and final discharge, provided that by the time of such
resignation, no wilful misconduct, fraud or other criminal behaviour of such

Incentive Plans 

11.4 At the date of this Merger Protocol, TNT has granted (i) 81,204 (cash-
settled) one-off matching rights to directors, including Executive Board, and
(senior) employees of the Group pursuant to the TNT Express One-off
Investment/Matching Plan as adopted by the supervisory board of TNT N.V. on 7
April 2011 (the _OMPlan_ ) (the _One-off Matching Rights_ ) and (ii) 82,018
(cash-settled) matching rights, excluding Executive Board, to directors and
(senior) employees of the Group pursuant to the TNT Express Bonus/Matching
Plan as adopted by the supervisory board of TNT N.V. on 7 April 2011 (the

Page 19  _EXECUTION COPY_



 

11.6 The Supervisory Board shall, in accordance with Rule 10.1 of Part C of
the Incentive Plans, allow all Employee Matching Rights outstanding under the
Incentive Plans immediately prior to the Settlement Date to vest (as defined
in the Incentive Plans) on the Settlement Date, subject to the relevant
directors and (senior) employees tendering their Shares under the Offer. Such
Employee Matching Rights shall be settled by payment of the cash equivalent of
the Shares comprising the Employee Matching Rights based on the middle market
quotation of a Share as derived from the Official Price List of Euronext
Amsterdam. The number of Shares comprising the Employee Matching Rights is
based on the Shares which are owned by the directors and (senior) employees
pursuant to the Incentive Plans immediately prior to the Settlement Date.
Rules 5.1.1 and 5.1.2 of Part C of the Incentive Plans shall only apply until
Settlement.

11.7 For the avoidance of doubt and without prejudice to the foregoing, UPS
shall pay the Offer Price for each Share that has been (i) granted to, or
acquired by, directors and (senior) employees under the Incentive Plans and
(ii) validly tendered under the Offer. TNT shall use its best efforts
to ensure that, subject to the Offer being declared unconditional ( _gestand
gedaan_ ), the directors and (senior) employees participating in the Incentive
Plans shall tender their Shares obtained pursuant to the Incentive Plans under
the Offer. 

TNT Airline

11.8 The Parties shall endeavour to ensure that TNTs airline operations will
be able to continue to operate despite the change in ownership and control
over TNT to UPS. To that end, TNT will during the Interim Period, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, procure that it and its Affiliates and
their respective directors, employees and advisors will provide UPS with all
information and cooperation reasonably required by UPS in order to have in
place as per the Settlement Date, a legal, organisational and management
structure with respect to TNTs airline operations that complies with all
applicable laws, regulations, decrees, rules, arrangements and requirements,
taking into account the acquisition of majority control over TNT by UPS. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that such cooperation by TNT and its Affiliates
may include, without limitation, corporate restructurings, transfer of assets
and operations and filings and/or applications with regulators, provided
that none of these shall have an irreversible detrimental effect on TNT, its
Affiliates and their respective businesses. UPS hereby agrees to reimburse TNT
for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and costs incurred by TNT and its
Affiliates pursuant to this clause 11.8.

Transaction Planning

11.9 Subject to any limitation pursuant to applicable Antitrust Laws, TNT
will, upon reasonable written notice and during normal business hours,
provide, and will procure that its Affiliates will provide, UPS and its
advisors reasonable access to their directors, senior employees, premises,
documents and advisors, and provide as soon as reasonably practicable UPS and
its advisors with regular updates on financial results and operational
developments material to TNT and the TNT Group and all such information and
documentation as may reasonably be requested by UPS in connection with the
Offer and the Merger. In particular, and subject to any limitation pursuant to
applicable Antitrust Laws, TNT shall give UPS and its advisors access to such
information and shall give such management and expert presentations as may
reasonably be required by UPS (i) to determine the optimal acquisition and
financing structure of the Merger, (ii) to complete any necessary filings and
notifications, (iii) to determine the optimal legal, organisational and
management structure with respect to TNTs airline operations following the
Settlement Date, (iv) to allow its financing banks to obtain the necessary
comfort and prepare the necessary financing and security documentation in

otherwise to progress the Merger.

vis-a-vis PostNL N.V. under clause 6.2 of the Relationship Agreement to the

to perform its obligations thereunder without breaching its obligations under

   12. | INTERIM PERIOD 
---|--- 

Conduct of TNT during Interim Period

12.1 Subject to applicable Antitrust Laws, as from the date of this Merger
Protocol until the earlier of (i) the Settlement Date or (ii) the date on

or managerial employee); and 
---|--- 



     | (d) | not, directly or indirectly, take any action which may
reasonably be expected to impair its ability to perform its obligations under
this Merger Protocol or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. 
---|---|--- 



   13. | EXCLUSIVITY 
---|--- 

13.1 For the purposes of this Merger Protocol, the _Exclusivity Period_ shall
mean the period commencing on the date of this Merger Protocol and ending on
the date of termination of this Merger Protocol, unless the Offer has been
made, in which case the Exclusivity Period shall end on the earlier of the
Settlement Date and the date of termination of this Merger Protocol.

13.2 During the Exclusivity Period:



     | (a) | TNT shall, and shall ensure that its Affiliates and their
respective directors, officers, employees, advisors, agents and
representatives, including without limitation, the members of the Boards,
shall, proceed with the preparations of the Offer (including, without
limitation by reviewing or drafting the relevant sections of the Offer
Memorandum, by providing UPS with all information reasonably necessary for
the preparation of the Offer Memorandum and by taking all such other steps as
are reasonably necessary in connection with the Offer) in good faith and as
expediently as practicable; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | except as permitted pursuant to clause 13.4 and clause 14.2,
TNT shall not, and shall ensure that none of its Affiliates, nor any of their
respective directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives,
including without limitation, the members of the Boards, shall, directly or
indirectly, approach, initiate, enter into or continue discussions or
negotiations with any third party with respect to a potential offer or
proposal for a potential offer for all or part of the Shares or for the whole
or part of the businesses or assets of the TNT Group or any proposal involving
the potential acquisition of a substantial interest in the TNT Group, a legal
merger or demerger involving TNT or a reorganisation or re-capitalisation of
TNT and/or the TNT Group (each an _Alternative Proposal_ ); and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | TNT will notify UPS promptly (and in any event within 24
(twenty-four) hours) if any communication, invitation, approach or enquiry, or
any request for information, is received by TNT, any of its Affiliates or any
of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives,
from any third party in relation to an Alternative Proposal, it being
understood that, as a minimum, TNT shall notify UPS of the identity of such
third party, the proposed consideration and other key terms of such
Alternative Proposal (including, without limitation the financing terms and
structure and the anti-trust and other regulatory requirements that need to
be complied with), so as to enable UPS to consider its position in light of
such Alternative Proposal and to assess the (possible) effects of such
Alternative Proposal on the Offer and the Offers chances of success, and TNT
shall keep UPS immediately informed in writing of any further material
developments in relation to such Alternative Proposal. 
---|---|--- 

13.3 By their acceptance of the terms of this Merger Protocol, TNT and the
members of the Boards confirm that at the date of signing of this Merger
Protocol they are not in discussions and/or negotiations with any third party
about any Alternative Proposal. 

 



Page 22  _EXECUTION COPY_



 

13.4 Notwithstanding clauses 13.2(b), 13.2(c) and 17, TNT is permitted to
engage in discussions or negotiations with, and provide information to, a
third party that makes an unsolicited serious approach to TNT with the
intention of making a Competing Offer (as defined below), provided that TNT
shall promptly notify UPS thereof (and in any event within 48 (forty-eight)
hours of receipt of the Alternative Proposal) and shall keep UPS immediately
informed of any material developments in relation to such Alternative
Proposal, including, but not limited to the fact whether it considers
the Alternative Proposal to be a Potential Competing Offer.



   14. | COMPETING OFFER 
---|--- 

14.1 A _Potential Competing Offer_ is a written proposal to make a (public)
offer for all Shares or all or substantially all of the assets of the TNT
Group or a merger of TNT, made by a party who, in the reasonable opinion of
TNT (including the Supervisory Board), is a _bona fide_ third party and which
proposal in the reasonable opinion of TNT (including the Supervisory Board),
having consulted its financial and legal advisors and considering, among
others, level and character of consideration, certainty of financing,
conditionality, integrity of the business and position of employees, could
reasonably be expected to become a Competing Offer.

 

14.2 In the event a Potential Competing Offer is made:



     | (a) | TNT shall be permitted to allow the third party making the
offer to conduct the same or substantially the same due diligence
investigation as UPS was permitted to conduct in the context of the
preparation of the Offer; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | TNT shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify
UPS in writing and provide full details, to the extent available to it, of
such Potential Competing Offer. Furthermore, TNT shall keep UPS informed of
any material developments in relation to such Potential Competing Offer. 
---|---|--- 

14.3 A Potential Competing Offer will be a _Competing Offer_ if:



     | (a) | it is launched, or is binding on the offering party
concerned in the sense that such offering party has (i) conditionally
committed itself to TNT to launch a Competing Offer within eight (8) weeks
and (ii) has publicly announced its intention to launch a Competing Offer,
which announcement includes the proposed price per Share and the relevant
conditions precedent in relation to such offer and the commencement thereof; 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | the consideration offered per Share exceeds the
consideration per Share offered under the Offer by at least 8% (eight
percent). To the extent that the Potential Competing Offer is an offer for
all or substantially all of the assets of the TNT Group, the calculation shall
be made on the basis of the net proceeds to be distributed to the shareholders
of TNT resulting from such a transaction (to be valued as at the first
trading day on Euronext Amsterdam following the execution of this Merger
Protocol) calculated on a per Share basis; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | it is determined by the Boards, having consulted financial
and legal advisors and acting in good faith and observing their obligations
under Dutch law, to be substantially more beneficial to TNT and its
stakeholders than the Offer as contemplated in this Merger Protocol,
specifically taking into account the identity and track record of such third
party, the consideration to be received by shareholders, the likelihood of
completion, the other terms and conditions of the Potential Competing Offer
and the interests of all stakeholders of TNT. 
---|---|--- 
 



Page 23  _EXECUTION COPY_



 

14.4 If UPS has matched any Competing Offer in accordance with clause 14.5,
the consideration per Share of any other, consecutive or amended offer made
by any _bona fide_ third party for all of the outstanding Shares or all or
substantially all of the assets of the TNT Group or a merger of TNT (a
_Subsequent Higher Offer_ ) must exceed the most recently offered
consideration per Share by UPS after having exercised its Matching Right by at
least 8% (eight percent), in order for any such Subsequent Higher Offer to
qualify as a Competing Offer for the purpose of this Merger Protocol. 

14.5 In the event of a Competing Offer, the following shall apply:

 



     | (a) | TNT shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify
UPS in writing and provide full details, to the extent available to it, of
such Competing Offer. Furthermore, TNT shall keep UPS informed of any
material developments in relation to such Competing Offer; 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | UPS shall have a period of ten (10) Business Days following
announcement of the Competing Offer to decide whether or not it wants to
revise its Offer and match the Competing Offer (the _Matching Right_ ); 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | if UPS exercises its Matching Right and its revised Offer is
determined by the Boards, having consulted their financial and legal advisors
and acting in good faith and observing their obligations under Dutch law, to
be at least equally beneficial to TNT and its stakeholders as the Competing
Offer within the aforementioned period of ten (10) Business Days (a _Matching
Revised Offer_ ), TNT shall not be entitled to accept the third party offer
and/or to terminate this Merger Protocol, except if permitted by this clause
14 in respect of any consecutive Competing Offer; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) | if UPS has failed to timely inform TNT in accordance with
clause 14.5(b), or if UPS has not made a Matching Revised Offer or if UPS has
informed TNT that it does not wish to exercise its Matching Right, TNT shall
be entitled to accept the Competing Offer and the Boards shall have the right,
but shall not be obliged, to withdraw or, as applicable, modify the
Recommendation and the Position Statement. If TNT accepts the Competing Offer
and this is communicated to UPS within five (5) Business Days from the last
day of the aforementioned period of ten (10) Business Days, each Party shall
be entitled, but shall not be obliged, to terminate this Merger Protocol in
accordance with clause 15. If in such scenario neither Party exercises its
right to terminate this Merger Protocol, this Merger Protocol shall remain in
full force and effect, save for the provisions of clause 4.3(f), and
clauses 13.1 and 13.2, which shall then no longer apply in relation to the
Competing Offer and the third party having made such Competing Offer. 
---|---|--- 

14.6 This clause (including but not limited to the Matching Right) applies
_mutatis mutandis_ to any Subsequent Higher Offer constituting a Competing
Offer.

 



   15. | TERMINATION 
---|--- 

15.1 Subject to clause 15.2, this Merger Protocol and the rights and
obligations thereunder may be terminated:



     | (a) | if UPS and TNT so agree in writing; 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

by notice in writing given by either of the Parties (the _Terminating Party_ )
to the other Party if (i) any of the Commencement Conditions has not been
satisfied or 

---|---|--- 
 



Page 24  _EXECUTION COPY_



      |  waived by the relevant Party in accordance with this Merger
Protocol by the Ultimate Launch Date, and (ii) the non-satisfaction of the
relevant Commencement Condition(s) is not due to a breach by the Terminating
Party of any of its obligations under this Merger Protocol or any agreement
resulting from it; 
---|--- 



     | (c) | by notice in writing given by the Terminating Party to the
other Party if (i) any of the Offer Conditions has not been satisfied or
waived by the relevant Party in accordance with this Merger Protocol by the
Long Stop Date, and (ii) the non-satisfaction of the relevant Offer
Condition(s) is not due to a breach by the Terminating Party of any of its
obligations under this Merger Protocol or any agreement resulting from it; 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | by notice in writing given by the Terminating Party to the
other Party in case of the other Party having breached the terms of this
Merger Protocol to the extent that any such breach: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | has or could reasonably be expected to have material adverse
consequences for TNT or the Offer; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | is incapable of being remedied within ten (10) Business
Days after receipt by the other Party of a written notice from the Terminating
Party or has not been remedied by the other Party within ten (10) Business
Days after receipt by the other Party of a written notice from the Terminating
Party; 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | by notice in writing by TNT if (i) all Commencement
Conditions have been satisfied or waived and UPS has failed to commence the
Offer on the Commencement Date, or (ii) the Offer has been commenced and all
Offer Conditions have been satisfied or waived and settlement has not taken
place on the Settlement Date; or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (f) | by notice in writing by either TNT or UPS to the other Party
pursuant and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in clause 14. 
---|---|--- 
 

15.2 Any termination in accordance with this Merger Protocol shall not take
effect until the expiry of ten (10) Business Days following receipt of the
written termination notice by the non-terminating Party. The Parties
acknowledge that during the period referred to in the previous sentence, they
shall be entitled to seek remedies in accordance with clause 27, including but
not limited to seeking provisional measures in summary proceedings ( _kort
geding_ ) to prevent such termination from taking effect.

15.3 If this Merger Protocol is terminated by TNT pursuant to clause 15.1(c)
(but only if the Offer Condition under clause 4.3(b) (competition clearance)
is not satisfied or waived in accordance with this Merger Protocol) or clause
15.1(d), UPS shall withdraw the Offer and shall not, directly or indirectly,
either alone or together with another person, for a period of nine (9) months
after termination of this Merger Protocol:



     | (a) | acquire or enter into an agreement or arrangement (whether
legally binding or not) or do or omit to do any act as a result of which it
may acquire any Shares; or  
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | make or announce a public offer for any Shares. 
---|---|--- 
 

15.4 In the event that this Merger Protocol is terminated pursuant to this
clause 15, none of the Parties shall have any claim hereunder of any
nature whatsoever against the other Party, save (i) in

 



Page 25  _EXECUTION COPY_



 

 respect of accrued rights and/or liabilities arising from the prior breach
of this Merger Protocol and, where applicable (ii) for any claim pursuant to
clause 16. Clauses 15 up to and including clause 26.3 shall survive
termination of this Merger Protocol.



   16. | TERMINATION FEE 
---|--- 

16.1 To induce UPS to enter into this Merger Protocol and to compensate UPS
for loss of management time and other costs and expenses it has already
incurred and will continue to incur in connection with the (preparation of
the) Offer, TNT shall pay to UPS an amount of EUR 50 million in cash,
immediately upon first written request thereto from UPS, if this Merger
Protocol is terminated:

 



     | (a) | by UPS pursuant to clause 15.1(d); or 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | pursuant to clause 15.1(f). 
---|---|--- 

16.2 To induce TNT to enter into this Merger Protocol and to compensate TNT
for loss of management time and other costs and expenses it has already
incurred and will continue to incur in connection with the (preparation of
the) Offer, the loss of franchise, (in)direct loss and damages to TNTs
business due to the announcement of the (potential) Offer and its effects on,
among other things, employees, customers and suppliers, UPS shall pay to TNT
an amount of EUR 200 million in cash, immediately upon first written request
thereto from TNT, if this Merger Protocol is terminated by TNT pursuant to:



     | (a) | clause 15.1(c) on the basis of EU Competition Clearance or
one or more of the Other Key Competition Clearances not having been obtained; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | clause 15.1(d); or 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | clause 15.1(e). 
---|---|--- 

16.3 Parties acknowledge and agree that the obligations set forth in clauses
16.1 and 16.2 shall constitute a " _boetebeding_ " as referred to in article
6:91 DCC. Parties furthermore agree that any forfeiture by TNT or UPS, as the
case may be, of the UPS or TNT compensation payment set out in clauses 16.1
and 16.2, respectively, pursuant to article 6:95 DCC et seq., be deemed to be
in lieu of, and not in addition to, any liability ( _schadevergoedingsplicht_
) of TNT towards UPS or vice versa related to the events set forth in clauses
16.1 and 16.2 so that the provisions of this clause 16.3 shall be deemed to be
a " _schadevergoedingsbeding_ " and not a " _strafbeding_ ". The provisions of
article 6:92, paragraphs 1 and 3 DCC shall, to the maximum extent possible,
not apply. Each Party hereby waives any (potential) right it might have to
request mitigation of such liability in any manner (in legal proceedings or
otherwise).

---|--- 
 

17.1 The substance of this Merger Protocol (including a summary of clauses 6,
7, 8 and 9) will be disclosed in the joint press release attached hereto
as Schedule 2, in the Offer Memorandum, the Position Statement and

required by the Merger Rules, or as otherwise required by the AFM or Euronext
Amsterdam are timely and properly made.

17.3 Notwithstanding clause 17.1, no Party shall, without the written approval
of the other Party, disclose or provide this Merger Protocol to anyone, except
to the extent that it is obliged to

or other governmental authority. Where possible, the disclosing Party shall,
prior to disclosure, consult the other Party about the form and contents of
such disclosure.

17.4 UPS and TNT agree to consult with each other with respect to any and all
further press releases and meetings with journalists in connection with the
Offer, if and to the extent reasonably possible.

17.5 The Confidentiality Agreement agreed between the Parties will remain in
full force and effect.



   18. | ASSIGNMENT

18.2 UPS is entitled to assign any and all of its rights and obligations under
this Merger Protocol to any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. In the event of

apply _mutatis mutandis_ to the designated assignee. UPS shall remain jointly
and severally liable with the designated assignee for the proper performance
of any obligations assigned to the designated assignee under this clause

available to them, in whatever capacity, including the giving of all waivers
and consents and the passing of all resolutions reasonably required to ensure
that the Parties and their representatives (if any) give effect to the
provisions of this clause.



   19. | COSTS 
---|--- 

Except where this Merger Protocol provides otherwise, each Party shall pay
its own costs relating to the negotiation, preparation, execution and
performance of this Merger Protocol and any documents executed pursuant
thereto.

 



   20. | NO WAIVER 
---|--- 
 

The rights of any Party shall not be prejudiced or restricted by any
indulgence or forbearance extended to any other Party and no waiver by any
Party in respect of any breach shall operate as a waiver in respect of any
subsequent breach.



   21. | NO RESCISSION 
---|--- 

To the extent permitted by law, the Parties waive their rights, if any, to (i)
in whole or in part annul, rescind or dissolve (including any _gehele dan wel
parti ele ontbinding en vernietiging_) this Agreement, and (ii) invoke

delivered, as required by law, by TNT, and assuming due authorisation,
execution and delivery of this Merger Protocol by UPS, constitutes a legal and
